I mean, they are baseball players first and then singers second (I assume). But they all did a fine job and I think my favorite would be Coco Crisp - he really gets down! The CD represents a wide range of styles, too - country, rap, hip hop, blues, rock, and will delight any musical baseball fan. I'd say this selection defintely hits a home run with this listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully, their breakthrough!","review":"For those who have heard their first album, _Chronicles_, they're in for a surprise, particularly in lyrical content and in production. Bob Mould's production was heavier, with more emphasis on guitars. Brad Wood lets the music breathe, with plenty of room for the bass and cello lines to come through. The songs themselves are more personal in nature, akin to Jason & Alison's _Woodshed_, but show a different perspective on the subjects of release and moving on.If you don't have _Chronicles_ already, pick both it and _White Out_ up -- you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verbow - Pop-ish music that actually has talent!!","review":"Verbow has to be the best new group on the scene.

The book grabs your attention from the first page and leaves you wanting more. Interesting characters and surprising plot twists make The Scent of Magic a thouroughly enjoyable ride. Seaborg created a land where magic is part and parcel of everyday life, from the highest levels of government to street magicians that really use magic. This is part one and I can hardly wait for the sequel later this year. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy novels. Anyone new to the genre could do no better than to start with The Scent of Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good deal to revive my camera","review":"I read the reviews here and they encouraged me to buy the batteries.

On many songs, Adkins relies on gimmicks, such as Up on Mars. Every punk rock band that I've ever listened to sounds better. Hints of excellent guitar playing are heard once in a while, but nothing is developed. His voice, with so many years to develop and practice, is usually outside any good range, so most songs sound like an old country singer who just never had what is takes to really sound good. Clearly, the man enjoyed being on the stage and having fun. You might like it with a six-pack under your belt, but otherwise, you won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it here?","review":"The ambiguous ending to The Giver comes after its message was so eloquently delivered to each reader on a personal level. That is why it needed not ending. Each reader ended the book his or her own imagination in such a way that their own individual message would end. The Messenger takes away all power and lesson from the Giver. It is a cheap story that involves no higher thought processes to understand - there is not nothing to understand. Such a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid if you are over the age of 10","review":"This was an insipid rehashing of the mythical story of Jesus Christ. Matty, who was my favorite character from Gathering Blue (a vastly superior book)is taking the Jesus Christ pose as he makes the ultimate sacrifice by saving humankind and the world itself in one fell swoop by dying. Allusions to Christ abound throughout the book until the whole process becomes trite and silly. As we are all familiar with this storyline it was a tedious read with an ending I fully expected. Try \\"The Giver\\" if you are interested in Lowry's work, as it's a far more thoughtfully developed and mature work not stunted by Lowry's unfortunate need to proselytize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"When I read gathering blue I didn't really think it was all that great but I really liked this one!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very bittersweet.","review":"As always, Lowry has managed to weave a word of good and a world of evil. This book is chilling and offers a dark analogy to the greed that can ensnare a community. Lovely read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect martyr disservice to #1 and #2","review":"(...)The Giver and Gathering Blue are two books that have a profound effect because they explore the mixture of good and evil above and below the surface in varying versions of possible post-apocalyptic societies. Messenger is not a fitting end to the other two. It seems an insult to the complexity of mankind, and the good and evil of the societies she has constructed to have an end solution lie with an all-good, all-giving martyr character. The message then is that we have no control over navigating the complexities of our societies except to wait for another savior, which cheapens both The Giver and Gathering Blue and the choices each character made to defy their societies."},{"rating":"2","title":"You fill in the blanks","review":"I did not like this book as much as the first two in the series. However, art is not always supposed to cheer us up. I think that Lowry is the kind of author who really wants the reader to become the storyteller and fill in the blanks. There is no neat package at the end, even in the book which is the third of the trilogy. Matty's true name communicates what I believe to be Lowry's central message. I don't want to spoil the end, so I won't reveal his true name, but the following quote is similarly revealing, and my favorite of the book. \\"So you could meet in the middle with your gifts? It wouldn't be so hard if you only went half way. If you met.\\" Despite the abrupt ending, Messenger is a must read for those who have read The Giver and Gathering Blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaia's commentary on \\"The Messenger\\"","review":"It was really unique and a captivating read, but probably read \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Gathering Blue\\" first, because you'll understand the characters more. It was sad at the end but it was an awesome book! (of course, I like almost every book I read, so who am I to judge?) :) I definitely recommend this book and the other three books in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick, Provocative Read","review":"Messenger is the 3rd book in Lois Lowry's alternative worlds series which began with The Giver. Messenger isn't nearly as groundbreaking as the first or last in the series, but it would be an excellent read for any youngster in chapter books (or adults as well). It's a very quick read, and it is extremely provocative, like The Giver, on the subjects of freedom and will, what is right versus what is desired. It isn't a terribly exciting story, and it ends rather abruptly with almost no denoument. It is well worth reading, though, if only to know what's going on in the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Messenger","review":"I loved it.The book was a great attachment to the Giver series. I enjoy every second of it.I recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it or risk missing a life time adventure","review":"The title of the book I read is Messenger by Lois Lowry. I found this book very interesting. Lois Lowry made the setting much different from our world today. Their world was great, everyone was friends with each other and no one ever lied, but there was this forest that was very dangerous and hurt people. The books' setting is described so well you feel like you're there in the book. The main characters are Matty and Kira. Matty is a young teenage boy who escaped an awful village and now lives with a man named Seer. Kira is a young woman who has a disability and lives in a horrible village. This setting is in the past when the people are just learning about running water. This book is a wonderful story full of adventure. I strongly recommend that you should read this book because it keeps you interested and teaches you many life lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"So, this book wasn't as good as The Giver. And it does help to read The Giver and Gathering Blue before this one, since they are companion books. But it's not necessary.The word to describe this book for me is \\"interesting.\\" It was a quick read. It was clean. It teaches a good moral. And it leaves enough unsaid that it makes you have to think for yourself and try to figure out what's going on. I got a little caught up in trying to remember Gathering Blue, so I could piece together some details. Overall, I liked it. But it was a little weird.And now it's made me want to read The Giver again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm halfway done and planning to finish","review":"This is a far more satisfying read to me--even as an adult reader--than the disappointing, \\"Gathering Blue\\". The storyline of \\"The Messenger\\" seems to comment on contemporary social issues of discrimination."},{"rating":"1","title":"She must have needed money, quickly.","review":"In one book, Lowry ruined and retold The Giver. I have taught The Giver to my 7th graders for 10 years, but no more. We were left with hope that Jonas ended up in heaven or a real world he would cherish. We knew he would enjoy love and colors, etc. But we now find out in The Messenger that Jonas' world is bleak and he has become the somber pensive Leader of this society. His words are mirror images of The Giver's. In fact this book is a retelling of The Giver with different characters and abilities. It is cheap and it destroyed the love I and my students had for The Giver. Don't read this. Lois, shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messenger","review":"This book wasn't worth the paper and ink that it took for Lois Lowry to write it.

It left alot more questions than answers, and in the end it's just one big question mark. It's great if you like making up your own ending to stories, but it's just horrid if you don't.It gives closure to Jonas from The Giver, but other than that, it's a sh*tty book. My one question is...what the hell happened to Gabe? Jonas's brother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"striking look...boring inside","review":"the book looks like it will be good after u have read te giver but it is quite boring actually"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a must NOT read!","review":"I DID NOT LIKE this book.

But, it was ok... in that it was better then the other book we had to read and the book we had to read last year. Definetely.

Are these villages possible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"In this book, more questions are raised than answered and since it is the last of the trilogy, this is not good. As mentioned by previous reviewers, the characters are cardboard flat. Some of the questions I had included main plot points. Why is an electronic machine bad? What happened in Kira's village to bring about literacy amongst the youngsters? If material things are so bad, why does wanting them produce such a drastic personality change in the receiver? What should the correct alternative be? Of course, a book should produce questions, but these seemed to develop out of laziness, not a desire to seriously engage and intrigue the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"Lois Lowry has written yet another great novel. Characters from THE GIVER and GATHERING BLUE meet each other adding a good ending to the drop off endings of the two books. A brilliant, brilliant novel that I would recomend to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat of a letdown...","review":"In this book, a companion novel to The Giver and Gathering Blue, Matty is a messenger, one of the few with the power to travel through the forest. When his community, so well-known for their acceptance of strangers, decides to close its gates, Matty and his mentor know that something very wrong is happening- and Matty, with his still undeveloped power, may be the only one who can stop it.I am a great fan of the Giver, and enjoyed Gathering Blue a lot, so I was very excited when this book came out, and read it in a single day. However, I was extremely disappointed. It felt like the author had written it simply because she promised a third book, not because she had a really cool idea. The characters seemed shallow and undeveloped, and the description of the village didn't fit in with the one given in Gathering Blue. You never find out the actual problem of the village, and the ending leaves way too many holes- and not ones that are designed to make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed-Sequel Is In Fact On Its Way!","review":"So I finished Messenger, and I was a bit disappointed - it left me wanting more! I thought, There has GOT to be a 4th book; I don't care if it's a trilogy, there just has to be more than 3 books! I got online and started searching, and Lowry is in fact coming out with a fourth book on October 2nd, I believe. It's called Son. I'm very excited for that book because, although this was a great read - short, easy yet entertaining, and thought provoking - it ended a bit abruptly. I would definitely recommend reading this one, as it ties together the first two books in the series - Giver and Gathering Blue, which actually seemed unrelated until reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Exciting Book I Read","review":"The book I read was Messenger. The author of this book is Lois Lowry. This book is about a young boy named Matty taking mail to people from forest. This story takes place in the past. Matty called himself a name. I am not going to tell you that name because I will ruin the story for you. The plot of this story is that this boy wandered into a forest and found something he did not know existed. The author did a good job showing how Matty helps people through forest. For example Matty helped seer's daughter go through forest.I would recommend this to many middle schools. This book is a great book for a class to read. Over the last paragraph I told you some reasons I liked this book. Maybe if you read this book you will feel the same as me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trilogy","review":"I am an adult who read these three books at the suggestion of a friend who teaches sixth grade reading. At the end of each book I was left with more questions than answers. It was a very thought provoking series. The imagery and the symbolism was wonderful. In the final installment, The Messanger, the parallels to the tennants of the Christian faith are remarkable. I would recommend that parents read this and share in the discussion with their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matty the Messanger- Giver #3","review":"The 3rd book of the Giver, but I am thinking they're all companion books and stand alone books, even though they're linked.I'm thrilled Matt is the main character in this book, he did become a favorite of mine in the last one. And I already got a glimpse of Jonas and Gabe! YAY!Finished! You definetly have to read this book if you've read the others to find out what happens to the characters. This was a good but also sad, nearing the end.I really enjoy Lois Lowrys writing and can't wait to get my hands on her other books, I'm sure they will all be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great science fiction","review":"There's a lot of fantasy available for kids, but less true science fiction. This book qualifies as good science fiction. I read The Messenger because I enjoyed The Giver so much and had to see where Lowry took the story after a very ambiguous ending (to The Giver). This is advanced reading, best suited for those willing to ask the hidden questions: what is the relationship between the people in the village? What influences are at work? Why is the forest changing? Deep and foreboding, this is not a light read, but for an interpretive mind it is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read - but unsatisfying in the end!","review":"I have read, in quick succession, all three books in this series; The Giver, Gathering Blue, and The Messenger.I read them all in hopes of coming to a satisfying conclusion to the story - but in this I felt cheated! The books are wonderful, don't get me wrong. Exciting, fast paced, terrific stories and characters. But on the last page (I have the kindle edition) I found myself repeatedly trying to page forward, as in each book it felt as if it hadn't ended. Not simply because I wanted more - but because in each case, it felt unfinished....One more page, one more paragraph - anything except stranding me in the middle of a story. I thought this was simply to make me continue to read the sequel, but even the concluding book left me in a lurch. I do not think I will be reading Lowry again any time soon. Her lack of endings is just too frustrating for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!!","review":"THis was the first of Lowry's books I had read.

Then Dad tried to help, but the \\"blocks\\" are not rigid enough to hold their shape if they are bumped or touched, so the construction collapses.

It's not just because the authors kept referring back to them, but because they were referring back to such insignificant people and events. Obviously, there are many strong characters that have such small parts that it takes away a bit from the focus of the story.Despite this, this book is still quite enjoyable. If you can hang through the beginning, the action starts rollercoasting from then on. Lots of action and suspense. Tony and Sue are having a bit of marriable problems that they have to work out. Tony gets to meet Lucus. Bobby finds an interesting female. Then there is the creature killing Sazi that Tony agrees to find and kill. Then there's a small reappearence of the teenage mass murderer, Scotty. Sooooo many characters, so little time.

Comparingthat to the available literature, I found it extremelyeducational and well organized. It is a great bookthat takes you slowly through different skills ofsight singing, with plenty of exercises for each one.The exercises are sorted from easy to more complexones. The book is fit for people both singing inchorus or solo. The rest of the book are exercisesthat are more like music pieces (rather thanexercises) and come with piano accompaniment and onechapter is dedicated to duos.However to me it seems that this edition is a littlemore simplified and less serious than the previousones. Also I think for the price you pay, you deservea more decent cover than plastic comb (the earliereditions are hardcover)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good textbook, horrible binding","review":"It is what it is. If your music program uses this book, then it serves it's function. It has plenty of sight singing examples for duets and solo.

After about a semester of use the binding starts coming lose and the pages and cover pieces start to come out. It's very frustrating. My schools music program uses this book.

Have to repaint ceiling now.","review":"My husband has used stovetop espresso pots for years and I ordered this one when I couldn't find his usual GB one. It blew up on our stove pouring espresso everywhere and spattering it on our ceiling, appliances, counter tops, blinds. I'm still finding places. He tried this again just to see what was happening and put it on a low setting and it still blew up but it didn't go as far. I think this product should be recalled. Luckily my kids were not in the kitchen at the time or they may have been hurt. Metal seems cheaper than the last brand we used but I would still expect it to not blow up so maybe there is something faulty on it. I'm asking for a refund but with a 25% restocking fee, no box and no reimbursement on shipping I'm not holding my breath. Also I now have to repaint a popcorn ceiling and buy new chair covers (they used to be ivory) so I'm out that money as well as the 3 hours to clean my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually erroneous, left-wing propagandist book at best","review":"Dan Savage knows how to meme his opponents very well, but unfortunately for him and his \\"friends\\" they don't know how to use facts and reason very well. That is clear in this \\"book\\" which is really a hit piece on mainstream America. One thing is clear - Dan Savage, who advocates against bullying, is himself a bully vis a vis extreme leftist propaganda that is obvious to see through. Reading this book one gets the impression that any kind of relationship is good - man and boy, man and dog, man and man, and hey, if all else fails, good old fashioned man + woman. Dan is free to say what he wants in America, but he should realize he'd be put to death or have his hands cut off for spewing such opinions in other parts of the world. Perhaps he should write a book about the good virtues and values within America and give credit to the majority for forming the most perfect nation on Earth. Now that would be an interesting, and humbling book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"This book was incredibly awesome!

I thought it would be interesting, and maybe funny, but it was Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity upside down. Social commentary from jackasses on the far right OR far left is boring and predictable.

It obviously written with a specific adgenda and without any orginal thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless book","review":"This book is pointless.

It is. After all, he is first and foremost a humorist, and therefore his silly ideas shouldn't be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"all is well in gomorrah","review":"As usual this book conveys that all is well amongst the hedonists.I would'nt blame Jefferson with todays descent into the maelstrom.Though he was a deist, he did recognize a Creator and a moral system based on the teachings of Jesus--Even O Rielly accepts that which he calls Judeo Christian Philosophy--This book negates a moral sense. It says that man should make his own rules and call right what he thinks is right. Christians call this Original Sin.No wonder this thing was remaindered.Being cute and call it humor says something about this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping Towards Gomorrah","review":"I bought the book because it was the title my book group chose to read and discuss in September.This is not high-class literature but does include information that was new to me.The author has attempted to commit each of the so-called seven deadly sins in the location in the U.S. where he believes there are many others committing a specific sin; i.e. greed in Las Vegas. His observations about gambling seem to be well thought out and show his understanding of the process. Comments by the author about some of the other sins didn't demonstrate as much deep thought.The point author, Dan Savage, seems to be trying to make is that it's possible to commit one or more of the seven deadly sins and it won't kill you or send you to hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high expectations for Skipping Towards Gomorrah, based upon the reviews of other readers, and based upon other writings of Dan Savage. I expected the book to be very funny.I found it rarely and only mildly amusing, and I was shocked and very put off by Dan's unqualified enthusiasm for the occupation of Iraq. I learned that Dan and I don't share much common political ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I read this book nearly a year ago and I have been trying to find the words to review this book.After all of this time the best review I can give is:WHAT A WASTE! There is nothing good here."},{"rating":"2","title":"An \\"Instant Classic\\"!","review":"Libraries should be required to stock multiple copies of this book because their patrons will adore it. If you are one who laughs out loud at David Sedaris' hilarious books, or if you are one who has had enough of hypocritical Puritans dispensing useless advice (which even they do not follow in real life), this is the book for you.Dan Savage makes a remarkably convincing case for the value and NEED to simply enjoy ourselves. Behind the laugh-out-loud humor, Savage presents some very real truths which Americans desperately need to hear today. No one is spared or given the politically-correct treatment. Savage tells it like it is a-la-Dr. Phil in some of his better moments. Very refreshing, and morally sound. At last someone has some SANE ideas about why America is the way it is.Bravo to Mr. Savage! I believe any living soul with a brain will adore this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan the man does it again! Great job Dan!","review":"I didn't think Dan could surpass his wonderful book \\"The Kid\\" but this book does or is at least it's equal.Congratultions to Dan for writing such a hilarious book that also points out the many hypocrasies in modern american life.He deftly celebrates and satarizes his subjects from swingers, to big people and the gay pride attendees.What he expects to find at these events and what he finds are sometimes 2 different things. His journeys are very interesting and enlightening.It is amazing how the 'virtuecrats' as Dan calls them, have such a huge political and vocal influence in our country when most Americans don't agree with them on a fundamental level. (Or that most wouldn't if they really sat down and thought about it a moment)I look forward to Dan's next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Francesco Rinaldi Traditional Unsalted Pasta Sauce","review":"This is an excellent product that proves that you don't have to overload pasta sauce with salt to get great flavor.

As long as you follow the given rules of (1) Lightening your hair first & (2) Washing sparsely with cold water after dyeing.Devilish is a pink based red so when it starts to fade it will take on a pink hue, which is great for me because I didn't want to go the Bozo the clown route.PROS:Lots of compliments on this hair color, it is by far a beautiful red :)CONS:It will forever wash out, which will then stain the rest of your body. Get a shower cap.In order to style your hair after you've used the devil stain wear gloves. Every time.Think stained everything.

I leave it on my light/ medium auburn hair for an hour and get good results. It also fades nicely, which is important if you don't have time for constant touch ups. Over 3 weeks it has faded to a deep natural auburn with a little extra red kick in the light. Others pros are that Special Effects stains my skin less than Manic Panic, and seems to come out on my towels less. Make no mistake, it WILL come out on your towels, but it will decrease with time rather than constantly hemorrhaging color. The only reason SE doesn't get a 5 is because I'm holding out hope that someday, somewhere, I'll find bold hair color that won't stain my tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"devilish.","review":"i'm constantly dying my hair, so this color works for me because it helps condition it with all the processing my hair goes through.my only downside to this is how bright the red is. it has more of an orange tint and made me look like ronald mcdonald. but i put purple on it and it turned out nice.i used it again after i had dyed my hair brown. it made it a nice deep red color.i prefer punky color more, but i like it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family that prays together stays together","review":"I read this author's book Father Found and didn't really like it.

Dre knows how to bring different rappers together to produce a perfect blend of voices. The production on this album is good by the likes of DJ Premier and Daz Dillinger, but The Lady of Rage just doesn't have the talent to pull off a solo album with so few guest appearances. Only a few rappers are capable of that. The Notorious BIG...I can't think of another. Even Snoop Doggy Dogg has always relied heavily on having a large crew of rappers to back him up, and he was the front man of those two albums, not just a supporting rapper like rage was. I'm surprised Rage has made a second album. I won't be buying it. I bought this because I was in need of another Chronic/Doggystyle fix but this isn't it.

She can flow and freestyle as well or better than many more well know male and female artists. As mentioned in the other reviews, she was a victim of bad timing. Death Row was in its death throes and as a result this album wasn't marketed well at all. Also, the production was a little lacking a times.

She deserves much more credit and hopefully she comes out wit another cd as tight as this one in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Female Rapper by Far!","review":"I don't know why this album didn't sell alot of copies because this is a great album. Okay its no \\"Doggystyle\\" or \\"All eyez on Me\\" but it is one of the best Death Row albums. Maybe the death of Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight being imprisoned affected the sales of this album.

So unless it's necessary to avoid accidental tipover, I don't think I'll lock the cup in place. I want to be able to remove the cup easily and it's not a good idea to be pouring liquid with the stove attached to the cup.On opening unit, bottom of cup has halo.

It's very sturdy and bright with a focused beam. It also comes with a belt holster, batteries, and spare bulb. It fits my needs as a paramedic well and I could not be happier.I bought this for $40 from a SoCal sporting goods store and used it for over 2 years before TSA stole from my baggage at the airport. I never had to replace the bulb.To replace it, I bought a similar model from Blackhawk for $60 but could tell no improvement, plus it came with no holster or spare bulb. So I bought this again, this time @ amazon.com, for work and saved the other for dog walking.One reviewer here mentioned the different style batteries but they are 123 model 3V camera batteries, typically found at any drug or general store for $9-10/pr. The cheapest I found was online for $35 for a dozen.I would not be surprised to find them charging more for this product so get it cheap while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light for the money","review":"I purchased this light to put on my AR-15.

Kate Faber is the leader of the two and she is confident, but feels lonely when Marylin becomes a cheerleader and doesn't hang out with her anymore. Marylin goes to parties, finds new friends, and starts liking boys! Kate finds new friends and gets a boyfriend!

I am about to endure my journey to 6th grade and I have no clue what I would do if I had to be in either Marylin's shoes or Kates. Finally it shows how some hard time and new people on the block will make you fight for your rights to stay with with your friends or show you even more that you clearly have to just step away.

A Jew in Communist Prague is a fine example of what a graphic novel or any book should be modelled after. The story is a truly captivating tale, providing a down-to-level, human look into the life of Jonas Finkel and the brutish treatment of his family because they are Jewish. All of this is told wonderfully, as the writer displays his brilliance for storytelling, pacing, characterization, and dialogue. And complimenting this marvelous plot are the equally fantastic illustrations, which style manages to perfectly mesh with this story of social and political issues in Communist Czechoslovakia.

Lack of Originality. More hard rock them classic Rock? So what! this album rocks. The mix of the group members Daisley-Kerslake back end. Box's guitar with Sinclair on Heavy Keys.

MTV Played a cover song from this LP in medium rotation good for HEEP at the time. No Byron, or Wetton? Thats not great but Hell Sinclair and Goalby easily made up for that with their own talent.

It shows a horrible red demon (or whatever, with teeth showing in anger, for the sake of nothing, because, when you listen the music and the lyrics in the album, it's all only hard-rock, with candid lyrics about love, etc (see the 4 covers, for example). Bizarre choice of cover art by guitarrist Mick Box.

A new Heep came through in the early 80's with this album . They took a modern sound and combined it with the classic Heep sound ! Songs like \\"That's The Way That It Is \\" and \\" Chasing Shadows\\" propelled the new Heep back into radio and ( believe it or not ) MTV ! Buy it , enjoy it and crank it up !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful collection of stories with great illustrations..","review":"This book is perfect for any young person, or person young at heart, who loves dragons. It features many of the marvelous illustrations by that master of fantasy, Michael Hague, accompanying 17 classic tales of dragons and their prey.The tales range in place setting from China to England, Scandinavia to Narnia. The dragons themselves range from fearsome to foolish, rage-filled to reluctant, and everything in-between.

The rest of this album is just as great. Jokes about being fat, being hungry and eating as much as you can. Sounds one-sided, but it isn't. His vocal delivery is very energetic, which makes his jokes all the more funny.

It's really not that funny, it's pretty much a continuous sequence of one-liners and scenarios (where the punchline, of course, is about how fat he is). Maybe this is niche humour or something, that overweight people would find funny, but if you want comedy that's both funny and makes you think a little bit too, try Dennis Miller, Woody Allen, George Carlin, Steven Wright, Robert Klein or Eddie Izzard (there are many others that I cannot think of)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"It works as advertised.

Not miracles, but a good product capable of doing solid work.I first tried it on a delicate black scarf that I was going to throw away anyway as it had so much fuzz and lint. It worked pretty well on this product. It didn't make the scarf look new, but it did make it presentable. However, it also made plenty of holes in the scarf.I then tried it on a mock turtleneck that was starting to get pills. I hoped that being thicker, the mock T could withstand the shaver. However, the shaver started making holes in my shirt before I quit to salvage what I could of my mock T. Furthermore, it did not remove the pills very well.Maybe I am not using the product correctly.

I was stunned. If there was no track 3, the album would be almost as good! The album is moody and irregular, looking like a tape (these days a cd loaded with mp3) you would record to yourself. The jazz tunes, the Lou Reed song, Marilyn Mason's, even the usually sucky Smashing Pumpkins... every music in this album is, at very least, very good.

But, I'll tell you that the reason I bought this CD is because of the beautiful Song to the Siren remade by This Mortal Coil. I am flabergasted by the fact that Reznor left it out when he was putting these tracks together. Granted, I suppose it doesn't fit in as well but it is the only, neverwas, highlight of the film's songs.

The song that you are probably looking for is \\"Song to the Siren\\" which has been covered by everyone from Robert Plant to The Chemical Brothers--but I believe the artist featured in the film is This Mortal Coil--you can save yourself the money and disappointment of purchasing the entire album and just buy that track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promethazine Codeine Syrup ML -","review":"A very interesting, and soothing CD.Definitely worth having in your CD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A DVD","review":"I order this thinking that it was the movie (DVD) but when I received it and placed it in my DVD player only audio was playing.

The hat arrived promptly but when I opened the box, found that the hat looked nothing like the picture. It was really cheap looking (made from woven paper) and was a really ugly yellowish white color. Considering that I had just paid $30.00 for it, I didnt even bother to try it on. I boxed it up and shipped it back the next day swallowing the disatisfaction of knowing that shipping both ways was non-refundable and totaled close to $15.00. The one star is for the hat itself and over-pricing, but I should also say customer service tried very hard to make it right, they emailed me right away to see if they could send me another hat and when I returned the hat they credited my account right away. But I wouldnt order from them again based on quality and high price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for my big head and hair!","review":"I bought this hat a couple of days before going to the beach because I read the reviews on amazon, and most of them said how wonderfully surprised they were that the hat fit them because of their big head.

I have not been at all disappointed. The booklet contains informative notes , which is especially valuable considering the diverse origins of most of the melodies offered here; the sources of this music go far beyond the 'Celtic' harp of the title.

Paisley started to lose me with the childhood recording of the holiday tune he had written. Some people might find this cute, but really it is self-indulgent coming in the middle of a record. This isn't something most people will want to hear more than once. He lost me completely with the tirade about the right to be offensive. I suppose some one thought this was funny.

John DeLorean is cast as the ignored messiah, one who's reputation for rocking the boat is only countered by the results he achieved. Simple technical errors abound, leading one to wonder what other facts where not true.

We tried to wean him from it when he outgrew it, but he would flail his arms and wake himself up when we used the sleep sack. Our doctor said it was fine to continue swaddling him, so I invested in the bigger size, in this lighter fabric since it is getting warmer out. I love the flannel. It holds its shape, and it warm but not too warm. We only ended up using it for about 3 weeks before we found out by accident that he didn't need it anymore (it was in the washer, it was bedtime, so we tried the sleep sack again, which worked).

Then, let's turn a baby bunny loose in the woods so we can't find it. Uh-oh! I know, let's tie a string around the mother bunny's neck. Perhaps the threat of strangulation will force her to help us. Yea! She found her baby hiding under a tree (what a surprise), now let's pull it out BY THE TAIL.I won't deny that the illustrations are very cute. But what's the lesson here? Why can't Curious George send a positive message to kids?The Product Description mentions that this is \\"Inspired by a vignette in Curious George Flies a Kite.\\" That means the scenes in Curious George and the Bunny are from the larger book, and were simply incorporated into the newly published board book in 1998.

As a college business student and future entrepreneur I found this film to be both educational and uplifting. Many astute business men with incredible real life experience give amazing insight to the world few have experienced. The academic side of entrepreneurship is also expressed from credible business professors at Bryant University. If you are the least interested in entrepreneurship or general business I say this film is a must see. You will learn from some of the best on how to make your ideas become reality. I gave this documentary five stars and I suggest you watch it and see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"I purchased this film because I have always been interested in entrepreneurship.

After all it does look flat; and stock charts do just look like a bunch of squiggly lines.After reading this book you begin to understand the science that is at work in Elliott Wave Theory, and believe me, they are not just a bunch of squiggles. Mr. Prechter makes his case brilliantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Convinced","review":"Maybe I'm missing something but all I saw was cherry-picking examples to support a hypothesis that Fibonacci sequences and their .618 ratios are fundamentally related to human behaviors including the stock market. I understand there are thousands of guys analyzing previous trends claiming to have found the Holy Grail; statistically a portion will forecast correctly and therefore convince themselves the're on to something. As a neuroscientist interested in certain aspects of group dynamics, I found the psychology parts weak.

From the comments on the cover and the introduction, I was expecting at least in part a chronological history of the period. Although filled with facts, you never get a good sense of the big picture. For instance the first chapter is entitled \\"The Eighty Years War\\". But after reading it I hadn't learned what countries fought the war, where it was fought, or who won and who lost. I think the author presumed that this all was common knowledge and he didn't have to insult us with these basic facts. So if you want a general overview of this period of Dutch history go elsewhere. If you already have a grasp of the period, but just need more meat on the bones, this may be a suitable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author fails to deliver.","review":"The back cover of \\"Love in the Ancient World\\" states that the author will tell the reader, \\"What is love? And how did people deal with it from humanity's earliest days? How was it represented, communicated . . . ? The answer to such questions would be interesting.Unfortunately, the author confuses sex and love and tells us stories of Nero's slaughter of his wife, mistress, etc. There is pottery that shows Greeks engaged in gay activities. Do these things say anything about love? No. There is a difference between love and sex which the author fails to distinguish. He actually confuses the two throughout the book. The photographs are wonderful and I learned something by looking at them. The text, however, leaves way too much to be desired.(PS I am not some crazy conservative.)Do not spend your hard earned dollars on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the family historian!","review":"I JUST LOVE THIS BOOK!

It is obvious he has gone to great lengths to research the details of this true story, including interviewing some of the actual participants.

Apparently a few people in the film industry thought enough of it to schedule it for production as a motion picture for 2008, according to the Internet Movie Database.

I couldn't believe it. I read the last two pages a half dozen times hoping I'd missed something. I even checked the page numbers to see if some of them had been accidently omitted.

They say not to judge the books by their front cover, I admit that is what I did on this book. The book took a long time for me to actually get into it and I didn't realize it was about a lawyer. That didn't help, because I am not usually not interested in lawyers. I was dreding on the fact that the book looked long and felt long after only read 4-5 chapters.

Those one-hit wonders can't compare to this. UU strikes me as a cross between White Zombie and Alice In Chains. It's hard to describe, but if you like either of those bands, you'll probably like this. It's not acid-trippy like White Zombie, or grungy like Alice In Chains, but an entertaining mix of both. Try out their songs \\"Drivel\\" \\"Natural High\\" and \\"Bitter\\", but don't judge them by their weak WWF song or the admittedly PM5K-ish \\"Mr. Deadman\\".

It's an awesome cd with influences from Powerman 5000 in most songs, also Alice In Chains, and Revolution Man even sounds like a Metallica hit. It's all got a very real sound, hard and loud, but you can still distinguish every beat in every instrument and the vocals are a lot more solid. The lyrics are drug-induced and violent, what else is expected from a heavy metal album? Songs like The Friend Song and Trip With Jesus have a fast pounding beat to them.

I also had a ticket to see them live (only because they were playing with Taproot, who I highly recommend instead). I downloaded a couple songs, and wasn't impressed, nor turned off either. Not until seeing them live was I brought to the point of laughter. They come off live as a third-rate Manson ripoff, and third-rate is being kind. I had a chance to see them again on Ozzfest, and I saw no improvement in the show. While they may be able to churn on decent music in the studio, when it comes to actually playing the songs, they fail miserably.

Buy it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need originality","review":"They have catchy music, but none of it is really their own. Their first single \\"Turn me on Mr Deadman\\" sounds nearly exactly like Powerman 5000 songs. Their newer, better single, \\"Revolution Man\\" does sound good, except the guitar riff is stolen directly from Rage Against the Machine. And even then their music doesn't have any real stand out quality. Union Underground has potentiol, they just need to come up with their own sounds. My advice would be to wait for their next album and see if they can come up with good music of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNION UNDERGROUND DEBUT","review":"If you like PM5K,Marilyn Manson, and NIN this is the album for you.\\"South Texas Deathride\\" is an absolut amazing song.Its rap with metal.This isn't your typical KoRn & Limp Bizkit rap metal.This is rap with harder metal.Lets get this straight though,overall it's not a bad album...well,actually it's pretty amazing in my view,but for all those Limp Bizkit fans,I would reccomend listening to it first before buying it.Fortunately,I am a fan of PM5K,Manson, and NIN,so I totally love this album.An Education In Rebellion gets the Rap-Metal award for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"Some of The Union Underground's work bears a strong resemblance to a PM5K or Rob zombie(which there is really nothing wrong with). However, the album as a whole brings in some more variety than one might not expect to hear from a band like this.

A friend gave me this book when I first expressed an interest in bonsai, and it succeeded in intimidating me. The authors provide very thorough details about creating bonsai, and take it to the level of science rather than art. However, it is because of this high degree of detail that I was struck with how serious the art really can be. I find it unfortunate that it is currently out of print, since it does cover bonsai in such detail. I would tend to recommend Japanese Art of Miniature Trees and Landscapes to the person who is quite dedicated to pursuing the art, and would not recommend it to a person with a more casual interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value!","review":"After purchasing VS cologne for years from the retail store, it was wonderful to purchase at a savings and incredible convenience.

It brings home the job pressures and the need to continually perform and improve. It also clearly outlines what lengths the corporate world will go to to maintain control.The author is to be saluted for having the backbone to fight back and to stand for principle. Most of all it is a story of his tenacity and need to persist and to get answers. Several of the chapters deal with the author's dark side and indiscretions which add flavor, but cause one to say \\"why did he do that?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a nicely crafted rehash of the episode","review":"Sorry it didn't have anything radically new to tell.

At the same time, The absence of the mention of the experience of women, people of color or of pratically anyone else who was not also a white middle class or wealthy gay male was missing from the text.I still think that this is a book to read...and re-read. Most of what the author talks about are universal issues...with a gay slant. It can be read by anyone who has grown up in in a straight WHITE man's world, including many (most?) straight white men.Yes, my growing up experience has been difficult - and there are a plethora of books out there that focus on growing up female, non-white, poor, overweight, etc, etc. I'd say give this book a good read, and \\"fill in the blanks\\" whenever the references to gay men don't apply to you. It is well written and has many good anecdotes, suggestions and insights - enough to make me want to look up and see what else the author has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lopsided interpretation","review":"I thought this book would be enlightening about the gay journey of an individual or individuals. It was far from that. Though this author is a professional, whether highly acclaimed or not, he made a lot of misrepresentations (I FEEL). Yes, I understand that the book represented many of his clients' journey into accepting their sexuality and validation issues as a gay man in society. This author is a professional in his field respectively, BUT he somehow made tragic mistake of categorizing and making broad generalizations that doesn't reflect many gay men. If he had possibly researched and interview people not his clients, he would have probably been successful covering a wide array of journeys that would cover the spectrum of many men's journey into their homosexuality. It made me angry and I eventually had to stop reading this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book after all the positive reviews.

Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"promoting the stereotypes","review":"While the author is thorough in exploring his worldview, it was difficult to relate to. In this world, there are only gay and straight people, strongly defined by their jobs, and at some point \\"wildly successful\\" in some sort of capitalist pursuit. I suspect that the author is limiting his worldview to the men who can afford his therapy or would choose to pursue therapy, the cost of which, I'm guessing, excludes variety and the type of person who spend thousands of dollars to pursue the lack of meaning in their own \\"fabulous\\" lives. The author also tips his hat the limitations of stereotypes and then dives right in and reinforces every gay stereotype there is. Not being a \\"fabulous\\" gay man who has never been wildly successful, it's a stretch for me to find myself, or anything of value on a personal level, in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Velvet's","review":"Almost at the first page I found so match that fits me and my personality and also my friends and other people I know.

For the rest of us, it is very superficial and barely touches the reality or complexities of deep gay relationships. It also does not address bi lives or any real help to analyze heterosexual activity of men who may identify as gay or bi.

I was asked to read this book and give my input as to whether we should consider introducing it into our school system. I thought the first three-quarters of the book were realistic and true to life. However, the last quarter was a major disappointment and gives an unrealistic resolution to domestic violence. The ending seemed like either the author got tired and wanted a quick ending or wanted some unrealistic, romantic stuff to draw readers. I think she did a disservice with a potentially good book.

His last album, probably his best, all but bombed underneath the massive lack of marketing, and this album has met a similar fate, though deservedly so. This is by far his weakest effort, full of sappy adult contemporary ballads that not even his great voice can save. The record moves at a snail's pace, with the occasional uptempo number thrown in. Overall, a wasted effort from someone clearly wasting his vast talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most underated singers","review":"Jon Secada is brilliant. It's a shame that more people don't know that. I love this cd. The four best songs are, Stop, Speak to the Wind, Better Part of Me and my absolute favourite is Love's About to Change My Mind. I can't understand why he's not been a bigger artist. There is good latin routed sounds on this album and there's a good mix of fast and slow songs. I know you'll love this cd. I do. I wish he'd bring out another english cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jon Secada Rules!!","review":"I loved this CD! Jon has a very nice voice.

I have recommended it to many people over the last 10 years (since the birth of my first child)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the purchase!","review":"This is a great breastfeeding book. Lots of information and presented in a format that makes sense (based on the age of the baby) and is helpful for knowing what to do and what to expect.

I was so impressed that I decided to buy the book and it really helped me. The language is clear and concise, and pretty much I learned a lot about breastfeeding from this book.Edit - It has been almost one year and I am still breastfeeding my baby, this book continues to help and guide me.

So, that's a pretty good review, wouldn't you say?Thanks for asking, Adelyn Blaikie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Handy","review":"I purchased this book after reading a number of positive reviews and I was not disappointed. I read the entire thing cover to cover in a couple of days while I was nursing my son. I have gone back many times to look up things I have questions about. It is easy to find the information I need. Also, I was pleasantly surprised when the hospital gave out a small, pamphlet version of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Advice on Weaning","review":"I bought this book before my son was born because I'd read that it is very important to have a good nursing manual. We thankfully received lots of support from the hospital and pediatrician, so the first time I really needed the advice in here was when I decided to wean him at seven months. Guess what? No information! This was basically another breastfeeding commercial and implied that if I weaned my child before 2 years, I was a horrible parent.Look, bottom line is it would be nice if this book could simply serve the function of giving you much needed information about breastfeeding. Part of the journey is ending the breastfeeding relationship, and I think it's a huge oversight that weaning isn't discussed in detail. We get advice from enough sources as it is. Everyone has an opinion; I don't think it's right for a reference material to have one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware, don't spoil your kid","review":"While this book provides useful tips and encouragements for nursing moms, I found the author quite single minded on what is the right way to feed the baby and not always clear on what's her personal opinion vs. what's well adopted or proven. My advice is that this is a book worth reading, but don't use it as the only guidance for feeding your child.If you don't want a child who stays in your bed for a long long time or who grows up to believe crying is the way to get attention and whatever she wants whenever she wants it, and if you'd like to bring a happy kid into your life rather than turning yours upside down, go read other books and get second opinions elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible Book for New Moms","review":"Huggins is a hippocrite and writes a book that is completely irresponsible. This book does little to provide guidance to a new nursing mom. Rather it makes you feel guilty, helpless and like a failure. I was a successful nursing mom for 14 months despite this book. For the birth of my second child, I did myself a favor and used it for a coaster for my water cup while I nursed my baby.Do yourself a favor and get the AAP or the Good Housekeeping books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"I am expecting my first baby in July and purchased this book because I plan to breast feed & am doing as much research as possible on everything long before baby comes home. So far, I have only read the introduction & first chapter, which is applicable to someone months away from giving birth.I agree with other reviewers that the author is definitely biased towards breast-feeding, but, duh! Why would the \\"Nursing Mother's Companion\\" encourage bottle feeding formula, especially when it has been proven time & time again that nursing is best for baby AND mother?I would recommend this book to any of my friends considering nursing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very helpful breastfeeding book","review":"For my first child I took a breastfeeding class and this was the required reading. It was my \\"bible\\" for the first few weeks after the birth! It was quite helpful to go into detail about what I needed to know to be successful at breastfeeding (and it ain't always easy!).If you're aiming to breastfeed exclusively this is a great book to have on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I am expecting my first baby soon and I am enjoying this book.

I will keep this next to me while I begin nursing."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a reason it is titled \\"companion\\"","review":"This book was very helpful with nursing issues. Other books devote a chapter or a few pages to nursing, this is a whole book! I keep it on my end table where I nurse and refer to it all the time. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Breastfeeding Bible!","review":"This is seriously the best book I've read on breastfeeding (and I'm a Lactation Consultant). Great for both new moms and experienced breastfeeders! Addresses many hurdles that breastfeeding can present. I couldn't have gotten through breastfeeding my daughter without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"must have for breastfeeding moms","review":"My husband and I had our first son 6 months ago. Breastfeeding is very difficult the first time around, and this book was a great help. It was recommended by our childbirth prep class instructor, and I'm so glad we took her tip. It is very straighforward and has great lists of problems and solutions that are easy to access. It is broken up into logical sections that, again, make it very easy to find information. Huggins is thorough and concise which was very relieving when I was rather desperate for help during those first few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the ultimate guide for nursing mothers!","review":"A dear friend gifted this to me at a baby shower; she knew what she was doing. When I first began nursing my son I consulted this text on a daily basis. Ms. Huggins not only provides all the information you need to know, she doesn't balk at telling you what foods to avoid when some health professionals advise new mothers that they can eat whatever they like and that it will not affect the baby. Perhaps this was the most telling assistance for me when my son developed colic and I was looking for ways to help ease his pain. I am still able to nurse my son at ten months without ever having a sign of dwindling milk source. I know that others have either given up on nursing their children or have supplemented with formula; without the guidance from this book I might have fallen into one of those categories. To the author: thank you, thank you, thank you. Now I give this book to any pregnant friend who intends to nurse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used w/both children","review":"Nursed my first for 1 year and am still nursing the 2nd at 10 months.

It is written in a friendly, easy to understand way and gives step by step instruction on how to breastfeed, from just getting started to overcoming problems. It is empowering and describes barriers to nursing which I myself did not know I had until reading. It is a confidence booster to learn many moms felt what I was feeling and someone had written about how to overcome it! With this book, I was able to work through some nursing difficulties which were not even talked about in other books I read.

The 3 stories in the collection that came from the original series were excellent, especially the one by Neil Gaiman (from Hellblazer #27), but the movie adaptation lacked everything that draws people to the pages of John Constantine: Hellblazer. It was bland and lackluster, deficient in both visuals and script. There was none of the old eloquence and sinister power in the dialogue, the characters were boring and unexpressive, and the plot read like a courtroom brief. Strictly speaking, in spite of all the ridiculous changes they made to the characters and story, the movie was better than this sad little representation could convey. I gave this book 2 stars purely out of consideration for the 3 stories taken from the comic series...stories which I reread from time to time in the other collections, and which stand out as classic Constantine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good book for self-study","review":"This book is not well-written.

As such, the ending is totally unacceptable. You read 1200 pages to get a conclusion and the whole thing ends in 2 pages.

While the artists are certainly talented (how many people in the world can sing like Chaka Khan...), and the music arrangements feel contemporary, I did not get much out of the album. I think a good covers album should take the songs to a new level, such as for the tribute album for Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra (granted that album wasn't brilliant either, but those songs felt more original in general). This album's arrangements generally show why pop and R&B today are terrible--songs are digitized and edited beyond belief, musicians are less inventive and original, and the songs lack the soul that made this music so great in the 70s. If you like EWF, go buy one of their original albums or see them on tour...this album didn't do justice to Maurice and Co."},{"rating":"1","title":"mistake","review":"I made a mistake in buying this CD. There is no doubt that all performing artists did the best they could, but i can't help but comparing every song to the orginal songs and they still stand out. Furthermore i find it hard to regonize actual interpretations, but find carbon copy's of the original songs, except for the last song; fantasy, but I can hardly imagine anyone preferring this (mis)interpretation over the orginal.A disappointed EWF fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really a Band this great leave alone","review":"These guys did the music better than anyone could come along and ever do. To do a tribute album is nice but production time and effort put into the originals puts anyone behind the eight ball from word go. You have to really work hard to ever update these songs if it is even possible. Never understood these types of albums. I mean the original did them right why remake them."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mouth \\"makes it worth while.","review":"This CD by bush is definetly their finest yet.

I was hoping the band would develop a little. The guitarist is surprisingly good and the singer writes good Nirvana rip-off tunes. But this album was a big disappointment. The first song is thick and heavy, and the second (Greedy Fly) has a nice stop/start section to it. The rest of the album is very boring. The band plays one dull rock riff after another, completely out of ideas. After this CD, I can hardly imagine buying another Bush album. Ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Suprising","review":"When I first listened to this album, I was quite ashamed to say, \\"I wasted my money on this crap?\\" When I really like a band, I like to finish my collection of all their work. That's the main reason I bought 'Razorblade Suitcase.' The first time I listened to it, I knew I could've done without it. But when I gave it a chance and listened to it another couple of times, I fell in love with it. Bush can't top '6teen Stone' but this album comes pretty close to doing so. In order of greatness, here it is: 'Greedy Fly', 'Mouth', 'Swallowed', 'Communicator', 'Cold Contagious', 'Straight No Chaser', 'Bonedriven', 'Synapse', 'History'...Wish I could go on. The point is, it's all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush's first great album.","review":"Sixteen Stone sounded a bit thrown together, although it does have some of their best and well known songs on it \\"Everything Zen\\" \\"Comedown\\" and \\"little Things\\".This is better though, its not meant to be a face value album , you listen to a lot of the songs and they draw you in, rather than just knocking you back with the sound.The songs seem to contain alot more emotion and feeling as well, and in that way, Bush sounded even better with \\"The Science of Things\\" as for \\"Goldenstate\\" well they really needed to do something a bit more interesting and take another, \\"if only\\" slightly different direction.Anyone who is into good music should own this album, its has a bitter, but its amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album really stinks except for one song!","review":"To tell you the truth this album is a disaster as a follow-up to sixteen stone. Their is only one decent song on it and it could of been alot better.

I can't get Gavin Rossdale's whiny little voice out of my head! SHUT UP, YOU SORRY, NO-TALENT, CORRUPTER OF PRE-TEEN GIRLS!I'm sorry, but this album is not only full of nonsense whining, but it is also full of cheezy, uncreative power-chord riffs. It's not that I have anything against the good old rock staple 5th chord, but if you're gonna use it AMLOST EXCLUSIVELY, please make it interesting....maybe throw up the rhythm once in a while, something to catch listeners off guard. Razorblade suitcase is sonic diarrhea - it sounds the same throughout, it's very unpleasant, and I think, if sound could be percieved as color...it would be a runny brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fourth-rate Wannabe Grunge","review":"To memphisbowlerpimp, noone has ever credited Bush with starting the grunge movement, as Bush came out with their first album the SAME year that Kurt Cobain died (arguably the end of grunge).Bush is not grunge, although they desperately want to be so. If you want to hear REAL grunge, save up the lunch money that your parents give you and go by a album by Mudhoney or Green River or Mother Love Bone (three bands I'm sure most of you have not heard of). Then by Nirvana's Bleach album and some early Soundgarden. Top that off with Temple of the Dog and your on your way to hearing REAL grunge, not fourth-rate Bush crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"soft boiled and weak................","review":"Pretty boy lead singer now is angst filled huh...... yea right look if this band isn't a xerox of a sound that has passed i don't know what is? i know all music comes from some other music but this effort shows now innovation what so ever...

Bush is at their bust on this. I love the songs that have the addition of clasical instrments such as the chello. Thats the main reason I like them, they add new things to make an art out of this cd. Yes, I know the lyrics are strange on some songs, but thats how Grunge is! Look at nirvana. There lyrics don't make sence and they mummble most the time but everyone likes them!Its the essance of the music. And Bush does make sence lyricly if you try to get into and understand what they are coming from. It's a great cd for grunge fans. A good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"good band, bad cd","review":"Although I love Bush, I recommend not to buy this Cd. It doesn't really have any good songs on it. No songs get you into the music and make you want to hear them again. When \\"Razorblade Suitcase\\" first came out, everybody I knew was excited. Bush was a loved band, with a lot of good hits. This Cd doesn't compare to \\"Sixteen Stone\\" or their newer cd, \\"The Science of Things\\", whuch both have great songs that keep you listening. I would recomend you check into a different Cd by Bush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulless, effortless, mercantile crap from the Bushmeisters","review":"The lyrics on Razorblade are just as bad as on Sixteen, if not worse, and only one song, \\"Greedy Fly,\\" has a remotely catchy riff to it. \\"Personal Holloway\\" might be listenable if it weren't so damn boring. I was amused by this album at first, but I found that on repeated listens, it's a rather painful experience. The chorus of \\"Swallowed\\" is pretty funny, though. And here's the exceptional chorus of \\"Mouth\\": \\"Nothing hurts...like your mouth!\\" Now there's lyrical brilliance. Razorblade Suitcase confirms my suspicions that the lone reason Bush got anywhere was because they had a pretty-boy frontman. It's scary the way the music industry works these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Bush could have done...","review":"First, I want to mention that this is a neutral review. Razorblade Suitcase is a huge dissapointment when compared to Sixteen Stone. I bought this CD and ended up trading it in for two dollars. I didn't like most of it...it didn't have the same tones, or anything near it, to earlier Bush recordings. More on an industrial side, Bush trailed from their sound on Sixteen Stone and produced an entire new one. If you likes Sixteen Stone, I suggest you listen to this album before purchasing it, because you will probably end up wanting to take it back. =("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"This is a great cd that reminds me of back in the day when you can just sit around and listen without a care in the world"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush rocks!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I hate it when people don't take bush seriously just because gavin rossdale has been blessed with good looks..........he can't help it.........but the main thing is that the music he makes is some of the best i have ever heard.A tendency to start fires is an all out rocker......while greedy fly and swallowed are classics.The world will finally sit up and look upto Bush once The Science of Things is released 'cause it WILL debut at No.1 ......ROCK ON GUYS!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly not like their debut","review":"Bush's debut album is so much better than this dissapointing follow up. Sixteen Stone is full of hit songs that you hear on the radio. That is what Razorblade Suitcase is missing, those #1 catchy hits like Little Things. The only songs on here reminding me of the old Bush are Mouth and Greedy Fly. If i were you i would wait around their next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falls short a bit though.","review":"This album is mostly pretty good.Although a couple of tracks fall short a bit.A different but good direction in sound, by Bush."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is garbage pure and simple","review":"bush lyric....

Who woulda thunk?","review":"It's funny that everyone loves to bash Bush and claim they ripped Nirvana off. All Bush really did was steal their producer (Albini) and create a better album that In Utero ever was. Thankfully, Razorblade Suitcase doesn't have the raw mushiness that plagued Albini's production of In Utero. He obviously had much better material to work with. Songs like the beautifully-backed \\"Swallowed\\" is amazing. So is the \\"Mouth\\", which builds up to the chorus with an epic feel. Get this along with 16 Stone and Science of Things."},{"rating":"1","title":"k. such a poor excuse for a rock and roll album.","review":"Bush is another on of those no-talent wannabee rock bands who try so hard to be cool but instead end up like some of those 80s hair bands. I do admit, there is some talent within the exterior of thid cd but the key constant pussification of this cd is the vocals. yes, the vocals suck and so do the lyrics. these boys could not write lyrics if their lives depended on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faded into oblivion","review":"I loved this when it first came out. Now I wonder what I saw in it. I still listen to Sixteen Stone occasionally, but Razorblade Suitcase has faded into oblivion in that stack of CDs I haven't put on in years. I guess it had its time and its place, but zero staying power. The test of time is foolproof."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album isn't really that good.","review":"I bought this cd, expecting a masterpiece like sixteen stone. It isn't. The cool guitar sound is gone (remember \\"Everything Zen\\"?) and it sounds like they are playing in a garage. The vocals and the musical quality pretty much turned to crap. I say this even though I am a huge fan of bush, but this cd simply doesn't measure up. If you wan't to really experiance bush, buy Sixteen Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot different from their first one.","review":"Bush's Razorblade suitcase is very good album, but is missing a few what could of been a few more better tracks, although every track is good.Its quite a raw sounding album, but the guitar playing is great, particularly on \\"Greedy Fly\\" with an awesome intro on the guitar.Probably this is their best albums, probably cause it was'nt killed by the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"best dude rock band album!","review":"I absolutely loved this CD when I first bought it when it came out in 1997,at the impressionable age of 14. :) Now,at 21,im rediscovering the music that made me love music in the first place. By The way, to all the people who say Bush isnt grunge,good for you. No one said they were grunge.SO no need to diss them for not being \\"grunge\\". Why do people decide to go ahead and label some group and then everyone harps on that one word?Bush are talented,tasty,terrific,and totally on edge. Their songs are not slow and depressing,although funny thing is,theyre not even as dark as Nirvana's lyrics,but no one says anything about that...(PS I love Nirvana also and im not bashing them). the lyrics are also not horrible, whoever said that obviously cant relate to anything that isnt too deep or interpretive. anyway this album rocks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music....Just DON'T Listen to the Lyrics","review":"The music is beautiful, scratchy, spacy, wet.

Too many albums sound way to over produced, and you know they can do this live , unlike some other bands ( Sum 41 anyone ? ) I could go on and on all day about this album , but those who get it , know what I mean ... to each his own ... if you like Bush and don't have this album ---- BUY IT !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a friend of the bass player's brother- england","review":"great sounding grunge rock. mmmnnnnn doesn't get any better than this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up","review":"After their excellent debut album \\"Sixteen Stone\\", I had great hopes for their second attempt.

'Sixteen Stone', 'The Science of Things', and 'Golden State' were great albums. 'Razorblade Suitcase' really was not. I don't know why, but the album just lacks any songs that give you that rush you feel when you hear songs like \\"Everything Zen,\\" \\"Float,\\" or \\"The Chemicals Between Us.\\" These and the other songs off their three good albums make you feel something, but Razorblade Suitcase just bores you. At least it did me.With the exception of \\"Personal Hollow\\" (and okay, maybe \\"Swallowed\\"), this is really not worth checking out. Pick up their other three discs though. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but what happened?","review":"I remember seeing Bush in 1996. During that time No Doubt opened for Bush. Yes that's right kids! Success comes and goes for most bands. Bush nowadays would open for No Doubt. Ironic don't you think? A lot changes in time. This album is good, but what happened. What happened is people started moving past grunge after 1996. After bands like Nirvana people held onto the dream. I myself included. But it is over.

It's supposed to have a \\"Bonus Track\\" consisting of a Sly and Robbie cover of a Madonna tune, but listeners are not instructed where it is on the CD or how to get at it. I know it's there, because when the disc cues up my player says \\"75:30\\" and as soon as I hit play and the first track starts, the time remaining drops to \\"71:25.\\" I suspect that in order to get to it, you have to have a cheap CD player and get it to rewind \\"behind\\" track 1. High end CD players will not do this, ever. So between copy protected CD's that won't even play at all on my player, other disc's with \\"secret\\" tracks like this one, Lamb's \\"What Sound\\" and Hybrid's \\"Sci-fi Mornings\\" I'm ready to say the hell with it and stop buying music.

At times,I found the stereotypes offensive and didn't really find humor in what I assume was supposed to be light comedy at times.I wouldn't waste my time with this book if I knew then what I know now, however, because of the beginning and ending chapters of this book, there is potential for a good writer and I would be willing to give Andrew Greeley another shot.

As with the previous book, magic is limited to telepathy and telempathy. Professor Jones' use of the old customs that would have been present in Arthur's Britain makes for some fascinating and informative reading. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any fan of King Arthur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"I have installed it and it works fine.

I did extend the wiring, and fabricated my own mount, because their mount is ugly, and won't work on my 1 1/4 bars. Just a small piece of steel with holes for the led and button, then fastened to the lower screw on the left switch housing clamp. On the last unit I just cut off the LED, but I kept it this time so I could be sure the battery is good and a signal transmits when I push the button.

And the all-time favorite, \\"Stomp!\\" is awesome for youth rallies and stuff! Everyone I know loves that song.

Gospel originated from jazz and blues music therefore you get a mixture that is exemplified by this cd. This cd sold a lot of copies so I think people would agree me in saying that the vocals were better than good on this cd. Gospel music has its own style and shouldn't be compared to another type of music. To say that someone is trying to be like Billie Holiday is ridiculous to me. How would Billie Holiday sound on a God's Property track? This is one of the cds you should have in your collection if you appreciate contemporary gospel. I would not call it gospel hip-hop because there is only one song with a rap verse in it. Every song on this cd is tight.

I do enjoy some music in this \\"fusion\\" vein. for instance the Arabica collection is of better quality than this. but you would do much better just getting Arabic pop, as in Egyptian top-40, or Rai from Algeria or Morroco, because that is rich music full of personality and nuance, often influenced by hiphop, dancehall, or house, so it is also accessable and club friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This music is nicely layered and droney; years latter I still find new sounds and it takes me through sweet psychescapes.

In addition to the Artemis Fowl series, he has the Benny books, Airman (a Count of Monte Cristo tale), and Half Moon Investigations (a humorous hard boiled detective story). Each of those efforts is masterful, mixing entertainment with insight and understanding. The Supernaturalist starts out with promise, and Colfer does offer a Colfer-worthy dark, sci-fi vision of the future, but, beyond the basic premise, this book is not up to his earlier efforts. On my own, I would rate it a three star, but my 13 year old son, while agreeing that it is inferior to other Colfers would give it 4.

They attempt to fight off the creatures but soon realize something horrible about the creatures, making their job much harder.I enjoyed this book because of how it was science-fiction and also was always exciting and fast-paced and would recommend it to anyone who likes exciting books, science-fiction books, or Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl series.Neal Bhasin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super science fiction story","review":"I was given this book because I really enjoyed Colfer's previous books. This novel tells the story of Cosmo Hill (an odd name...) who manages to escape from a horrible orphanage. He joins up with a group of people who call themselves 'Supernaturalists'(hence the title of the book.) They meet all sorts of interesting characters in unusual situations, but then this is Eoin Colfer and you come to expect that sort of thing in his book.I enjoyed this book every bit as much as I did the Artemis Fowl series. Colfer is very talented and offers a different sort of story to what you usually expect in science fiction. Go for it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Colfer has really hit his low point","review":"Oh man, this is LAME!Weak charachters, poorly told story involving the destruction (oh wait, now we're trying to save them) of some cool-hued willo-the-wisps reminiscent of the Blue Meanies from The Beatles' \\"Yellow Submarine\\".I've read all the Artemis Fowl books, so I've gotten used to Eoin Colfer's confident (slightly pompous) writing style, but I certainly wasn't prepared for this atrocity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swearing","review":"My 4th grade son wanted to read this so I checked it out first. I was disappointed to see the swearing in it because now I can't let him read it.Is it normal for books written for this age group to have swearing in it, as the Supernaturalist does?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but no Artemis","review":"I liked this book, it was a good change of pace from his Artemis series. It takes place in the future city above the ground. You follow Cosmo through his haunting days as an orphan, to his vigilante days, to his new understanding of the world around him. The stories of the characters are all there and you get enough detail to keep you satisfied for such a short book. If you like Colfer then pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Done it again!","review":"Eoin Colfer has done it again. This book is as good as his AF series. It is action packed... but it was so good, it left me wanting more. I wish there was a sequal. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this was a great book.","review":"After reading the Artemis Fowl series, I couldn't wait to read The Supernaturalist. The book had a lot of suspenseful moments and a ton of detail. I thought the book had a lot of action in it. I would usually read the book for at least 50 minutes. The ending leaves me waiting for the sequel to The Supernaturalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a waste of time or money","review":"This is not Aretimis Fowl. If you come in excpecting Artemis Fowl, you are likely to be disappointed. This is a very good book. Eoin Colfer uses his ability to write fantastic characters that you find your self torn between who you like the best, similiar to Aretmis Fowl. Take it from me, an average 14 year old boy much like Cosmo, Colfer captures his feelings greatly. However, sometimes the plot moves a bit to fast and some of the early plot twists are a tad predictable, despite it you will find yourself loving this book. The one thing that seperates this from Aretimis Fowl is the fact that this one has a better ending then any of the three. Overall, a book you won't be sorry you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"wooaah coool","review":"This book is good. It makes you want to keep reading. From all the things that happen to Cosmo. when he fell off the roof and his skull broke open and his brain was hanging out of his skull and had to have metal put over his head and had to get his kneecap replaced. and another good part is when he had to go on to the myishi satelite and find the parasites home. And saved monas life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Supernaturalist","review":"This was a great book...more in-depth and personal than Artemis Fowl, but just as great, if not better!It has a solitary and firm plot. The story goes on and on with a highly original story. It's very mysterious and keeps the reader guessing what will happen, only to twist the story even more.A great book...A must read.I'll tell you one thing that I thought after reading this...I WANT A SEQUEL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convincing and the Physics suck badly","review":"This pretends to be SF. But it is really fantasy. The author describes a highly technical society that does not respect the individual. However Colfer either does have no clue about physics and technology, or he does not care. This is perfectly acceptable in fantasy, but not in something that pretends to be realistic. It does screw up the readers sense of how physical reality works. It also happens so often that it really breaks the mood frequently.Add to that that the story is not very interesting, the characters are flat and the plot is chaotic. I think reading this book is a waste of time at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Supernaturalist\\" is superb!","review":"The Supernaturalist, by Eoin Colfer is an absolutely wonderful book. I think that it is comparable to any of the Artemis Fowl series. The Supernaturalist has five main characters. Cosmo Hill, who was abandoned on the streets without a sponsor, was sent to an orphanage where they tested potentially dangerous products on the orphans. The other main characters are Mona, an ex-gangster, Stefan a brave boy, Ditto, a 28 year old boy in a small body, a product of a genetic experiment, and Ellen, who is greedy and self-centered. It is a futuristic science fiction novel about Cosmo, Mona, Stefan, and Ditto who hunt down life-destroying parasites and fight Ellen, who is using the parasites for her own benefit.I liked the story because of its interesting storyline, it is action-packed, and once I picked it up, it was hard to stop reading it. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who likes science fiction novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Exciting","review":"Eoin has done it again! I loved the Artemis Fowl trilogy and I enjoyed the Wish List and he has carried on the zany and thrilling plots into this book. I enjoy the way he creates the characters and the how the plot unfolds with the most unexpected turns. I hope this story continues in a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and fascinating book!","review":"This book and its author created a fascinating world and reality in which to follow believable characters through the fantastic. Much the way more traditional sci-fi and space opera has done over the years and continues to do: \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\", \\"2001\\", \\"2010\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"I,Robot\\", \\"Ringworld\\", \\"Advent of the Corps\\", and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, as usual!","review":"As all of Eoin Colfer's books, The Supernaturalist is amazingly well-written and has enough suspence and twists to keep the pages turning. The story is about Cosmo Hill and the creatures simply known as Parasites. These Parasites, which feed off the life force of humans, are unseeable to most people. Cosmo is one of the few that can see the Parasites, as can a group of people who call themselves the Supernaturalists. Due to his ability to see the Parasites, Cosmo goes on an adventure that won't easily be forgotten.Even though I usually read at a much higher reading level, books like The Supernaturalist is certainly not just for little kids. I love all of Colfer's books, and The Supernaturalist is my favourite of all of his. This is a must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful holiday book","review":"If you liked Guinn's autobiography of Santa Claus you will love this book. The story moves smoothly through the ages and has many links to history that, with a little imagination, you can find believable. The characters are delightful, making it a joyous holiday read. This one is a keeper--it won't go off to the half-price store at the end of the year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded and drawn out, boring and hard to get into","review":"I was intrigued with the topic and the historical perspective of the fiction book, but it was a chore to read.

I think It's awesome to see so many great punk bands together on one CD. There are some really good songs on here, my personal favorites being those by Rancid, Lagwagon, AFI & Dance Hall Crashers. My only problem is that I've never seen the movie and I can't find it anywhere! If you know where I can find it, let me know! I'd love to see it (with a soundtrack like this one, how can it be bad?)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A page flipper","review":"I bought Hubcap King and 'The Time of New Weather' together. I'll probably not be attempting The Time of New Weather for quite a while -- too much else on my reading list. I wanted so much to enjoy the novel (having mystical interests myself). The story does have some interesting metaphors and characters, but it took me a long time to get through it without flipping over countless slow sections, not because it was a heavy read -- quite the opposite, it just didn't hook me in any way. As much as Sean may be a wonderful teacher of Zen, I heartily suggest he take a few writing courses to learn how to become a better story teller -- to create a more coherent and escalating plot structure, develop multidimensional characters, scintillating dialog... I found myself neither amused nor excited nor gaining anything from the read. I felt instead that there was a lot of rambling and redundancy and fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Nonsense!!!!","review":"I am 56 years old, and an avid reader. I have often not liked a book I have read, but this is the first time I have ever wished I had not read one. It is a very derivitive book - a combination of \\"Candide\\" (to which the jacket reviews compare it) and John Bunyan's \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" (which they do not). If one has read these, one does not need to read this. The author, Sean Murphy, works hard on trying to impress us how clever he is, and fails miserably. What he deems as cleverness is, again and again, just \\"cloyingly cute.\\" Two examples from just one chapter - the one he calls \\"The Shape of Tuesday\\" - calling the man who founded of an institute which studies time \\"Julian Calendar,\\" and, at a banquet which honors time having food seasoned with \\"parsley, sage, rosemary.\\" PLEASE!!! And every chapter is like this. If zen, for you, means trite allegory and confusion, have at it, but, otherwise, avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"an old favorite","review":"I lvoed this books so much i bought it at ebay for a small fortune, i HAD to have my own copy.

Even reading it today, it does not lose its charm. Thanks so much for writing this!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I loved this book, and I think it was as good as The Heavenly Horse.

Not quite as good as Heavenly Horse, put still one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a ColdFusion developer need to learn","review":"Since the release of ColdFusion MX, learning a little bit of Java makes more sense than ever for a ColdFusion developer. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Java manuals out there are targeted to people with OOP experience, often C/C++ developers. They also cover a lot of things that have no value for a web developer. Eben Hewitt managed to cover this special niche pretty well, with a well-structured book that delivers exactly what a ColdFusion developer need to learn in order to become acquainted with Java."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent content from a good writer","review":"High praise for this book on object orientation using Java. Eben has done an excellent job; highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"Couldn't get into this one despite trying multiple times. I'm usually able to at least skim through the boring parts to reach the end so I can see what happens, but with this one, I didn't even care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But too fast.","review":"Shadowmancer gets you going from the first page, it just goes straight into all action, fun and games and high pranks. Throw in a bit of magic and some strange monsters and you get an interesting read. The problem with it is very simple, you take a very promising situation, expect it to develop into a dozen pages of nerve tangling plot, with a twist or two along the way, and it does not do it, it is over in half a page and you are left thinking, I could have done that better. I however did not, and credit to Mr Taylor for doing what I have failed in twenty years of promising to do, but it could have given so much more to the reader. Definitely more Tolkein than Potter, but a long way from Lord of the Rings. It is enjoyable, and worth having a look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even in the same league as H. Potter","review":"I have read all the Harry Potter books and although they are considered children's literature enjoyed the story and loved the characters. I read a review of Shadowmancer and how wonderful the book was and thought the family would love it. As it wasn't in the US yet I had a friend bring it back from a business trip in the UK. What a waste of a favor! I have been trying to wade through this book for the past week and a half. Utterly boring. I feel like I am in Sunday School again just with different names but somewhat the same stories. Please don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Huge Waste!","review":"If you like books that are moralizing to the point of insulting then you might want to throw away your money on this one. Otherwise, stick to good fiction like Eragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfinishable, unforgiveable","review":"Like many reviewers, I almost always finish the books I read, no matter how dislikeable. But the poor plotting, absence of ANY characterization, humorlessness and just generally dismal writing was sapping my will to live. I agree with the reviewers who noted that its 'youth fiction' designation was not an excuse for its terrible quality: young people deserve good writing too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miracles Without Character","review":"The book is a short novel of good versus evil in a thinly vailed effort at evangelical Christian dogma.There is little real story development beyond the three central characters blundering through bad situations that are entirely out of their control, repeatedly being saved by God when he sends \\"the King\\" or angels to save the day for them. Supporting characters jump in and out of the story line never to be seen again, their purpose seeming to be just a quick miracle, then away they go. The writing was somewhat above average so far as simple storytelling is concerned; however, the interaction between characters was very weak since character development is necessarily limited in a story that covers only a few days in the lives of young children. The book was not entirely unenjoyable, just very simplistic with an overly obvious religious intent (no subtlety there at all). I'll not be buying another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This is possibly the worst book I've read in years. The characters have no depth at all. The book is written in such a jumpy, mismatched way that even the action does not flow smoothly. There is plenty of action, I'll allow that, but with such shallow characters, who cares?I'm a mother that likes to read young adult sci/fi fantasy to keep up with what my 13 year old daughter is reading. I didn't expect this book to be at an adult level. I did expect it to be similar to Harry Potter, which is the book that Shadowmancer was compared to in the book description. However, it is boring to read, and not at all like HP. My recommendation is to skip this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Harry Potter...","review":"I picked this book up after reading about its popularity in Britain, and it had been compared to the Harry Potter series. Unfortunately, i was quite disappointed. The plot was incredibly weak, and it took all the strength I had to merely finish the book! Perhaps some younger readers will enjoy it, but there are other better written books out there that they should spend time reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Harry Potter, but enjoyable...","review":"True, I read the publicity comparing Shadowmancer to Harry Potter, so, as a huge Harry Potter fan, decided to read it. Shadowmancer is NOT Harry Potter, but fortunately, I do not believe everything I read in reviews. Since I didn't really expect it to be the next Harry Potter, I really enjoyed it. I found the characters enjoyable and the writing to be okay. Not the best I have read, but not the worst. Yes, it is a story about the battle between good and evil and if you don't enjoy that story, you probably won't enjoy Shadowmancer. However, if you enjoy reading fantasy fiction with enjoyable, imaginative characters and DON'T expect this to be Harry Potter, you should put Shadowmancer on your list to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Appropriate for Children","review":"This book was purchased as a gift for my 8 year old son because it was marketed in our local bookstore as a children's book, popular with Harry Potter fans.I read it first because it didn't sound like a children's book in the jacket description.

I never warmed to any of the characters. The plot is uninteresting. The conclusion is anti-climactic.But worst of all, the book is preachy. The author is an Anglican vicar and he insists on bringing the Christian \\"mythology\\" right into the story, only changing the names to protect the innocent. I do not object to the invocation of Christian themes--I love Lewis, Tolkien, and Charles Williams--but I object when the story is simply a pretense to convert the reader.I love fantasy, but I cannot recommend this book at all. Very disappoiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"C.S. Lewis fans, beware!","review":"Anyone who loves C.S. Lewis is sure to hate this book and find it almost impossible to read. I forced myself to read some of it in an effort to discover why it became a best seller.

Please don't buy this book for your children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Game First Try, But Harry Potter It Ain't!","review":"From what I read of it...actually I didn't finish it due to lack of interest. I read the press kit for the book and was hooked by what appeared to be an engrossing storyline and the background of the author himself. Sadly, the book failed to deliver as promised. Try it if you like darker, gothic, evil attempts to take over the world type of books, but I don't know how the press thought this would be the \\"next Harry Potter\\". J.K. Rowling is in no danger of losing her laurels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadowmancer disappointment","review":"As a youth fiction author I try to read books in the genre I am writing. I eagerly picked up Shadowmancer after hearing it was outselling Harry Potter. What a disppointment! The writing was not professional, stilted and dis-jointed. The characters continually changed personalities, the story choppy and had very bumpy chapter transitions. Most of the story was told in passive voice and point of view changed per sentence. It was incredibly dark considering it was supposed to be \\"Christian.\\" The few Bible verses thrown in were not labeled as such and if you are not familiar with them, you would not have known you were reading Scripture. The ending was totally unsatisfying and left you wondering what happened. Don't waste your money on this book. If you want a well-written, exciting book with both good and bad characters and is a breath of fresh air, buy Eragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible writing","review":"Even if one doesn't mind the over-religious tone (after all, the author is a vicar and there's nothing wrong with him promoting his own beliefs), the writing of this book is terrible. The characters are two-dimensional caricatures. The author couldn't be bothered to create his own dialog for the priest character, but instead continually fills his mouth with verbatim quotes from the Bible. And the dialog of the other characters....totally unbelievable is putting it mildly. There is no character development; instead the author simply tells you what the characters feel.If you're after well-written fantasy by a writer who promotes a Christian world view without shoving it down the readers' throats, look to contemporary writers like Stephen Lawhead and the old masters like CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien. This book is to Lewis, Tolkien, and JK Rowling what a Ford Fiesta is to a Rolls Royce."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recomended","review":"I thought I would really like this book, and I tried to like it. I usually read books straight through because I get so wrapped up in it. But I put this one down and just lost interest. It felt like a chore to finish it. I guess it just seemed boring. I did like the character of Kate, at least there was one female character in the book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure for Insomnia","review":"That was probably the worst fantasy book I have ever read. Nevermind the fantasy part, the whole time reading it I felt like I was being sucked into the Bible. Don't get me wrong, I totally respect Christianity and Christians, but it should at least have SOME warning on the cover for the agnostics/atheists. As for the actual storyline, the whole thing was lagging and the events that occured didn't seem to flow together, altogether much too choppy for me. Additionally, the [horrible] word arrangement and choice not only made reading it unpleasant but confused the heck out of me.All in all, this definitely will not be going on my favorite books list unless I suddenly decide to become Christian and like bad writing. And also, for the person who said Taylor was even better than Tolkien, there is no comparison. How can you even say that? Tolkien is THE master of fantasy, saying Taylor's writing exceeds his is like saying the ocean is dryer than a desert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feh. Ick. Bleah.

Anyway, you might think this is to Christian like but come on, a vicor wrote this! As for the characters, Thomas is a rebelious teen. Well if you have ever read the Goosebumps series, Thomas is the kid who no one believes. Kate is like a tag-a-long (not the girl scouts cookie.) Raphah is a very zealous man.

I can't see why the Newsweek reviews were so good because it's prose was difficult to read. The novel was written in old English using uncommon diction. I have never written a book review in my life but my disappointment with this book has compelled me to do so. If you live within the UK, you may enjoy this book. But if you live outside the UK, it will be a disappointment for you. If you want Harry Potter entertainment, this is not the book for you. GP Taylor is no JK Rowling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor character development","review":"No matter what some want you to believe, this book doesn't come close to the works of Rowling and Tolkien in readability, plot, and most of all character development. It might have worked had the author taken the time to paint a better picture of where and when it takes place, and given the characters much more of a history so we could get to know them and understand them. The book is very hard to get into because of these failings, and there's no real suspense or sense of awe or wonder in what occurs as the story unfolds. It could have been so much better, and I wonder if the author will make any attempt to correct these failings in the sequel or whether it will be worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Unprofessional","review":"While I was reading this book, I couldn't help thinking of all of the good writers out there who have had no luck getting published. Even if you narrow it down to Christian fantasy writers, I'm betting that there are a bunch that have written something better than this. Welcome to the mysterious world of book-buying.While Shadowmancer is not without potential, the utterly unprofessional writing spoiled any enjoyment I might have had. It's a mystery to me why this book took off the way it did. I have to say I'm thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"The main problem with this book is simple; the writing is terrible. The constant shifts in point of view make it confusing and jerky. The shallow characters are obviously a foil for the author's soapbox sermons.Even though the publisher pushes this book as Christian fantasy, it seems to rely on occultic sources of power for the forces of good. That's surprising, especially since the only one who claims to be a Christian in the book is the bad guy.If you want a better choice for inspirational fantasy, check out \\"Raising Dragons\\" by Bryan Davis. Much better writing, great characters, not so preachy, and a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - I threw it away","review":"On a trip overseas and in need of something to read, I picked up Shadowmancer on a whim. What a mistake. After forcing myself to read to the end I threw it away in a hotel room deliberately.This is almost certainly the worst book I have ever read. There were a few well-written paragraphs here and there (the first chapter had me hoping), but on the whole this is shockingly bad.Characters are bland and make incomprehensible decisions. A crude, unhelpful brand of Christian-like religion is bandied about in a silly sort of way. The pacing is disastrous; things randomly happen, then stop, then start again. Creatures and ideas pop up for no apparent reason and then are abandoned, never to reappear.The worst thing is that there is press fawning over it like it's the second coming of Harry Potter. That series might be weak as literature, but it's an order of magnitude more worthwhile and entertaining than this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadowmancer: Such a good title deserved a meatier story","review":"The plot was okay, the characters piqued interest, and the setting was descriptive. So... why did I give it only two stars??? Lack of development!!!!! With all of the elements of a good story, I never lost interest, but I also never got hooked. I kept thinking he was going to flesh out his characters - up until the last few scenes. I was very unhappy to have spent that much time and learned that little. It seems like our Vicar turned author had a great idea, came up with some good characters and then did not spend enough time writing. Kinda like reading someone's term paper that they had all semester to work on, but only wrote the night before.I do not recommend this book - especially to younger folks.

Books that I would suggest are Eragon [and soon Eldest book two] by Christopher Paolini.And all the Harry Potter books By J.K. Rowling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for teens and adults alike!","review":"My daughter, son and I loved this book. It is a fantasy, action story with a good message. We borrowed this book from a friend and then went out to purchase it in hard cover. We can't wait to read other books by G.P. Taylor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written Fantasy for Young Adults","review":"Mankind, with the help of God and His angels, fight the fallen angels, witches, sorcers and evil spirits (in the guise of men).Thomas and Kate (2 young adults), and Christian friends they meet, are in a race to stop a second war in heaven and the destruction of the earth. Along the way lessons are being taught about evil gaining control in a life for the purpose of destruction. I also discovered several statements in this book that were very enlightening. I thoroughly enjoyed this well written fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curiouser and Cuirouser","review":"I hated this book. When I was looking at it at the bookstore, it said that it was going to be better than Harry Potter. I had to buy it because I just did not believe it, I'm a big Harry Potter fan. So I read the book, to me it's like a copy cat of Harry Potter. Hmmmm, 2 boys and a girl, a big powerful evil guy, the only difference for me from Harry Potter in this was the author put god in it. Pretty much a waste of money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"Quite frankly, a terrible book. If you HAVE to read this book, wait a few months and borrow it from the library. The characters are flat and undeveloped. Their history is written out in their introduction instead of slowly being revealed. Their character development falls flat, even the plot itself falls flat. The book was waaaay too preachy, but I thought until I could deal with that until I came to the ending which was horrible. Quite frankly, the author should have stuck to his job instead of deciding to try something new.Like many before me, I wish I could give 0 stars but sadly Amazon doesn't allow that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and dull","review":"This book failed to get and hold my attention. It's not the religious underpinings, it's the wildly inconsistent style. The action starts quickly but it's so poorly described to become both boring and confusing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Terrible","review":"I looked at the comments on this book only after I had bought it and read it. When I bought it, I was intrigued by the story of the self-published author who became an underground hit in England, and so decided to give it a try. If only I had checked here first.Bottom line - every one and two star review is right. Further, since I note that the most recent review is over 10 months old, I wish to emphasize that this book is still, now, terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I saw Taylor being interviewed by Matt Lauer and Taylor said that Demmural makes Voldemort look like a wimp. I went right out and bought a hardcover edition only to discover that I'd been had by a hype machine that is much much better than the book. The book isn't terrible, but its not very good either and it doesn't reach the ankles of either Rowling or Tolkein. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Confusing Mess","review":"The book is a noble effort, but in the end it simply does not work. Most of the problem rests with the author who tries to cram too many characters and too much information in to, what appears to be, a book for teens. Being 38 and a avid reader, I had a rather hard time getting though it. So I just can't see many teens having the patience to read Shadowmancer to the end. Many reviewers have recommended C.S.Lewis and the Harry Potter books as alternatives. These are wise reviewers and I happily support them. I'd also like to add pretty much any thing written by Neil Gainman (who often writes of similar themes)and Eragon by Christopher Paolini. Paolini is a teen who writes like a pro. Taylor would be smart to read his work before Shadowmancer 2: Demurral's Wraith."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but it was impossible. I met GP Taylor at a book signing and he seemed really nice. There were all these rabid Shadowmancer fans there going on about how this was the most amazing book ever and so I picked up a copy. Frankly, I was very disappointed. This book is very poorly written and it's distracting from the story. The religious aspects, which start out interesting, become preachy and downright boring. I have never just abandoned a book mid-read but I was very close with this book as I was about 50% in and I just plain old didn't care what happened to the characters. To compare this book to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings is like comparing my How I Spent my Summer Vacation essay from second grade to my Honors Thesis in college. It might have been a great book with some heavy editing, but as published, it is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so shadowy.....","review":"I am struggling to finish this book. I'm a school librarian who reads lots of different kinds of books, especially Fantasy titles. Maybe I've read too many lately...with two boys, one girl who have to save the world as we know it. I just don't see the spark in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensively bad","review":"This was a truly badly written book. In addition to trite characterizations and borderline gender discrimination, the plot is dumb and the writing is terrible. Don't believe the hype and the cool cover. It's a rotten book."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I'm giving this 2 stars because (for some reason) I was interested enough to skim all the way to the end. One or two of the characters caught my attention. But as other reviewers have said, the writing was clunky and failed at being \\"poetic,\\" the action was hard to follow, and the characters were undeveloped. The thing that bothered me the most was the bludgeoning Christian message. The whole point seemed to be \\"God is good, the devil is bad.\\" That wasn't the background, or the framework, or the characters' motivation -- it was the entire plot.At least those who think there are too many \\"anti-Christian\\" books for young readers now have something to read, but the rest of us shouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadowmancer a shallow look at fantasy","review":"I was told at a conference that this was going to be a huge hit. So I ran out and read the book only to be disappointed. I'm sorry, but this book isn't worth the attention it is getting. It is a shallow attempt at writing fantasy. There is no real character development and there is so much potential that Taylor could have made a great novel and/or series out of this, but instead he left the world with a flat, boring book. Not one single character is developed enough to make the reader care.I wouldn't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"The Best of Rosemary Clooney. If you like music from this period, then the title says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction to the \\"wow!\\" aspects of Tibetan spirituality","review":"I have enjoyed this book for many years. It gives a colorful description of the more unusual aspects of Tibetan and Bon religious practice. One chapter, for example, interestingly called \\"Psychic Sports\\", describes the lung-gom-pas runners who run incredible distances while in a trance, warming oneself in the snow through psychic heat, telepathy, etc. The author was a hardy traveler and a practicing Buddhist -- and a no-nonsense observer of the world around her -- so her observations ring true. Since this book was written early in the century, it is refreshingly free of the political controversies that surround modern Tibet; instead, it describes an earlier, purer Tibetan culture, long before the Chinese tried to destroy it. I would have liked to meet this author -- she must have been a fascinating woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"This is information you will find nowhere else.

I would have exchanged or returned it, but they were all out of stock everywhere. I came out here, checked the reviews and learned that our problem was identical to the one everyone else seemed to be experiencing. We took it apart and reassembled, pressing down really hard on the lift mechanism. Ta-da! It worked, and we now have one extremely happy little boy. I say try that before you brave the return lines or place a call to Mattel's customer service center."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work!","review":"My son asked Santa for this toy and he got it, but when we put it together it wouldn't work. We tried everything, even 2 different kinds of batteries, but it still didn't work. We returned it and searched 5 stores the day after Christmas to get really excited, bring home another one, and it didn't work either!! We are not happy! I had 3 different people try to get it to work and nothing. We are now convincing my 3 year old to pick out something else. My husband calls it junk...What a waste of time, not 1, but 2 non-working Ice Mountains."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be great ... if it works!!","review":"Got it as a Christmas present for my 2 1/2 year old son. After taking an hour to put it together, I put brand-new batteries in, and it didn't work. It opened up a new package of batteries, and still, nothing. I returned it, and of course, there are none on the shelves at Target, nor anywhere else. Seeing as others have this problem of a non-working toy, I'm not sure I want to go searching for a new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronics do not work","review":"Bought this for my sons for Christmas. Very disappointed that I couldn't get it to work. Took it back and got another one. Still won't work. Not clear why. Took the back apart to see if there was an obvious loose wire. No luck! I took it apart and did the clicks and all, put it back together. Checked and replaced the batteries. If it didn't cost so much, kids could keep it and just play on it. One good thing, these reviews. At least I won't waste more time working on it, if it really won't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad...","review":"This was the one toy that my son HAD to have for Christmas. To my dismay, and his, the toy didn't function at all. I put it together, placed fresh batteries in it, turned it on, and NOTHING HAPPENED!! We took it apart, put it together per the manufacturer's instructions(again) and still, nothing. Two sets of batteries and one very disappointed child later, we gave up. Upon returning it, I was told that just about every one had been returned citing the same problems and that Target had removed them from their shelves. Shame on you Matchbox for not having a better Quality Review Department. I'm sure I'm not the only mother who had a crying child Christmas morning because this toy malfunctioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fun for the entire 10 mintues it was working","review":"My son just got this toy last night for his birthday. After patiently waiting the assembley, he was really excited to play with it. The on/off switch for the crane stop working literally after 10 mintues! It's a shame. It's so irritating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit with my 2 year old.","review":"I reluctantly purchased this item for my 23 month old son. He enjoys playing with matchbox cars, and I knew something like this would keep him preoccupied for a while -- I was right, he loves it. There is not a day that goes by that he does not play with this toy. There was not a problem putting the toy together, at first I thought I would have problems get the loader to work -- but I think it was just out of sync. My son is ruff on toys and I dread the day the loader stops working, as stated in the other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I spent an hour putting the stickers on it and putting it together, only to find that it does not work.

My son received this last year for Christmas and I think it is the only day it actually work. Besides the crane breaking many of the other pieces kept falling off, the cars would get stuck under one of the ramps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought two different ones with the same results!","review":"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. It didn't even make it to the new year before the crane broke and would not move anymore. He was devistated because this was the only toy he really wanted. So I bought a second Ice Mountain on line because all of the stores were sold out. With in a week, the same thing happened. The crane quit working! This toy is a great idea, but needs work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"I found this very easy to put together - but I did make sure I did it carefully after reading reviews.The design is poor. The crane can turn so that it is over the car lift. It'll keep the lift from going up which wears out the gears QUICKLY. This happened to ours the 2nd day we had it.My son loves it and still plays with it, but the fact I spent $30 on a toy that broke after 2 days irks me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"My four year old wanted this toy so badly last year that we bought it for him. After the third Ice Mountian we finally got our money back. The lift would not properly lift the cars to the top of the Ice Mountian.When I called Mattel, their response was that I had not put it together correctly. As I had assembled three of them, I was quite aware how to assemble Ice Mountian. Mattel's constantly telling me that I had mis-assembled their product was extremely frustrating and insulting.The concept was cool but the design is flawed. I have found that items bearing the Hot Wheels name versus the Matchbox name work, are better constructed and more durable. I had the same issue with a car wash two years prior to the Ice Mountain purchase.My son, now five, still wishes he could have an Ice Mountain, however he knows they are \\"junk\\" as we call it at home.Beware before you buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY NICE","review":"Trust me if your are looking for something fun to do with your cars this is it. It doesn't use a lot of electricity, the batteries will last about a half a year if played with about an our a day every couple of days. It works with many diffrent types of cars. It is worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Sons likes the toy but it broke after 5 days","review":"We bought our son the ice mountain for his third birthday. He really likes the toy but the crane mechanicism broke after 5 days of use. Also, if the track does not turn, make sure that it is pushed in all the way in the base. He stills plays with it even though it is broken, but I agree it is very disappointing to buy a toy and have it broken within the first few days.When I was a boy, I grew up with Matchbox and Hot Wheels. I loved them. I was hoping to start my son on them, but now I will have to reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work","review":"I just want to echo what others have said. Check to see if the electronics work before you put it together. We put ours together for my son and he was very disappointed when we turned it on and nothing happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this","review":"The picture makes it look much cooler than the toy really is. My son is an avid matchbox car collector and I thought he would enjoy this set, so we purchased it for him for Christmas.The assembly is long and after it's put together, it easily falls apart. I thought that the controls in the picture actually controlled the crane, but it doesn't. The lift portion on the left of the toy never worked. The car always gets jammed in it and it never makes it up there. The concept was awesome, but the quality of it is poor. Don't waste your time or room space with it.We paid $20 for it and it's still not worth the money. Our son played with it for about 2 days and now it sits in pieces in his room. I'm about to toss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I Get It - Not Worth Buying","review":"Now I get all the negative comments regarding this toy. At first a number of them seemed petty, but now I get it. Crane Noise - it's so loud that I'm unable to hear the tv, my husband talk, or another person on the phone over it. Crane Design - it sucks & has never worked right. Does my 2 yr old boy realize that it doesn't work? No, but it sure would be more fun for him if it did. Durability - terribly annoying given that 6 different things keep breaking off every 1-3 minutes & my 2 yr old can't fix them himself but is bugged by the sudden change in his toy. So what happens? I have to stop what I'm doing every 5 minutes to keep fixing the basic parts or convince him (not so well) to move on. Assembly - really sucks. My husband & I together sat for 2 hours and had great difficulty putting it together. Looking for a bettter purchase? Try the Fast Lane Garage - my son LOVES it and plays for 20 minutes at a time numerous times a day with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"My 3 year old son wanted this toy for Christmas last year. After receiving it, he played with it for all of two days before it broke. I knew buying for a 3 year old was a risk but wanted to get this for him and hoped it was more durable. The ice part broke apart and got to where it wouldn't stay together at all without falling through on its own. The arm stopped lifting and needless to stay there was more than one disappointed person in our home that Christmas. I wouldn't buy it if I could get by with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun for a short time but very poorly built","review":"My 4-year-old was very excited to get this toy for Christmas and loved playing with it. Unfortunately, however, something was falling off of it every five minutes. After about 3 or 4 days, it died. I returned it to the local Target store and was given a refund. I intended to buy another one to replace it, but I could not find one locally or even on line except via auction for about three times the listed price. I felt really bad and was expecting quite a fuss from my son, but he has not missed it and has not asked about it even one time. I guess it wasn't that special after all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR ELECTRONIC QULAITY","review":"My 3 1/2 year old son received this for Christmas because this is what he wanted. He was very excited about and loved playing with it but the sound effects did not work at all. It took my husband a very long time to put it together and then to find out after all that time that the sounds don't work. After reading the other reviews about this I will not get another one. It is too much money to waste my time if another one doesn't work. I will replace it with a much better quality toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try this-","review":"We thought we had one of the Ice Mountains that didn't work also, until we read these reviews and called Mattel ourselves to see exactly what to do to get this thing to work. The rep told us that the instructions weren't very good and it would have saved a lot of people a lot of grief if they would have included this in them: Next to the gear where the ice goes in at, there is a little white button, and on the bottom of the round ice part there is a little round peg sticking out. That part has to be pressed down last in order to depress the white button and get it to run. That button HAS to be pressed down in order to get power from it. We tried this, and it worked! My son loves playing with it now, and daddy is a hero for fixing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not call it Christian themed, as I thought it would be...","review":"This book seems to advocate a mix mash of different belief systems. When I saw a quote from the Koran cited as a piece of wisdom, I threw the book out. The 1st Law of Logic is that 2 contradictory statements cannot both be true. It cannot both be true, as the Bible says, that Yeshua, aka, Jesus, was the Son of YHWH, aka God, and also be true that, as the Koran says, He had no son. (Well, it can be true if Allah isn't YHWH.) The Koran advocates the murder of Christians & Jews. That isn't exactly consistent with Scriptures and Christianity either.I really feel that I not only had my money wasted, but that my faith had been insulted also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great, great!","review":"This is a truly inspirational book of stories of heavenly encounters, guardian angels, and the power of God.

While my goal is to write for travel magazines, I certainly need to have a good understanding of web writing, more knowledge about creating and keeping up a web page (especially for a future publication), and some idea of how my writing must look on that page when it's published.I found this book to be quite useful for online journalism practices, and I appreciated the many real world applications that the author used. The author, Dr. Richard Craig, has much experience in journalism himself, and he enforces the common practices of good writing that all journalism students should keep in mind. He is very thorough, but go on and stick with him until the end of this book.Dr. Craig's book may be outdated in a matter of years or less, but overall, this is still a very helpful and timely textbook.

What amazing art. Everyone should flip through this if they get the chance. They shouldn't however read it. Mark Waid, who I really enjoy, writes a meaningless story in which he plays with the ideas of the afterlife in the DC Universe. However, everyone reading this knows there is nothing at stake if they can follow the complex and drivel filled plot. It seems like Waid just wanted to tell what certain heroes believe in, which doesn't have any effect on anything. Like I said, the art by Bryan Hitch is drop dead gorgeous especially on the oversized pages. So, a 5 for art and -1 for story averages out to a overall grade of 2. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive.","review":"I have to take issue with those who would decry this book. I think it's truely a noteworthy addition to the JLA of today. I, for one, LOVE the depth and imagination that is going into today's comics. The Watchtower Era JLA is the pinicle of said depth. Just when I think they've pushed the philosophical and metaphysical boundaries to their limit, they push harder. This book, while not perfict (It doesn't quite fit on my shelf, for one) is a great example of the writing that has made this title what it is today. Much like The Matrix raised my expectations of special effects and Sci-Fi, so does today's JLA raise my expectations of a good comic book. Heaven's Ladder is a great book, with a lot of depth, good art work, and wonderful character interactions. This book really leaves you feeling good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the size!","review":"The product is ok! although on a warm sunny day you will cook inside it, it does protect you and look cool at the same time.

Naturally, while walking around the knee armor is a bit awkward, but as one salesman explained to me, the armor is supposed to ride low while walking and should shift into place when you sit down to ride. If you do take the knee armor out at your destination, they feel just like regular blue jeans (can't really even tell the hip armor is there). I can see where they may get a bit warm in the summer, but I'd rather sweat than bleed, as someone else once said. Very nice quality, and feels very durable. Can't tell you how well they protect in a crash, and, Lord willing, I never will :-).

It folds ever so conveniently into such a small bundle of short tubes that can be tucked into a large pocket or purse. It snaps itself together in a flash with what seems like a large bungee type cord which runs through the entire length (you simply just pull it a little). It is quite rigid when inline and is very comfortable to grip. My husband has had this for 2 years and only uses it on occasion so I cannot say how well it would hold up to daily use - my only concern would be how long the elastic bungee type thing can be twisted and bent before fraying - but so far have not found out. Perhaps someone else will post on continuous use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive Slasher","review":"Hellbent was the first completely gay themed Slasher film I have ever seen and I really liked it.The guys were hot,the story was intriguing and the effects were done well for the budget that was afforded it.A mysterious masked man is stalking three gay friends as they head out for a night of fun and mischief on Halloween night.The masked man has an amazing body just like most of the other gay men that are congregated at this Mardi Gras like party so he doesn't seem like a threat because he blends in but his actions become more and more bizarre and then the fun and slashing really begins,although the beginning did start out with a really good decapitation scene as the body count racked up two before the movie really got started..'gotta love that,as a slasher fan'.I found it to be very progressive and I hope to see more movies that have gay story lines that don't just involve Aids,sex and tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Micheal Myers","review":"I at first was expecting something low budget and horrible quality.

Whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink","review":"This movie was down right horrible. No suspense whatsoever. It has absolutely no plot. I'm guessing the killer had something against the main character since he stuffed all the heads in his apartment. Did he have something against his dad? His dad was a cop. Did his dad arrest him once or something? Or were the details of his dad just thrown in there for no reason? Or is the killer just a homophobe? The ending of this movie is just insulting. It actually made me mad that I sat through it.I'll give it 2 stars for the nasty eyeball scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive surprise!","review":"I was positively surprised to see this movie, it is well made, exciting and with charming characters, and can be easily compared to \\"Scream\\" or \\"I know what you did last summer\\" in quality and drive.This is however pure slash, and no psychology. They should have added 10 minutes to the movie, to give the viewer a killer profile. The movie ended with me wondering who the killer is under his mask and what his motives are to kill the gay guys (and only the masculine ones).However, apart from the entertaining factor, this movie gives the gay community reason to rejoice. It shows that the gay now feel so confident in themselves as gay, that they can watch a movie about gay men getting slashed without letting it hit their self esteem or make them feel discriminated. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who cares why?","review":"I really enjoyed this movie for what it was: a Horror Movie. The fact that the main chracters are gay is secondary. What I liked most about this film is it takes a few minutes to set up the characters then it just takes off and doesn't stop until the end.

They're very strong & won't bend. My daughter uses two on her bedroom door. The notches are great! I hang clothes that wrinkle easily on them. The notches on the hook give the space needed to prevent them from wrinkling, and the knob on the end is handy for hanging jackets, bathrobes, etc. We can completely close our doors with the hooks on them...even my sliding closet door works with the hook on it.Great product for small spaces, and you don't have to put any holes in your doors for the hooks.

But is there a way out, especially after Dianne's parents die in a suspicious auto crash. ANGEL FACE, like most of Otto Preminger's films, is a very well done entertainment and could keep you guessing right up to the rather abrupt ending.A well done Parmount Pictures film with all the accesories you could expect from a major studio release in the early fifties.

Wished I lived in Pico Mundo!","review":"This was my first Koontz book I have read. There are writers that write for a movie (at least hopes for a movie), and there are writers that write for the reader. Mr. Koontz, in my opinion writes for the reader. The way he gives details about the characters Odd has contact with, it gives the book more meaning then just a cookie-cutter formula some writers follow.My only wish was that Little Ozzie had a bigger part in the book; he sounded he could have really made a contribution to the story then just a mere friend of Odd Thomas. I thought Little Ozzie was a hoot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd Thomas Oh sooo Good","review":"If you even like Dean Koontz a little you will simply love this book!

Never did I once wonder how many pages I had left, or become uninterested. I did get a little too creeped out in the last third of the book, but overall it was a taut page-turner. And, on top of that, it was bittersweet. The protagonist, Odd Thomas, was compelling and charming; his love, Stormy, was his perfect, lovely foil and together they were magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Odd Thomas is one of those rare books that artfully marry suspense, humor and writing as cripse as a new morning into one perfect package. Told in a pleasant first-person voice, the story unfolds to reveal a remarkably human character who can see the dead, but not talk to them. There is no pretense here; Odd tries to stop tragedy before it happens yet makes the mistakes that anyone else in his place might do. His tender relationship with his girlfriend, Stormy, and the harrowed and strained moments with his parents are perhaps some of the best moments modern novels can provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to Know Odd Thomas","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised to realize Odd Thomas was not like most of the books I have previously read by Dean Koontz. I enjoy this author's works so much because he is a true master at creating characters that I, as the reader, am able to assume identity with. How refreshing to find that I, a 45-year-old female, could identify with a 20-year-old male.I can't wait to find out how Odd Thomas gets through life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"Some Koontz books are super, some stink - this one is fairly good. A new idea and approach plus the book really races off to a quick start.If you love Koontz, you will like or love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a poor dialogue writer!","review":"This was my second book by Mr Koontz (one more and maybe a final chance after the horrible, unspeakably bad The Taking) and if this is one of his best, it will be my last foray into his world. Everyone is raving about this book; they may have a point; but the dialogues in this book are the worst I have come across for years. I have found one of the weakest spots of Mr. Koontz: He simply cannot make people talk The ones between two lovers are particularly bad and laughable. Come on people who on earth talks like this in real world? The plot is somehow redeeming (actually better than Taking which had no plot in the first place) but if you find the characters talking in a gibberish way as if they are maronettes this ruins everything.Mr. Koontz, my humble advice: Go read Stephen King or John Le Carre and see how characters talk in fictional world-like real. Any merit your story may have is buckled under your sophomoric mouthings.Did I say the dialogues were terrible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I really like Dean Koontz but this story really disappointed me. I was really waiting for the mysterious relationship with Anabella to fully reveal itself. The story a bruptly ends and you are left guessing. This could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I think that I found this book disappointing for two reasons. First, I have read several of Mr. Koontz's other books, and was disconcerted while discovering that this book is nothing like any of them. Having enjoyed his other novels a great deal, I was in the mood for more of the same. I respect that an author broadening his horizons is generally a good thing, but only as long as his work remains original. Which brings me to the second reason I probably found this book disappointing. A friend of mine loaned me Stephen King's Bag of Bones a few weeks back. To someone familiar with this King novel, Odd Thomas could be uncannily described as a Bag of Bones, Jr. While I also enjoyed Bag of Bones, I wasn't in the mood to read its adolescent clone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"The first chapter of this book put me over the edge. I couldn't take it anymore. This is the first book I've read by Koontz, so I am hopeful that all of his books aren't like this. The first chapter introduces at least 25-30 characters, none of which I was particularly interested in. Obviously there are many readers who like this \\"flakey\\" style of writing. I just want to read a story. Guess I'll stick to James Lee Burke, Stuart Woods, James Patterson, etc. This book is to involved for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz","review":"A wonderful book with a very special young man named Odd Thomas who can see the dead and other strange things. The author must be a very nice man or he couldn't have invented such an awesome human being!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good first person 'modern gothic fantasy'","review":"yeah, Odd writes like a guy trying to put what happened down on paper, and Koontz well... what can i say other than i've read some other stuff by Mr K and this one's pretty doggone above par for him. but don't forget what Odd writes in the first chapter \\"When at first I proved unable to keep the tone light, Ozzie suggested that I be an unreliable narrator.\\" BEWARE! unreliable narrators tend to jump around like frogs on a griddle. then they all of a sudden SMACK you in the face with a month dead mackerel the size of a (pun intended) Mack Truck. so watch out folks, if you get pulled into this novel... pitfalls will ensue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage and Humor","review":"\\"Odd Thoma\\" by Dean Koontz is a book that held me enthralled, eager to read on and see what happened next. Odd can see dead people, and he has \\"psychic magnitism,\\" which pulls him in the direction of finding a culprit, regardless of the risks to himself. The story is suspenseful as well as a love story with a very touching ending. The one flaw that I found was as follows: Odd is a high school graduate who works as a short order cook. People think he's not very bright, and he's just managed to squirm his way through high school. His one talent is writing, but for a young man of his description, he wouldn't be writing as well as . . . well, Dean Koontz! Here's an example of what Odd writes: \\"Watching from the edge of the barrel-tile roof, a crow cracked its orange beak and shrieked, as though it suspected that I had come to poach whetever crispy beetles and other sparse fare it fed upon in this parched territory.\\" Does that sound like it was written by the guy described above?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read but still thrilling","review":"This is a great book if you're looking for something simple but still captivating. There were times where I skimmed a few paragraphs but it's definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Characterization","review":"Odd Thomas is an exploration in fascinating character development. Odd is certainly one of the most unique characters in fiction. Koontz does a great job in weaving a world that is outlandish and realistic at the same time. Every time I set the book down, I found myself going back for more.This is a great read and worth investing in."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Dean Koontz book for me..","review":"Overall, I feel that this book was pretty good. Dean Koontz's writing seemed to be a little twisty (with so many descriptions of things and sarcasm) that I didnt pay full attention to a lot of the writing. It had me restless with the question of \\"who the bad guys were\\" throughout most of the book. The writing is great though. If I had not been so worried about who was the bad guy, i would have paid more attention to the rest of the book..I really liked the way he did the ending though. Sad but fitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot to Like in \\"Odd\\"","review":"Dean Koontz has come up w/some memorable heroes in his books, but Odd Thomas is one of the best. From Chris Snow, who could not go out in daylight, to the talking dog in \\"Watchers\\", Mr. Koontz really gets into the minds of his characters.I was hooked on this book from the first page and read it all in a day. If you like horror, suspense and mystery type books, I think you'll really enjoy \\"Odd Thomas\\". Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovable character, a likeable story","review":"It's hard not to like \\"Odd Thomas\\", by that I mean the character himself. He's a sensitive, self-depreciating twenty-year-old who just happens to be able to see and communicate with the dead. Odd's unusual \\"gift\\" has left him with a rather heavy burden to bear; the ability to commune with victims of crime (and hopefully find their killers), as well as a knowledge of future tragedies. This foreshadowing of danger is made clear to Odd by his ability to see \\"bodachs\\", malevalent, spirit-like creatures who thrive on impending doom. Odd's quest to discover and avert an unknown disaster is well written and interesting, but I did feel the ending was somewhat rushed and underdeveloped. Odd is such a unique and likeable character however, that perhaps we could look forward to his appearance in a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd Thomas","review":"I was disappointed in this book by Dean Koontz. It lost my interest soon after about three chapters.Koontz is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too odd","review":"It started out well but turned odder and odder with the inadequately supported events. No sex for 2 twenty year olds after 4 years. Who shot the sheriff. What is with the bodach and what purpose did they serve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better books","review":"I had high hope for this book, but they were crushed quite quickly after reading about 10 chapters.All of it was mush and boring. I mean if you are going to give someone the ability to see demons, at least make it more exciting.Normally Koontz doesn't disappoint me, but this was the only book that I could not read all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the year's best!","review":"Dean Koontz is both prolific and verbose, regularly turning out a couple 500-page suspense novels every year. Some of them are terrific (like his first book of 2003, The Face), some are more ordinary. Odd Thomas, fortunately, is solidly in the former category.If you've seen the film The Sixth Sense, you'll be familiar with the setup for the plot of Odd Thomas. Yes, the oddly-named Odd sees dead people. He also sees evil spirits, the presence of which alerts him to a terrible event that is going to happen.Although it starts out in familiar fashion, Koontz is a gifted enough storyteller that he soon makes you forget the movie and just enjoy his story. Taut and suspenseful, Odd Thomas is the type of book that Koontz made his bones with and it will be very welcome to fans new and old alike.Odd Thomas is one of the best books of the year, a moving and gripping story that is powerful enough to take your breath away. Don't miss this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"One of the best books I have read in some time. Great characters, humor, anticipation. I wish it had been longer because I was so involved with the story line and characters. Unexpected ending - I should have seen coming - but I didn't which is why I found it unsettling. GREAT READ! I hope Koontz's next book is as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Koontz at his best!","review":"When I first heard about this book I was skeptical. I mean, come on, the guy sees dead people. It's been done, only the first time it was called The Sixth Sense. But I read the first chapter before passing judgment, and I was hooked. The similarities dwindled away almost immediately, as Odd Thomas, a humble fry cook, starts to immediately grow on you.Here's what I look for in a book: great characters that I can care about, suspense, drama, possibly love, and if I'm really lucky well written prose and dialogue. Unfortunately, finding books that posses any of these qualities is becoming more and more rare with each passing day. Rarer still is finding a book that possess ALL of those qualities. Odd Thomas is one of those rare finds.Whether you're a long-time Koontz fan, or considering reading him for the first time, this is definitely a Must Have book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd Thomas, the odd, AWESOME one.","review":"Odd Thomas is one of the funniest, most interesting and loveable characters I have ever read. After reading this series (well, I still have to read Odd Hours), I wouldn't mind reading every Koontz book I can get my hands on. This book just keeps you entranced. I read Odd Thomas over the course of a few days all while visiting some friends and being very active. You will not want to put this book down. The relationship Stormy and Odd have could make anyone jealous. You would think that seeing dead people has been overdone, but Koontz handles the plotline with an ease of genius. Once you read this book, you will definitely want to read more about this awesome guy, Odd Thomas. I, like others, found myself laughing out loud numerous times while reading this. Excellent read. I feel it'll be a while until a character beats out Odd Thomas as my favorite book character. Get this book. You will absolutely be delighted with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Book","review":"I listened to the audio book and the actor did a great job. Odd Thomas starts off intriging and amusing. As the story progresses , I have a difficult time maintaining interest in the story. I wish Koone's character Odd Thomas had more encounters with the dead.Odd Thomas is a good character, but I didn't care for the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough, already!","review":"I've read several books by Koontz now and this is the worst. It takes so long for him to get to the point that everything is anticlimatic. I don't need to know the background of every minor, passing character. I don't care about all the sappy, stupid, overly cute banter of the characters - it just goes on and on and on.........This book could have been 1/2 the length and been better for it.The Frankenstein series is great, but this - PULEEZ! I also read Relentless and it's about as bad - only with even more \\"cute\\" whimsical banter that makes me want to vomit.I read this book in 2 days - the first day I put up with it, the second I skimmed as fast as I could to the end. It's an interesting premise, but riuned by all the detail and irrelevant non-action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book .","review":"starting thethird book now. so far a really good series. more action oriented than many of his works and a lot more intimate. not as good as intensity but that washis bst in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I saw this book recommended so decided to order. I liked it and ordered the next one. It's not creepy (which I was afraid of) and makes for a good read. Supernatural but not skin-crawling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Be prepared to sleep with your light on! Awesome book!","review":"This book was so great and creepy! Wow, I still get chills when I think about it! I slept with my bedroom light on for two nights after I read this, I kept thinking those darn shades were hanging around my bed! Just wait, you will understand after you read this! You will not be disappointed! Just take a deep breath before you open the book and be prepared to be scared out of your skin!

Enjoyable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read--Very entertaining, makes you care.","review":"I just finished this book last night, and I couldn't stop thinking about it, even as I slept. It was a very interesting story, I enjoyed imagining the world Koontz created, and he made me care about the characters. I think sometimes Koontz overuses description and creative flourish, and alliteration (it does seem like padding or experimentation), but if you can overlook that you will enjoy a great read. There were a couple of things in the plot that weren't developed/explained, but again, the book is worth reading even so.In my opinion, Koontz's best books are \\"Watchers\\", \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart\\", and \\"The Face\\". I also thoroughly enjoyed \\"Odd Thomas\\", \\"The Bad Place\\", \\"Tick Tock\\", \\"Demon Seed\\", and \\"Lightning\\". I'm probably leaving some other favorites out, but there's a good reading list for anyone interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really LIke Odd Thomas.","review":"Odd Thomas is a great character. Very easily likable. Easy to sympathize with and a joy to walk beside in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Koontz books.","review":"Odd Thomas has joined Lightning and Intensity as one of my favorite Koontz books.Thomas is a young man sadled with a wonderful gift...or is it a curse? The ability to see the dead comes with the responsibility of providing their tortured souls with justice.The story follows Thomas' investigation into the identity of an evil man known as Fungus Man. In addition to his ability to see ghosts, Thomas also sees \\"bodachs\\", paranormal parasites of evil that frequent locations where horrible acts are, or will be, committed. Fungus Man is followed by many of these bodachs, so Thomas is compelled to find out the identity and plans of the maniacal stranger.I thought the ending had a great twist. This is a fine example of story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd Thomas","review":"This book a wonderful book to read if you're into suspense novels. This definitely a 5 star novel.

I can't wait for \\"Brother Odd\\" to come out. I've been reading his novels all summer but \\"Odd Thomas\\" is still my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I bought this book because of the raves by Publisher's Weekly.I gave up after the first chapter, thought this was more ofa teenager's read. Koontz has a distinct way of going up anddown in his writing efforts, which leads me to believe thatsome of his books are written to fill out a contract."},{"rating":"1","title":"what can i say?","review":"Dean Koontz is an excellent writer and he is by far my favorite. i loved and cherished each book that he wrote...........except this one. This book made me think his recent writings were pure crap so i decided to stay away from them. but i ran out of books to read so i started reading his recent stuff and found it was very good. its just this book is confusing, the plot was confusing, and what the hell is a bodach? If you read all of dean koontz's oldies and didn't read his recent stuff yet don't pick this one up. i suggest velocity or life expectancy. I just don't see how everyone loves odd thomas. and for the icing on the cake..........a sequel called \\"forever odd\\". so im suggesting not to pick that up when that comes out also. MCL"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever","review":"Worst written book ever structuraly and plot wise. The author has the worst writing technique ever. He talks about something them moves on then goes back and you easily get lost. Action in the book doesn't make sense. As if the writing structure wasn't enough torture to go through, the plot also wreaks. The killers turn out to be police officers, people you barely were introduced to in the book. That isn't a twist!!! A twist is where you are introduced to someone in a book in depth and you least suspect them of being murderers. In this book, the killers are \\"Suddenly\\" police officers which we bareley know. Total waste of time and money. Worst book ever. It deserves a negative rating. People who gave it 5's obviously are easily amused or the badly written structure of the book forced them to day dream while reading and they thought their day dream was the book. They need to wake up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't like Dean Koontz","review":"I am not a Dean Koontz fan at all, but because of the large number of people who are, I occasionally give one of his books a shot. Most of the time I am simply reminded as to why I am not a Dean Koontz fan. Odd Thomas, however, was a massive exception to this rule. It just seemed to have all the ingredients and to fit them together so well: an interesting premise, an endearing main character, and witty story-telling. Even if you're not a fan of the author, or even the genre, this book is well worth taking a chance on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd-tastic!","review":"Odd Thomas is more than a character in a book. He is now a friend of mine. Never before have I been hooked after the first page of a novel, but Mr. Koontz has managed just that with this brilliantly inspiring, yet delightfully spooky offering.If you are a fan of \\"Medium\\", \\"Ghost Whisperer\\", or any of those ghost mystery shows on the Discovery Channel you will delight in the adventures of Odd Thomas! If you have ever been in love, or if you are lucky enough to still be with the one person that made your heart flutter, Odd Thomas will keep you turning pages.Simply put, \\"Odd Thomas\\" is the single most charming, romantic, witty, psychic 'nerd' to ever perch upon a bookshelf.Read it now, not tomorrow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dean, you make reading divine","review":"I never cease to be amazed at the humor I find in dean koontz's books. Inspite of the frightful encounters these characters get themselves into; I find myself laughing with delight at absolutely marvelous thoughts of elvis(failing to move on), morality opinions(regarding the phone booth), normally mundane shopping experiences(ice cream and tires), and such. Keep up the good work. I can hardly wait for another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairly well written piece of genre fiction","review":"This book was selected for my book discussion group, and that's why I read it. It is an easy and quick read, but very much of the supernatural/thriller genre. There is no shortage of cliches, and virtually no literary merit or significance beyond pure entertainment. Just about all of the characters are either really good or horrendously evil, no semblance of a real human being to be found. A classic airplane book and suitable if you merely want to pass the time, without gaining anything from the time spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful Writer With A Very Likable Character","review":"Few writers can master a language & narrate a story as well as Mr. Koontz.His writing & descriptions throughout the book have the reader really understand how odd Mr. Thomas & his life really are. It's all done in a style that puts a smile on the readers face page after page.The book seems purposely written with sequels in mind. The descriptions set the stage to understanding characters in future books. Unfortunately this also bogs the middle story down quite a bit.The beginning starts off very well. The last 20 pages, or so, are superb; the ending sad & bittersweet.The writer's style & mastery cannot completely save the very slow middle story. Worth the read? Most definitely"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great character from Koontz","review":"Odd Thomas is a uniquely drawn character that answers the question: what would happen if the kid from Sixth Sense grew up? While not the same character, the premise is the same and the manner in which these books mine this story concept is well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not run of the mill - different - good.","review":"I'm an off and on again fan of Mr. Koontz's writing, and I really enjoyed reading this book. The story was good, the characters well develoved, believable, and interesting, and, honestly, I'm ready for the next installment. The story is about the supernatural, it's about horror, mystery, and love, too - with some fun sprinkled in. So many tell the story in their reviews which, I think, diminishes the readers experience - so, I don't. However, I think there's something between the pages of this book for most to enjoy, and once you think you know what's going on you find that you really don't. Bravo Mr. Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy reading the Odd Thomas series","review":"I've read the first four of the Odd Thomas novels before, and am reading them all again in preparation of his new books in the series. I enjoy the series. They are well written and keep you reading. I like most of Dean Koontz's novels, and tend to read all of his stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd Book","review":"What's odd about Odd Thomas is that he can see dead people. He must use his sixth sense to stop something evil from happening in less than 48 hours. What, he doesn't know, but he sees bodachs-shadowy creatures who always appear before a carnage-everywhere in the sleepy town of Pico Mundo. All their attention seems to center around a new person in town: Bob Robertson. Odd, with the aid of his endearing girlfriend Stormy, rushes to solve the mystery before the ill-fated, violent catastrophe occurs. Koontz's writing is nauseating at times. The persistent and irrelevant streams of consciousness about Odd's Granny and other minutia detract from the story. Odd's character also flirts from one place to the next for no apparent reason other than to introduce the reader to Odd's mother or father. The premise had potential, but it doesn't live up to expectations. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Odd","review":"Joints slowly pulls you in, gets you wrapped in his world, and then throws a sweeping breaking ball right across your eyes leaving you wondering where you\`'ve been and what will come next.

Odd Thomas was one of the best characters I'd ever read about. But a warning, I thought the ending was depressing and sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate Hate Hate This Book","review":"Man do I hate Odd Thomas...This is a winding ride of a read that takes you through highs and lows ins and outs only to drop you to a depressingly dead thud in the end. All that work and expectation to be left deadly dissapointed in the end is not worth the read or your precious time on this earth. I know for certain I would have dropped this book as quickly as a rattle snake if I could have for saw it's downer of an ending. This book definitely falls in the DO NOT BOTHER AND DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME category of books I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes every second seem like an hour","review":"This was my first time reading Koontz. I must say, it was a huge disappointment. The book starts off quite promising, but then quickly leads you through every mundane detail of every scene. I assume the writer had enough material for a short story, but fiscal considerations prompted him to create a 10 hour cd. (I heard it on a CD instead of reading a book). The characters are developed and Koontz can definitely write, but like Stephen King, he is verbose. I have read \\"The Stand\\" and \\"It\\" and both books are over a 1000 pages, so I am not averse to reading if their is a story. If your book is 70% description of minutia and 30% plot, then you have failed as a writer, and are only selling books because at one time, you wrote something good. This was such a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-o-r-ing","review":"Why do I continue to read Dean Koontz books? Probably because I am always sucked in by the great reviews and keep hoping that this time they are true -- really-- who can possibly give this book 5 stars? Found this the same as all his other books----- no plot, boring, predictable, unimaginative (shades of the dementors and Lost-- aren't we tired of black shadowy beings flitting about?) - Waste of time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is someone writing for Dean?","review":"Wow.. this is the second book by Koontz that I've been disappointed in. What happened to the guy who wrote Intensity? I bought \\"The Face\\" and thought.. is he having someone else write for him? Where's his sense of humor? Although there is a sense of humor in this book and The Face, it sure doesn't sound like Dean Koontz's brand.This story has been done. The \\"I see dead people\\" thing and \\"I help them to let go of this world\\". I think next time I buy one of his books, I'll read through the first few pages to see what \\"Dean\\" I'm getting. And whoever is writing for Dean.. STOP IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!","review":"My husband and I both wasted our time reading this and I have read a lot of Koontz's books and this is the WORST!! I wonder if he was paid per word for this book! Most of the book was detailed useless information about nothing over and over. The part about the black room was interesting and Koontz spent lots of time and detail on it and then never really mentioned it again as if he just decided to change the story, but leave that part in to take up room to meet his word-count quota. The actual story was so predictable! Save your time and read something(anything) else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad","review":"Started out with lots of promise (best story line and writing he's done sense Fear Nothing and Seize the Night barring the excessive surf lingo etc.) but died around page 190. Koontz makes Odd and his girlfriend Stormy (dumb name) into two perfect little angels -- when playing cards Odd can feel, 9 times outta 10, when his hand is stronger than those of other players and when it is not, so he wouldn't DARE go to Vegas and gamble to make money (what Odd calls \\"harvesting cash\\"), \\"it'd be the same as stealing\\" , \\"I don't need money\\", \\"I don't ever want to go anywhere\\" \\"I just want to be a fry cook or a tire salesman for the rest of my life\\" GET REAL!After that the story, the characters and writing dies. Becomes juvenile. Too much padding with Odd's endless ruminations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This is the author of such terrific books as \\"Watchers\\" and \\"Intensity\\", isn't it? My question to you Mr. Koontz is: \\"What happened?\\" Granted, this author is a genius with flowery, descriptive prose, but that seems to be the only thing he is doing in this book. I kept asking: Can we get on with the story here? The reader has to wait forever to get to the point.It is unfortunate that such a wonderful writer seems to be losing his touch. (Maybe a new editor is needed to light a fire under him?) The characters run the gamut from being annoying (Odd Thomas himself) to downright hateful (Odd Thomas' mother).The story itself is plodding at first and then turns very unpleasant. Unfortunately, it never redeems itself.I don't like to be so negative, but this is not an enjoyable story. Hopefully, Mr. Koontz will be a little less mean-spirited with his characters and a little more plot driven in his future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd but not very interesting","review":"I've read most of Dean's novels, and his newer releases seem to be waning. \\"Odd Thomas\\" is no exception; the most significant shortcoming about this novel is that it never seemed to go anywhere. And, I didn't find the characters as real/descriptive as in his other novels.Also, I didn't know I'd be reading the pseudo-script to the film \\"The Sixth Sense\\" (Bruce Willis). I enjoyed the movie but wasn't interested in reading a novel about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a big Koontz fan but disliked this book...","review":"I am a big fan of Koontz's writing, having read many of his books by now - The Husband, Velocity, Life Expectancy, One Door Away from Heaven, Intensity, etc. His books usually grip me in suspense and have unpredictable twists and turns that keep the reader interested. I listened to this audio book and it was horrible. It goes on and on about the most random things with such detail that it's boring and made my mind drift. I did not even get interested in the story until the 33rd chapter. Then, it drops off again at about chapter 47. The ending is so non-climactic it's sad. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the handicapped","review":"My husband is blind in one eye, and this was one of my Christmas gifts to him.

The book does its best to keep you off guard, and to foil your expectations, which is the sign of a good mystery. I have mixed feelings about ghost stories, and avoid authors who take the paranormal too seriously. Koonts does a great job of acknowledging reader's skepticism, while making the otherworldly more believable. The use of humor, which he attributes to one character's advice to \\"keep it light\\", works extremely well, with (to my mind) the exception of random inclusions of the ghost of Elvis.Overall, the book kept me involved, touched my heart and mind, which is more than I expect from a mystery. I would offer one serious caveat. With the recent events in Newtown, CT, there may be readers who want to avoid this book for now. The violent denouement may strike a bit too close to reality. It is sympathetically handled and moving, not exploitative, but more real than the author may have intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book not to be missed.","review":"This was my first time reading a Dean Koontz book, and I didn't know what to expect...certainly not the beauty and the tragedy within the pages of this book.

If you're looking for pure escapist entertainment, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start to the series","review":"Odd Thomas stars in several books that highlight his ability to communicate with the dead and to solve many horrible murders, many linked with the mystical and occult. In his first book of the series, Koontz explains the reasons for Odd's quirky behaviors and sets up how Odd will move through his adventures for the rest of the series. You don't have to read it first to enjoy the other novels but many things that Odd does in the other books are referenced back to this one. Also his connection to Stormy Llewellyn and what happens to her will allow anyone who read the later novels first to understand Odd's feelings and inner dialogues and where he hopes to end up eventually. I've enjoyed the series so far and I'm looking forward to reading Koontz's latest Odd Thomas novel \\" Odd Apocalypse.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"One of the best books I've read in a very long time. Odd Thomas is such a loveable character. I couldn't put it down! As with so many of Mr. Koontz books I can see this made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first page and a half of this book is rediculous","review":"I'm not sure who I blame more for the shabby, poorly-thought opening paragraphs, Koontz or his editor. There is a serious blunder in the opening of this book. It begins with Odd wondering why anyone would want to read about his exploits. ??? He sees dead people, bodachs, travels in time ... and wonders why anyone would be interested in him? Odd would have to be dumber than a cracker to believe this, but his character as it develops in the book is not so naive and stupid. This opening is the worst case I can recall of a writer/editor tandem being guilty of an error so gross that it destroys the credibility of the main character. If Koontz had thought at all about this, during the editing, he would have rewritten the beginning. I just don't understand how a writer of his caliber could make such a mistake. Anyway, I'll keep reading his books because at some point in his novels there's always a plot point that grabs me."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my wife","review":"I am not a big reader, but my wife likes Dean Koontz - most of the time.She told me this is one of his better books, and recommends it to anyone that likes just a good story and/or Koontz' work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't even finish book","review":"I am a huge Koontz fan, but this Odd fellow I just cannot embrace.

Over time he has changed his \\"style\\" to become more preachy, to demonize anyone form of belief other than what he believes, and his stories have become weaker, less original, and tedious.He has gone from being one of my favorite writers when I wanted something to read just for fun to a mere shadow of himself. I have an ackward relationship with him. One one hand he is like an old best friend who I relied on for many years. On the other hand he is now like that same friend but who is going down the tubes yet who I keep hoping will come out of his free fall. I sometimes still read him because I keep wishing to find the same spark he used to inspire yet at the same time I try to avoid much of his stuff because I had to see how far he has fallen. Like Stephen King, maybe its time Dean considers retiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get All The \\"4\\" and \\"5\\" Reviews","review":"Maybe I am not used to Koontz's writings, since this is the first one I have read. Therefore, I approached this book with no positive or negative feelings of Koontz's writings. I was deeply disappointed when I finnished it. I struggled many times against closing the book and putting it down for good, but I kept reading hoping the good parts lay just ahead. But the good parts never came. (This reminds me when my chilren were small and I took them to see \\"Peewee's Big Adventure\\", because our local movie critic had said that it was \\"extremely funny\\". Well, we watched that movie waiting for the funny parts and suddenly the end credits began to roll.) Apparently most people who read \\"Odd Thomas\\" thought as I did because the resale value is less than $1.00. I believe that this book is comparable to Tom Clancy's last two bombs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very original","review":"The title character name is the first of many weaknesses. Odd Thomas? How about Stephen Strange or Lucretia Bizzare? Give me a break. It's an old writer's trick that Koontz should know better about and try to rise above. As for the book, nothing new here, weird happenings, a few twists and turns but nothing really new. The title character IS odd but so what. Give us something we've NEVER imagined and not just a rehash of what's already come before.

This story is a mixture of mystery, sci-fi / religion (little) and horror, splashed with humor. I chuckled out loud more than once and I read a political book before going to sleep.Odd Thomas moves fast with enough characters and their development to be interesting without dragging or becoming confusing.I do not enjoy books with either an obvious or out of left field behind the fence ending. I enjoyed Odd Thomas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"I have been Koontz fan since my first book I read of his, Cold Fire. I thought it was imaginitive and a great read. I read many of his books and agree with most reviewers his recent books tend to have more metaphors and similes that tend to push you off focus on the story. I myself tend to slip my eyes off the page every once in a while thinking to myself, Huh? In Odd Thomas the story doesn't move quickly at all but at a gradual pace. I thought it started a little slow but picked up a few chapters in. I enjoyed reading it and I didn't expect the little twist ending. Its a great read and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"i read this book after my barn owner suggested it. she made it sound like a really interesting story and since I love the paranormal I decdided to give it a go. i was disappointed. first off I kinda think its stupid that he can see dead people but they don't talk, it kinda left me thinking ok whats the point. also the story just didn't flow for me at all. there was a bunch of random things that were thrown in there like the time machine, stupid facts about random characters, and the climaxes didn't fit in with the story.I was bored. i'm happy I only paid a dollar for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This was my first Dean Koontz book, and I was pretty disappointed given the rave reviews I have heard about him. I am not saying he is a bad writer by any means, but it turned me off to his books.In this book I felt like I had to walk a mile to get 50 feet of story. He seemed to keep going on and on with descriptions of things that had no significance to the story. My main issue was his use of dialog, I'm sorry but people just dont talk like that. Let alone a couple of 20 year olds in some podunk town. The dialog between Odd and his girlfriend was very unrealistic and distracting. He is a great writer, but as said in my title, just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good, but wordy and drawn out.","review":"How many times can you describe a scene in a book. Well, Dean Koontz manages to describe things in a million different ways describing almost every scene. It's actually too much! I couldn't wait until he would get to the point. Plus there were alot of details about characters that you could care less about. I was always waiting till the author would get back onto the good stuff. The real suspense stuff instead of boring us with useless details that were not interesting.My favorite of Dean's is \\"The Taking\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What brought about this change?","review":"I, like many others who have written these reviews, would really like to get back to the old types of writings we came to love from Mr Koontz. The characters and stories are still good, but not near as intriguing as before. I really liked the way he wrote before, combining the barely possible like subliminal messages with the really outrageous. His characters also were always very colorful and memorable. Now it seems they're much more mundane. I also, like others, keep thinking I'll give up on this author but have grown up with his works, so I keep trying one more, hoping it will be like the REAL Dean Koontz books we've all grown to love over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd Thomas","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Dean Koontz and that has not changed.

While looking for something new to read a co-worker asked if I had read this book (Odd Thomas). I told her that I didn't think that was my type of reading and she talked me into giving it a try on my Kindle. I agreed and I'm so glad that I did for I'm now ready to read all of his books. This was a can't put down book, luckily it was on Kindle so no need to til finished. Thanks to all my friends, Amazon,Mr. Koontz, and certainly to my co-worker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend to any Dean Koontz fan.

I had to see what Odd was up to next, so I've purchased the next 3 books in the series. They're fast reading and keep me wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"I read this book on a lark. To be fair I have read Dean Koontz before, and never really appreciated his style. But I heard so many good things about Odd Thomas, that I decided to give it a try. I was a little intrigued at the beginning of the book, but as it went on, it only disappointed me. The oddities about the main character felt like a crutch for the author to move the story where he wanted it to be. None of the characters felt believable. I was surprised partway through to realize that the main character was supposed to be 20 years old - his voice sounded like he was 40. The events go hurtling on toward nothing surprising, a little happy and mostly sad, but everything as it is to be expected. I feel like the last 10 chapters were just a given - there was no point to read them because you already know how they go. I like the \\"idea\\" of Odd Thomas. I just feel like Dean Koontz could have done a lot more with that idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dean Koontz Book Ever","review":"I have read a few of Koontz novels, but this is by far the best! Twists, bends, and an exciting plot caused me to take this book everywhere with me until it was finished. I'm sad that it only lasted 24 hours but it was really that good. You will be surprised, you will probably not knwo what will happen next and it's unpredictability is what made it so enjoyable. No one enjoys a book that you could write yourself. Very original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd is a likeable storyline","review":"There are plenty of good reviews here; so, I will try and concisely touch on a few topics.I enjoyed the writing style of the book--fresh and a quick read.

This version forces you to take off the old legal version in order to install. When I found out that my legal version couldn't be used, it forced me to reinstall version 6, this took almost an hour to install, reboot, un-install and reinstall the orginal version.

There are several gun and fist fights before Audie and Crawford meet for a gunfight. Crawford has about four gunfighters who work for him.Audie has four women who try to help him.

Anyway, I did have som high expectations about this one. so, there are those two tracks, which are nice, then there are four songs, which sound good for the 3-5 first times, but which slowly start to irritate ( Let's rock, Why Can't ..., padrino, Flo). Then there are a couple of songs which are prettty neutral, but lame. And then there are the ones that have irritated me since the first listen; for example, \\"Disconnect The Dots\\" is disgusting teen punk. Yuch!. Well, anyway, to sum it all up, I'd have to say, that ska may attract you at first, but in the long run it's simply one of the most efficient vomiting tools. This album is just another commercially ambitious record with few catchy tunes, but not a bit of durability.

New Smash Mouth listeners, if you are considering buying a Smash Mouth album, buy Astro Lounge before Fush Yu Mang, because the quality is much better, and because you may decide not to listen to more Smash Mouth if your first impression of the group comes from this album. If a person grows used to Smash Mouth from Astro Lounge and then listens to Fush Yu Mang, it's kind of unrecognizable as Smash Mouth. The music is okay, but it does not sound like Smash Mouth. Also, be aware that while Astro Lounge DOES NOT have profanities, Fush Yu Mang DOES. All in all, if you're looking for good rock music, then this is a good album, but if you're looking for more great Smash Mouth, then you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far and beyond the best album ever.","review":"\\"Walkin on the Sun\\" was good. \\"Why Can't we be Friends\\" is slow and boring (also not written by them). The rest of this CD is a cut above. Smash Mouth has a fast, aggressive style mixed with a punk/ska sound. There songs speak of everything to being kicked out of their building (\\"Heave - Ho\\") to a humerous song about the mob (\\"Padrino\\"). Even some of the harder (is that the right word?) songs like \\"Let's Rock\\" and \\"Pet Names\\" that I didn't like at first quickly grew on me to become some of my favoites. I listen to \\"Fush Yu Mang\\" more than any other CD I own. Anyone who gives this album less than a 5 is prolbably an avid Backstreet Boys fan who only likes the songs they play on the radio. They should go buy Smash Mouth's new album \\"Astrolounge\\" which is just more slow and boring pop music (with the exception of 3 or 4 good songs).

At first I thought, well, it's just another punk album. Then I listened to the words - and now there's only 1 track I'm not fond of.

I'm a fan of both the punk-rock and punk-pop styles of Smash Mouth, and it's really a shame that they've got more fans of the pop style they don't have for real than the punk style they love to play so much.

The writing and photography throughout the book are of a very high quality. Historical photos combine with images of a \\"feel good\\" nature to illustrate over 100 years of America's fascination with dogs. The text represents the best of many famous dog writers who you might expect to find in a collection like this, plus essays from well known \\"mainstream\\" writers you would not expect. My favorite pieces include those by Jane Smiley and Roger Rosenblatt. And there is a beautifully written short-story about a girl and a guard dog in a concentration camp. Also appreciated were some vivid accounts of Westminster, the world's greatest dog show. I have a few quibbles, but all in all Our Dogs was more than my money's worth--a lovely picture book that is also a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson on the value of temporary relationships","review":"I read A Pony for the Winter as a young girl in Junior high (before the words Middle School meant anything) and learned the lessons of temporary relationships thru this book.

From the volcanic ash and lava flows in Iceland to the mighty Mississippi to the huge flows of mud, rock and ash into the Los Angeles Basin from the surrounding mountains, man's heroic efforts to live where nature did not intend us to live make a fascinating tale. McPhee's narrative has enough detail to provide the reader with a full appreciation of the forces at play and the perseverance of the men and organizations charged with \\"controlling\\" their impact. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Science Novel","review":"I was assigned this book as side reading for a upper level Environmental Geology class. It is one of the best books i've ever been assigned. The way Mcphee integrates interesting case studies with geology and the natural world keeps you intrigued. It never goes too in depth so anyone who understands earth science at all should be good.

It might be blizzards, Tornadoes, Hurricanes, earthquakes, something will eventually make life difficult. Here John McPhee has selected Flood, volcano, and landslide as the forces of nature and depicted the struggles of Louisiana, Iceland, and LA California.I was mesmorized by the descriptions of red glowing underwater lava flows in Icelandand the precarious cliff edge home-sites in California following massive mud flow disasters.Life seems a little more precarious after reading this but I am also more appreciative of the heroic efforts of so much of humanity thanks to McPhee's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"McPhee has it down, again","review":"McPhee manages to pinpoint and highlight controversies in such a way as to let us feel as though we are forming our own opinions and not being guided along into a particular viewpoint.A good read for anyone who enjoys a decent piece of literary work, from above average high-school kids to distinguished scholars. If you enjoy learning something while you read, McPhee is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this one for pleasure","review":"There are books that should be read for the value of the information they contain. There are books that should be read for the beauty and power of their language. There are few that achieve both. This intensively researched page turner never fails to combine clarity and eloquence.

However, I found myself even more fascinated with the struggle of the Icelandic people against essentially the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (good luck) and the head-in-the-sand mentality of Southern Californians when it comes to mudslides. McPhee is as artful in explaining geology as geology is complex. When I read his descriptions of complex geological situations put into simple terms, I smile, chuckle, shake my head, and read the line over and over. I just can't believe such complex concepts can be explained so simply using the same language I use everyday.The man is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfocused and boring","review":"I was disappointed after reading this book.

It will take me a while to read another book by this author..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controlling the Lava","review":"When reading this book for my intro to geology class, I found it to have alot of inpertinent information. For example, in the section to control the lava flow in Iceland, it gave a lot of unnecessary information about the appearance of many of the men on the mission to control the flow of lava. I didn't care to know what the men looked like; I was only interested in the methods they utilized to protect themselves. The information was unnecessary and boring. Also in the section of controlling the Mississippi, they assumed that the reader knew what a dam was or other devices they used to control the water. Since I don't live near any flood plains, it was hard to understand how the devices worked because lack of clear description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"I would recommend this product for almost anyone. I went from using a conventional oven only to using this convection/toaster oven, and it is now used more than the conventional oven (much better for the power bill).

Not luck with either effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the electronic timer that bread won't get overtoasted","review":"I'm not sure why I haven't heard from anyone complaining about the mechanical dial-knob timer that MOST toaster ovens have - those that usually have 3 knobs in the front of the oven. They don't work right especially when time is set to a few minutes which is what I use most for toasting bread. Either the timer ends too soon or my toast is black. I've to turn the timer each time to use the toast function. As the oven gets old, this timer loses its accuracy due to too much use - it's a mechanical timer.It's a delightful change when this unit has an electronic timer as it toasts bread to the same brownness every time. Other functions are easy to use, just press what you want to do, set the temperature if you want higher or lower temperature that it's been set and press start. The unit does remember the last temp setting by the way if you don't need to change. Convection is a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toster oven","review":"Over all a very good product.

I was terribly excited to have a fancy toaster/convection oven and after pulling out the monstrously huge unit and setting it on my countertop, I discovered that it will not start. I can program everything on the display, but the combined \\"Start/Stop\\" button seems to only work to stop, rendering the entire appliance a very shiny piece of trash. Worst of all, because I relied on the Black & Decker name, I purchased the oven at a time when I would be unable to use it for a few months, but I assumed returning it wouldn't be necessary and was getting a good deal. In truth, I was getting an awful deal on a completely useless toaster oven. Maybe your toast will actually turn on. I wouldn't suggest taking that kind of risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"unit turns on by itself","review":"unit is horrible. I think i had it for 1 yr. Unit turns on by itself.

Too long!","review":"I Plugged it in and tried a piece of toast with the shade setting of 4. It took a long time, too long. It was extremely hot on the sides front top and back. The cabinet stayed hot for a long time. Too hot to the touch. It definitely would have burned ones fingers.One could not even open and close the door without touching the hot surface of the glass. Bad design.I tried another slice of bread for toast with just a shade setting of one. Still the case was just as hot.I'd be concerned about the power cord coming into contact with the hot surface in the back, melting the insulation, which would allow bare wire to come into contact with the case.I can't believe they put this product on the market. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Analysis","review":"Good size to almost eliminate the need of your large oven. (For those concerned about space, look up measurements.) Good things; Looks great, heats great, size, convection fan, digital controls. Bad things; top and glass gets \\"really hot\\", convection only works on \\"bake\\" function. (And you must remember to turn it on) The user guide states to unplug the unit if your not using it. (Which I do) But if you do that, it clears the memory. (Making the temp / time memory recall useless.) Also, the LCD back ground does not light up and is a bit difficult to see in certain light. Regardless, im happy with it so far.** As far as toasting bread / bagels I think your better off using a regular toaster. While it does toast great, it uses a lot more energy to \\"toast\\" compared to a regular toaster. I have a regular toaster next to the toaster oven. Its a lot quicker and reduces energy consumption. Also avoids heating the toaster oven up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst toaster oven - very disappointing","review":"I wish I had checked out the reviews before I even bought this. It does get hotter on the outside than any other oven I have owned and would definitely consider it a hazard. The provided accessories (broiling tray, pizza pan, etc.) were very thin, warped right from the box and I can't even imagine trying to clean them. Overall feel (controls, etc.) is very cheap and flimsy - no substance. Found the controls confusing (yes, I did read the manual) and there are rather illogical 'sequences' that must be entered to use certain features. I have had B&D products for years and have always been thrilled with them. I bought this for the capacity, but will now have to think twice before trusting the brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shattered Door, 2 years","review":"I have enjoyed using this convection oven for the price. Although, I don't think the convection worked very well. Pizzas would often come out soft on one side, so we always had to turn them. The controls are supposed to remember the last temp and time input, but it never did.We have owned this for about 2 years and tonight the glass door exploded and shattered all over my kitchen. Luckily, my dogs & I had left the kitchen. I was cooking a potato, no pan or foil, just as I have before. It had only been in about 15 minutes. I am disappointed. If something else would have gone out on it, I would not be as upset. The glass door shattering is a serious safety issue and I am not going to recommend or purchase anything from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker CT06301 convection oven","review":"I guess I was fooling myself to think that a small counter top oven could actually be a \\"convection\\" The convection is just a small fan to \\"stir\\" up the air inside of the oven. The heating coils are still inside the cooking area and in a small oven like this, they are very close to the food. No matter how I varied the time or temperature, the food would be either to browned or burned both top and botton, before it was cooked.

And it does not seem that it would set the house on fire. In fact, now it is stone-cold dead. If I unplug it overnight, it may come to life, but not long enough to fully toast bread before going comatose again. It was 5-stars rating in my book, until it just failed.

Well, I thought, if the newer one has the same warranty, I'm fine. Then I found the warranty for this one, and it was only 1 year. So Black & Decker are selling inferior products now with much shorter warranties. I called and they said I was out of luck, since it lasted a whole 60 days past warranty expiration.

The pace is way too fast and they change positions very often. It was hard for me to keep up with all of the different positions as an adult. I couldn't imagine how kids could. The kids on the video must have practiced for at least a year so they could all be in sync. I would recommend \\"Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids\\" by Rich Grogan if you are wanting a work out that kids can actually keep up with and is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, especially for parents","review":"I originally bought this video for my two children. Sitting through it with them, I realized that this might be a good way for me to loose a few of those extra pounds you put on with small kids! The video can be challenging at first, but my kids love the music and anmial sounds and don't care if they do all the routines, but for me, it's been really good exercise and my kids like the fact that I'm doing it with them, even if I look silly to them. I recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST for Kids","review":"My grandchildren, from age 2 to 8, just loved it. They were first caught up in the music and then began exercising with the children on the video. When the animation came on they were laughing and having a wonderful time. I believe this is the most effective exercise video for children I have ever seen and am sure it one of the most positive forces in videos for my precious grandchildren. Hurray for the makers of this wonderful product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast","review":"I use this with my second-graders, but they don't like it.

Although it is well made the children found it much too difficult and gave up. I have played it for them several times, and they always begin with enthusiasm, but soon lose interest because the dances are much too hard for the little ones (ages 2-6) Maybe this would be a good video for older children, but \\"Chicken Fat\\" still gets my favorite children's exercise video review."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Professional Dancers Only","review":"This video claims to be for ages 5 and up, but unless you have a much older child that has been taking dance lessons for years, don't waste your time or money.

It may be fun for kids to try home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the lactose intolerant","review":"I ordered this DVD looking for an exercise video I could do with my toddlers on those long, indoor, winter afternoons. I picked this one, because my kids are obsessed with animals in the rainforest.Well, other than the weird bird, there was little animal portion of this video. That was not thrilling, but fine. The killer for me, was that this video was so clearly made in the late eighties/early nineties and is SO cheesy! Think Alyssa MIlano Teen Steam, but 10 times cheesier.So the cheese factor I could handle if my kids enjoyed it. However, the dance moves were SO complicated and the music SO bad, I just pulled the plug quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay. For this genre, it's a waste.","review":"The songs \\"Pollution\\", \\"Counterfeit\\", \\"Stuck\\", and the cover of George Michael's \\"Faith\\" are the only good songs on the album.

It has a few slow and dare i say boring songs on it but the rest of the cd is just one good ol' mishmash of Heavy guitars, fast scratchin' turntables and excellent lyrics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Big","review":"I love chess and I'd always hoped to instill that love in my children. Fortunately, they are all fast learners and within an hour they were all doing very well. I decided last Christmas to buy this set for one of my children so that he'd have one that he could carry around with him and possibly begin attending tournaments. Unfortunately, I didn't look at the dimmensions before I ordered it. I didn't realize how large it was. The board is solid with only one fold so the case has to be large enough to hold that and the pieces. The pieces also are huge. It's a good set, it's just a lot larger than I'd thought and that makes it harder for a 9-10 year old to carry it around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken, looks cheap","review":"This item arrived broken -- not surprising, since the bars appear to have been attached with a hot glue gun. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Good","review":"I think this album has a lot of merit to it. I originally purchased it when I heard \\"Flow\\" on the Jawbreaker movie soundtrack. That, along with \\"Look Who's Perfect Now\\" and \\"Dizzy Moon\\" are the best songs on the album. These are the songs that have something unique and really enjoyable to them. The other songs have glimpses of this as well, but to a lesser extent. Overall, I think it's a great first album. Will we ever hear any more from them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"different","review":"I expected a bad techno album when i first turned this C.d on. What i got was a great new band who blended techno stylings with guitar and intricate bass lines. The lead singer is a good young songwriter and has the potential to follow in the footsteps of Shirley Manson of Garbage and Laurie Post and Nina Gordon of Veruca Salt. This c.d is a good first album for a young, promising band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highs and Lows here..","review":"Tracks 1, 2, 4, 6, are great, solid songs with pleanty of drive behind them- especially Weather Boy which is their most complete and catchy song. (mainly due to the saturation of Look who's perfect now on Australian radio station JJJ) I must disagree with the reviewers comment on Keely's vocals. Having anonymity is a blessing these days, and her sexy, yet common sounding voice complements the electro-pop music nicely. Not a bad effort at all from a newbie three-piece. Well worth a listen in the music store, and decide then for yourself. Much Better than Garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transister","review":"I have listened to this album repeatedly since I bought it and enjoy the lead track (\\"Look Who's Happy Now\\") the most. Also, \\"Crazy Moon\\" is a very good song. I think the lead singer is average and the songwriting is spotty, but there are moments. My main question is why Interscope decided to replace the gripping initial video -- about a suicide -- with a forgettable one featuring the vamped up lead in the New York subway. Anyway, a pretty good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"I bought this cd because I am a fan of Foxy Brown. She only has one solo, \\"Somebody Else,\\" which is really off putting and not true to her style. All of the songs sound the same also. It was dissapointing because there was so much they could have done with this album. It was just way too hardcore for my taste. It could of done with a lot less cussing, and more original songs. If you like Foxy, Nas, or AZ, then I would buy their solo albums, and forget about this one, unless you like hardcore music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of realism.","review":"What happened here. Nas and AZ went pretty and lost lyrical energy, Foxy is always wack, and Nature (who is he) This album had no type of charismatic lyrics or production. All this album is talking about is fantasies about illegal drug selling and cristal. If you knew all these drug lords you would not be in the rap game, you would seek asylum. Just plain common sense. The beats by Trackmasters and Dr.Dre are horrible. Dr.Dre could do a lot better than this. I just hope Nas and AZ find the tools necessary to rip up a track like they did in their previous albums. This album is definitely not the album. To all hip hop heads: DO NOT BUY THE ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"could've been much better 3.5 stars","review":"When I first heard this album I truelly was very dissapointed ,after Nas putted out 2 outstanding cd's(\\"illmatic\\" & \\"it was written\\")he came out with this. This album starts off great:\\"the intro\\" is made nice,\\"firm fiasco\\" is my personal favorite,\\"phone tap\\" is great(nothing else to say),\\"executive decision\\" has a great beat but it gets annoying after a while, the rest is ... but then they come up with(a way too short)\\"untouchable\\",\\"5 minutes to flush\\" is the good thing about replacing Cormega. \\"Desperados\\" which includes a perfect performance by Cannibus. The songs that come after desperados are all great. Like i all-ready said this album could be way better. This is the worst album were Nas has been on but it's not that bad. Only the songs between \\"executive desicion\\" & \\"untouchable\\" are really bad. If you're a real Nas fan you should buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the hook","review":"I bought the tape back when it FIRST came out. A fan of Nas AND Foxy AND AZ the Visualiza, I just KNEW it would be bangin. And it was. From beginning to end. This was one of the best combinations of talent as far as recent hip hop is concerned. Nas' storytelling, Fox Boogie Brown's quick tongue and ability to get down with some of the hardest male MCs and AZ's skill and carriage all made this CD hot. My favorite songs on this CD were \\"Phone Tap\\" (which is STILL a favorite), \\"Five Minutes To Flush\\", \\"I'm Leaving\\", and \\"Firm Family\\". Even though my tape got stolen a while ago, I STILL love this CD to death. So cop it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst collabo allbum of all time! (1and 1/2 stars)","review":"To tell you the truth I am surprised that this album is bad(DONT ASK!). But it is bad as these reviewers say it is. Songs that I endorse:FIRM FIASCO, PHONE TAP, FIVE MINUTES TO FLUSH, DESPARADOS(Canibus was the deciding factor), and THROW YOUR GUNS. Filler: Firm Family(crickets chirping), Firm All-Stars(YAAWWWN!) Firm Biz(they literally destroyed their buzz with this song), Hardcore,F*** Somebody Else(Foxy sounds like a real dumb b***h on this song)and the rest of this album. Bottom Line:This album is the reason why most people say nay to Collaboration albums. The production was bland, the lyrics were below average and the fact that this album stained Dr Dre's credibilty says a lot. Question: If Cormega was a part of this group, would it have been a big deal? Answer:No, because even if Cormega is nice that doesnt mean this album is going to be hot. Anybody who says this album is bad is not hating, they are telling the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"This CD has a few hot songs, but truthfully, its not worth the money.

Producer Dr. Dre is quoted on one of his songs off 2001 calling it \\"the Firm flop.\\"Nas' career almost fizzled into nothing under the Escobar nickname...and it took the brilliant Stillmatic project to resurrect his career.Foxy Brown pretends she was never involved.

There wasn't one song where Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature rap together. That's a big weakness in that album. AZ was the reason why the firm album was so good. His rap vocals carried the firm album. AZ told a rap magazine he thought his vocals could been better. But his rap vocals was better than Nas, Nature, and Foxy Brown. Nature rap vocals was really good too. But the main two rappers everyone like, Nas and Foxy Brown didn't rap to their potential.

Many in the conservative movement will find that this book hits too close to home. But as a seriously religious person myself, I had the courage to get a sense of humor.

Not one character in the whole movie was believable, endearing, intriguing, or even attractive. This went beyond facial features and expressions to actions -- running and chase scenes were like watching people in casts. Except they weren't in casts, except for that of the movie of course. Perhaps this could have been saved by a great plot, but the plot was weak and depended on good acting to create a sense of eerie tension. That failed completely as the main characters lumbered around like a couple of refugees from Weight Watchers. The only concern created in the viewer was whether they might accidentally run into a wall and knock it over.I don't usually bother reviewing a movie like this but I thought maybe you might find a warning useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time use","review":"I purchased this unit two weeks ago.The first problem is,you can't keep the visual view centered.To do so you need to press PF12 many times during flying.I checked the mfg. site and see they have a add-on unit,that will fix this issue !?In General it is a nice unit,but it as to be improved.David Williams"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignatius for the 21st Century","review":"Father Aschenbrenner accomplishes a lot in this extraordinary volume. He is able to distill the wisdom of St. Ignatius Loyola for a modern audience. He is then able to take that sense, and give the reader a sense of the overwhelmind relevence and modernity that the Exercises offer the faithful of any age. This book should be terrific for one wondering if the Exercises might be right for them, for those feeling a calling to God, and as a wonderful review for anyone who has experienced the Exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Short, slow and boring.

I noticed that some events that happened in Book 1 also occurred in Book 2. When I think of a series, I think it is a continuous story. But, I will see what the other books in this series have to offer. There are also some slow times in this book, especially in Pine Grove. But, they are critical to the book because they let you in on feelings of Rebecca and Travis. I also didn't care for the ending too much. I was expecting something dramatic. The ending left several points open - will they be covered in the next book or will the next book have some of the same special events like Book 2 did after Book 1? Overall, it was a good book with a fairly happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but Western romance has been done better...","review":"First of all, I don't know any father who would command his daughter to marry a man who works for him. That said, my eyes rolled too many times to count especially when Travis and Rebecca interacted. Lori was a bit trite in describing their relationsip to the point where the word \\"tender\\" was overused . Also, I was bothered that she introduced characters from Pine Grove but had no follow through. At least the ending was fathomable. Lucky for Lori, I enjoyed her other books such as any from the Kensington series or the Californians (especially Donovan's Daughter). If anyone wants a good western romance, try Sigmund Brouwer's 'Sam Keaton: Legend of Laramie' books. Frighteningly enough, you can read about another cowboy who pines for a woman named Rebecca. But their romance is complicated and heightened by action and some great humor--all of which spans the length of 4 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this kind of uplifting books","review":"Lori Wick is a wonderful writer.

I'm starting \\"To Know Her By Name.\\" right now, and so far its good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've heard so many wonderful things about Lori Wick's books, and recently read \\"Pretense,\\" which I thought was very good. It whetted my appetite for more. \\"Whispers of Moonlight,\\" however, was a disappointment. After a while, the story seemed so circular, and it made for very frustrating reading. The characters were not believable on the whole. With the exception of Rebecca (who was exasperating in her pig-headedness), the characters who experienced changes in their lives seemed to do 180-degree turnarounds instantaneously. It just seemed too good to be true. I am left wondering which of these books is more representative of Lori Wick's writing. I am hesitant to spend the time to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!","review":"I love Lori Wick's books and I loved the beginning of this book.

It was just terrible, I grew to hate Rebecca and I felt that the plot became pointless. Lori Wick's her writing style is poor, making sentances come out corny, or childish sounding, and she always has all her characters be perfect, making every book more like a fairy tale about the enchantingly beautiful princess and her handsome, dashing prince. No one is really like that! It's so unbelievable!

Now, that might not be a bad thing -- in fact, I think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones -- but the advertising is dishonest.Much worse, though, is the the pointless and boring character of the movie, which is about a bunch of stupid or verbally sadistic \\"friends\\" who mostly don't like each other. While I've known cliques that keep getting together despite frictions between some members, it's inconceivable that these people would keep getting together for these abusive and tedious holiday events.

Nonetheless, if it's 1 am, and you can't sleep - THIS is the movie to watch. Don't expect 'Caddyshack', or 'Old School'- some parts ARE hysterical, but its humor is subtle (particularly the mannerisms of certain characters, plot holes that aren't explained, etc) - which is precisely why one can view it over and over again.NOTE: If for no other reason - you must see this film, for the scene of the two giant lizards conversing over work at the Halloween party.

I'm sorry but chopped veggies wrapped in a cabbage leaf with cold raw tomato sauce on top is not an enchillada. It might actually taste good, I don't know.

Atwood does an excellent job of character building, almost Dostoevskian in the inner and outer depth and overall scope. Some of the action I have a little trouble believing, but Atwood does provide reasons, within her character development, for those actions (sometimes after the fact); they are just not the actions I would take or would, in most cases, expect someone else to take. I was a little disappointed, in other words, with how some of the characters reacted to the \\"antagonist,\\" for lack of a better word. Personally, I expected (several times) this character to be beaten to unconsciousness or murdered, but alas....If you are an Atwood fan, I don't think this book will disappoint.

The language is beautiful, brilliant, stunning, sometimes hilarious and sometimes harrowing. But the characters are what elevate this book into the realm of great literature. These people are so real that I often find myself wondering how Roz is doing, what Tony's up to.

I think I'd just read The Handmaid's Tale and had such high expectations for the new Margaret Atwood that I was disappointed by this modern day, relatively mainstream novel.Picked it up again a few weeks ago and liked it much better the second time around. It's no Handmaid's Tale - but it is engrossing and the characters are well drawn.The only aspect of the book that was still disappointing to me was the trouble I had believing that Zenia could still exert such force over three women whose lives she had derailed. As compelling a character as Zenia was - I think these women would be smart enough to never believe a word she said. And yet...A good read with just a touch of mystery. Guess the second time was the charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atwood a good novelist.","review":"This is the first novel I have read by Atwood and it is very impressive. Her characters seem so real and as the reader I really cared about what would happen to them. Tony, Roz and Charis are 3 very diverse and unusual women who become and stay friends in the face of a common adversary. I think one of the appealing things about this novel is that it is easy to identify with the women and what is or has happened in their lives.The only dissatisfaction I had with the book is that some places could have been edited. When the characters have lapsed into memory there are portions that just drag and in other places it's a repeat of what we already know about that particular character.Overall, an excellent read and I recommend it. I think this novel will have a strong appeal for most readers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time Atwood Reader Enjoyed Book","review":"My mother-in-law is a big fan of Margaret Atwood and she passed this book along to me.

Then you are taken back in the past to lean of each characters history. Then the book comes back to the present. It is not hard to follow, but the more you learn about each character the more you don't want to put the book down.Very intriguing...and leaves you wondering why these people would make the choices they've made."},{"rating":"2","title":"At times uneven but often fascinating.","review":"I love Ms Atwood's writing period. I mean,in my opinion she could write about the phone book and keep me engrossed. You may not agree with me,I know,I just wanted to state that before I review this book,which while not her best work of the ones I've read so far, still resonates. The three woman are so well-drawn that you feel like you are snooping in on some very good friends. All quite flawed, but still the kind of friends I wish I had more of. Also, There are,unfortunately,\\"Zenias\\" in this world,although most don't operate on such a high-level of manipulation as she does. The stark reality of these woman's lives is a vivid,though at times,a bit unbelievable parallel to this woman who seems to exist only for her own selfish needs. It's a scary,sometimes funny and often sad book that will keep you wondering what will happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected surprise!","review":"All the characters in this superbly-written novel are symapthetic, human people that you can't help liking, at least just a little. All except one. The main character, Zenia, is a wholly detestable person who evokes NO sympathy or tender feelings whatsoever.Atwood is considered to be among the upper echelons of Canadian literary figures, along with Robertson Davies, Farley Mowat, and Margaret Laurence. In my humble opinion, with Robber Bride, she has outshone them all. This is my first foray into Atwood's writing, but rest assured, it is an archetypal Canadian experience, like the cottage party, that I will definitely repeat.Believable characters and situations, albeit fantastic, make this novel a treat to read, to become immersed in. It leaves one with a bit of a warm, fuzzy feeling in the end -- a warm fuzzy feeling that wears spiked heels, chains and leather."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite Atwood novel","review":"A book definitely to reread; at first, it's all to easy to hate Zenia. However, Atwood is also subtle enough to make us realise that the three friends are not entirely blameless. For me, the Roz part of the story was the most interesting and I can't recall rereading any other modern novel so often. It's much more real than the distant and cold Handmaid's Tale and less indulgent than Cat's Eye. The symmetrical structure also works without provoking feelings of artifice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Margaret Atwood's other books.","review":"It took me about a month to read this book. I read two other books during the same time. The plot was very dissapointing. I found it very difficult to care about any of the characters. I have read many of Margaret Atwood's books, and this is the first that was a complete let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Shame!","review":"Oh no! This is simply an embarrassment! This book is nothing more than a silly romance novel masquerading as literature. Atwood is my favorite author but this book just supports my theory that she has \\"sold-out\\" to Hollywood (what a shameful movie The Handmaid's Tale was!) Don't bother with this mess. Read The Handmaid's Tale or Life Before Man or any other \\"early\\" Atwood. If you are an Atwood fan, don't embarrass her by reading this. Let's hope things turn around SOON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining but too predictable, not charming","review":"Mildly entertaining but too predictable, not charming, I skipped through some pages that droned on. There were some very enjoyable segments. This is a book my wife might prefer to read but not enjoy afterwards. Had a common, liberal, anti-male feel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Captivating","review":"This is a wonderfully written novel. I was completely captivated by the lives of the three women in the book. I almost couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"The story of Zenia, a character with no redeeming qualities and her impact on three women. Only you never find out anything about Zenia. And Roz, Tony and Charis are not people I cared very much about. I think there characters were pretty well defined, but I kept wondering about the men in their lives and what these women saw in them, and what Zenia wanted with them. When I got to the end all I thought was is that it? I felt like I had wasted a week of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, someone please make her stop!","review":"I was a big fan of Margaret Atwood, but after suffering through this atrocity of a novel I feel cheated. I have wasted 4 days of my life reading this unnecessarily loooooong novel. Margaret, are you going through late life crisis? This book is like a cheap soap opera. You used to respect women.Three middle aged women chosen to be victims crying wolf the whole time.Don't waste your time reading this meaningless drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Atwood's best","review":"I've been slowly making my way through all of Atwood over the years, and as this is probably one of her lesser known works, it was one of the last for me to sink my teeth into. I love Atwood's writing, she's so gifted at creating characters, and in this book her character creation is at it's peak. All the women are so perfectly fleshed out, so different from each other, and getting inside each of their heads is equally engaging. I loved the way the book moves between the women's past and present, showing all they've been through and the ways Zenia (an amazingly complex \\"bad guy\\") destroyed their lives. I finished the book in under two days, it was just that engaging. This is a beautiful story of the twists and turns of friendship, and in my opinion one of Atwood's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Help for Keloid Scars","review":"This product is so helpful for keloid scars. I have three on my chest, back and shoulder. I pretty much keep them covered most of the time - almost more as protection against clothing, seat belts, purse straps, etc. They have flattened some over time but I've had them for years and when they are uncovered for any length of time, they become red and irritated again. I get a box about once a month or every six weeks. The instructions say they can be washed and reused but they get gross from rubbing on clothes after awhile. The little bottle of vitamin E oil really goes to waste - I've probably thrown out a dozen of them. Also, the instructions say to wear for 12 hours and then take it off for 12 hours and apply the oil. That's more \\"on and off\\" than my scars can take but still, this is the most effective product I've ever used on them in 40 plus years."},{"rating":"1","title":"dr blaine's scar care gel","review":"I didn't care for it.

It falls off sometime. Gets dirty. Takes a long time to dry. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal, Super Product!","review":"This product is terrific for reducing the most horrific scars. The gel is on an adhesive reusable/washable patch that you cut to your desired size and the E-sil helps soften the scar and return to healthy looking skin. I got it here for half the cost at my podiatrist (who recommended it after surgery). Results are fast and noticeable. I'm glad I decided to check Amazon before getting a new package. Thanks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best healing product ever","review":"I have had past surgeries and experienced scar tissue that just doesn't go away. The ScarCare Gel Pads delivered on their promise. Using them as directed, I healed quicker and with NO scar tissue in the sutured area. I have just a fine line where the incision was made. I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Blaine's Gel Pads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiger users beware!","review":"It wasn't made clear in the listing that this is essentially out of date -- Panther was an interim OS and this book is written from a Panther perspective. Tiger has been with us for more than a year, and the listing for this book should make it clear that this is out of date. A waste of my $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Agent on Flight 101","review":"I have read almost all of the Hardy boys books but this one has been my most favourite.

And that the book is \\"disjointed\\" in it's writing. I do not quite agree. This is one of the worst in the series, but certainly not \\"THE\\" worst!

After the show, they went back stage to see how the tricks were done. Hexton, the magician, showed them how he made a person disappear and reappear. Hexton made Fenton Hardy disappear, but he didn&#65533;t reappear! Then Hexton left. Frank, Joe, and Chet end up in Ireland as they search for their father. But are they on a wild goose chase and suspect the wrong person of kidnapping Fenton Hardy? Will Hexton take them prisoner too? To find, out read Secret Agent on Flight 101.

In the War in 2020 a humbled America sends a small force armed with experimental weapons to try to save a collapsing Russia from an Japanese armed Islamic invasion. The world has been ravaged by a pandemic and has become a much more dangerous place.Peters works in several potshots at Weapons purchasing, the Air Force, Washington, and institutional insanity. Peters also works in some pretty philosophical musings about war and revenge.The book definitely shows its age. I'm old enough to remember the Soviet Union, apartheid South Africa, and when the Japanese seemed ten feet tall so the story works for me. Younger readers may be nonplussed by the State actors.The feel of the book is somewhere between \\"Fields of Fire\\" and a Tom Clancy book. Peters is allergic to happy endings.

Sexsmith is a master of melancholy and hopeless nostagia. I don't know who she was, but she really did a number on him...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I first learned of Ron Sexsmith reading a newspaper article about today's lesser known singer/songwriters. I subsequently found this disc on a discount rack and bought it, without ever having heard any of Sexsmith's music.This mellow disc is full of simple songs with simple melodies. Many of the songs consist of Sexsmith's rather bland vocals over sparse background instruments. The songs are short, but with 14 of them, the disc seems very long. The songs, in my opinion, seem to run together to the point that they all start sounding the same. Individually, some of the songs are charming, but collectively, they don't do much for me.This is the kind of disc would be great if it's included in a 5-CD player on the \\"random play\\" function, allowing you to hear one or two songs off this CD before mixing in songs from other discs. As an entire album, however, I would prefer a wider variety of songs, as well as a more expressive and emotive vocalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This is one of the most incredible albums I've ever had the privilege of hearing. The line from \\"Strawbwerry Blonde\\"-- 'Still I see her face framed in blue sky. At the top of a slide coming down.' --is one of the most visual lyrics I've ever heard. All of these songs create a perfect blend of musical and lyrical imagery.

I must say that I bought this for a couple of his classic songs, especially Mack the Knife.I should have paid more attention to the track listing because some of the more-known songs are Live versions in which he half-sings them, half-talks to the crowd. So if you're looking for the original versions of the songs, please look elsewhere.That said, it is interesting to hear Darin in a sort of Vegas-lounge act setting. It gives you a definite feeling of the 60's rat-pack-era.Overall though, I don't think it's worth the price and therefore I feel a tiny bit disappointed. It's not bad, but it's definitely not what I was hoping for. It won't make it into heavy rotation in my cd collection.

She sees the sides of black and white magic and, while she doesn't buy into and of it, it doesn't fail to scare those around her. You're aware of the bad guys from early on, but it's Eve's mission to get enough evidence to convict that has the reader on the edge of their seat.I highly recommend this book, and recommend reading the series in order especially if you're more into the romantic aspect of the stories.

I've enjoyed them, which is why I felt my intelligence was insulted with each page turned. It was so obvious so early on, that the people Eve thought to be guilty and pursued, were set up. It was blatantly obvious from the first, who the guilty were, and they were conveniently set to the side until they popped up to end this book on a sour note. My advice? Save your money and just move on to the next one. This book cries, \\"Refund!!!!\\"The author is prolific enough. It would have been more honorable of her to have said, \\"This story really sucks,\\" and tossed it into the trash.

Also, Eve came off as arrogant and contemptuous of the wiccans....usually her relentless intensity is balanced by her frailties so she reads as a wounded warrior. but I didn't feel that dynamic in this one...thought this one was pretty interesting, but those aspects left a sour taste. my least fav because of that letdown...I am glad I continued, though.

A Russian Perils of Pauline","review":"Despite some interesting characters and occasionally rich and lovely language, this book was irretrieveably brought down by a frankly silly plot. One reviewer accurately described it as a penny dreadful-type story. For a time I thought the writer might be using the old-fashioned style to write a clever book, but the last few chapters fatally undermined that hope. I have heard that later on the series improves, but I can't see sticking it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Start...","review":"Either the translation went awry or there is something rotten in the plot; either way it is a shockingly amateurish start and might even put off readers' from buying other books of the series. To start with, Erast doesn't stutter; many characters are let off in the middle without any explanation; characters' appear out of blue with outlandish names; it is never explained why the main villain did what he/she did - if there is a metaphorical reference to it, I don't think I would want to re-visit the book again. Various eulogies praising the book to the sky from the likes of Ruth Rendell are but a sham to hook a naive reader to buy this boring book...Unacceptable...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving. Dull.","review":"Disappointed that this story didn't give me an image of the culture in Russia. This story could have been is Spain or US or any European country. The mystery was slow moving - it took me 6 weeks to finish. It was easy to put down and not pick up for a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to play a dirty trick on your audience","review":"Don't read this book if you like what it seems to be--a comic twist on the classic detective novel.

McInerney panned this book but compaired with much of what paases for mystery novels today it was great. Historical novels always have the danger of not maintaining the period the exist in. Akunin knows what Russian life was like near the end of the monarchy-he captured it with a true feeling. I'm sure some of the nuances were lsot but the translation was remarkable - I had a Russian friend read sections, she was very familiar with the novel. As a fan of this genre I look forward to more translated novels - maybe even a TV series like other European detectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent airplane book; typos on Kindle","review":"This is an intriguing detective story written in a style that you will either like or dislike. I liked it because it nicely reflects the time and place of old Russia and carries the story along in a very readable narrative format. One problem is that some text and pages are repeated in the Kindle edition -- apparently they caught some typos but inadvertently left both the old and new text and pages and there's no way to reach them to get them to correct it (like locatons 306-57)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary pleasure.","review":"Such a small book and yet so richly packed. The translation is, well, delightful. You'd swear this book really was written in the 1870s. It's full of wonderful little details such as Russian Roulette being referred to as American Roulette, and Fandorin's boss having one of the first of a new invention called the telephone. The characters are intriguing, especially the neophyte detective Erast Fandorin. More than a few times I was thinking, \\"No! Don't do that! Pay attention to your job!\\" But, obviously he wasn't listening...I was sad to see this book end and hope the rest in the series get translated NOW. If you like reading Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky (is that spelled right?), give this a shot. It's not as deep as those authors, but it captures their styles well.Also, this had one of the most shocking and devastating endings I've read in a book in a LONG time. I am still trying to deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Have Read in Many Years","review":"This book was listed in the New York Times Book Review Section as an \\"editors' choice,\\" which was why I picked it up. The hero, Fandorin, was so remarkably dim-witted, the book became increasingly annoying as it plodded along. How a series could ever be written around such a foolish person amazes me. The plot was replete with gaps that never seemed to get filled, and the ending was shockingly bad, as if the author just got tired of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book, Thin Plot, Cliches, Disgusting Ending","review":"Under no circumstances read this book! Its plot is thin, predictable and riddled with tensions resolved, apparently, by the hands of magical little elves. For the spy novel fan, or fan of any novel, you will find it quite familiar and completely unsurprising as it consists mostly of cliche scenes. The final scene of the book is predictable, disgusting, and disappointing. The narration is done in contemporary American English and many stereotypical colloquialisms and accents are reversed; these are the book's only clever devices. This is done to establish the feel that Europeans and Americans are alien and that the Russians are familiar. I found some of the anachronisms in the book's narrative style to be distracting. Reading this book was a very unpleasant experience for me. I wish I had stopped after the conclusive explanation of the early criminal investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth time and money","review":"OK, I'll confess right off the bat -- I've read all of Akunin's books, in Russian. They're simply amazing. This particular book is like an addictive drug, once you start, you simply can't stop. Get it, read it, you won't be disappointed. There're others, some better than Winter Queen, some worse, yet all equally engrossing and will keep you guessing until the end -- promise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost potential ...","review":"I recently found out about Akunin's novels, and started with The Winter Queen. The first few pages of the story grabbed my interest, but then it started falling apart and became more and more unbelievable. Our hero is young (19), inexperienced, and yet finds himself assigned to investigate a top crime and travel internationally. He has so many brushes with death, about the only thing that didn't happen was tying him to the rainroad tracks like Nell in a Dudley Do-Right cartoon. I'm sorry it dissolved into such dreck. The beginning was really promising, but it soon became a plodding affair which I ended up sort of skimming through to the bloody (and gratuitous) end. Bah. No more Akunin for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great character! formulaic ending","review":"Erast Fandorin is part Inspcector Cluseau, part Hercule Poirot in a somewhat predictable, but thoroughly enjoyable mystery. The intrepid slueth is a young detective working in Moscow in the late 19th century solving his first murder. The murder, as it happens, grows into a much wider (and deeper) conspiracy that reaches to the pinnalce of political power on an international scale.The earnest Fandorin is somewhat a bumbler, with average intelligence who manages to stumble his way across, into (and out of) a number of comic - and serious - situations. This was enjoyable to read. Yet I can only give it four stars because of the cliched ending. (No, the butler did not do it.) Those who are avid mystery readers should be able to piece the plot together mid-way through the book - but will keep on reading out of the sheer joy of witnessing Fandorin work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good points, but ultimately disappointing","review":"First the good points. The language was beatiful; the story moved briskly, with old fashioned cliffhanging chapters; Fandorin is an engaging character. Unfortunately, the basic plot is frankly silly, and for me spoiled the enjoyment of the book's good elements. The ending seemed especially gratuitous.I decided on this basis not to read the rest of the series, though I note one reviewer tells those put off to stick with the series--perhaps the plots get stronger. Certainly the era offered plenty of basis for more realistic plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Plot Twists and \\"Time Period\\" Feel","review":"If you like the detective-driven mystery genre, especially the old masters, you should enjoy THE WINTER QUEEN. Just when you think you know what will happen to our hapless hero, Erast, real life steps in and spins him in a different direction. Certain elements are expected, you will probably guess the villains' secret identities a little sooner than the detective, but other pieces will surprise and delight. The author and translator use a beautiful array of words which helps place the novel in time, so keep a dictionary near."},{"rating":"1","title":"So outdated, this book is completely worthless","review":"Not only is the information in the book unhelpful, it is now completely useless. None of the places I went to existed anymore as this book hasn't been redone since 1995!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for archival use...","review":"I'm sure that in it's time, this book was quite popular but today it would be viewed as ecologically irresponsible and well... wrong. The first 60 pages of this book talk about lawn care and also recommend getting rid of your grass clippings. Then, there are some useful discussions on trees, shrubs, etc. Each chapter is finished with a Q&A -- possibly questions from readers. He does have an index to all the tables in this book, but I don't know what happened to his U.S. Growing Zone map but it doesn't seem to match-up. I'm definately not in Zone 10!

Extremely musical, considering all the dark techstep coming out in 96, and soooo well produced. Luke Vibert always has been one to mix genres and this is no exception. Jazz, DnB, classical, soul, you name it and its on here and it all works to form an incredible DnB album. Many of the songs are through composed (non repetition of musical sections) and this makes for really adventurous music that takes the listener on a journey.

He had the original Blue Planet release that contains two songs not in the Nothing Records release. I think that it was probably the best record released in '97. I listen to many different types of music, and this is one album that I keep going back to time after time. If you have an interest in IDM or D&B, you can't pass up this record.

Some Dillinja or Dieselboy will suit you much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best d'n'b album ever?","review":"This album is so good. Every track is a masterclass in how to arrange and edit material into dense, exhilirating music. Squelchy bass lines bounce off the walls, keyboards caress, differently-rhythmed drums are layered one on top of the other to produce music that is impossibly hectic, and each track is identified by a voice sample particular to it (\\"What am I saying? I'm not even Chinese\\"). Cartoon-like, yes, but also very beautiful, 'dark' even, in places. The bonus cd is just as good: the two tracks entitled \\"cheesy\\" will bring a smile to anyone who listens, the untitled tracks are chaotic, maverick early jungle tunes, and the final two or three tracks are very long d'n'b 'workouts', similar in feel to 'papa'. Drum 'n' bass is effectively over in the UK, and this album isn't likely ever to be bettered."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Won't Regret It","review":"Ok, so in '98 I picked up this album, used, from my local store, for really cheap. I don't remember what prompted me to get it, I didn't even know what Drum and Bass was at the time. IT IS CLASSIC! Luckiest purchase ever! I thought it was some extremely underground album (ok, so maybe I was right), but it is core genre, and extremely listenable to boot. If I could have only one D+B album, this would be it! Buy it!

This is a fanciful book written by a REMF from WWII and my hardback copy is the dustiest of the \\"WWII Classics\\" in my collection. Norman Mailer, as a writer of fiction, couldn't carry James Jones jockeystrap into a pub in terms of great novels. Turgid prose personified, I had to MAKE myself complete the book. I came away feeling that it was a damn good thing that Norman Mailer was an interesting person. His writing was an elitist proto-marxist-apologist view of the world seen from a narrow standpoint regardless of the canvas he worked on. This book was his most commercially successful novel. That alone should stand as his epitath. Flawed, first, forgotten. He leaves no legacy but a stabbed wife or so. The book blows and reads as a dated piece more and more. I tried it again recently and it still is damned near unreadable...if there's such a word.

I was disappointed and couldn't wait for the book to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"much adiue about very little","review":"this book has potential but fails to deliver the goods. too much time is invested for the pay off. i hated the time machine sequences they were a total waste of time, eventually i just skiped them to help get the book over. this is a shame because there were some very good parts to the book a good editor could have improved it by trimming a few hundred pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Aces","review":"For me, the best part of the book was the way Mailer was able to continue to unfold the characters, and the baggage they brought with them, all the way to the end...much like someone laying down a hand at a poker table, one card at a time. It is a very heavy and enlightening book, made so by Mailer's ability to layer one character's perception on top of another until the reader is nearly as exhausted (in a good way) as the men contained within the covers. The ending was pure genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for book","review":"I started reading the book but never finished it. I did not care for the language and sexual content it was not what I had expected after reading some of the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"It is the true measure of a great book that days or weeks after you've finished, the characters and events keep running through your mind. The feeling is one of \\"I need to check in on Croft and Brown, Goldstein and Martinez and see what they're up to\\", as if their lives continue in a south Pacific jungle somewhere. The book takes place on a fictional island in the Pacific during World War II, but the interaction of the characters and their personal struggles are timeless. This book is considered by many to be the best novel to come out of the war, and it is easy to see why. It's a great novel period, war or not. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book lays bare the soul of America and its people.","review":"The characters Norman Mailer has created in \\"The Naked and the Dead\\" are without doubt the most living and memorable I have ever read about. Mailer, through dialogue and thoughts gives each of them sheer perfection - his 'Time Machine' sections taking you into a character's past expose in graphic detail America's roots. Basically you can see in an instant how a personality has been formed.Of course this is only possible because the men are under the tremendous trial of war. As the gripping story unfolds you see the fear of death becoming stronger and stronger; the men are worn down by fatigue amidst the rawest, most realistic human struggle you will ever read of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it through","review":"I know it's supposed to be a classic and I tried; I really tried.After about 200 pages I had to stop.

Sorry Norman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imposing start","review":"I picked up an old paperback edition of this book and couldn't put it down. An amazing accomplishment for a 25-year-old writer, even though Mailer's style is a mixed bag, and he had to use \\"fug\\" as a euphemism for that other so-common word. Reminds one of Hemingway, but also in its gritty realism of Saving Private Ryan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The boy genius","review":"Mailer has a great piece of work here, especially considering it was his first novel. The characters are interesting and this is what drives the book. Norman is able to create very vivid and realistic scences. At times, the words just become pure gold. However, his inexperience does show a small number of times. There are momoments that it becomes tedious abd repetitive.

His characters are so realistic that I canremember their names five years after I've read the book.Mailer wrote the novel with the insight of someone twicehis age and with the raw courage of the young man that hewas. His knowledge of the whole army heirarchy, from private to general, was amazing to read about and the plot wasperfectly constructed. I recommend this book to anyone whowants to be introduced to the extensive works of one oftoday's foremost living authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mailer - The most overrated author ever, ever.","review":"This is my 2nd go around with \\"The Naked and the Dead\\". I'v read a lot of Mailer and come to the conclusion he was a very good writer when describing what happened to Norman Mailer. Otherwise, he was a joke.Which leads me to \\"The naked and the Dead\\". Great descriptions of combat and the jungle and what it feels like to be out at night, on a hot steamy jungle, straining to hear if the Japanese are coming to get you. But the soldiers are jokes or cardboard cut outs, and Mailer's \\"philosophy\\" nothing more than warmed-over 2nd hand Marxism with a Brooklyn accent.And the \\"Time machine\\" used by Mailer to describe the soldiers civilian life simply shows he knew nothing outside the world of Brooklyn or Harvard. None of his Non-New Yorker characters ring true.Its amazing how good the WW I novels are, and how poor the WW II ones are. Or in other words: Just Fudge it, just Fudge it all to hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you rather be a mule?","review":"I am at a total loss regarding this book. If you wanted to pack a mule and find out how much the average weight of one is, this is the book for you.

The dialogue never flows or has the ring to it that we all look for.Any sex you find in the story I would classify as silly and juvenille.I truly looked forward to buying this book and when read was most disappointed in its contents.I guess, I'm just not a mule packing guy!

(Oh, yes! it looks like it was self-published) The female lead was a prosaic doll that never came to life.After giving it a heroic try for 2 hours, I skipped to the end just to say I finished it, but I didn't pass it on to friends.

The directions are written in \\"steps\\", that is, each rambling paragraph is headed by \\"step 1\\", \\"step 2\\" etc. but this is not step-by-step direction.

This 'work', merely an arranged compendium of useless episodes and scenes, is completey boring and without any enrichment, all it does is tire the reader. The style is marginally academic, that is to say, it is written in long, flaccid sentences with too much self-exaltation included. I was bored by the entire book, Breton imagines that it was revolutionary to write about fractured and obtuse occurrences which have nothing to do with anything except his own idea of importance. He meanders through pretentious descriptions which are trite. Don't be fooled by his sycophantic adherents who believe that he actually \\"invented\\" surrealism and art. I'd rather read the true ramblings of a madman than this ordure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneasy","review":"None of the information given in this book is documented with footnotes. There are some general attributes given for each chapter at the end of the book. It just makes me uneasy that the material does not come with adequate sources.Especially after one glaring error is to be found throughout the description of the religious clashes between the Scots and the English.The author refers to the Church of England as being the Episcopal Church. It is not. That would be the Anglican Church as opposed to the Episcopal Church or religion in the U.S. The Anglican Church became the Episcopal Church,in this country, after the Revolutionary War. The English monarchy is the head of the Church of England and we fought that deadly war to found our country's independence from the English monarchy.I found that I couldn't really finish this book because of my doubts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Scotland's Empire instead!","review":"What a load of reductive cr*p! Buy Get Scotland's Empire by T. M. Devine instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book was a Christmas gift and I recently finished reading it. I had fairly low expectations going in, but my interest was held all the way through. Mr. Herman does indeed make a strong case for Scots leading the way in many aspects of modern society, although I would say that declaring that Scots invented the modern world is rather speculative. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this book and was especially interested in how Scots helped shape the United States and Canada with highlanders generally siding with the monarchy and migrating to Canada as Loyalists after the War of Independence and lowlanders siding with the revolutionaries. An excellent read if you are interested in Scottish or New World history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneasy with this book","review":"At times interesting, at times dull. I was fine with that until I came to page 235 to read about Scotts in the American South. Herman says the term \\"redneck\\" was a Scots border term meaning Presbyerterians and \\"cracker\\" was also a Scottish term. That was news to me. I've checked with several sources and have never been able to find any indication this was true.Things like that, and the absence of footnotes, leads me to feel uneasy about the accuracy of this book.I shared some of the book with my church's business administrator, a native of Scotland. His response was to laugh and ask, \\"Who is this man?\\"I suspect Herman is American. It shows when he refers to the Church of England as Episcopal -- which is technically true, but non-americans would have referred to the Church of England as Anglican. A telling moment that also made me wonder about the biases Herman may have brought in to the writing.All in all, I just felt uneasy about trusting the author and his sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was a great price for a great book. Book was in mint shape. I tried to rent this from library but could not finish it all so I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book, a little uneven","review":"I found the first half of \\"How the Scots Invented the Modern World\\" to be very informative and entertaining. The portraits of Hutcheson, Kames, Hume and Smith were interesting both by themselves and in the way in which the author explained the connections (both personal and intellectual) between these thinkers of the Scottish \\"Enlightenment.\\" I was convinced that in one sense these Scots really did invent the modern world, or at least the modern mindset.The book weakens, however, as it becomes in the second half a fairly pedestrian retelling of accomplishments of Scotsmen and their descendants. It was refreshing not to read any excessive English-bashing in this account, in fact, it might be the most pro-English book about Scotland I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.... although not without flaws...","review":"As non-biased reader (no Scottish roots or ties), I found this a good book. Its coverage of the Scottish Enlightenment is excellent - and this is the best part of the book. He covers both the individuals and their theories very well and its highly readable. However, after he moves on from the Enlightenment, it becomes quite tenuous. Claiming the Scots were responsible for the British Empire, America and Canada is a little bit of a stretch? Also, this book can be a bit of a heavy read at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, easy read","review":"Arthur does a fantastic job of bringing together facts and stories together while examining the significant impact that Scots have had on the world. From our liberal arts college to modern medicine and economics it is amazing the impact of the Scottish people. This book is extremely readable and easy to understand. I highly recommend reading this book and passing it along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent history of Scottish contribution to civilization","review":"I read this book during my vacation in Edinburgh. I was amazed by thensignifcant contribution of Scots to the civilization, in areas of philosphy, economics, science and culture. The book is an easy read and very funny sometimes. Strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in the history of Scotland of Scotsmen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Reading","review":"As only a second generation American and lifelong student of history in a casual sense I was happily carried away by the author's style of introducing the luminaries of the Scottish Enlightenment and their enduring principles in the context of 18th century Scotland. And as I read I was gratified that I was able to see the long term effects of these great thinkers and the cultural heritage imported by the Scots to my country....often before the author defined them. I enjoyed quite a few \\"aha\\" moments and am inclined to delve deeper into the concepts and great men introduced in this book. Thanks and well done!!!How the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in It"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Summary","review":"This book is a great summary of events particularly of those events dealing with the Scottish side of the Enlightenment. Philosophizing is fine but where the Scots came in is taking the quizzical nature of the Enlightenment and applying it to practical pursuits like science, medicine and even the beginnings of modern economics (Adam Smith, who's father was a customs officer oddly enough). The author also does his best expunge some of the popular myths of Scottish history including the cases for the Jacobite Rebellions of 1715 and 1745.Overall-I loved the book but in some ways it got a little repetitive something akin to reading \\"How the Irish saved Civilization\\". The Scots did a lot of great things but eventually the book has the reader believing that they did everything. Eventually I began to wonder if Mr. Herman was going to give the Scottish people credit for inventing the wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...

Very disappointing.Please check your copy carefully upon receipt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotland Forever!","review":"What a warm and revealing book. For so many of us in America of Scot descent, too many of us had no idea of the importance of this poor and ignored nation that produced such a revolution of new ideas in law, philosophy, government, economics, education, and religion that are with us today and taken for granted. Scotland overcame every adversity and stands proud today as a grand part of our heritage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm, maybe I missed something...","review":"but I found this one of the driest books I've read in ages. I was quite eager to learn more about the history of Scotland and the Scots; it's part of my heritage. And I have read scholarly works before, so it's not that I am unfamiliar with such or expected a novel. However, this man took what is doubtless a very interesting topic, and made me cringe repeatedly with his complete lack of finesse with words. It was so dull and ham-handed!I cannot recommend anything in its place, and there is some good data in the book, but I am really astonished at the good reviews! By all means buy it, but just don't expect a riveting read to keep you awake till the wee hours or anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grand title for a book that is so anti-Scottish","review":"This book flatters to deceive. Despite its grand title, rather than offering a new take on Scottish history and culture, it simply repeats tired old prejudices and down-right lies about Scotland's gaelic past. There is no historian who can offer an accurate account of Scotland's history, without having a proper knowledge of her gaelic/celtic heritage, and this author has evidently allowed his prejudices to get the better of him when commenting on the gaelic part of Scotland's history, using far too many quotes by British imperialist agents designed to negate and excuse their attempts at cutural and ethnic genocide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me think","review":"I have a Scottish last name and have always been interested in the history of Scotland. This book is easy to read on difficult subjects like Adam Smith. It really made me think about whether Capitalism is the driving force of the world. If people have enough material things do they conform. In the US with lot's of different kinds of people that seems to be the case. It also appears that even the worst off in the US has a TV and is probably better off than the best off in sub-Sahara Africa. I don't want to argue who is happier. I also was interested that Lowland Scots were Presbyterian and English Episcopalian. I loved the reference to English as high-browed. I still see the British as Stogy to the point of their own downfall. My last name is a Highlander name so now I wonder if we came after the 45.

The very fabric of American life. A totally believable male voice written by a female author in a gripping read of intellectual meanderings, portraying a very human (ergo flawed) individual, lovable despite his myriad failings. If you love absorbing characters, pithy prose, word play, satiric observation in an enormously humorous form that will brighten your day despite the heady subject matter, this novel is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"the smoker's lament","review":"This book is funny, charming, and very well written. It's a pleasure to be inside the head of her wonderfully misanthropic narrator - the most sociable hermit I've ever come across. Christensen is even good at funny sex scenes. But I didn't quite buy the epicure part of the book-- the cooking doesn't play into the plot nearly as well as the smoking and the recipes are kind of backwoods for a post 9/11 gourmet. The author also is compelled to soften all her funny dark humor toward the end too much. But, all in all, an extremely enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Anyone Who Loves to Love a Villain","review":"Dry, cutting wit is in short supply these days, especially in mainstream fiction.

Wish I hadn't bothered wit this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased this book for a friend and for me as a holiday read because the reviews were really good. We're both in the food profession and I thought it would be fun to read a fiction work (rather than non-fiction). I also thought this sounded different from other fiction/food books I'd read in the past. Well, unfortunately, food does not take the center stage and, as my friend noted, the author does not sound like she likes her main character. The plot has some interesting twists and turns and it's journal format is interesting. However, I wouldn't say that the focus was on food at all. I definitely enjoyed <The Last Chinese Chef> quite a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Kate Christensen's first two books were very good, but they didn't prepare me for how absolutely well written this one would be. With each book I feel she gains confidence and matures as a writer, delving deeper into her characters. Mostly, though, what is so exciting is the way she turns a phrase. The writing is so elegant it almost doesn't matter what she is writing about, as long as she just keeps putting it on paper!I ate up the language and sentences were ringing in my head (something that usually only happens to me with someone like Dickens), but there were a few singular words I wanted to change because they were duplicated and I wished that they remained singular. This was a perfectly written book save for maybe three words. How amazing is that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you LOVE Hemingway... don't bother","review":"The cover reads, \\"His greatest love story.\\" There is only a tidbit of love speckled here and there. For the most part the novel is completely absent of any females. It actually seems to be 3 books in one with very little connection between them. Part one was very visual and the story flowed excellently. Parts two and three Hemingway completely lost my interest. I couldn't follow where he was taking me, there were so many disconnects, it felt like a smattering of short stories none with any sort of conclusion. I was left wondering why he even included some sections. I found myself forcing myself to finish in hopes there would be a sudden twist and reading this book would have been worthwhile. Unfortunately, I was dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. Should have bought hard back.","review":"Great book. The most Hemingway of all Hemingway books...The sadness and the lack of meaning are painted with the boldest colours. I guess some might say it's just that mildness that was so amazing about the hemingway writing corpus, but, after reading them all and soaking in that sadness, one wants to experience it to the extreme. This book is the extreme of sadness. Enjoy it!The problem with paper backs these days is that they are as soft as... cheese... the sort of cheese that is very soft, I mean... I want to lend it to all my friends, but know it means I will one day have to buy a new copy just to sit on my shelf and wait with me until great sadness will come into my life.

I think generally speaking men will appreciate this novel more than women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph Through Death","review":"As in many of his works, Hemingway once again writes of a man who stays the course through all trials and obstacles, even if it costs him his life. While similar, \\"Islands In the Stream\\" may even be said to be better than \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" because it reaches further back into the protagonist's character and makes his tragic end all the more heart wrenching. \\"Islands\\" is a great representation of the aspects of Hemingway's writing. His unrequited loves, his European memories, his role as a father, all of these are shared with the reader in \\"Islands.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely a shadow of For Whom the Bell Tolls","review":"In this hefty novel, Hemingway reincarnates Robert Jordan and the plot and themes of For Whom the Bell Tolls. Being Hemingway, Islands in the Stream is well-written (although not as well as many of his other novels), but there's nothing new here. Islands in the Stream is a last ditch effort by a dying master."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I do not feel I have the literary capacity to review Hemingway's novel. I'm a second-hand reviewer who feels comfortable reviewing second-hand books. For example, see all my reviews of Navada Barr's books.

Over all I would have to say that this book was above average, and addressed many of the changes in the industry to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"A plot as dark and twisted as its protagonist--bone-chilling, heart-breaking, and masterfully crafted","review":"\\"What can you know of an animal who craves blood, lust, revenge; who can love utterly and selflessly one tiny, wounded woman?\\" (p. 65)My best friend gifted this book to me, and I read it in two sittings; I couldn't put it down. Dustin is a psychopath who manages to terrify and somehow endear the reader in a chain of horrifying events as he struggles with the demons and desires born from his even more monstrous, repressed past. Through his abusive control of his wife Helen, he paradoxically discovers the all-consuming, healing power of self-annihilating love--but is it too late for redemption? I strongly recommend that you find out for yourself, as the ending will leave you speechless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribute to Art Tatum","review":"Paying his tribute to Art Tatum Makowicz reveals his own musical personality. He presents his unique approach to modern jazz being even more creative than Tatum. Makowicz does not attempt to imiate his keyboard dexterity and unsurpassed sense of harmony. Instead, he gives more personal touch in his improvisations. Unlike Tatum, Makowicz quite often goes away from the original theme creating his own, unique variations. His piano sounds crisp and rich, as he prefers Bessendorfer over other pianos. This CD is a real musical gem. Highly recommended to all jazz piano lovers. Both thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an exceptional TNG story","review":"I bought this mostly because I read a lot of ST books but never a comic book, so I was curious. The character and ship drawings are fine, with the worst being Data. The action is fast paced, but underdeveloped, but it's a comic book, so it's OK. The writing is very bad. Also, the writer didn't have a good grasp of the characters. Their actions/reactions seem out of place compared with other Trek literature or TNG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read about an unknown guerilla war","review":"In reading \\"Behind the Burma Road\\" I learned about a guerilla war that was waged behind the Japanese lines during the Burma Campaign in World War II. I have read other books such as \\"The Maurauders\\" by Charlton Ogburn, \\"Burma Rifles\\" by Frank Bonham and \\"Galahad\\" by Colonel OSborne which have had mentions of the Office of Strategic Services and their Detachment 101. In this book you get the first hand knowledge of the former commander. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"6 or so good games in one","review":"Exactly as advertised. As one who liked the original 2d sonic videogames, this is a nice blast from the past. It has the console and game gear versions of several games, and had several sonic offshoots(pinball etc) which I didn't really care for.But still there are at least 6 games that I enjoyed and that's more than worth the price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Mega Collection Plus","review":"Replayaility: constant. 20+ games to choose from, retains the playability of the the original games. Lots of extra content. 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but missing some of the sonic games...","review":"This game is amazing, for only 20 bucks. The only downfall is that it doesn't feature any of the NEWER sonic games, such as sonic heroes or any of them like that, they should of maybe bumped up the price and bit and added a little more in there, but other then that its great. (Now that i come to think of it, sonic heros alone is 50$ so i guess they should make this game like $100 and have EVERY SINGLE DAMN SONIC GAME EVER MADE!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I thought this game would be something great to get my kids so they would have something different to play. It was even better that it came for the Xbox. I was very disappointed though. The graphics were terrible. I understand it was made for a sega but if they say and sell it for an Xbox then it should play just as well for an Xbox!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Thought this would be a fun- always been a fan of Sonic and my 6 year old loves him. This \\"collection\\" doesnt even allow you to play all the games listed. The graphis are awful compared to Crash Bandicoot, Star Wars and Cars for the same system. Maybe because it was meant for Sega? I dont know- but dont waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primus Sucks!!","review":"When i listened this album the first time i disliked a lot; it sounded 'awful' where is the primus sound? i wondered, but 10 years later, this sounds awesome, i can't tell you that is the best work of primus but, nearly i'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL GOOD MUSIC FESTIVAL","review":"I THOUGH THIS ALBUM WAS TIGHT!

I find myself skipping almost all of the tracks, exept 1, 2 and 8. Other songs have thier moments, but all in all it isn't too good.Word to the wise, spend your money on something else. I usually don't condone downloading over buying, but when the cd only has 3 good songs and 2-3 okay ones it's definatley not worth it. Infact, the only reason why I havn't traded it in for something else is because I'm a primus fan, and I like to collect things ;P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Primus in a new direction","review":"I can see why people don't agree with this album. It ventures away from the the previous albums. The drums are a big differance, they sound very differant. Also, the strange voice of Les Claypool is repealed somewhat. But the dominant bass is still there, like on all their albums.The best thing I like about this album is 15 tracks, and only on without purpose. Like on Pork Soda, several of the 15 tracks could be taken away and still have a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid late-era Primus release","review":"Unfortunately, \\"The Brown Album\\" is consistently bad-mouthed by people who want Primus to release \\"Sailing the Seas of Cheese\\" over and over again. There's no denying the genius of \\"Sailing...\\" but I think \\"The Brown Album\\" holds up just fine on its own. With the exception of \\"Shake Hands With Beef,\\" which is a tad boring and sounds kind of muddled, this album could stand on its own with any other release in the Primus catalog. \\"Fisticuffs\\" is awesome, and so is \\"Hats Off,\\" \\"Over the Falls,\\" \\"Bob's Party Time Lounge,\\" and \\"Restin' Bones.\\" Les Claypool is one of the finest musicians and creative forces in music, and this album, like just about anything else he works on, should be praised."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"This is a very interesting and solid album, with amazing bass and great guitar lines on each song. Brain doesn't ruin it, in my opinion. He just has simpler riffs and a simpler style than Herb, although on some songs there is a kind of annoying lack of cymbals. That's the only thing I don't like. My favorite song is probably Fisticuffs or Kalamazoo, and The Chastising of Renegade and Bob's Party Time Lounge are notable too (although I will say the live version of Bob's Party Time Lounge on Rhinoplasty is slightly better than the studio recording.) All in all, I think this rates with their early releases (very, very, very good.) So ta-ta for now folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"primus iis great; brown album sucks","review":"first of all i never thought i would see the day that primus had simplistic drumming. i can't respect brain because in an interview he said that his favorite drummer is tommy lee. give me a break. ler's reggae style guitar is very annoying and les seems to not want to take control. i love every other primus album and i listen to them all the time but this album sucks. i don't like one song on it and the sight of it sickened me and i had to take it and sell it for three dollars and a miles davis cd. i would actually give it zero stars but les is still one of the best bassist of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back to earth, Les! We miss you","review":"Les's goal(it seemed)with the Brown Album was to prove how \\"out-there\\" Primus could be, but in the process, forgot they still have a responsibility to entertain the people that shell out the cash for the CD (me, really). What a joyless, unlistenable piece of trash this is! And I say this as along time Primus fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can do (and have done) better","review":"The nadir of Primus' career so far, the Brown Album is a rock-bottom collection of lazy jams. The production is murky and at times unlistenable, and the new drummer is less than impressive. Thankfully, their latest release \\"Anti-Pop\\" is a huge return to form, and this album proved to be just a glitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"As exciting as 5 hour dental surgery","review":"I'm surprised that this band lasted in any form for more than 2 or 3 albums. They have gone beyond their total clown image. All of their stuff comes out sounding the same: you are relieved when it's over and you have silence. Obnoxious, annoying, loud, brain-mushing. Les Claypool should go and stay in his own world and stop polluting the air around us with his aural diarhea. This album is criminally awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primus does suck...","review":"this is definitley the worst Primus album, just beating out Tales From The Punch Bowl....Just not like the previous albums..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown is Beautiful","review":"There is only one word to describe this album: Brown. From Brain's hollow drum intros to Larry's superb quirky guitar solos. Not to mention Les's funkified bass riffs. I've never heard music where the vocal's fit the music so perfectly. A lot of people don't like this album because the recording sounds like it took place in a racquet ball court but I think that only adds to the awesomeness. The thing that separates this record from most other Primus releases is the Brown Album has only a couple fillers (Camelback Cinema, Pudding Taine) which is why I only gave it four stars. Even the last song is awesome which is not common with Primus albums. If you've never heard Primus before I would suggest this or Frizzle Fry. You won't be disapointed unless you listen to Linkin Park or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book!","review":"Book in very good condition. Thought we would not be able to find this product, very surprised and happy. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Rap Music","review":"Powerful rap music with moving words.

I dun been to parties and heard dis cd play from start to finish, no joke. Kilo in jail or sum'n now and I doubt if he tried his hardest he could ever top this album.

I have been symptom free of my own severe PMDD for over 4 years now following these methods. I found this book to be an honest, well researched and insightful tool in helping women (and their spouses/partners) to understand this disorder from the inside out. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!!!","review":"This book is wonderful! It is easy to read, easy to understand, and for once I feel like I really understand what works, what doesn't work, and why. I highly recommend this book for every woman who has PMS, PMDD, or is even just a little cranky once a month. This puts it all into perspective, and offers all kinds of solutions. Top-notch! Plus, I trust the information because it comes from a woman doctor who is both a psychiatrist AND an OB/GYN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the idea only","review":"I should have known when the used copies were only a penny, but I persisted. Hey, this thing won a Hugo and a Nebula, right? Well the idea of the ringworld is interesting. The science of doing it is interesting. Everything else is boring.I'm a huge sci-fi fan and I normally will get sucked into a book and not do anything until I finish the book... not so with Ringworld. It was dull, the characters were entirely unbelievable, poorly described, I found myself not caring about them at all, and for the last 80 pages or so, skimming rapidly and even skipping pages entirely... and then I stopped 20 pages before it was done. I can't remember EVER not finishing a book.This book was absolutely horrid. Please don't read it. If you like the idea, go play Halo - it would be time better spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The biggest novel by Mr. Big.","review":"I always called Larry Niven Mr. Bog, because he had some big ideas in hisnovels, like moving the planet Uranus in order to move the Earth before thesun turns into a red giant. But no idea was bigger than Ringworld, a ringbuilt around a star with 3 million times the surface area of the Earth.Just the idea is enough to send the mind spinning. And when a Puppeteersends Louis Wu and Kizinti Speaker To Animals to the Ringworld to discoverwho built it, the adventure is on. Probably Niven's best known work, hewon one of his several Hugos for this masterwork. This is essentialscience fiction reading from a master of hard science fiction. Don't wantto give too much away, but Ringworld brings together a lot of loose endsfrom Niven's Tales of Known Space."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of a long relationship-","review":"I first read this book when I was 14, and literally never put it down. I remember by dad attempting to describe a puppeteer at dinner the night before, and I had been skeptical of concepts like impervious hulls, but the story weaves a diversity of elements together seamlessly. This year I stumbled into Niven again as an escape from law school reading, and find the science, narrative, and stories as compelling as ever. Its a pleasure to return to this book after so long, and I highly recommend it to any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very different type of story, but intriguing and fun","review":"I had a hard time figuring out what kind of stars to put on this book. Some of the characters were lame, a lot of the dialogue was cheesy, the technology is ludricuous...but I liked it. It wasn't torture, there were loose ends where I felt like I missed something, and dialogue that was hard to figure who was speaking, but when it wasn't confusing, it was really cool. Worth checking out for the idea of it and the adventure. There is something really likeable about the Kzin, so I think I might be picking up the Man-Kzin Wars books soon. This is such a short book, that I recommend it to sci-fi fans who don't rely on strong characters and just want to read about interesting technology. If you're in it for the characters...eh, maybe not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A All-Time Classic Must Read For \\"Sci Fi\\" Lovers","review":"If you love reading fast-paced, imaginative, inventive stories about special people traveling to amazing worlds, then you'll love Ringworld. You'll meet Nessus the Puppeteer and Speaker-to-Animals (I guess they aren't people, are they?) and Louis Wu and Teela Brown. They get in a craft protected by their trusty General Products hull and take off for the Ringworld. Ringworld's breathtaking size and Larry Niven's breathtaking imagination will keep you reading until the end and leave you wanting more. And of course, there are sequels! This is the real McCoy; accept no substitutes. Also remember: never eat food that has been dropped on the ground, then picked up by a Puppeteer. And *I'm* not going to be the one to tell why no one knows the location of the Puppeteer home world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for sentient creatures","review":"What a disappointment. I have to read this book for a class on sci-fi. Now I am a computers-are-sexy, nerf-sword-fighting, SETI-screensaving nerd...so I should know what to appreciate. Not this. Niven has a few shiny ideas; aliens use pleasure-stimulator guns as weapons, beings engineer gigantic hollow spheres and planet-ribbons that circle stars. But the 20-year-old chick in love with the 200-year-old protagonist makes me retch at her stupidity. Yes, Virginia, you wear more than slippers when you go out to walk on lava. If you are on the inside of a ring facing the sun--guess what?--the sun never sets. Eh. I'm not all the way through, so hopefully it gets better. The outlook, however, is grim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly awful","review":"It's one of the most stupid and most boring books I've ever had the misfortune to read. Granted, a gigantic ring encircling a planet is a compelling idea, but a book also requires a good plot and interesting characters; this book had neither. If Ringworld is considered a science fiction classic, the science fiction genre must be littered with junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing; Niven could take some pointers from Asimov","review":"I'm glad I bought this with a gift certificate. Niven seems to be too busy trying to impress with his scientific knowledge to take time to entertain. I read 2/3 of the book and finally gave up. I don't really care about the characters and I don't really care about Ringworld or its inhabitants. He should follow Asimov's lead and make the science serve the story instead of the other way around. If you like hard sf that actually entertains while making you think, try Stephen R. Donaldson's 5-volume GAP cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I had read about Ringworld for many years before I finally picked up a copy through Amazon. I eagerly awaited it, and thought of terms like 'majestic' and 'awe-inspiring' which I would apply to it when finished.Now I have the book Im not sure I CAN finish. While the idea of a 'Ringworld' is fascinating, Larry Niven fails to deliver any of this interest. His characters are rather tired, and lame, and boring. His writing is slow, lacking in detail where it matters, overly detaile din other parts, and always boring.It must be kep in mind that by the time I started this, I had just finished Orson Scott Card's superlative 'Ender Saga' - so perhaps I expected too much, by expecting someone to write with Orson's brilliance.Perhaps not. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a grand mess...","review":"I can't understand how this book has become a \\"classic\\" of science fiction. This was my second attempt to read this book, and this time was just as slow and tedious as the first. I hesitate to review a book I didn't finish, but this was so bad, I couldn't resist. Ringworld is loaded with flat, uninteresting characters and situations that didn't hold my attention at all. It was as if Niven threw many good individual concepts onto the pages, but couldn't figure out how to cohesively link them together. Oh well, I can always look at the wonderful Puppeteer painting in Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials and give a slight bit of gratitude to Niven for coming up with that character."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I looked Like Larry Niven, I'd hate women too","review":"I don't understand how this book became a classic beyond a very interesting concept. The story itself is not very compelling, the science proves shoddy over and over under any examination and the characters are one-dimensional, unless they are female, in which case they have no dimension. Niven relegates all females into the role of bimbo, sex-slave, or vegetable. In fact, the main character is 200 years old and manages to have sex with every woman he comes into contact with. Do you get the feeling that someone is projecting? Niven seems to reveal himself to be a sad, sexist nerd who had one solitary good idea and just really lucked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck was this?","review":"I heard all kinds of good things about this book, so I decided to give it a try. Wow. The characters are somewhat thinner than cardboard, the writing is childlike, and very, very bizarre. English grammar was not a prerequisite here. I read a novel a week, and this one ended up in the trash can about half way through. Strange, and yet somehow dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paucity of Imagination","review":"Ringworld is soooooooooooo big. Big deal.When I read sci-fi, I hunger for people and events unextrapolatable from the known. In short, things previously unimagined, rather scaled-up things known.From the foregoing, you might get the idea I hated the book.You'd be wrong.Instead, I was disappointed by it, which is worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist Crap","review":"Oh, I could write a lengthy, detailed review. But it doesn't really deserve that. It's a book full of sexist crap that someone writing in the late 60's should've known better than to do. That it won the Nebula just makes me disappointed in the Nebula voters of 1970. :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh... never again!","review":"I read Larry Niven's Ringworld on advice of a friend. I had heard of it and knew it was considered to be a landmark work of science fiction. I'm glad I didn't read it before I learned to love science fiction. I might never have picked up another.I found this story to have almost no character development. None of the characters were likeable and I could not have cared less if one or all of them died along the way.Niven spent pages describing mental ramblings of these annoying people and one sentence on the important plot developments. Sometimes I actually had to go back and find the one sentence that I had missed in order to find out how huge changes had happened.I found the \\"culture\\" that had been created for the Ringworld to be improbable as well as depressing. There is so much that could have been done with the premise that just wasn't.I won't read another Larry Niven novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disappointment","review":"I was unfamiliar with the term \\"School and Library Binding Edition\\" and was very disappointed in the product. I was looking to replace my well-worn original paperback with something more permanent, but this is a very poor reproduction copy the same size as the paperpack, with a cheap pasteboard binding slapped around it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ringworld","review":"This is a book EVERYONE should read. Put it all together and you have a comprehensible view of man and what makes him tick. Also a scary look at our inevitable fate, which we seem to be hurrying along. The punch line of the story shows the error of our way of thinking and treating the planet. Maybe being born in the country, on a farm, helped me get it. Oh, and it is a great adventure getting there. Sci-fi at its entertaining and educatable best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that inspired \\"Halo\\" (and other video games)","review":"I remember picking this book from the library and thinking \\"Oh! This must have been the basis for the gameHalo.\\" After reading it, however, I realized that this book was also the basis for other video games, such as theWing Commanderseries of games and (for at least one interesting plot twist)Master of Orion 2. (I won't put any spoilers in this review, but the twist has to do with an odd trait that you can add to your custom race in MOO2.)The book was a fun read with a few \\"deus ex machinae\\" to get around potential problems before they ever come up, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief enough to imagine a world that is 93 million miles in radius, I don't think you'll have much problem with some of the other plot work-arounds.All in all, a fun book that is sure to fire the imagination, but not really that much of a hard sci-fi (i.e., \\"this might happen in our future\\") novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 gold rings","review":"This is one of the masterpieces of hard-science fiction novels, though that is one of its problems. Its power lies in working out the dazzling scientific premise -- what would an artificial world built on an immense scale be like? The novel has two big flaws, however. Once the characters double back on their path and Niven has no more novelties to present, he seems to lose interest in the story. More importantly, the novel exhibits dated 60s attitudes about condescending to and exploiting \\"natives\\". (By the time he started writing the sequels Niven was clearly aware of this, and had his hero treat the Ringworlders as equals and with respect from then on. But the original novel couldn't be rewritten)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had high hopes for this one, but it didn't deliver","review":"I've been told that I should read the other Ringworld books and that they would give me a better appreciation for this one, and so I probably will. The premise of the book is inherantly weak. I feel bad saying that, but it's just true. I feel that Niven had this cool idea for a world, physics-wise, and tried to throw up a story around it as an excuse to explore that world.The plot, what plot there was, just didn't go anywhere. The characters were so-so. It really may be much better in a larger context, and since I really like Niven, I'm going to give it that chance.I have to say that overall, I'd call this book fairly dull and unmemorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but not for kids!","review":"Thanks to the review noting the sexual content of this book. I had bought it for my 14 yr. old son on someone's recommendation but then decided to read it first. It's a shame that the author goes into so much gratuitous detail. My son would have liked the book but I think I'll wait 10 years to give it to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but very bad written","review":"The describe of the characters of the crew, their relations ships and motivation is incredible bad! I heard so much of this book and then it was a desaster! The points are only for the good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second to none!","review":"Hmm... only a thousand words. I cant begin to EVEN explain how good it is. the concepts are NOT far fetched (10 years maybe) clear concrete, 2 headed aliens, a colossal cat with the biggest chip on his shoulder, shall I go on? The concept on going to distant reaches of space to find a ring around a sun is kinda kooky but, it is the best book Ive ever read. I compare ALL books I read with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Builder of Worlds, no Societies, not Human!","review":"As we speak, as close as we human's can come to building a Ringworld is through the emerging Computer Animation technologies. So, some one out there, build it we will come. This is what Close Encounter's did for UFO buff's. Now those of us with enough imagination and intelligence have an author who can see The Bigger Picture .BRAVO Mr. Niven!MORE Mr. Niven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but NO","review":"I'm only sixteen but this book was really a disapointment. I had to do this for a report. I mean the idea about a ring world is great-no fantastic, but he just can't get a good story going to support it. The plot was lame. These guys are so intriged about this ring around a sun and end up crashing on it. And they want to try and find a way off it? If their so interested why not study and look around first than leaving. The characters are interesting but stupid. An overgrown catlike guy, a 2headed scared freak, a 200 year old man who, i have to admit, starts off humorous but then dies down to annoying. Then there's this girl who was bred for luck that likes this 200y guy. I've heard of marrying someone older than you but this is just unbelievable. And what kind of idiot would breed someone for LUCK?! It was very slow, boring, and not even exciting. I'll have to agree with these people, it was really terrible. If i was Niven, i would think about rewriting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time...","review":"This book is a fine example of the kind of scifi I don't like. It's completely nonsensical(is that a word?) and incoherent. It's like the author wrote out what he had dreamt or something exactly as he dreamed it. I suppose if you like science fantasy like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy then you would probably like this,, but fans of military sci fi or 'honest' sci fi I think wouldn't like it. I don't understand why it's considered some kind of great classic myself, it was awful. No offense Larry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"This book is very predictable, with bad charactor development, a low pace and no redeming fetures. It s the first book I have read by this author and I will not read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this win awards???","review":"After reading The Mote in God's Eye, I thought for sure that Ringworld would be even better. It was so boring that I gave up at page 100. I really can't make up my mind which character I hate the most. I think it is probably the cat guy (Speaker). What hurts the most is that I bought the book brand new (about $13 in Canada). To think there were sequels and spin offs... outch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It really made me kind of ill...","review":"I am not what you might call a militant feminist, but I have to say this is one of the more sexist books I have read. This is too bad, because the idea of Ringworld is pretty interesting.However, of the two female characters, one is only invited to join the expedition because she is lucky, and is therefore an airhead. The other, whom they come across toward the end of the book, is basically a sex slave. Not to mention the fact that in the alien races, the females of the species are basically vestigial, existing only for reproduction. I know this doesn't really sound that bad, but the way it is written makes it horribly worse.With some authors, I can forget about this kind of thing and just concentrate on the story, but Niven's writing was just not interesting enough to take my mind off it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad science and fiction","review":"If you have ever wondered why science fiction have bad reputation outside the field, look no further. The reason is that genuinely bad books are hailed as science fiction classics. Rinworld is such a book and a reason why science fiction is laughed at.Ringworld is a gadget story. That is, a book whose only noveltry is some gadget, in this case the ringworld, otherwise characterised by bad writing and plotting.The science is wonky as well. The concept of genetic luck is of course unintentionally funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most imaginative books i have read","review":"Trying to visualize the Arc at night was what caught my imagination. Larry Niven has got easy style of writing and if you read this in the context of the 'known space' it is fascinating how he unfolds the entire history of a 1000 years. Maybe that is just the way we may go. Isaac Asimov has mainly human beings in his Foundation Saga but Larry Niven brings in various other species and this is more probable."},{"rating":"1","title":"had to force myself to read the whole thing","review":"the style is choppy, the characters unbelievable and poorly developed and the story had nothing that held me in its grasp except the desire to finish the book. some of the ideas were interesting, but they were underdeveloped. for example, tell me more about the puppeteers. that could be some thought provoking science fiction. leave out the attempts at ironic contrasts of non-existent societies. they weren't even worthy of bad science fantasy. basing an entire book on a modification of the dyson sphere is no reason for praise. i plan on reading one more in the ringworld series to see if the writing improves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"For me reading Ringworld was, in a word, painful. I understand that a good deal of this pain came from the fact that I am not a fan of \\"hard science\\". Yes, the concept of the Ringworld and Dyson spheres is facinating, I even like the idea of genetic luck, but I simply didn't enjoy reading 300 pages of pure technical description. I would have read that and more if there had only been some decent character interaction. There were glimmers of hope when the puppeteer's plotting came out, but no, the characters simply went their seperate ways and ignored one and other, as if Niven himself was afraid to concieve their emotions. Instead of focusing on these interactions we were left with the only character that did not seem to care who also did not want to talk about it and only contacted the interesting characters when he wanted to talk about the technical aspects of their escape. Overall I feel that there were the seeds of an interesting story, but they failed to flourish."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this won a Hugo","review":"With a mysterious ringworld, this book had a lot of potential for action and intrigue. Instead, four characters drive their flycycles across an endless plain with nothing too exciting happening along the way. I just didn't care about the weak premise or characters. One of the main threads of the story having to do with luck is novel but ultimately stupid.This book was a huge letdown for me. I was going to put it down halfway through but thought that it's a revered book... maybe it's just slow to build and will pick up as details about the ringworld are revealed. I wish I had stopped.I am not tempted in the least to read the sequels, even though they may explain more about the ringworld; I no longer care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ring World","review":"My Godson said this was a must read. I totally enyoyed it and could completely understand the way this book has been embraced by all who read it. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligently designed book","review":"The construction of a ring shaped world is conceived and physically built by humans in the futures past. It's area is 3 million times the size of Earth's. It was ingeniously designed as an answer to overpolulated worlds. It is also noticed by the puppeteers, an advanced race of apparent cowards that are terrified by it's awesome presence. They choose a crew of 2 humans (one intelligent and one lucky) 1 kzin (a humanoid cat-like warrior)and 1 insane puppeteer to investigate it. A tanj perfect plan!This was a fun read. I am starting to see that Niven seems to tend to write stories that hint at a belief toward intelligent design. But his ideas of intelligent design are more scientific and less religious. His stories seem to politely scoff at those who worship diety. It's a very interesting concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great classic","review":"Ringworld is a marvellously inventive story - two humans and two Aliens, a cariverous, Cat-like kzin and a herbiverous puppeteer - set out to explore a vast world built in a ring around a sun, with a surface area of billions of square miles on which all kinds of societies can flourish. Niven is a trained mathematician, and it makes the story more satisfying that the maths are worked out plausibly. It deserves its many awards for sheer non-stop inventiveness and action. The characters are plausible and fascinating, too. There is a website \\"Known space\\", devoted to Niven's works, if anybody doesn't know, and a brilliant new book of the wars of humans and Kzin, The Wunder War, set in the same universe, published recently. There have been two sequels to \\"Ringworld\\" published and another due out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all hardcore SF fans","review":"A great book that you can read over and over again and findit new and exciting each time. Niven introduces us to ahost of characters each unique with their own vews,culture, and way of life.As for Ringworld itself, it is a masterpeice of Niven'simagination and his skill of weaving a world so real, it'sas if he was actually there.A must for all SF fans, and for those just discovering thewonders of this genre, a great introduction to the world ofhard-core science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Interesting and Enjoyable Tale.","review":"This is certainly an enjoyable work of science fiction--Niven spins a good tale. The characters are interesting and diverse, and the concept of the \\"ringworld\\" itself is intriguing. My only problem with Niven's work is that at times it goes far afield and there are a few concepts developed incompletely. But this does not take away from the enjoyment he gives. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"An entertaining look at a world that is a thin ring thousands of miles long. This is a classic and mind-blowing piece of hard science fiction, with the emphasis on the cool implications of the enormity of Ringworld. The characters tend toward the scifi cardboard cutouts familiar to the genre, but this is not to be missed for scifi fans.A better Niven book for the characters, although not the science, is Footfall. Also check out the Mote in God's Eye, a fascinating look at a totally alien world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"A great Sci-Fi book that is not to be overlooked by anyone who considers him/herself knowledgeable in the realm of Science Fiction. One of those flawed but amazing works that stands as a benchmark in the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny book that peters out at the end.","review":"This book has a cast of interestisting, but unbelievable characters doing interesting, but unbelievable things. It is not quite as funny as hitchhikers guide, but the ideas make up for that. Towards the end I think the author lost interest so it sort of dies, but it is worthwhile nonetheless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning concept, brilliant ideas, flawed execution.","review":"I read this book when it was first published, again about 10 years later, and once again recently. In all that time, my impression of it has not changed. I have been a science fiction addict all my life, and a fan of nearly everything Niven has done. But not this. While it contains interesting characters and some strikingly original ideas, it suffers from the same disease as Tom Clancy's more recent novels: it drags. God, how it drags. Finishing it was a major chore, all three times. Like Clancy's recent work, this would be twice the novel if it were half as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concepts, bad execution","review":"While the ideas and concepts of the Ringworld are pretty good, the book overall is BORING. Niven comes up with a creative setting, but then you read page after agonizingly dull page waiting for just something to happen. And when things of interest finally happen, they're rushed. The societies and people the main characters encounter are poorly developed and feel like they were just thrown in. Ultimately, it's ok, but definitely nothing fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"The idea, at least, was promising. Unfortunately, Niven writes poorly - certainly not at a level that would be acceptable in any other genre of literature. His alien characters felt more like B-movie human actors dressed up in bad costumes. I wouldn't recommend this to any adult, since there are far more literate works of science fiction, and I certainly wouldn't recommend this to young teenagers, since it is mostly sexist drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I listened to this book on audio book and was thoroughly bored. The story and plot were a thin covering on an overindulgence in trying to create future science that is completely unlike anything else. It's like the author was so interested in trying to ensure that every facet of life was so unique in his world that he completely neglected the story and character.To echo what some others said the crude sexual bits only detracted more from the story.The actual ring world is an interesting construct and an original idea, but the rest is just eh.I'd heard for years how great a book this was, now I just wonder if I read the same book everyone else read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be.","review":"I had heard about this book for years. All I had read of Niven's was the \\"Integral Trees\\" and that was horrible, but I thought I'd give this a try. I felt like I was watching a cartoon. The characters were plastic, the story was tedious and dull. I thought of all the stuff I could set on Ringworld and none of it was there; nothing was there. I'd like to know what happens in the sequel, but I don't think I can make through another page by this guy.P.S. The concept of psychic luck is so stupid I almost stopped reading the book every time they mentioned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the hype -- where's the hoopla?","review":"Reading through the reviews, I guess I am not the only one who thought this book needed just a bit more to make it interesting. I DO read A LOT of sci-fi (with P.K.Dick as my unchallenged favorite) and did not get the enjoyment out of Ringworld that I was expecting from so much hype. His ideas are unique, but there was nothing in the novel that kept me up till the wee hours reading (e.g., I just wasn't captivated). Needless to say, I won't be finishing this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"never delivered","review":"I ordered this product and was eagerly awaiting its arrival.

The best song on there is probably Maniac in the Braniac with Ice Cube, which he flows like crazy, then Mack 10 joins in. Holiday and Lunitics in the Grass are pretty good, too.

He chose to write a book of interconnected stories so that the protagonist of each story blends into the supporting cast of the others, making the collection even more enjoyable. This is a kindness to the reader, because one story isn't enough time spent with stellar dudes like Ptolemy Bent and Folio Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"FutureRacism","review":"While the style of the writing is good, and the idea is awesome (which caused me to buy the book), the race issue is very important to Walter. He purposely inverts old school white-black racist stereotypes, where instead of blacks are lazy, suspicious, and criminal-minded, the whites are. The black man in jail was put there unjustly, and he's innocent. This can very well be the case in real life, but this is not common. EVERYONE in jail pleads innocence and framing. Walter Mosley had a great idea for a story, but ruined it with his apparent hate of the white man. I regret that I funded his racism propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"topnotch science fiction!","review":"Life in America a generation from now which isn't that different except the drugs are better & the daily grind worse.

After several hours, in spite of valiant attempts to like this work, I gave up. Driving in silence seemed a great relief. I found the stories to be highly predictable in their plot and outcome. The characters and plot lines were poorly developed and fragmentary. Adding to the agony was a narrator who's vocal talents were highly limited. Attempts to mimic accents or speech impediments resulted in nearly unintelligible results, adding \\"insult to injury\\". The juvenile nature of this work along with the poor narration results in an unacceptably poor overall experience. While the written version of this work may alleviate the limitations of the narrator, I remain highly doubtful that attempts to slog one's way through these unremittingly (and VERY predictably) dark and poorly written works would be worth the time investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are vignettes ...","review":"...not stories. They are not complete, but rather seem to have been truncated. They progress, developing an idea, then suddenly stop without closure or release. The ideas explored are quite interesting, to be sure. In fact, I'd like to see this world developed as a novel. But the rythmic problems of this writing will have to be addressed. Give me a reason to keep reading.To be fair, the ideas in the book may be given closure in the final stories. I'll never know, as I've found the experience so unpleasant that I won't finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great example of cyberpunk","review":"Mosley's collection of short stories is one of the most enjoyable and thought-provoking examples of cyberpunk to date. Many times the genre of cyberpunk relies on worn-out tropes and oft-used plot-devices in order to drive the story; the world Mosley creates is an immensely intricate one. This book is also one of the few cyberpunk book that adequately explores themes of race, gender, and class--it's perfect for the college classroom, or just for a quiet afternoon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance and mystery tied together","review":"In a beautiful and deceptive way, Reynolds uses the disappearance of a daughter to introduce the reader into a world that is moved, disrupted and changed by the human heart.

Unless it's absolutely full the shoes will fall over and might fall on the floor in the back, where they are hard to get out. You can not store expensive shoes in here because they will get damaged. You also can not use it for everyday storage because when you take out a shoe to wear, the rest are unsupported and fall. I suppose it's okay to use for your seasonal stuff. Also, the finish is pretty near black; it's a very very dark brown.

Instead, Gerd flies into downtempo territory, with flares of Brazilian and Latin music. And, as an album, it's quite good in itself. \\"Malaguena\\" has such a wonderful bass and sparkling melodic line that it's impossible to frown while listening to it. \\"Clarao De Lua,\\" with its mysterious and delicate Portuguese vocals, is comparable to anything the Thievery Corporation has done, while \\"I Dream You\\" is a easygoing journey through Relaxville. The Latin influences are in full effect on \\"Que Mango!\\" and \\"Another Kind of Spring\\" skims along on a nice double bass. Sure, given the proliferation of Latin-based downtempo, it might not be the most unique, and certainly it's not as influential as their debut album, but it's solid music nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Came to Life","review":"I have owned this album since its debut in '97, but never really paid any attention to it.

How can someone take a story about murder, rich movie stars on vacation, and romance and end up with something so predictable, trite and boring? None of the characters were interesting or even distinguishable. Worse of all, the writing style was so dully flat that I felt like the author was whacking me on the head with each sentence. There is such a thing as excellent, entertaining trash that evokes emotion - Nora Roberts, Olivia Goldsmith, etc. The only reponse this book evoked was the realization that I wasted an afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE SLOWEST MOVING BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!","review":"How did this book ever get published? It was the most boring thing that I've read this year. The entire book is about 474 pages. Just imagine wasting all that time for nothing. I believe that this novel should be considered general fiction and nothing more. There was some romance in it, but hardly any suspense. It just went on and on. The main characters went to about a thousand dinner parties and banquets. That took up about 75 pages in all! Nothing exciting happened at all until about page 250. But don't get me wrong, Laura Van Wormer is a good writer, because I'm reading \\"Talk\\" and loving it! Just trust me, save your money on \\"Just For The Summer.\\"Brad Stonecipher"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this author working out of a cave or a former nun?","review":"I actually laughed in places when I read her stiff attempts at pretending to be of this century. I don't need a lot of sexy stuff to keep me hooked, just a decently plotted story (no go) and a main character I can care about. I would kill this girl if she were my houseguest.

The humor in her songs is compelling. Some songs deal more with the civil rights movement, but address it from a very personal viewpoint. Even if you think you don't like country western music, the songs on this album will change your mind and have you singing along.

I wished this desk could swivel from the base. And I wish the table edges could be more protected. My wrists get marked from the steep ridges. Also the tool that is included for installing the base is very weak and easily bent. The bottom bolts have difficulty bolting 100%; however it does not affect the table.Otherwise, the wheels move really great. Installation is a breeze.

This is surprising given that I find plotting difficult and cumbersome...it's almost an affectation with me and, as I know, with other writers of \\"literary\\" fiction, too. Unfortunately, \\"literary\\" means all too often that the story doesn't meet John Gardner's briiliantly conceived criterion of story as a \\" vivid and continuous dream\\" in the reader's mind...Plotto makes plot seem if not easy but at least doable, it takes away some of the mystery and replaces it by craft.

First failure was a noisy fan, starting after a couple of months and which ultimately ended up cutting out entirely. I was able to replace this myself after finding the part, but it's clear they're using the most low budget fans they can find (and there are two mini muffin fans inside that aren't identical). And now the left channel speaker output has started cutting out, mostly only working when the unit is warmed up and even then somewhat intermittently. I'm not sure I'll bother to fix it at this point, and instead invest in something better.

I am an avid shooter as well an active amateur radio operator (HAM) so learning that the author of the book - Hiram Percy Maxim - son of Hiram Maxim (inventor of the first 'real' machine gun), I simply had to have it.

This expert history goes into great detail about the political and diplomatic context, with particular attention to the Habsburg obsession with Louis XIV's France.

The book includes some black and white plates and several maps. Fine scholarship, though not light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Execrable Writing","review":"Despite a potentially fascinating topic, this is by far the worst-written history book I have ever come across. I put it aside years ago as unreadable, but recently I picked it up again, thinking -- hey, interesting topic, it can't be as bad as I remember it. It is, and even worse. And I see that this view is echoed in the reviews of Stoye's 2007 rehash of the same topic.It seems as if Stoye assembled a pile of note cards without a coherent thought on any card, and then threw them together, exponentially multiplying his incapacity for coherent thought and narrative. How could any self-respecting editor allow this kind of stuff to go through? The answer has to be that Stoye's writing is beyond editorial salvage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Misleading title...

And also for style.Anyway, I give it 4 stars because it is definitely a wallet chain, it hooks to your belt loop, and it is exactly as advertised.

She reminds me of one of my old friends.The things that go on in this book will definitely take you from one extreme to the next. I also like the fact that there is drama in more than one place, for instance I love the issue between the supporting characters and how they all tie up together because of Quanda.

In addition, Mr. Womack uses terms like \\"slash-and-burn\\" to describe the agricultural methods used by indigenous farmers in Chiapas, without mentioning the fact that the jungle soil to which they have been driven is, as most farmers could easily tell you, about the worst soil possible for farming. So-called \\"slash-and-burn\\" is about the only possible alternative on such soil, but the term leads the reader to believe that the indigenous people are poor farmers. They are not.

This is music that invites the listener in rather than coming out and grabbing. It requires concentration, for the beauty lies in the detail rather than in the aggression, but it's an effort that well repays itself.

The fact that it loosens by the ties in both the front and back allows it to be put on easily.HOWEVER, I have tried the dress on twice now and while tying the string on the front the second time, the very top grommet fell out of the material. Of course, this does not instill a lot of faith in the other grommets maintaining their rightful place on the dress, so I'm extremely disappointed. Especially since I likely won't be able to wear it to the party I purchased it for without fearing the material with rip without the grommet.Needless to say, if you plan on wearing the dress once or twice, it's a decent purchase...but don't expect it to last much longer, or you'll be disappointed like me. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE SHELVES","review":"I literally have ONE DOZEN of these shelves in various places in my home.

This series amazes me somewhat because I lived in Long Beach where Charlie lives and in L.A. a few years ago, and never met any characters quite like she has in her stories.

The concept is good. You don't have to spend time developing. However, you can find these applets on the web and you won't learn A SHRED of Java applet programming. You can download an un-jarrer (to decompress the resulting jar files that are created) and a decompiler (to get to the source code of the class files). That doesn't help because you land up with code that's hard to understand (for example, it's hard to find where some of the extended classes come from). The book gives a plug-in that you can use to change SOME of the characteristics, but it's painfully inflexible in general. Therefore, what's the purpose of the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless applets! Authors, please set up a help site!!!","review":"In short, this book is useless. The applets don't work all the time. I got those errors like \\"Applet ABC can't init: NEW\\", \\"Applet ABC can't start: ERROR\\" on my work PC. There is no place to get help: no email addresses from the authors, no mailing list, no nothing. This is frustrating. The applets were just not tested well in all scenarios by the authors. To help your readers, authors, please spend sometime to set up a site with frequently asked questions. Until then, to my dear friends/readers, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS USELESS BOOK!!!!

This book isn't for you...","review":"If you're interested in the actual programming of Java then this book is not for you.

All 3 cans tip back with little or no effort. The gun itself is even worse! Only if a child is as strong as an adult can they pull back on the plunger. Then it locks up so you cannot pull the trigger back no matter how old you are! If adults get frustrated with this toy, you know a 4 year old will. My 9 year old can't even get it to work~now that's sad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Just like the other reviewers we had bad luck with these. We ended up with two of these for the girls' birthdays and neither worked well. The guns were too hard for either of them (ages 5 and 7) and they would break every other shot, my husband even took them apart and put them back together to no avail.The cans were hard to pull up and if you did finally got lucky enough to knock them over they would just fall. It never worked right... Not worth the time, money or space it takes on the game shelf. I strongly recomend finding something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Purchased this toy for my four year olds birthday and he wasso excited.

My son received this \\"toy\\" for his birthday. The kids had fun with it for a few minutes, but the gun is very hard to work.The ball must be pushed in just far enough for it to gun fire and my son also pinched and cut his finger on the trigger. The cans are tricky for kids to pull up, and they kept falling over and \\"crunching\\" before they could get all three to stay up to even play the game. Even the adults were getting frustrated with setting the cans up! Well anyway, the kids lost interest in it in about fifteen minutes, and one of the cans broke and no longer stays up. Which is fine with me because I feel that my son doesn't need toy guns anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a dime!!","review":"I bought this for my 2 boys thinking they would love it....they did for about a minute until the gun broke!! The trigger thing is too hard for a kid to pull back so an adult had to do it but then if you pull too hard it breaks. It worked 1 time, we thought it was just a defective toy so we took it back and exchanged it for another. The same exact thing happened. Also having never been used, one of the cans we never even were able to get it to stand up. This is a good concept for a toy but it needs a HUGE improvement. Highly advise to NOT BUY.

After reading the other reviews, I wanted to take this back to the store, but alas he insisted on keeping it. It is not as bad as the other reviewers say, but it is rather poorly designed. The cans do stay up. My son can pull the trigger by himself, though I don't see how because it is difficult for me. The noises are repeatitive and irritating. And once the cans have colapsed, it is very difficult to pull them straight again and my son cannot do that on his own. To pull the cans back straight, you have to pull very hard and twist ever so slightly. It takes several tries for me to set each one back. I hope he gets bored with it soon. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this toy!","review":"We received this toy for Christmas this year. It was such a cute idea, and my 4 year old son was so excited to play with it, that we opened it right away. As you will see all the other reviews, he didn't even get to pull the trigger once. It jammed, and uncle took the gun apart to try to fix it, to no avail. I hadn't read the reviews; just took it back to Toys R Us to try to get a new one. Good thing I didn't find it.

It's pretty much common sense. To summarize this book, you should: ask a lot of questions to a potential mentor as well as other individuals who have worked for him or her. You should not: procrastinate, sleep with your mentor, or work with someone just because they're famous. Honestly, that's about all I got out of this book.

I had seen many a bad review from mags and others, but that is because they have no clue about music and how it should be played(so it feels good, not that it follows main stream bands and how everybody thinks a song should be played) Les and company dont follow the set rules and that makes their music all the more acceptable and likeable by us non following top 40 listening loosers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's dark, but only dark-ER","review":"People love to point to Pork Soda as Primus' \\"dark\\" album in one way or another. I will grant them this much: Yes, the album is fairly dark. Darker than others before it for sure. But I take issue with this moniker to some degree. SSoC depicted \\"American Life\\" in very prostrate terms; it spoke of drug problems among workers, etc. The messages are still similar, but perhaps this time the music reflects them more accuratelyMusically, this album is SOLID. If you have any admiration for Les Claypool, this album is for you. It has all of Primus' early instincts.

When I started listening to it I wasn't sure what to think of it. the bass playing was great but I couldn't really understand the lyrics and some stuff didn't seem to fit on the album. Then after a while it started to grow on me and I started liking some songs which progressed into alot of the songs on the album.

And since his birthday is so close to Christmas we do not always have \\"Birthday\\" wrapping paper on hand.

I won't have another bite","review":"I used to be fond of that comic strip as it was released daily in your paper.but 15 years or so later, it looks like the strip really lacks diversity. it always gets back to a very limited amount of key issues or gags and over 25 pounds later (it's heavy not only because of its completeness but also because the publisher obviously picked the heaviest stock available) you're getting bored of the same situation coming over and over again.not to mention the average job the publisher did at designing the set.you might want to stick to your old soft paperbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Set","review":"There is not much more I can say about this set other than its awesome. It contains all the Calvin and Hobbes comics and that right there says it all. The binding is very high quality so this should last you a lifetime (so you can pass it down generation to generation and everyone can enjoy the best comic strip ever written).If your looking for the complete collection this is the set for you. Just be aware that the books are very large and can be heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Heavy Collection","review":"I never bought any Calvin & Hobbes book before, so when I got interested in them, I decided to buy this massive collection. It really is heavy; carrying it will be sport, believe me. But it's worth it. The classiness of the thing is just grand: 3 volumes in a slipcase, there even were a thin sheet of paper to protect from friction and else. This may not be very important but I do enjoy the pickiness of all this.Now as to the cartoons themselves, well I do love Calvin & Hobbes. It's the smartest cartoon I ever read (just know I am not a cartoon specialist at all) and it is so profoundly humane and witty and clever and... and... and a lot of other things. I can't say enough about this article. The introduction, or preface, by Bill Watterson is quite good; and very interesting.This is a must for anyone who enjoys good cartoons. Definitely worth its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Collection Ever","review":"If you love Calvin and Hobbes then this is the pinacle of what you would want with a boxset.

This was the best Christmas present I have ever gotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomparable Comic Riches","review":"A while back I happened upon a few of the old Calvin and Hobbes compilations and upon reading them was reminded of just how rich and funny these cartoons were. When C&H finally walked off into the sunset, I eagerly awaited the final farewell strip, and was cruelly disappointed when the local news distributor declined to import any newspapers on that day. (I live on a remote Alaskan island) The Complete Calvin and Hobbes has healed that wound. I'd forgotten how funny, in particular the snowmen cartoons were. The 3 volume set is beautifully done, all printed chronologically and dated. Beautiful color repro, nice paper. Volumes are quite heavy.

It is such a shame that they did not put the effort into the binding for this makes the other quality moot for the volumes fall apart on first opening. At first we thought it was a quality control problem and we sent our first volumes back (all three volume bindings were broken front and back). When we got the second set, only one volume's binding was broken on first usage. We went to a book store to check them out and see if it was just our ones and the display volumes in the bookstore had broken bindings also. My son decided to keep the one we had, not wanting to risk getting a set with more volumes of broken bindings again and valuing the plates so much that he wanted it any way. As I started, it is such a shame that they did not bind these volumes correctly. They would be so much more valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calvin Rocks!","review":"Personally, as a fan of Calvin and Hobbes, I would love to have all the strips. The Complete would be much cheaper than buying all the books seperately. I never imagined that this sort of a \\"The Holy Bible of Calvin and Hobbes\\" would ever be released.

As far as this collection is concerned - the wonderful introduction by Bill Watterson (with a photo of his cat 'Sprite') is worth more than a single read.However, and this is a BIG however for folks who really love reading Calvin and Hobbes. The mammothine size of the volumes just makes it impossible to read these books as often and as comfortably as one would like to. They are unwieldy and cumbersome and they might just end up standing up on the book-shelf till kingdom come.My suggestion would be to buy the slimmer series and keep this horribly expensive edition on the 'wish-list' to buy when one is 75 and retired, and with a pension fund so that one can read the lovely introduction by Bill Watterson...and sit with these editions on a comfy chair next to one's personal library shelf with a pipe and some whisky if one so prefers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the Best present I bought a child.","review":"I was about to recycle a Calvin and Hobbes paperback an ex girlfriend gave me years ago.

Great for Calvin &Hobbes fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes","review":"This product, as all Calvin and Hobbes collections, contains wonderful strips that appeal to all persons from any aspect of life. It (as expected), contains ever strip Watterson ever had printed as well as his watercolors of Calvin and Hobbes. A wonderful product for dedicated fans or someone looking for a good laugh.However, one drawback with this product is the quality of it's binding vs. its size. Each book, being so large, puts heavy strain on it's binding which is a glue binding. If used with care the books will last forever, but we all know such careful care is virtually impossible so these books binding will eventually deteriorate. However this should not deter fans from buying this product as rebinding the books with a higher quality binder will solve this problem forever.Great Product, could be a little better, but it's one flaw is easily fixable.

A must-have for fans!","review":"This collection of my favorite comic strip of all time had been out for a few years before I finally put together enough disposable income to handle the hefty price. It was completely worth it. This collection is obviously intended for the serious Calvin and Hobbes fan, (guilty as charged) for kids or casually interested folks, I would recommend one of the other numerous collections.

I mean, like one book of Calvin and Hobbes is already a 5 star book. How about if I took the entire collection of Calvin and Hobbes and compressed into 3 hard cover volumes and nestled those into a decorative box. It would be about 35 stars at least out of 5 ... plus 2 bonus stars for coolness.Only problem is because of the weight, it's really hard to read while on the toilet. I'll need to setup a separate reading bracket to help support the weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"The BINDING makes this book a terrible value","review":"I wonder if Bill Watterson knows what a shoddy job Andrews McMeel Publishing did in presenting this utterly sublime material. Ive got phone books that are built better than this. This set was a gift from my Mom, and I'm not going to return it, but ALL THREE books were falling apart right out of the plastic wrapped box. I feel bad that Mom paid full price (and then 25lbs worth of shipping!) so if you're considering buying this, look to rummage sales and used book stores, (then use the poor condition of the spine to negotiate an even lower price.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Product is great!!!","review":"I luv Calvin and Hobbes, so though it has few drawbacks I still like this complete collection very much..Pro:Complete collection in one package.Good for an archival.Cons:Very bulky (23 pounds)hard bound is not really a hard bound, so you need to be carefull while using it, else the pages may comeout.you cannot really read it lying anywhere, require some patience to handle these heavy books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly, the last strip had to be bittersweet","review":"The very best comic, it is a letter to the editor of the world. It provides sighs (looking back at younger times [belive it or not, in 8th grade I still wish I was in first]), laughs, ect, ect. The one thing I didn't like is the last strip. Every time I read it, I cry. Goodbye, childhood freind, who brightened my day. Goodbye, mischevious tiger. Goodbye, panels that DID something, not just showing a change in time. Goodbye, perfect example of life, a summary, touching on everything, showing all. Goodbye, me, you, fantasmigorical bacrounds, unique are, Spaceman Spiff, who spends half his time crashing, Tracer Bullet, rampaging dinosaurs and crabby teachers. Goodbye, farewell, and good luck.

After a couple decades of hammering us with redundant reprint books, the kind that force you to buy every one of them so you can get a more complete collection, they finally publish the complete collection.But this collection is so shoddy that it is a crime. The materials used are junk, and pages fall out. Don't buy it. Or better yet, go buy all the past reprint books at used prices and you will conserve your money and there will be one less sale for this Andrews McMeel Publishing disaster.I would think a cartoonist that fought to keep his characters and strip from being licensed to death in other arenas (like toys and coffee mugs) would have more integrity and want to make a first class collection for his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"You already know","review":"You already know if you want this or not, c'mon.

Please believe me everyone, I don't know how it's possible that there are any great reviews on this book???????????? The writing is very amaturish - about what my middle school kids could do. How could this book even get published? Don't waste your money or time. I have read hundreds and hundreds of romance novels and this was one of only 2 or 3 that I couldn't finish. It was a long book, which is normally a plus in my opinion, because you can really get a good, full story.

I immediately downloaded them for kindle because I usually have better success with people's reviews rather than publishing companies. I was disappointed though. I just couldn't connect with the characters. It also read more like high school history than romantic historical fiction. It did have enough to keep me reading to find out how it ended, but barely. Some parts seemed to drag on forever and I wanted to give up completely. I am going to copy and paste this in the other 2 books reviews from this trilogy because none of them held my interest for very long and I felt the need to let someone who is looking for historical \\"romance\\" to keep searching.

There are few honest testaments from survivors of the late 70's. This one rang true to me. If you enjoyed Kem Nunn's \\"Tapping the Source,\\" John Keeble's \\"Yellowfish,\\" Rock Brynner's \\"The Ballad of Habit and Accident,\\" or Allan Weisbecker's \\"In Search of Captain Zero,\\" try this fascinating novel.

The warranty just ran out and the printer started to refuse to pickup even a single sheet of paper. Thankfully, my visa card is going to reimburse the $70 repair bill to replace what looks like $3 worth of rubber parts (pickup roller and page separator). It was a decent (yet low budget) color printer while it lasted (for a whopping 500 pages over 13 months). I don't plan on spending any more money on this thing. When it dies again, it's getting junked.EDIT: It died again. This is a terrible printer. It didn't even live lopng enough to get through the starter cartridges that shipped with it when new. How can a printer fail TWICE before the mini starter cartridges are even used up?DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor black imaging, paper jams, try Dell 1320c","review":"I bought this printer because I was tired of replacing injet cartridges and waiting for injet printouts. The small size of the printer for a color laser was very attractive. The printer, however, is fatally flawed. The black image quality is quite poor and at times unreadable, but we lived with it for most schoolwork. (The color was OK). The printer is very finnicky about the paper. Some types will always jam. Other types will jam frequently. So after about a year, I have given up on this printer. After some research, I purchased a Dell 1320c. After about a week, I am quite happy with this printer. It is larger, but the black and color print is better and so far no paper jams!. It also costs a bit less as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung CPL 300 Color Lased Printer","review":"The unit is small and fits on a desk.

I am very pleased with this purchase. It is quiet, fast and reliable. Anything that I have printed out in color looks fantastic! So, I don't have to yell at the kids anymore when they want to print things out. And I don't have to be so choosy about what I print out. Also, even though the cartridges that come with the printer are not considered 'full' cartridges, they are printing out a tremendous amount of work and there is still plenty of ink left. All in all, I am very pleased. Also, don't spend $30 for a printer cable in the name-brand stores.

Lousy quality.","review":"Purchased this laser printer for small office applications. Right out of the box had to return the first one. No good. Second one behaved better but was still flawed. Front panel wouldn't close properly. Had to tape it shut in order for the printer to work. Kept it anyway because it only cost about $100. Printer lasted about two years without problems (but keep in mind, it was used very little). Crapped out a few days after extended warranty expired. Now needs a new fuser unit. Fuser unit costs more than the printer itself. My printer is now a boat anchor. Oh well, the idea of an inexpensive color laser printer was great in theory, but the true quality of this printer is garbage. Not what I expected from Samsung. I will say it printed nice color and gave me semi-professional printing results. It's just that it's a piece of garbage and I can guarantee you the printer won't last long.

After reading the troubleshooting guide and comments on the internet, it was obvious it needed a new imaging unit. I purchased one of those and the unit worked fine (though the imaging unit squeaked). Three months later, there is light \\"streaking\\" across the page--top and at intervals. I give up.

It doesn't matter that I've only ever printed 3500 pages TOTAL on this printer, if it's more than a year they won't do a thing.

Luckily, it's easy to open and remove the jam- Samsung must've known the hassles that their printer causes. I would never recommend this to anyone I know. Maybe it's just my printer that has these problems, but even if it worked every time I still wouldn't recommend it. I'm a college student on a tight budget, and $200 is ridiculous for a printer that offers no other functions. Get an HP instead.

Photographic images are not very good; however, vector images are just fine. The killer for me was attempting to navigate the Samsung online repair website. I say \\"attempted\\" because I was unable to complete a repair request, ending up in a never-ending circle. I literally spent over an hour and never made it past step three of five!

All prints become faded, even with a new cartridge.Finally it has another common problem where the toner cartridges get kicked out of their bays and open the front panel halting printing.

And no, it wasn't my choice of paper - the paper I used was meant to be double-sided.To top it off, 4 months after purchasing the Samsung CLP, the paper would jam every single time I tried to print, and so I brought it to Best Buy and exchanged it.I'd recommend the HP Color Laser Jet, which runs for the same price (at Best Buy, that is).

She seems to be following in the footsteps of second-wave feminist poets who have covered similar ground, but much more effectively. The themes of Georgiou's work could be directly out of anything by Adrienne Rich or Marilyn Hacker but without the prosodic savvy or rich metaphors of either.This book was marketed on is \\"sexiness,\\" and I guess it has its sexy moments, but all in all, it's pretty lackluster stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great tools, BAD case","review":"I bought this because I wanted my grill tools in a case so I could keep them out of reach of my grandchildren.

Perry right now is a very hot producer and songwriter for singers like Christina Aguilera, Pink, Gwen Stefani, Kelly Osbourne and countless others. Her Beautiful song for Christina even won a Grammy! She has really come a long way from this already forgotten band,and I'm sure some of the members are in other bands or quit music.

The way she acts out her feelings and emotions just touch any person who watches this movie.I found all the kids and actors who contributed to this film very special. Each and every one of them was able to give you the feel of hope. The music was very inspirational and it could make you cry at times.Another thing I want to point out is about Roberta's family. Even if she and her husband got separated because he cheated on her, her sons were still very supportive and helped her all through joy and sorrow. It made me feel very touched to see both her sons helped her out in the concert. It's very rare to have a family like that - let me tell you.Overall, I loved the music and acting. It was very inspirational and touching. You must watch it!Kirstie Mabitad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music of the Heart...Excellent","review":"Giving Gloria Estefan her first film role, Meryl Streep an Oscar Nomination, and having Wes Craven as the director, \\"Music of the Heart,\\" makes an impact on everyone's heart. The story line is based on a documentary entitiled something like \\"Small Wonders\\" or something like that. It is included as a bonus disc on DVD as well as the theme song's video and so much more! I strongly recommend getting this title on DVD!***And if you are intreasted, also get the soundtrack!***"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY WARMS THE HEART!","review":"This is one of those films that renews your faith in society. I thought Meryl Streep did a good job, and Angela Bassett played her part very well...full of spunk and enthusiasm! Shes so beautiful! Amazing what can be accomplished in this world when we practice vision and self discipline. I also thought it was refreshing to not be faced with lots of romantic scenes. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The violins were incredible, i love the sound...to me it can be mesmerizing! The movie takes a bit of time to really get into, but once youre there its def worth the wait! I dont think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful movie.

Meryl Street and Aiden Quinn are two of my favorite actors. However, the big surprise for me was the companion documentary Small Wonders. My husband and I both teach music and marvelled at the work done by Roberta in her violin program. We were both in tears at the powerful success of this music program. I wish I could buy several copies of Small Wonders (haven't been able to locate it) so that I could give a copy to each of my students and their parents. Doing anything well...whether playing music, painting pictures, designing rockets, etc. takes an enormous amount of work and dedication.

If you are looking for a story that is similar to the story in the bible, this would not be your book. It is very different from that book in many ways; first of all Adam and Eve are raised by the Serpent and God, instead of being on the own. Eve and Serpent travel outside the Garden to see the world. The Serpent raises Eve and teaches her until she meets God and Adam. Then Eve takes lessons by God with Adam for a while until they are adults. Then in my opinion the book turns sour. God wants to test out reproduction and forces Adam to rape Eve. I stopped havig interest after that mainly, but found Eve and the Serpents travels interesting.

Why would anyone want someone to believe these horrible things when they are searching to find something so good. There is only one creator he is our Lord and Father he is not a man of evil and would never demand Adam to rape Eve. The devil did not raise Eve. If you are looking for answer about the bible this book is no place to turn. I hope all Christians will stand up against this book. God Bless those who read this and belive it.

It brews great coffee, is programmable for 1-4 cups, decaf (keeps it at a lower temp so you don't get a bitter taste, extra strong flavor setting and you can program it the night before so that it is brewing when you get up. It also does not have a warming pad so the coffee doesn't get overdone and it shuts itself off after two hours.

We tried the 4 cup setting and looked forward to savoring some Dunkin Donuts ground coffee.When it was ready, filled two regular size coffee mugs and tried it. It was warm, not hot - warm enough that you can just drink it down without sipping. Now I'm not a fan of \\"so hot you can't sip it without burning your lips\\" and \\"waiting 10 minutes for it to cool down\\" hot, and I'd read in other reviews that it wasn't going to be piping hot, but I would like my coffee hotter than this, preferably giving off a little steam too.It was also pretty weak - again other reviews mention the need to push the \\"extra flavor\\" setting. I don't see why you need to use special settings to get a reasonably strong cup - subject to the grounds you use of course.In any case we decided to clean it up, pack it back up and send it in for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS!!!

We have really enjoyed not having to use a carafe. It does make good coffee and it keeps it hot as advertised.The only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish the fill lines in the water reservoir in the front was a little bit easier to read. It is hard to tell how much coffee is in it sometimes.

The book had some anecdotes about the author's life that were okay but I was left uninspired.

This book does just the opposite. The autor talks about himself and how successful he has been, then launches into a loooooooooooooooooong fictional story of a day in the life of a Starbucks barista and how every interaction is a presentation. Is this book only about making that point?

I figured it was worth a try to boost my milk supply. It actually worked. I didn't see much of a difference taking 1 pill 4xs as per the instructions 1st recommendation, but I noticed a big difference after taking 2 pills 3xs a day (also per instructions). I did, however, quickly run out. I ordered a second bottle and found that my supply has re-established at a much higher production rate, and I didn't take any more of them. Also expect to be a little sweaty and to smell like maple syrup after its gotten into your system. The payoff was good and I would purchase them again if necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really works","review":"I started using More Milk Plus capsules when my supply was running low at the end of every day.

BTW brown rice works better for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced","review":"I had high hopes for More Milk Plus since it contained a blend of herbs. I thought it would work better than fenugreek alone or a nursing tea. This was not the case. I think More Milk Plus is overpriced. I got better results from either fenugreek alone (2-3 caps 3 times a day) or Yogi Nursing Mother's tea (3 cups a day). And they are cheaper. I will not repurchase More Milk Plus. After talking to other nursing mom's in a local breastfeeding group we have come to the conclusion that More Milk Plus works better for skinny moms that weigh less than 150lbs. For those of us who weigh more, and thus take the higher does, we did not see the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally NOT work for me!!","review":"I purchased this item based on the excellent reviews and recommendations.

When I use both products, my supply goes back up again, but not nearly to a level close to satisfying my baby's needs. However, if I don't take as many of these capsules or drink the tea as often each day, my small supply goes right down, so this product does do something to help at least.

BUT BEWARE people this book's not like that. It talks about a cripple named Benjamin Lebert and his boarding school mates. There's no action in the book, nothing to learn, nothing to get inspired by, nothing good in other words. All they do in the whole novel is going from one place to another and try to ponder on life, in a 16 year old point of view... but, not a very good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading numerous good reviews of Crazy in The New York Times and Salon.com, I was expecting a book worth my time. Unfortunately, my desire to read a good coming-of-age novel was not satisfied. More than anything else, it seemed that the book was about chicks and booze. Some of the book dealt with the main character's emotions, but half the time, those emotions were saturated with too much beer. If you want to read Crazy, borrow it from a friend or check it out of the library before you consider purchasing it. Or, if you are interested in reading a *good* coming-of-age novel, check out The Perks of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. It, too, includes chicks and booze, but are dealt with in a more heartfelt way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Reality at its best.","review":"I loved this book mainly because of the fact that because it was written by someone who wasn't so old that they forgot that parts of adolescence isn't a walk on the clouds all the time. The author was sixteen when he wrote the book and so was still in adoleecence. This book is a dose of reality for those who believe that growing up is all sweet and dandy. The writing is excellent because of the fact that it isn't sugar coated. The book is great in its straightforward manner. thats why I reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great writing for such a young author","review":"Beautifully written. It's hard to put down but the ending is sadly disappointing. The author leads you to think something big is going to happen but it was totally lacking of a climax and therefore fell quite short of the basic structure of a book. I realize the author was triying to be original and it was an exalent attenpt but it leaves the unsatisfied in the end. Other than the disappointing ending it was great and i think it was worth the $ i paid for it. I'd recomend it to my friends and i have.

Linkin Park a few years back had this same exact idea with \\"reanimation\\", which also flopped in the eyes of the fans and critics.This album would be fine if Bush made it available to the fan club members, or offered it for a reduced price, such as $5.99 or so, but to charge basically full price is a joke. This album is only targeted at current Bush fans, and Bush fans only.There's certainly no need to buy this album unless you get it for $1 or so, and you like the remix of the song \\"Mouth\\" which got decent airplay on radio all over the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Hurts Like Gavin's Mouth.","review":"This album is horrible. Gavin's Singing is worse than ever. There is not even a decent song on the album. Not only is the singing bad but the lyrics are pitiful they make no sense at all!

This album is the worst one out of all Bush albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remix Gone Bad","review":"I think the remix shouldn't have been done, because Bush does not have the type music to be written in a remix form.

This album has been severley criticized but I am certain that this album has a very rich galleria of sounds, rythms, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!! :(","review":"There is only one way to discribe this album and that is to say that it is pitiful. Bush, an excelent band, is one of the best bands I've heard after the grunge movement died out. By releasing this album, they've not only slapped all of their fans in the face but they've defiled their music and what people believed they were about. I am extremely disappointed that one of my favorite bands could turn around and do something that makes them no better then the pitiful sellout Backstreet Boys or Matchbox 20 for that matter. If you like Bush, do yourself a favor and buy \\"Sixteen Stone\\". Stay away from this compact piece of dung."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not what it should have been.","review":"I understand the point of remix albums as the original artists (or other artists/producers/etc.) want to make their previously released songs sound different. The issue is that Bush's music does not flow very well when it is remixed to electronic music. Bush's music would have come off better with industrial remixes. Instead we get bland 7:00 remixes of songs that sound like they came from rave clubs. People should turn elsewhere for a good remix album.

How can anybody like this c.d.!!!","review":"If you like techno stuff with synthesizers and stuff, you'll like this album. The songs don't even sound like their original versions!!! Most of the songs don't even feature all of the lyrics. Such as \\"Comedown (Lunatic Calm Remix) only repeats one line of the lyrics of the original song thorughout the whole song which is about 6 and a half minutes long. All the music doesn't sound the same either. It sounds more like 70's and 80's techno-pop than 90's alternative rock. So, if you're considering buying this c.d., I advise you DON'T!!!!!!! It is a complete waste of money! I have to force them to give me my money back!-Matt Laird"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This album is so lame. I guess Bush wanted to get rid of all the comments on being a Nirvana clone. I personally felt that they weren't clones at all and were BETTER than Nirvana. They screwed it up now. Who wants remixes? Bush successfully took all of their *excellent* songs and killed them. They massacred their songs. I couldn't even listen to 5 min. of this. THIS CD IS TERRIBLE! Buy the first one and hope they realize what mistake they have done.Sixteen Stone - MUST BUY IF YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC!!

ON \\"dECONSTRUCTED,\\" the tracks are nothing but electronica-like beats that seem to drag on forever. Every song (with the exception of the single \\"mouth\\") is just a headache-inducing mix of blips and beeps. In my opinion, BUSH should stick to what they're good at (making actual music), and forget about joining the fadish electonica wave.

These various techno artists were asked to remix bush songs so they did. And it's some damn good techno if I do say so myself. So, in refference to the comment below, OF COURSE NOT ALL THE LYRICS ARE USED! That's what a techno remix is!

While you howl with laughter, though, you also smile in sympathy with these deftly-drawn creations, and ultimately find your faith in your fellow man subtly restored as Cooper discovers, at the end of his quest, that his true fortune lies in his undiminished capacity to love.

All of the stellar reviews from Amazon had me totally conviced that this was the ultimate cure-all. Right? Wrong. As soon as it arrived at my front door, I Ran inside and literally used it three times that day. The Results? Non-existant. But I continued used thinking that i just hadn't given it enough time to REALLY work. Over a month later, I can safely say this product has done absolutely nothing for or against my skin; no refined pores, no cleared breakouts, no improvement in overall complexion. I felt the tingle people refer to after the application, but that's all that happened.

Massimini's approach is very immature. The best way to explain his philosophy is that of \\"the absorption of the self\\". His view seems to be that we, that is the layperson, knows best. That we can find our own salvtation in our understanding of ourselves. The traditions of two millenium is patriarchial.... His obsession of knowledge as being the \\"salvation\\" of the human race is just arogance.

Even this one, labelled \\"Best Of,\\" fails to deliver, although it does include a version of his June 1959 # 59 Hot 100 hit Danny Boy.Nowhere to be found, however, is the B-side, The Hungry Eye (Mercury 71442), nor are his \\"best\\" hit, Slow Walk, a # 3 R&B;/# 17 Top 100 in late 1956 on Mercury 70963 and its flipside, Wildwood, and the February 1957 # 74 Birthday Party on Mercury 71027 and its B-side, The Last Time.Finding all six original sides in one volume in CD format is impossible.And, as much as I love the tenor sax of Sil Austin (who once was featured in the Tiny Bradshaw band), I would not recommend paying the current used price shown as long as there are other options far less expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This book had its moments that was funny and it makes you think about our \\"church folks\\".

TDS was a sleek killing machine with the slogan \\"nothing can stop me now\\" pained on its hood in blood, and the fragile is an enygma of beautiful musical soundscapes and musical innovations that will take your breath away.NIN's unnofficial 2.nd album, Broken, is pure anger and angst. This thing will grab you by the throat and never let you go, pausing only briefly at track number #4, before crushing you down with 5 tons of steel machinery and human screams in 'happines in slavery'. this is DIGITAL ANGER at its best, this is every angry minds outlet, this is pure genius. and before you know it, the storm suddenly stops, leaving you confused, making you press the play button on the cd player again and again.This CD is the most condensed anger&fury filled music you will ever hear. And the kicker? ITS actually smart angry music, not some useless loud banging with suicide-ladden lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine Inch Nails: Broken","review":"This album is one of the best albums I have heard from Nine Inch Nails... It's an album that is honest and bold... At a time when the likes of Pearl Jam and Nirvana were playing it safe with the whole \\"Grunge\\" thing Nine Inch Nails released an album that opened eyes to bands like KMFDM and My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult. Trent Reznor made an album that shook the foundation of the music industry by releasing an album so different from the popular culture and succeeded by making it a name stay in every angst ridden or claimed to be angst ridden person around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Heaviest of NIN","review":"If you are one of those people looking for the heaviest Nine Inch Nails release, you've found it. 1992's Broken features \\"Gave Up\\", \\"Wish\\", and \\"Happiness In Slavery\\", three of the heaviest NIN songs to date. \\"Last\\" is very good as well.Being that it's the best EP release from Trent and Co, be sure to pick it up next time you stop by the old record store.You also get two hidden tracks (98&99) \\"Physical (You're So)\\" (A cover of the Adam Ant song), and \\"Suck\\" (not my personal favorite, but done very well live)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken record.","review":"Very good NIN ep that you could really just call an lp. I mean, there are alot of lp's with 9 tracks, and this has 8. Anyway, like others have pointed out, Trent seems a bit angry on this one. Broken reminds me of Ministry's album \\"Psalm 69\\", in that it's mostly fast and loud with alot of guitar on it. Definitely the most \\"metal\\" sounding overall of NIN's output. Some copies of Broken come with tracks 1-6 on the disc, and tracks 7-8 on a 3 inch mini-disc. I assume the initial copies. Cool to have unless you want them all on the same cd. Either way, Broken is as essential as any NIN before or afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Certainly Awesome","review":"This is definitely one of the greatest Nine Inch Nails releases ever! If you've heard \\"Fixed\\", then this is much the same thing, but it is much more harsh and abrasive. Two of the tracks, Pinion and Help Me I am in Hell, are musical interludes, but they make it work. The best two tracks here are Wish and Physical (A cover of an Adam Ant song). Simply awesome, and a must-own for any real fan of industrial music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it!!!","review":"My favorite track is \\"Gave Up\\", but the whole cd is wonderful.

No question. I think people just over look it becaue on the song shotage. \\"Last\\" is one of the most angry, and explosive songs I heard and is with out a dout on my list of favs and this c.d is on my fav c.d list. Not one bad song. Trent is a wizard at his music and a wizard at expresing his feelings though amazing music. If my have P.H.M or downward spiral this is a must have. IF you like the other Nin albums of just like heavy music this belongs in your colection. Worth the money.....Really!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too physical, but it doesn't suck","review":"Well I'm gonna fess up that my favorite song is \\"Too Physical.\\" It's fun to moan to.

But the best NIN is the fragile. Go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM, BUT NOT THE BEST","review":"NIN's goes more into guitars in this one, and not synthesisers and sound effects, and it's done rather well. It's definitely worth the green.I personally like \\"The Downward Spiral\\" a little better, cause it's a lot dirtier and rough. This ones rough, but not very dirty. Well, excluding the first song, \\"Wish\\" which pretty much tells everyone to go F--k themselves. The albums angry, but still fun to listen to. I love it, and recommend it to anyone who would like to like NIN but are not into keyboard pop like the first album, or rough and crude sound effects or wacky sinthesized songs like in the 3rd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overlook the extra tracks","review":"Great album. Tracks 98 and 99 aren't listed on the cover, and they're definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little short","review":"This album is, for NIN, a definate change. It isn't as techno-pop oriented as the others and is maybe the most angered of them all. Leaning more on the lines of full industrial, this album is a pulse pounding ride through a demented and tormented mind. The in your face riffs and lyrics never let up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine Inch Nails \\"Broken\\"","review":"Easily on of the best NIN albums ever... \\"Last\\" Might just be Reznor's best song"},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken is one of the greatest music experiences available","review":"First and formost Trent Reznor is a visionary and I am currently listening to the new single \\"The Day The Whole World Went Away\\", I found it at nin.com and I am terribly happy that I can hear it before the label releases it. Broken and The Downward Spiral are amazing and Pretty Hate Machine is pretty good. I say pretty good because that's what I think of it. It's '80s techno-pop and I was raised on the Spiral so... the two of us didn't quite mesh terribly well, though there are some amazing songs on the CD: Something I Can Never Have is unbelievable and Head Like A Hole rocks, etc. Broken is the most \\"hardcore\\" of the three, but I love it and Trent truly is the god of modern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best NIN album yet!","review":"This is by far Trent Reznor's best album. It's not as repetitive as the Downward Spiral, and less monotonous than Pretty Hate Machine. WISH is a fast, heartpounding song that buils up to a crescendo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"Reznor's lyrics are perfect for angry teenagers. They are self-pitying, melodramatic, sentimental, and crassly served. I indulged this when I rode the bus to school back in the day, but certainly not now.NIN is one of those \\"bands\\" from the 90's that wasn't great enough to carry over into the sublimation of the 90's, the 2000's, much less was consciously aware of this process, and thus became a relic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only NIN product worth owning","review":"It didn't take me too long to get sick to death of Nine Inch Nails even before their T-shirts started outselling their albums. A very cheesily produced show at Lollapalooza (which started with various band members theatrically slamming their [don't laugh] keyboards to the stage every five minutes [whoo, anarchy! Rock on, dude!] and ended with one of their roadies picking up and playing a discarded guitar) was my first and last live experience of this extremely under-talented hack who's been the critics' wet dream since the release of \\"The Downward Spiral\\".Prior to \\"...Spiral\\" however, Trent released this EP and it was much better than the low-rent Depeche Mode tribute \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", and ended up being more vitriolic and abrasive than anything he's released since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken is appropriately titled.","review":"I can't believe this is a NIN CD. It's directionless and each song runs right into the next. What's that all about? Somebody's been taking too much cough syrup and it's beginning to show.

That is because, this reviewer, doesn't find it mandatory to explain the hidden tracks. Also it is going to be one of the shortest.This is the \\"best\\" Nine Inch Nails album because it seems to be the purest. Where as PHM seems influenced.

Too bad the CD isn't longer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle Royal: TVT vs. Trent Reznor","review":"This, possibly the angriest record in the Nine Inch Nails catalog, is supposedly Trent letting loose a lot of hatred towards certain record company representatives. I don't really care about all that, all I know is that this is a great EP. Now, while I'll take musical greatness where I can get it, I could have gone for a full LP of Broken material (as long as it wasn't anything from Fixed). I suppose the best way to describe this album is as such; Distortion over-ridden guitars bludgeon your ears as Trent Reznor seethes hatred from his pores, and some neat keyboard plunking. Reminiscent of early Ministry, you can definitely spot the influence that \\"The Land of Rape and Honey\\" may have had on this album, but it still remains an example of Trent Reznor's mastery of organic instruments mixed with industrial chaos.Key Songs: Wish, Help Me I Am In Hell, Happiness in Slavery, Gave Up, Suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"BROKEN shows a heavier side of NIN","review":"This CD is the loudest NIN CD so far. The song \\"Last\\" actually is played with the good ol' electric guitar, which is a refreshing change. With songs like \\"Wish\\" and \\"Happiness In Slavery,\\" BROKEN takes it's place as one of the 3 best NIN CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have album for ninnies...","review":"this is a great album. though many people say it's different from all the other nin's albums, i think it's still very nine inch nails. nin fans know that even when an album is different from the last one, there's always the \\"mark\\" of the band. it's tougher, but it's the same person writing the songs and performing them with his band.i don't say i recommend it, because if you really like nin (like i do), any cd of them you buy, you'll love."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack to your nervous breakdown","review":"\\"Broken\\" is such a primal musical experience. Everything about it is loud, raw and the guitar work is explosive. I love the way Trent uses hip-hop rhythms as a backdrop for anger and noise. When I feel disgruntled or disillusioned about the world in general, \\"Wish\\" is my theme song for those feelings. And even when I'm in an up mood, listening to \\"Broken\\" is still a cathartic, energetic experience. And I think the fact that it's an EP instead of a full-length CD allows Trent to maintain the urgency from beginning to end; it's more of a shock to the system than say, \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" (which is more of a techno-dance album to me anyway). No doubt, \\"Broken\\" raises the roof."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"This is the best cd of all time of all time buy it now and blow your eardrums trents best work"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this CD is one of the best they have made","review":"These songs are for people with attitude that enjoy loud and popular music. Although some of their lyrics do contain words not suitable for younger listeners, it is overall, a well made CD with enough music to jam to."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years old and still rocks!","review":"Hey, to me the mark of a good album is if it stands the test of time, and to me this does. I just picked up the CD after owning the cassette and not having a tape deck for years. It still manages to sound just as powerful, and fresh as ever. I really feel that Trent, when making an album has the idea in mind to make his work sound fresh for years and years, unlike similar artists who's records sound dated after a few years. Either Broken was ahead of it's time in '92 or it's just damn good,or more likely both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slave Screams","review":"This little mini-album by God(aka Trent Reznor) packs a grenade that's guaranteed to explode after each listen. The singles are easily the best ones here, \\"Wish\\" and \\"Happiness in Slavery\\", but this E.P. is still worth owning as a whole. There is also some great lines in here too, like \\"Don't think you're having all the fun/You know me, I hate everyone!\\" off of \\"Wish\\" or the chorus from \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" \\"Don't open your eyes, you wont like what you see/The devils of truth steal the souls of the free/Don't open your eyes, take it from me/I have found you can find happiness in slavery\\". The two hidden tracks are also great too, \\"Physical\\" and \\"Suck\\". One of the best E.P.'s out there. And for a couple of bucks why not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard hitting industrial metal.","review":"One of my favourite albums (well, it's an EP, but who cares) of all time. Huge guitar riffs, pounding industro beats, and of course, Reznor's trademark lyrics.

There are only eight songs, but they are all very good, especially Wish and Happiness in Slavery. This is NIN's second best album, The Downward Spiral is better. If you like this album and want something more industrial, get Fixed, Broken's remix album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy and Atmospheric","review":"This thirty minute E.P was released by Trent Reznor after a long battle with record company troubles. His bitter anger and frustrations about the whole situation is definitely apparent on the album/EP. Reznor's music is still edgy and atmospheric in the industrial/synth/dance vein but \\"Broken\\" is more straightforward and melodic than previous Nine Inch Nails releases.While I miss the angst of songs like \\"Head Like A Hole\\" from Pretty Hate Machine most of what you hear on \\"Broken\\" is still great. Songs like \\"Pinion\\", \\"Help Me I Am In Hell\\" and \\"Happiness In Slavery\\" have the hard pounding dance beats that are expected from Nine Inch Nails. It also includes two instrumental interludes \\"Wish\\" and \\"Gave Up\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Very helpful. Gives routine movements without diarrhea.

For those who have not read the book, this TV movie was very nice. Although, for this Linda Howard fan who did read the book and enjoyed it, seeing the made for TV version was very dissapointing. While reading the book I always imagined Robert Cannon being this incredibly handsome man in his late thirties as described in the book not a fifty something who wears glasses. But, that aside, other things bothered me as well, such as a new character added to the storyline and others deleted, there was also change of location and last but not the least what was up with Evies husband being dead only for a little while. I gave it two star because I am a fan of Linda Howard and was dissapointed how the book translated into this Tv version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they read the book before making this movie?","review":"I was so very disappointed with this movie.

I can't believe all the hype around this band anymore, they used to be a great band when stings came out, and ever since they haven't made an album any where near that good. Oncoming storm was alright a few good songs here and there. The problem with this album is that its basically the oncoming storm with another ripoff riffs here and there. All this is, is the Same breakdowns you've heard OVER AND OVER AGAIN! with the same lame metalcore at the gate rip off riffs. And i used to be a fan of unearth and was eager for this release. What a Recycled crap of an album this is. Yeah so if you like your music to be unoriginal with the same riffs from other albums. This album is for you , but if you want somethign innovative and original check out there first Real Album \\"The stings of Conscience\\" Theres Tuns of better Metal then this today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unearths best release yet....","review":"Great album. Awesome riffs, great guitar work, bone crushing breakdowns...everything you would expect from the metalcore gods that are unearth. I won't be like most of these guys and write a book about it, just pick up the frigan cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid Album (4.5 stars)","review":"Unearth is a band in today's metal scene that never fails to stand out, and I respect them for that. And they still continue to do that with their 3rd full length here. \\"Giles\\", the first single off this album, is a track that represents the band well, especially if you dig the stuff before this. Only real flaw may be the vocal work somewhat, but you can get past it if you're a real fan. Otherwise, if you really dig Unearth, or you want a good metalcore record, look into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough for either","review":"Basically this album is half thrashing guitar riffs, half metalcore breakdowns, with not enough of either to please dedicated fans of either genre.The technical riffs are pretty much amazing, but played throughout the whole song only to be stopped by a breakdown, which is the same breakdown for every song.Personally I am a fan of the technical riffs so every time the breakdowns come it's change song time, but I still get turned on by them from time to time if they are good. So to put it simply, I think they sucked. Terribly. What happened to writing original stuff.Oh and the vocals could be a tad more dynamic instead of the same \\"I scream every word with a yaw sound thrown in instead of vowels\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a Maltese, don't waste you money.","review":"These did not work on my Maltese at all.

I wanted to learn the \\"right\\" (i.e. secure) way of configuring our Apache deployments from the start.Along with the Apache project's official directive / module references, this book helped provide a great foundation for understanding how to configure and harden Apache. The most useful things I took away from Apache Security were:* creating a cruft-free, secure by default httpd.conf;* hardening PHP;* getting more from httpd logging; and* really, finally understanding SSL/TLS (and keys and certs).There is a lot of information in the book, so I'll likely be reading it cover-to-cover at least once more to glean the next round of tips and concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book...","review":"This book is worth every single dollar.

Maybe the idea is to keep buying new gear to keep companies alive; alas, my diNovo keyboard just up and died. Oh, it says it's connected via bluetooth to my Mac dual 2.0 G5 running osx 10.5.8, and sure it's got brand new batteries. But do the keys do anything? Nope. It's just dead. I'm long past my warranty so I'm SOL. Oh well... guess I won't be buying Logitech stuff anymore. So... anyone want to guess how much longer the diNovo mouse will last? I'm thinking probably a couple of months.Oh how I'll miss the hours wasted trying to get the thing set up as well.Good times. Good times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this before you buy this one @!#%!","review":"I'm bitterly disappointed as I've been a Logitech fan for years but this product really disappointed me. There are two major flaws that not many people have mentioned thus far:1) The number pad's keys are smaller than the keys you find on a standard number pad. Even for my small fingers, that makes it really uncomfortable to use and I have to look down when I enter numbers. This pretty much disqualified this keyboard for my day-to-day usage and I would not have bought the product if I knew about this beforehand.2) The product has quite obviously some connection faults. As soon as my PC goes in standby mode, I cannot use the keyboard anymore and need to use my old keyboard to type in my password. This seems to be a common problem as some of my friends had the same issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy technical support","review":"Things were fine until I allowed the update service to download new software. Once that occured, nothing worked. I dealt with Logitech's online technical support. Despite describing in my email to tech support that I had already done most of the things that technical support would require me to do, I had to start all over and go through each step that I had already gone through, only to have email tech support conclude after two weeks of this craziness that I should talk to their phone support. The product still doesn't work properly. Tech support was just frustrating beyond comprehension. The product is great when everyting works correctly. But run into a problem, and you're truly stuck. Logitech could do much better with their support, but they don't. If you have any technical understanding you will know far more than their robotic technical support people and will only be frustrated by their rote answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful keyboard - Awful mouse lag","review":"I love the feel and look of the keyboard (Though I wish it were all black, or at least a 'normal' alu-colour) but I constantly experience lots of mouse delay, rendering my PC completely useless for minutes at a time. It somehow starts behaving nicely again after a few minutes, but 15 minutes later I am again grinding my teeth as the mouse grinds to a halt and starts it's delay again.Two stars only because the keyboard really works fine, and the mouse laser tracks nicely on any surface I've tried (when there is no lag, that is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"pairs and connects with macbook pro - intel","review":"This would be a 5-star review except that there is some functionality missing when connected to a macbook pro. It paired and connected easily - mouse, media pad, and keyboard. The media controls on the media pad and keyboard control iTunes just fine, which surprised me. I can turn the volume up/down/off. The fast-forward, start, stop, fast-backward media key do the right thing in itunes, even when working in other windows. Good job Logitech! Don't know much about battery life, I've only had it for a couple of days. I was using a mac bluetooth keyboard and it doesn't have the nice media pad.The Windows key is the Apple key.At times there is considerable delay with the mouse. I switched to a non-bluetooth logitech mouse which seems to work more quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Mouse Lag !","review":"I bought this thing over a year ago with high hopes for its sleek appearance and Logitech quality. There is something wrong with the bluetooth connection, the mouse, or whatever, and it has made the mouse almost impossible to use since day one. Every few minutes, the mouse experiences a \\"lag\\" where the cursor does not track where you are moving the mouse, in both speed and position. It is VERY ANNOYING.I have figured out a way to point the mouse away for a few seconds to fix it, but Logitech has no support about this or anything, and I have a wired mouse that I keep connected on my desk to be able to use in an emergency when the bluetooth mouse acts up. I do NOT recommend this product and I will be switching to another brand right now. I thought I'd enter in this comment before I purchased another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, bad repackaging","review":"First off, I really like the keyboard and mouse. They work well with both my dell laptop and macbook in bluetooth mode.The bad part is that I bought the product from Amazon refurbished to save a few bucks. When I received the product, the packaging was mangled inside the shipping container, the batteries were dead and the keyboard and mouse showed a LOT of wear and tear. I am keeping the product but I am disappointed with Amazon. They usually are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice hardware, but key decals wearing off after just a few months","review":"Like others here, I was quite pleased with the keyboard and mouse. Both are very well designed ergonomically. I'm not that happy with the MediaPad, as it uses an extra two batteries in addition to the four in the keyboard. The install was a bit fussy on our Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 machine, and there have been some Bluetooth connectivity issues that probably would not be that easy to debug for novices. But the really awful part of this keyboard is that the decals are wearing off after about six months of not overly intense use at home. This is not acceptable on such a high-end keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space bar only works sometimes. Customer service sucks","review":"I purchased this keyboard/mouse combo in Aug of 2007. I like the look and feel of it, however almost immediatly I started having problems with the spacebar not responding. Unless you press hard on the middle of the spacebar it will not leave a space. I have read many others have had the same problem.I called Logitech customer service. (I could not find a toll-free number so it was on my dime) The man I spoke with was nice, but the first solution he had for me was for me to send my keyboard to logitech first and then they would send me a replacement one in 4 to 8 weeks. I told him that was unacceptabble as I dont have another keayboard to useuntill the replacement one arrived. He then told me if I have my proof of purchase(I got it here on amazon so I could print one) I could fax it in to logitech and they would send me a replacement one in 4 to 8 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your desk will never look better!","review":"Being an architect, I couldn't resist the allure of the diNovo even though I had read some troubling things about it.

Even better, it has an incredible design, and looks fantastic on the desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now with Laggy Goodness!","review":"Logitech needs to get their act together. The lag on the mouse is criminal. It is to the point that I can spin the mouse in a circle five times. Let go of it. And watch the last two circles appear on their own. So up to a two second lag. Which means you can't use this mouse for anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"DINOVO LASER PROBLEMS - what a shame!","review":"Right now I am hardly trying to write my review on my Logitech laser keyboard...it's a shame. Majority of customers hope the problem reside on the software side. \\"Let's be patient, let's hope that Logitech is gonna develop new software and everything is gonna be ok...\\" No it is not. The whole thing is faulty. The little USB receiver is not powerful enough. I have replaced it with a cheap Chinese USB from eBay which makes it at least 10 times better. I have contacted Logitech to let them know but they already know this. The answer was...\\"We can send you a wired adaptor to get the USB device closer to you mouse/keyboard\\" :) I do not need it.

Now that was a monster, rather difficult to read, but very good history written to the very high academic and intellectual standards of Britain (just like this book on Cortes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant rubbish","review":"It does not often happen that a book is rendered useless by a single sentence. This is one of them. Apparently in an attempt to legitimize the hideous cruelty of the inhabitants of old Mexico the author makes the following statement:Every people, it is now generally supposed, has its own right to conduct itself as its national customs provide.This is so incredibly stupid that it makes the author a self-professed idiot and therefore irrelevant. Fortunately it comes early in the book, so that no discerning reader need waste too much time on this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"An astonishing story told in fascinating detail","review":"...This still is the best book in English on the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Far more than most historians, Thomas explores the interconnections among the leading personalities, both Spanish and Mexican, giving the reader a feeling for the noble and the devious aspects of these sixteenth century people. Politics and the exercise of power emerge as major themes. The author brings out the contingency of history through his analysis of key events that might have gone another way. There was nothing inevitable about Cortes' ultimate success; if he had not been so clever and ruthless, he might have ended up as a human sacrifice in an Aztec temple. As it was, more than half of the conquistadors died, a casualty rate that no modern army would tolerate. The six hundred page text is supplemented by useful appendices. This book would be even better if it were more fully illustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"Buy it, dont hesitate. It feels like \\"being there\\".

That's how important this book was to me, personally, as a source.Besides being an excellent, well-researched history, it is READABLE, and I should know. I've read it four times.

I liked it, because it includes some main themes everybody should know at least something about, and it is quite entertaining (for a book on this subject).What is more, I would like to mention that at the end of each chapter the authors include some questions that help you to understand better what has already been explained. There is also a web link that provides you with the answers to those questions. So, if you are like me and not very good at this kind of thing but want to be sure you answered correctly, you will be able to find out).All in all, I think that this book is a thoroughly good introduction to economy, easy to read and with some extra features that are extremely useful.

Some of the illustrations crowd too much line art with too little text onto a page. Sometimes it would be better to see different representations of the same object. Detail photos keyed to illustrations would be helpful too.Also, be cautious about doing your own electrical and/or plumbing work. Electrical mistakes can burn your home down.

Anybody that takes Manson or any other metal or rock group seriously should have thier head examined and check for a brain. At any rate this is a good Cd and the production picked up since Trent Razor took the production wheel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But The Best Was Yet To Come","review":"Ah, before the birth of the Antichrist, Mr. Manson dropped the \\"Spooky Kids\\" name and released \\"Portrait\\". This album has some pretty good songs on it, but none compare to his later stuff, \\"Wrapped in Plastic\\", \\"Lunch Box\\" and \\"Dope Hat\\" being his three best songs on this record.

Anyone who listens to him knows that. This album was a good idea about how there are deeper messages in things like willy wonka than our parents would like us to know. Unfortunately, it was a failed attempt. It manages to merit a few good songs like dope hate, get your gun, and lunchbox, but that's about it. The album sounds like a cheap underground metal band, and there's a lot more to them on other albums. IT also seems really cheesy with all the child references. I can't blame it for sucking, because it was thier first album, i just prefer the other albums, especially Holy Wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated garbage","review":"Dont get me wrong I really liked all of Marilyn's other cds but I thought this one was just plain ridiculous.I have to admit Get Your Gunn is great all the other ones are just filler though.Dont buy this if you like decent music."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOISY AND UNORGINAL","review":"Marilyn Manson's 'Portrait of an American Family' is a mix of noisy innuendos and violent music. Never have I heard such a noise in my life.

Some of the lyrics are thought provoking and creative, while others are just juvenile and stupid. Lousy vocals, below average instrumentally, and all in all just not Manson's best work.

No album as never soundede like this and none ever will. This one is more about atmosphere then anything. Dope Hat has great background noises. Lunchbox is also a favorite summarizing all the hopes of a bullied 5th grader. I love Manson and all his albums - when i feel quirky i listen to this one- when i feel violent- Antichrist Superstar and when i feel sad- Mechanical animals.

The best track on the record is song number six, \\"Dope Hat\\". Other stand out tracks are \\"Get Your Gunn\\", \\"Lunchbox\\", \\"Dogma\\", and \\"Misery Machine\\"This album is pre-Rameriz so it lacks the 'Shock Rock' appeal of Antichrist Superstar and Smells like Children. It is also very much different from Mechanical Animals' Glam rock. This is more grundge and crunchy sounding. The guitar riffs are weak and don't really stand out. On the other hand, the bass (played by Gidget Gien) is fantastic. Manson seems kind of sedate in this one as compared to more recent works.All in all, this is a very good first attempt to make a mainstream record. But it is nothing like the more recent releases. Is it any wonder that Marilyn Manson and Maddona Wayne Gacy are the only surviving members of Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids? It also explains the radical change in their sound. This was more rock and less shock. The bass riffs are really awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great album.

Sizemore was typical of mobster entering the Program: fearful, cocky, arrogant, patronizing, angry, unhappy, and unfeeling about what his actions have cost his family; in short... self-absorbed. Since I'm retired now, the movie brought back all the memories of dealing with these guys and talking to them in the only language they understand. I even remembered in which section of the file the Memorandum of Understanding went.It also brought back memories of the James Caan movie \\"Hide in Plain Sight\\", which was a true story and changed the rules regarding non-custodial parental rights when a spouse in WSP is relocated.Both Whittaker and Sizemore did an outstanding job in this film, which got the stamp of approval from the USMS.

You will not be disappointed. Views from Confederate Marylanders to Virginians to Texans are presented, in easily read snippets....and while Gen. Armistead and Kemper may be missing, this is not an attempt to be complete, but rather to be interesting. And, thankfully, this 143 page book is quite varied, with those fighting for the C.S.A. separated by the three days of action at Gettysburg. From the actual accounts written at the time, to Coco's interpretations, background and so forth, this book will stand well on the shelf on anyone interested in the War of Northern Aggression, Yankee or Southern Confederate American.

I had read that they were very much like the HD600s but with added bass. Lots of people have lots of different opinions about sennheisers but that particular comment about these two models was repeated far and wide.These headphones do need amplification, and they depend a lot on the amplifier for their sound. Without any amplifier they won't sound so great. With a cheapo amplifier they'll sound okay. But with a good amplifier they will sing.

Introspection certainly falls into the \\"should have been\\" catagory. Produced by Bill Wyman of the Stones, in the rose-colored Satanic Majesties era, this wonderful album sat on the shelf and missed it's moment, in the rapidly shifting UK music scene. Shades Of Orange showed up on various collections, but here you have the whole magic kettle. Gentle pop-psychedelia that is well written, performed and produced, evoking early Traffic with that fairytale floating over the fields headspace. However this holds up very well over time, and what might have seems passe in 1969, sounds classic and gemlike in the light of a new century. These songs are windows to pop heaven, a very good trip indeed.

The pity is that in many places they show they have what it takes to be far more interesting. \\"Push the Ghosts\\" could be a nice rock anthem with a little work on the chorus, but the singer (not really, he just talks fast for the most part) intrudes way to much and wrecks it. \\"Got me Sussed\\" could work as well, with a little discipline in the writing, but again the lead singer so dominates everything that you can't focus on the good parts of their sound.

Powerfuly and captivating!","review":"Hideaway is beautifully written, fast-paced and full of intrigue. It details the depth of good and the nature of evil in a very potent fashion. Koontz throws in much of the supernatural and allows readers to expand their horizons and delve deep into their own hearts as they consider the powerful themes presented here. Ultimately, the book demonstrates the power of love and innocence, the hand of God to watch over the pure in heart and the inevitable truth that evil cannot overcome LIGHT. I found this book very intriguing, excellently crafted, and deeply satisfying. I highly recommend it. The characters are very well-developed, you really feel for the people and you really see the nature of the villain, which is vitally important to a convincing suspense novel. At 400 pages, it's not too short nor too long. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A major success for Koontz...","review":"Hideaway is an example of Koontz at his best. The emotion in this book ebbs and flows in waves. One minute I was crying the next I was laughing. A perfect balance of humor (usually dark humor) with the initially terrifying parts of the novel. You can't have a good book without both. The characters were well developed and wholely believable. The religious slant on the book lends a light to Koontz literature that I have never before seen.

I got exactly half way through and realized that, although I had no difficulty turning pages, his style of writing was completely lacking in soul. Has his writing always been stilted? And he is WAY TOO wordy! Now don't get me wrong, Mr. K must be doing something right. His efforts have afforded him what is, undoubtedly, an ultra comfortable living and lifestyle.

It did not scare me; it did not make me laugh; it did not satisfy me in the end. Life is too short for this type of over-written and under-plotted and under-characterized work. I couldn't bear to give the book only one star, because it was obvious Koontz was trying really, really hard to make a literate and informative book. But I never gave a damn about the phony characters--from peter perfect resuscitation patient to the doctor that just loved his darn patients too much to the evil man in sunglasses that lived in the realm between life and death, I couldn't buy it.

Other books have been made into movies and won best picture, and that doesn't have this level of evil. The adopted daughter is a very crucial part. When someone dies and is brought back to life after a certain time period, you wonder what did they see, or go through. People talk of experiencing various things. This puts a spin on all that you've ever read or heard about. It is a great read and the scariest of all, is that there are people out there who are truly this evil.

I did like Watchers... one of the best books I have read in a long time, but all his other books and especially this one are duds for me.Koontz drags his narrative out for ever... boring. And when he gets into dialog, he is clumsy at it. Then he goes over the top with gore to the point of disgusting.Hideaway started out with a bang. It was intense, vivid, and gripping... but from the time Hatch and his wife were in the hospital the story went straight downhill.And all I can say about the ending ... there was no ending.I am through with Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Two Cents","review":"Hatch Harrison is reanimated by a noted surgeon, eighty minutes after he dies from a car accident. After what appears to initially be a full recovery, Hatch begins having strange visions of an evil young man clad all in black.

Believing that the same fate may be in store for Hatch, his wife and his newly adopted daughter, he must reach down and find within himself the strength and will to become something more.The story bounces back and forth between the Harrison family and the serial killer's points of view quite effectively. Some scenes become more extended than they probably needed to be and I started to find myself skipping paragraphs here and there. The whole story came across as rather formulaic. Not bad, but also not really anything special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book: Yes, Movie: No","review":"I luckily listen to the book on tape before seeing the dreadful movie.

It was far more shallow than it could and should have been. When I was at school, I would write long stories, and finish them abruptly when told I had half an hour. This must have happened here. Koontz was bored, and finished off quickly, while reading something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"This book was my first Dean Koontz experience and I found myself unfulfilled and confused as to why people rave of his writing. Certainly to read a book as predictable and almost boring as this constitutes a considerable waste of \\"quality book reading\\" time. He overshadows this work with religion without even attempting to use fundemental Christian beliefs which only makes you blurt out a sincere \\"Huh?\\" when you finally reach the end. I have to honsestly say I did not like any of the characters or feel I was brought into the book to feel a part of it. Perhaps someday I will try another Koontz book.

I found it more of a \\"here and there\\" reader more than something that I could become completely enthralled in since there really isn't any order or flow to it whatsoever.This book helps the reader to become a little more aware of grammar usage when it comes to everyday things, and it makes you realize how many things you learned incorrectly in school. There are, however, many questions drawn about usage that are left unanswered.The author is witty and at times sarcastic with her responses to her callers and can really come off as a grammar snob. On the other hand there is a lot of personality present in her writing which makes reading about the topic more enjoyable and less like a textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic tale of greed and redemption.","review":"This is a wonderful, if simple, story of humanity's greed and how one man's plan stimies the galactic power brokers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monkeys have emotions, too (but better options exist for you)","review":"Out of a dozen \\"feelings\\" in the book, almost half are negative (scared, hurt, sick, sad, naughty), plus the presumption that your youngster needs to sulk in time outs.This very short board book, published in 1998, simply takes scenes from existing Curious George books. This then is a money grab, and offers little at that.For a child who has trouble handling emotions, better options exist.

While Eskin has a good style, his narrative is jumbled, he skips around a lot and it is often hard to work out what is going on. Also Eskin virtually ruins his own book by going on endlessly about himself when it is really not relevant to Wilkomirski's story.

In others some people in tights are stretching and walking around. It picks up a little in the last ballet \\"The White Swan\\" of Swan Lake; unfortunately the cameraman who must be as bored as I am focuses on the gloomy and tormented faces of the dancers and stays there.The only good part is the two minutes bonus of the Black Swan of Swan Lake."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dancers are great.

The Paris Opera Ballet could have well spared our time and patient with such a display of amateur coreography: Mr Schmucki manages to use all the modern dance cliches, all the time, in every work!

There is nothing wrong with this approach. Unfortunately, the introduction of concepts without any explanation of their importance, or how they fit together, leaves the reader with little more than a list of steps to go through to calculate a position, and no clear understanding of when to apply which corrections or why.

This movie does wonderful justice to both the original series and the Beyond series.The script is great and whether or not you agree with the censoring, this an intense movie.

The action is on par with any Batman Beyond episode. Even though the detective work is not up to the original Batman style, the constant unfolding of the plot, in addition to the constant recounting of Batman history, makes up for that. There are also a lot of nice little satisfying loose ends that get tied up. Finally, the final scene involving Batman and the Joker is just plain cool.

The score (to use the term loosely) is dreadful. None of the characters are sympathetic, they are simply obnoxious and full of \\"witty\\" banter. (I know Bruce Wayne is supposed to be brooding and tormented and all that nonsense, but he's not the callous jerk he is here.) It is incredibly violent, the animation is poor and the storyline absurd even for a Batman film.The \\"rationale\\" for the Joker's return just doesn't wash. The Joker's disfigurement and madness are not in his genes/DNA! The Joker is the result of catastrophic conditions that disfigured him, driving him mad.

Someone needs to tell the WB to get off of their high horses and think of the fanbase. What I was witness too on Xmas day was a horribly butchered version of a great movie. They changed too much stuff, and most of the cuts were awfully bad. Even if you do decide to ruin a great plot, at least pick up the pieces and re-animate key scenes.

It is the best looking Batman-related thing around, and it is truly creepy. The highest compliment I can pay it is that I didn't know what was going to happen until it happened. That's a rare greatness that is not often achieved in movies. The feeling of the movie has a great sense of finality to it that is very exciting. My only problems with the movie are A) I will always like Bruce Wayne better than Terry. I'm probably just set in my ways, but he's my Batman, and I wish there would have been more Bruce-vs-Joker stuff in this movie (not that there weren't any already, but still...); and B) the reason of how the Joker has come back feels a little off for me. First off, it's been done on the show, and second it's just too out there. But that's just me. The sum of the parts more than make up for these little nit-picky things.

This wasn't a good purchase. The item was advertised as the uncut version of the movie and I was sent the cut version.

Much more violence than you'd see in the typical bat toon, and the way the Joker comes back is (in my opinion) a little lame.

Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out for spoilers!","review":"If you get the DVD version, DO NOT watch the \\"animated character bios\\" until after you have watched the movie. They contain at least one spoiler which I wish I hadn't seen until afterwards. As for the movie itself, I definitely agree that it's the best animated Batman movie yet. There were some weaknesses in the story and cinematography, but it is something that will stick with me. It goes farther in some respects than the Saturday morning cartoon, but it does so without losing the spirit of where it came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but deleted scenes could've added more.","review":"This movie will be enjoyed by all Batman Beyond fans. The sound is great when you got surround and the animation is briliant espcially the scenes with the laser. Things that bothered were me the eay Joker comes back (at the begginging and how he REALLY came back) and how he died (in the flashback and at the end) I wish the WB execs would've just put a sock in their mouths and left the scenes in that were deleted, even though they werent a big part of the story, the WB should've just left them in. Most people who have seen the movie complain about that and that only. The DVD's is one of the best I've got, its features will keep you out of trouble for a little while. The commentary is great to listen too, and the documentary is good. It also has trailers for other WB movies and the so-called \\"deleted scenes\\" are just ... storyboards. So all in all you could say you get your moneys worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad WB Didn't Have the Guts to Release the Real One","review":"Let me say right now, I've seen both versions of this movie, and the original uncut one is probably 4.5-5 stars IMO. Unforutunately, by making the cuts they did, they ruined both the dramatic tension in the story and the coherency of the story itself. The movie makes very little sense with the major change they made, and I for one am glad I only rented the movie instead of purchasing it. The screener I saw a couple months ago was a far better movie. What's up with that, WB? You guys will get my money when I can get the awesome movie I saw two months ago.For all you parents out there, this movie is moderately kid-friendly now, but it's still kind of creepy and in all likelihood will be enjoyed as much by your child as Batman: Sub-Zero. Take that as you will. For all adults out there looking to add this to their collection, don't bother. You'd get more entertainment out of watching a couple episodes of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very glad to finally have the uncut version!","review":"First thing: IF YOU'RE NOT OKAY WITH CARTOONS HAVING ANIMATED VIOLENCE/BLOOD, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. After being tricked to buy the cut version within the double feature containing Mystery of the Batwoman and Return of the Joker, I decided to buy the uncut version since I heard there was quite a difference between the two. And I am very glad to have bought this cut version. Both cut and uncut versions of this movie are compelling and heart wrenching (the cut was handled beautifully by Paul Dini and the DC animated crew) but I think this uncut version is much much more emotional. This movie ranks as my second favorite DC animated feature (second to Under the Red Hood) and is sure not to disappoint any fan of Batman or Batman the Animated Series/The New Batman Adventures as it ties the Batman Beyond universe more solidly into the mentioned series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice way to tie old and new","review":"I've been addicted to Batman my entire life, and I love the direction this series has taken. The revelations and answers during the climax would probably only be believable in Gotham but other than that it's a perfect Batman flick. Dark scenes, good lines, fast flying car evading laser chase, and engaged character interplay. Will Friedle (Batman) and Mark Hamill (the Joker) are wonderful! The music is perfect. Dark rock with twangs of electronic and blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Censored or not this is a grest film","review":"I would like to say that I join the very noisy majority that complains about the cuts made to the film, but I have to say that this is one of the best, more mature animated films I have seen in my life -some parts even match the level of action and/or depth that some of the best Japanese films have. The artists and director (in the commentary of the DVD) don't seem to have any regret about the cuts, so they must agree that the film was not that hurt with the changes. ANY film goes through the scissors before it is finally shown to the audiences -there must be hundreds of unused footage of the best films in history that had to lay on the cutting room floor. Come on, guys, appreciate the final work for what it is, and do not despise it for what it could have. This film is AWESOME."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Terrible","review":"To all those people who say that the quality of the movie did not suffer terribly because of the censorship and blatant lies by The WB, I present to you: The Return of the Joker. The entire premise of this film was knowing that violence solves nothing and if you go to far ytou will be haunted. This has been homogenized and spat out. The cuts also destroy most of the terror of the Joker. The resulting film isn't terrible, but it is disjointed, skippy, and almost bland. Don't give them the satifsfaction. Do not buy this film for yourself or your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original was great. This edited DVD is terrible.","review":"The people who made \\"Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker\\" are true artists in every sense of the word. They fully understand that things such as plot, storyline, and character development are crucial to good animation.Unfortunatley, the executives at Warner Bros. decided that those things don't matter, and they edited the story for this DVD so as to make it radically different from what the story's creators had wanted their audience to see.If anyone from from Warner Bros. is reading this, I want you to know that I am a 29 year old man with lots and lots of money to spend on DVDs. And I'm not giving you one penny for this one.And I know that there are many others out there who are just like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Batman story","review":"If you are a fan of Batman, buy this movie. Though I only saw the edited version of this movie, I thouroughly enjoyed it. It has all the elements that make a classic Batman story. Bruce Wayne\`s guilt at the danger his partners are exposed to, classic detective story twists, and an ending that put a lump in my throat. Though this story is geared towards a younger audience, it has depth and intrigue that will hold the attention of most adults. A great movie, and one that any fan of Batman should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know this wasn't the intended vision but...","review":"It's still a classic. Yes, I realize that it was edited. Yes, I realize that it was probably even better. It still is hard to improve on such a fantasic story. There were times when I just sat slack jawed at what I had just seen. If you are a Batman fan you must see this. I'd tell you more about it but that would ruin the suprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorta disapointing","review":"its not the uncut version i thought it would be, i bought it and its still the regular version and its disappointing.

The upcoming \\"Return of the Joker\\" has the scene that completely changes how the characters are viewed -- mainly, the completely \\"different\\" way in which the Joker dies, and who (not accidentally) kills him. It changes the whole movie.There is also, a great deal of symbolism lost -- Like the very first scene, which is cut.Don't buy the edited version, unless it's for your kids. The unedited version is much more violent.In the end, it's not the best in the current crop of Batman animation being released. It was good, but not great.\\"Sub-Zero\\" was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"for any BBB fan this movie is worthwhile! It had an interesting story and was a good way to tie up the series. The movie arrived before the estimated delivery date and in good condition- I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was hyped to see this film, because I LOVE \\"Under the Red Hood,\\" and had been told that this was better! WRONG! It is NOT better than \\"Under the Red Hood.\\" I found it farfetched and silly (admittedly, this takes place in the future, and ALL Batman movies/comics are farfetched), and its conceit about the true identity/manifestation of the Joker is LUDICROUS. One of the other things that bothered me is that, thanks to the use of a weapon of mass destruction (saying anything else would be a spoiler), fully THOUSANDS of Gothamites must have been killed, and yet that was never mentioned. The bottom line is this: watch or buy \\"Under the Red Hood\\", which is much more believable and explores the Batman's psyche and myth much more completely, and includes a great Joker storyline, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my stepson. He collects all matter of Batman merchandise. He could hardly wait to watch the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to finish Batman Beyond with a bang!","review":"I'll start off by saying that the streaming service was excellent. This movie takes place in the Batman Beyond universe which is about 50 years into the future. Bruce Wayne is old and mentors a newer, younger Batman - Terry McGuinness. This movie concerns the - you guessed it - the return of the Joker. Throughout the three seasons of Batman Beyond I was always wondering when the Joker was going to show up. This movie not only explains where he has been, but the shadows of Batman's past are also explained. Adults and teenagers will love this movie. There are a few scenes which may be disturbing for younger viewers, but overall this is a fantastic experience and a must watch for any Batman Beyond fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker","review":"It could have been good, but over 14 minutes of the movie has been deleted (as mentioned numerous times, almost proudly, in the creator's commentary). I am not a major fan of Batman Beyond or Batman in general, just a fan of good movies and good animation and this one falls short. Also beware of what the back cover of the DVD states, there is NO deleted scenes of the 14 minutes censored from the movie, just deleted storyboard footage that wasn't even animated. Just another way of \\"nickle and dime-ing\\" the consumer, they will most likely come out with a \\"Director's Cut\\" in the future to further milk more money from the fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great uncut version, great used DVD!","review":"The uncut version is better that the edited version. The quality of the used DVD was almost like new, with no scratches. Thank you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me a die-hard purist but...","review":"this ain't Batman. ... The only part where this movie shines is the flashback to where the REAL Batman has his final meeting with the REAL Joker. The rest of the movie is either predictable, derivitive, or just plain flat. Do yourself a favor and rent this before you buy it. I give it 2 stars for at least having Batman in it. Otherwise it would rate no stars at all.Hey, am I the ONLY one who is bothered by the fact that we had a chance to have a Batman movie where he has a final, climatic showdown with the Joker, only to have it cut up and sandwhiched into a Batman Beyond movie.Think about it! You were cheated! There should have been two movies here. A Batman-Joker movie, and then the Batman Beyond movie as a sequel. Instead we get neither. This [stinks]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"edited version is a letdown to original","review":"i'm fortunate to have seen the original, unedited version of this film and it's fantastic.

Very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (Uncut)","review":"I have waited a long time for an animated feature that would really bring out the dark, dangerous side of the Joker. Here it is.With censorship taken out of the picture, Joker is finally allowed to reach his full potential: he tortures, kills, and commits atrocities that would never have been allowed in any of the TV series.Joker fans: you need this movie.Robin haters: ditto.Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Prepared - Be very Prepared.","review":"I replaced my VHS copy of the movie with this one. I wasn't quite ready for the additional violence. I'm not going to ruin the plot by saying more.I recommend this movie - it is very good - but it is not for children. I rate it PG 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only version of this movie to own","review":"Return of the Joker may be the best animated super hero movie yet made. With a strong plot and high emotion this movie successfully brings back the greatest villan of all. This uncut version though is the one to own. While filling in some history as to what happened to Batman's greatest foe, it also gives a very interesting way in which he returns. This is not a childs movie. The joker has lost his sense of humor. (I guess dying will do that to you). Gone is any hint of the clown prince of crime. This joker is a psychopath pure and simple who only wants Batman (both versions) dead. Highly recommended for any fan of the Batman animated series and if you want to try Batman Beyond for the first time, start here."},{"rating":"1","title":"edit version is too horrible","review":"I saw the cut and uncut and man the cut version was edited so much that it didn't even look like a movie. *spoiler* When Bonk was gassed instead of being shot the reanimation looked so fake. So did when tim pushed Joker to his electrocution instead of being shot. The weirdest part is that WB had to change some dialouges in the film too. I felt like it was edit so much that all of a sudden I find myself at the end already. The only good thing about the edit version is that it is better to watch on your t.v. rather then open your computer all the time just to watch the uncut one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Great Movie But...","review":"After viewing the edited version, I must say that the uncut Batman Beyond: Return Of the Joker is much better. Still, one thing really bugged me. On the package it said that the DVD had a full screen aspect ratio, when instead it is presented in wide-screen. I personally, find wide-screen movies annoying, because it's like sitting in the back row of a movie theater (no matter how close you sit to the tv). It would have been great if Warner Brothers put this one on a double sided disc for those (like me) who hate wide-screen movies. With that aside, If you are a Batman fan, the uncut version is the one to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperback bound bathroom tissue!","review":"I feel guilty writing a review of a book that I could not bear to read in its entirity, but doesn't that describe how bad this so-called novel was?! Apparently this author thinks that if he writes in enough fleeting appearances of every popular FR character into his story then he'll have an FR novel. There was no attempt at creating a substantial plot, there was only meaningless chance encounter after chance encounter with other authors' characters. Even if the reader can accept the sheer implausibility that these famous encounters could happen one after the other, the reader would have to be disappointed by Thomsen's misuse of these people. What was he trying to accomplish? Why not develop Volo's character (he could use some) instead of butchering those that other more capable authors have so carefully constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once bitten....","review":"I enjoy the Forgotten Realms, but I suggest to all who also like the realms, avoid this book! Volo has been used in a series of roleplaying aids to help us get to know the realms, and those books have been very successful - they are well written and useful - and weren't written by Brian Thomsen.Brian steals other people's characters and other people's plots (this could've been called \\"80 days around the realms\\") and drags the readers through a series of chance encounters with almost every character ever written about in the realms.I wish I hadn't finished it, but I wanted to see if the novel had any redeeming features. No, I didn't find any.Brian, if you are going to inflict us with your writing, at least try to be original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By far, the worst in the Forgotten Realms Series","review":"This is, without a doubt, the worst-written fantasy book I have ever had the misfortune to read. The fourth-grade plot basically goes out of its way to incorporate old jokes and bad puns - the sort you find inside bubblegum wrappers! I would suggest that time would be better spent reading two of the Forgotten Realms Series' \\"superstar\\" authors: R.A. Salvatore and Elaine Cunningham. Everything they write is a late-night page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too horrible to describe.","review":"This isn't just one of the worst Forgotten Realms books , it's one of the Worst books period! That was money and time that I will never get back. I'm surprised Mr. Thomsen hasn't been sued for plagiarism. This is a total disgrace. Stealing \\"Around the word in 80 days\\" and attempting some pathetic intergration with the campaign guide. I'm not sure if it's just the writers ineptitude or the publisher trying to swindle us. In either case they both should be ashamed of themselves. I only wish Amazon would let me rate this in the negatives. I'd give it - 10 stars. Save your self some pain and skip this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just read the review","review":"This novel was not meant to be a serious work. Something that could be compared to Chaucer, or Shakespeare. The other reviewers seem to have missed that. Its light, full of bad puns and terrible jokes. A pleasent diversion from more serious titles, Once Around the Realms accomplishes its objective to simply be fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"good or bad","review":"I know that most people dont like how Brian M. Thomsen wights or how his chapters are but the main thing that most inportint is the main point of the story. iam just saying that dont pay that much time worrieing about the bad things and just injoy the book.I gave Once Around the Realms an 4 stars because I thought that this book was well wreiten and has a great ending. the only thing that I regrete is that the book hade to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"Refreshing to hear a contemporary Ska band that plays true this style of music's early 60's Caribbean roots, without forcing any fusion of punk rock, alternative, or frat-boy dope-rock into the mix. The rhythm is irresistable, the horn lines are sweet and elegant. No synthesizers, electronics, or anything else that would spoil sound. The Allentons put a lot of soul into their singing and playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok if you like the TV novels","review":"I'm not a big fan of TV novels, but I thouhgt I'd give this one a try since I like the show so much. It was about what I was expecting. The stories are told from Rory's point of view. In reading the stories you miss out on a lot of classic Loreli moments (Loreli and her mom; Loreli and Luke) It's basically a summary of what you see on the TV screen, but only Rory's side, so it seems like you're missing half of the story. I like the fast paced dialog on the show, but it seems to lose something trying to read it on the page. This was easy reading. If you need a light hearted book I would suggest this."},{"rating":"2","title":"More on The Gilmore Girls","review":"The first book in the Gilmore Girls book series, it is an excellent tie-in to the well-written and smart show. In the show, you get the snappy dialogue, as well as the cozy scenery. In this book, you get the inner thoughts and backstory of the town and more of each character. If you enjoy the show, you can further your viewing enjoyment by reading these tie-in books. This one in particular will introduce you to the characters if you are new to the show or would like more background.

After I wrote an email questioning that, it was changed. I have yet to hear back from the publishers, SAMS, and I would avoid all of their books because of this waste of paper.I started to make a list of omissions and vague descriptions after the 2nd chapter, but that list is too long to outline here. This is a very anti-design, techie look at CSS presenting an attitude that was out of date before the text was written.The project I was working on through this book failed, but I now know that I know less about CSS than when I started this book.

Of those five, 3 of them are not displaying what the author is stating should be present. Specifically, figure 2.1 on page 23, figure 2.2 on page 24 and figure 2.4 on page 35 are displaying the wrong screens.

The writing is dry, the explanations poor, the math is too easy to get lost in, and the book assumes prior knowledge that an undergrad student isn't equipped with yet. I would recommend this for grad students or as a reference to professors, as the appendices are put together very well, but it is terrible book to actually learn thermodynamics from. I have had to purchase other books in addition to this one, despite the fact that I'm a good student. To its credit, there are in-chapter examples and a VAST number of end-of-chapter problems (usually over 100). If you must use this text for a thermo intro course, I highly recommend the solutions manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for undergrads","review":"This book assumes you memorize everything they say once. In an example in chapter six, they went from V/2 to V/2 x 788 x 37.12 without saying why, without using symbols to show what the numbers represent, without even including units to help you figure out what they are doing. It turned out to be a conversion mentioned on a page in a chapter, not in any of the tables or indexes for conversion.

I only see one song (Closer) that could be really. When he says \\"I wanna f!!! you like an animal, I wanna feel you from the inside\\" he could be talking to a man for all we know, not a woman. The other songs are about pigs being hauled off to the slaughter house, suicide, and just personal agony. And anyone who says it has no melodie is stupid too because why does music always have to have a melodie to be good? It doesn't, and besides alot of the songs do.

From the opening words of \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\" to the final verse of \\"Hurt\\", one's mind and soul are taken for a non-stop emotional rollercoaster, albeit a downward one.

This is what happens when Trent decides to say F@*k it and cash in on the NIN brand. It's whiney alternacrap that could have been done by the smashing pumkins, and thats not a good thing because the pumkins SUCK!! It was shortly after this that Trent started hanging around that goth poser Manson who's biggest hits were covers of other people's songs.

The Downward Spiral is in fact the life of a man who finally kills himself...This album is Nine Inch Nails' best... every song has its personality, and every song is a treasure to discover and to understand...Buy it, it,s one of the best buys you can make in the Industrial section...A blast!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice follow-up to the first album","review":"\\"The Downward Spiral\\" does not have the flow that was found in NIN first album, but this album contains emotion and energy that was as explicit as in this album. \\"Closer\\" is probably the most popular song from this CD, but there is more to offer than just this one song. Perhaps the best song on the CD is \\"Hurt\\" which is a sadistic song about one person's pain.This album was written following the breakup between Trent and his girlfriend, and you can feel the rage and anger and emotion throughout the CD. At points, the album can be downright explicit and offensive, but don't let this scare you away from the quality of music put forth by NIN.Don't try and compare this album with the first one, because they are two different \\"feels\\". However, this album is good in its own right due to the raw emotion sent forth by Trent. The instrumentals are excellent, and this is something lacking on the first CD. Overall, it is enjoyable, and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"SACD DE review","review":"This album still carries me through many angry & confusing times, and I've been listening to it for 10 years! Now with the Deluxe Edition we get TDS remastered. Yes, it makes a difference. The bass is more punchy, the guitars are more in your face & growly, the weird little details that you thought you'd heard all ready take on new dimensions. Basically you can hear all the layers with more clarity, and you'll probably hear some layers you never even noticed before. The 2nd disc doesn't have anything new except the demo versions of three songs, it's interesting to see what these songs were before they were \\"fully realized.\\" Will I listen to them over and over? Probably not. If you're a rabid fan you probably all ready own this. If you're new to NIN get THIS, it's the first thing I'd recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"COOL DUDE !!!

I don't care what Trent Reznor may say to this, but he has a record to sell.I listened to this CD a few times when I was younger, gave it a chance, then it disappeared. I really don't know where it is. I don't care. I've moved on to music with REAL aggression and REAL artistry.

This CD goes through every emotion a human feels from Self Assurance, to Not Caring, To Being Horny. After track 9 the momentum of the album completely changes after Reptile and Eraser, the Downward spiral comes to a close after the album named song and Hurt.

Perfect 4 neone."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY 4 AND A HALF STARS!","review":"This was my first nine inch nails cd and I didn't like it at first. But it really grew on me. At first I was gonna put like 2 stars but I listened to it again and it really grew on me. Now it is worthy of 4 and a half stars. One of the reasons I didn't like it at first was becasue some of the stuff is just so repetative and just seems to drag on forever like the intros to some of the songs like \\"Reptile\\". But now I don't mind that at all. Actually I like it for some reason. See Nine Inch Nails music is really ment to be simple and sorta drag on with the intros and some of the techno stuff. See, that sorta is one of the reasons why Nine Inch Nails is awesome and what makes them stand out from alot of bands these days. So just give this album a try, you may not like it at first but trust me, it will grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before The Fragile, there was The Downward Spiral","review":"A few years before Trent's current masterwork The Fragile, he made an album we all know as The Downward Spiral. It was dark, emotional, but it was musical genius. He made an album that perfectly personifies anger, torment, and hatred. There are not many modern artists that can do that on one album(let alone two albums). Like I said, this is NIN's most essential album, so quit reading this and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it only got better!!!!","review":"just like visiting an old friend. u can actually hear all the sound-effects that were not apparent on the 1994 release. the extras are killer, and well worth the wait to see.

The complete freedom that the composer/producer/musician displays on this album is astounding. The constant conflict between perfect, industrial rhythms and unidentifiable-yet-in-key noises and effects is groundbreaking and mesmerizing. While the lyrics are startling in their honesty I suspect that they are presented in the context of intelligent satire rather than for brutal shock effect. Any musicologist should enjoy this alternative and intriguing journey into unknown musical territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"DARK and good.","review":"Definetly a highly rated album... \\"Hurt\\" and \\"Closer\\" are the high points and most popular. \\"Big Man With a Gun\\" is great!Overall very DARK.

I could not see listening to this entire album very much, but then again some people do watch \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\" more than once now don't they?I think it is a strong album, but in my opinion I do think it has been over rated in some sectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves an infinity of negative stars","review":"Ladies and gentleman, I present the (expurgated) lyrics to \\"Big Man With A Gun\\":I am a big man, and I've got a big gun.

Sorry to dissapiont all NIN fans, but they have hit rock bottom with this one. I suppose that it just shows that with this type of music, there's not much else to do than to go 'downward'.

IF YOU WANT REAL INDUSTRIAL GET MINISTRY MANSON OR ZOMBIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius? Hardly.","review":"My brother loves Nine Inch Nails. Every time I hear this particular album Reznor's work is not what I hear. I hear David Bowie (\\"Low\\" era), Joy Division, etc. I don't understand why everyone gets all excited about this guy. I mean, sure, it's ok, but it's not terribly original. More like a collage. Plus, his lyrics have never been his strong point (they still aren't), and I find them particularly grating. So, he combined elements of pop, rock, industrial... big deal. Get all excited about it if you want, but the works he copped his ideas from are much more fufulling. I'd recommend any of them over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"www.atomhammer.com","review":"Incredible.I wont tell you how great this album is as (it would take too long and) you wouldnt be here if you needed proof. Its a true classic in every sense.Now i recieved this remixed 2xCd pack last week and its the best purchase ive made in a long time.I swear its allmost unsettling as to how much better this mix is in surround sound when compared to the classic stereo originals. If you have surround sound and a decent hi-fi or TV at home you will be surprised how fresh, how vital, how surprisingly up to date this album sounds. It hasn't aged.If ever there was a album that cried out 'genius' and bekoned new fans toa genre that otherwise is stale and cliche'd its this album!Even if your not a NIN fan id advise people to get this record as its the best surround sound album ive ever heard. Itstruly THAT good.CLoser, Heresy, and Hurt has never felt so good! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Use for Digital 5.1","review":"Trent Reznor makes great use of your 5.1 Surround Sound audio system. It is so great to have an artist that embraces technology in his art. He gives his listeners an audio experience that no one can beet. This is not only a great improvement over the original album from a pure audio point of view (even if you just use the CD side), but is a great pick up for anyone that want to make the most out of their spanken new Audio System.

Interesting here and there and boring in other places. But the as soon as Trent Reznor starts singing I start to cringe. Lyrically he's HORRIBLE! Big Man With A Gun is the worst offender, but Closer and Hurt are also prime examples of his lyrical ineptitude . The only song I can stand is Ruiner, but most of the time I pertend he's a foreign musician speaking in some unknown language."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Their Best","review":"Well I Thought This one and 'Pretty Hate Machine'were the 2 best ones but I Was Wrong This was the best one i guess i mean every time i go into a record store and look for nin there is always the same albums there like: the fragile,pretty hate machine, and of course this one.But I'm Just going to have to skip right to the point this album rules!!!

I thought it was worth the price though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Album, Horrible Release","review":"I give this album one star solely because the CD side WILL NOT play in a computer! I love the content of the album; it's one of my favorites. The remixes are all pretty good, from listening to the album in a CD player or as a DVD.

Froget about the music for a second (if possible) juts listen to these insane lyrics I mean Trent really got in touch with that darkside and boy I bet he looked so deep inside he probably scared the living %$#& out of himself. There's so much diversity on here, from the pounding MR. Selfdestruct to the last track Hurt you'll feel different and your views even your outlook on life will change. My favorite moment on this album is in the middle of ruiner, that amazing guitar solo man it rocked my world. This album touch such subjects as heresy and suicide even the title suggests that this isin't for those people who are willing to igonore the ugliness of this world or those light hearted pop lovers.

Also I'm betting quite a few hate it because Trent could musically beat the pants off of his Contemporaries (like 2Pac, and Snoop Doggy Sh*thead...er Dogg)and to be honest, yes some of the songs do suck. My actual Favorite is #2 (Heresy) and another is the much talked about Big man with a gun (why does this seem like a rasberry to all the 2 Live Crew wannabe rappers of 93-94?) Maybe if they would actually sit down for a few hours and listen to this and try to get the whole THEME of the album, it's be better, because Unlike Antichrist Svperstar, the almost lyrical/musical play isn't just handed to you, you have to look and listen to the lyrics, you'll find what it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTERPIECE ONLY TRENT COULD PULL OFF","review":"Trent did a great job w/ this and if u r wondering if u should buy if well..if you like industrial and u like the big bands like KMFDM and SkinnyPuppy that inspired this guy buy the CD and all of his others.Trent is simply one of the best along w/ nivek and sache"},{"rating":"2","title":"best produced album I've ever heard","review":"The best album by NIN, and a standout album in its own right.

Kudos Trent and Co."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thew Best CD ever made","review":"This CD is by far the greatest CD ever made (except for maybe Antichrist Superstar).

Since when do tuneless techno beats and obnoxious screeching constitute good music? At times it's physically painful to hear. The lyrics are trash. The 'concept' is just a thinly veiled rip-off of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" and The Who's \\"Quadrophenia.\\" This is just a pile of garbage with a Parental Advisory label slapped on to deceive young people into thinking it's somehow mature. And, sadly, it worked. If you have more than a couple brain cells to use, skip NIN and find out what real music is."},{"rating":"1","title":"THROW A BOMB AT ME, BUT...","review":"I thought that this album was very boring. Though at rare times it was very good, (closer, piggy, man with a big gun, downward spiral), the rest of this album is just extremely repetitive and boring, in my opinion. Most of the songs sound the same to me. I suppose that you could compare that desciption with KoRn's title album, a lot of them just sound the same. Sure, you can flame me for hating a \\"Great\\" album, but i was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"THAT'S A MINUS ONE STAR!","review":"To think I actually use to listen to this garbage. My life was very dark back then. This is quite possibly the most depressing band of all time. If you want your life to plummet into a dark emotional hell, void of any self worth, then buy this or any other NIN cd's, they'll do the trick. I wonder how many suicides this trent's music is responsible for, painful to think. Have a wonderful day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"as a side note, i have listened Downward Spiral more times than i can remember...","review":"Ya, you're really, really scary and depressed Trent Reznor (NIN), just like the stupid people that follow your music. If you want industrial rock that doesn't induce fitful attacks of tear producing mirth, than listen to Godflesh. Broaderick and Co. grab Reznor by his long hair, string him up and kick the chair out from under his feet. It isn't a contest. Out of the kindness of my heart, I will even mention the four best Godflesh albums for those of you not in-the-know: Streetcleaner, Pure, Hymns and Us and Them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one thing:","review":"Trent Reznor writes incredible music, but horrible lyrics.

This album was packed with punch as well as style."},{"rating":"2","title":"ProCon","review":"Seems as though most people are very strong on their thoughts of this CD. It's either good or bad. I haven't listened much to it...but I would suggest that you just listen to the trial songs, and determine then. Some people claim the lyrics make no sense...really they do. They all do, it's just a different term of logic that they forget to switch over too. So, once again, if you feel that some of the songs are worthy of listening to again, then buy it. A great cd to listen to in an angsty or confused mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!","review":"Don't be tricked into buying this album. Buy the non-import version of the downward spiral. It rocks. This $37 version has ONE extra track that you can get on the Crow Soundtrack, which also rocks. Don't throw your money away on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of all time.","review":"I listen to this practically every day, I have for the past year and a half. This album really flows. It has a story to it, though it is fictitious. A man goes through various levels of hatred and self-loathing, becoming less and less human. Then finally in track 13, he kills himself. This is THE BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME. BUY IT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album itself is great, the surround is a worthwhile novelty","review":"If you want the review of the music itself, you might as well check out the page for the regular copy. Everyone knows it's great. As for the surround, it's good for a change of pace, and it gives the songs a fresh feeling, but it doesnt take long before you're longing to flip it over and just listen to the stereo version. Maybe it's because my surround system isn't high-end, but the surround version just isn't quite as good for everyday listening. It's great for sitting back in the dark and immersing yourself in all of the little details that have been blasted into full audibility, but from what I've experienced, the songs lose a good deal of catchiness and listenability in the surround format. I enjoy listening to the surround version on rare occasions, and I think it's easily worth the small price increase, but for my everyday listening, nothing beats stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish i could give it no stars.","review":"Everyone that says that this is heavy is stupid, its not the least bit heavy, its slow techno beats with boring whispering lyrics.

The rest of this album bites, however. It is a lot of noise-really grating noise-that doesn't warrant a second listen. Sorry I bought it.

Next time I will stick with the single off one of this guys albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and very degrading","review":"Why make noise like this ?

I was into pop-punk at the time, and my musical taste didn't jump out of that genre until recently, and i found this the other day and put it in, it is one of the most beautiful musical masterpeices of all time, i would rank this up on a list of favorites behind Pink Floyd's the wall, and Hurt, is the most emotional song you could ever hear, this album is great from start to finish, tho it is really an aquired taste even if you're a fan of certain NIN songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Album that inspired me to make music","review":"This album is one of my favourites by Nine Inch Nails. After purchasing Broken back in 1996, I really got into them.The Downward Spiral is a heavy-hitting, yet mellow and done by Trent Reznor without any flaw. The album came out much better than I had expected. I got it pretty late -- about 5 years after its release (in 1999, when I bought The Fragile).With tracks like \\"Heresy\\" and \\"Piggy\\", with \\"March Of The Pigs\\", this album is sure to please any Nine Inch Nails fan, or start you on your way to becoming one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only enjoyed 2 songs","review":"For NIN's 2nd full-length album, this one didn't hold up for me. I only really enjoyed \\"March of the Pigs\\", and \\"Closer\\". As 1 viewer stated in the headline of his review, it's an audio suicide note. Trent was going through a terrible time during this recording and it certainly shows not only in this one, but also on \\"Further Down the Spiral\\". When I was younger I used to love this album. Recently I stuck the cd in my stereo and ended up turning it off after a few songs. Not my favorite anymore. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"great and quickly sent...","review":"love the cd---and it came quickly...It really, like always has the great balance of harsh songs and even mellow...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumbs Upward for The Downward Spiral","review":"Okay, I don't necessarily buy into all of Trent Reznor's lyrics (\\"God is dead, and no one cares...\\"), but poetry aside, this album deserved all of the critical acclaim it received. The Nine Inch Nail composed what I consider to be one of the best albums of the 1990's, and Reznor shows that Industrial music is not just out there to be danced to. Nine Inch Nails uses a superb mixture of high-reverb guitars, keyboards, sound effects and beats to portray a spectrum of emotional highs and lows compressed into a flow which I feel is on par with Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon.\\" Reznor packs a hard and noisy whallop on the first half of the album which reaches a climax with the song \\"Big Man With A Gun\\". After this, things slow down dramatically until the final song \\"Hurt\\" hits you with one big, depressing knockout punch. The feeling conveyed on \\"The Downward Spiral\\" is phenomenal, and it's a must-buy for alternative and hard-rock junkies alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trent is a musical GOD","review":"From start to finish, this album is flawless. In my opinion the best album ever. As always, Trent awes the audience with a raw yet perfected sound it would seem impossible for him to ever top the ranks of this album. There is NO better musician, in any genre. Plain and simple, Trent IS a GOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best band of the 90's [bar nirvana]","review":"This album is simply brillant. I listened to Pretty Hate Machine until is started to wear away but this is a totally new chapter in Trent's career. I've been advised to buy Broken but I can't find it anywhere.

Trent Reznor is without a doubt a genius, and there are so many moments of brilliance on his second record, The Downward Spiral. There are some moments of self indulgence as well, though. This album will probably be too much for some listeners. Too much pain is on the album, they'll say. This is not an album for easy listening, but for the angry, disillusioned soul, this is where to turn. Amidst the hard,ugly songs (\\"Mr. Self Destruct\\", \\"Ruiner\\",-the titles say it all) there are also many moments of beauty (\\"Hurt\\", \\"A Warm Place\\")that the numbness from the rest of the album is alleviated. Overall, this album is an amazing technical achievement; machine-created music with a human heart beating underneath. It's defintely not for all tastes though, or for people easily offended. If you can look past that though, and appreciate an original work of art, give this one a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Big dissapointment.

Trent Reznor has made a work of art with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart.","review":"TDS was Reznor's darkest and from what I think his best piece of work in his entire career (and also his most disturbing). If you are trying to get into Nine Inch Nails, I would recommend either With Teeth, Year Zero, or The Fragile, as they are cd's that are less dark than this. However, if you are into NIN, you should DEFINITELY pick up this cd.My favorite songs: Mr. Self Destruct, Heresy, Closer, March of the Pigs, Ruiner, Eraser, Reptile, A Warm Place, and finally Hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"Althought the lyrics on this CD can at times be offensive and/or inappropriate this album is one of the best of Nine Inch Nails."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to give it a 6","review":"The story of a man on the downward spiral. dark but very artistic. wow. never, ever, ever will this one get old."},{"rating":"2","title":"PIGGY PIGGY!!!","review":"This cd is great!!

Heartfelt, deep, surprisingly delicious.","review":"This CD is absolutely Trent Reznor's Masterpiece. Without him even telling you, you know exactly that this CD was a product of his serious, suicidal depression, and the aggresive tinge that pulled him out of it. Being a rock album with Techno undertones, there are absolutely no limits to what sound may be used, and yet, we will all get the regular rock sound that is expected. So there we have it, the perfect utensils, and the perfect artist... painting a masterpiece with an unlimited array of colors, and a raging emotional drive that never lets up.Overall, it's perfect. Not a single track bored me. Not a single second felt off track. This is Trent Reznor, in these words, and tones, and tearing, breaking, strained sounds. Taste what he has created. You will never be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else do you expect????Part 3","review":"First off I do not want to write like 100 pages of why NIN(Trent Reznor)is a Genius, because I can, but a quick review on this album that I urge everybody who has given this album negative reviews to LISTEN TO IT AGAIN. I've been a NIN fan since the beginning and each album is different and unique in it's own way. There is no possible way that I can put one album above another because they are ALL MASTERPEICES, and The Downward Spiral is no exception. If you don't like it at first just listen to it again with an open mind and I think that you will be able to at least give Reznor some credit. I'm all about people having their OWN opinions but at least give things a REAL try. I can truly say that this is as good as anything he has ever done. So If you don't like it, that is fine, and if you do like it then all the better.

And too much so. The most promising section of the whole album is the middle section of \\"Ruiner,\\" featuring a good bass break and some nice distortion guitar work.

The weird thing about TDS is when I first listened to it, I thought it was awful. As my knowledge of music grew I started to notice how genious it was and still is. Anywho, nothing sounds like it.

I had heard a lot of good things about NIN and was really looking forward to listening to this cd, but when I got I listened all the way through, and it blew hard. There is no real \\"music,\\" it is just a lot of sampled sounds and random fuzz tones. It honestly hurts the ears; if I wanted to hear something like this I would stand outside a construction site. Also Trent's pathetic singing and lyrics border on the mindless idiocy of all other music made today. he critizes everyone and everything, in a pathetic effort to show that only he sees the problems and the solutions. music like this makes me ashamed to be a 90's kid. don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. reznor, you sir are a genius","review":"Well, let me just say that this album is by far the greates ever made, and not since the death of Nietzche has there been such a remarkable voice to remind us about that inescapable abyss of nothingness ,via that powerful Reznor mumble then scream singing. All the songs are great, not one wink link. I have to agree with people magazine when they say that this album is the work of a truly tortured genius. this album is completely original I have never heard anything like it, it is even different fron reznor's other work, but then again no nin nail song is alike, when I listen to the downward spiral it inspires me to write macabe poetry of my own. And a special kudos to reznor for finally challenging all those American institutions that no one seems to want to tackle, religion, how individualism is drowned by the masses, what a revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and mindless","review":"Mindless anger and \\"dirty\\" content alone don't make a good or bad album. The people that automatically dismiss this CD (and many others) just because of the Explicit Lyrics label or the mindless-angst themes are missing the point. However, so are the people who adore it just for those reasons. There also has to be some real thought and inspiration behind the music, or else it's just noise. Trent R is just one more guy trying to be loud and obnoxious to make up for the fact that he can't write good music. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trent Reznor needs to grow up.","review":"\\"The Downward Spiral has some great songs such as 'Closer' and 'Hurt', but the rest of the album is an unnecessary attack on Christianity, religion, and decency in general. He curses at God and Christianity as though his life has been traumatized by them. ... 'Man with a gun' is probably one of the most repulsive songs ever made; truly it is there for shock value and nothing else. I don't think an entire chord was played throughout the entire album, only screechy noises and industrial sounds pollute the tracks.

Only because it's from mid 90's and Fragile is more for 2000(now). NIN get's better as the years go by, so keep that in mind! So, if your a true NIN fan, you have to buy it!

I got addicted. There is rarley a day in which I don't listen to NIN. The music speaks volumes, touches emotions other bands can't reach. What's more it is an album rather than a collection of songs. The significance of the title is enforced throughout the album and tells the tale of someone falling out of life. I can relate to this having almost fallen to the bottom myself. This album helped me. Thank you Trent. I only hope The Fragile (their next album) will acheive the same level of mental provocation. I have heard that it will be a double CD and include several instrumentals. If they are as good as A Warm Place then the world will be a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better sounding and more original than Filter.","review":"Not to knock Filter, but Nine Inch Nails is a whole lot better varied than Richard Patrick's brain child. I had never listened to NIN until my local TV station started using music samples from this album on their ad promos. The one they used is the catchy \\"Closer\\", which has become one of my favorites. Infact all the songs on here are made up of catchy keyboard & synthesizer sounds, which is good because that's a small part of the music genre I'm getting into. You could call NIN ambient rock. Some of the songs sound like video game music heard on early 90's games. Nine Inch Nails should have been on the \\"Songs In The Key Of X\\" album. Filter is still good, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"(...) And second this is an awesome CD. If you like Marilyn Manson then you would like this record.

I could not stop listening. David is a genius when it comes to writing and arranging music.

The premise is a clever idea gone horribly wrong. Much of the rhyme is unoriginal or forced and some of it goes on and on and on so that we feel we are stuck in one of the author's horror novels. Stick to what you do best Mr. Koontz and leave quality children's writing to quality children's authors, please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvellous book for all grandmothers, moms & daughters","review":"This small book packs a big wallop - it says all one would hope to say about the warmth and love of a grandmother for her grandaughter; and vice versa.

When the granddaughter was younger they would bake cookies and go shopping together. Now that she is growing up and the grandmother is getting older she is beginning to forget things. The granddaughter gives her something special so that she will never forget her.This book tells us that there are special gifts that can be given but the greatest gift is the gift of love.

The illustrations are truly incredible, and extremely realistic. This story is quite satisfying and will bring a tender joy to your heart. Susan Bosak uses a poignant, candid language that allows the nice story to shine through. It is just something that should be share with as many generations within your family as possible.This book should be required reading for all families.

I certainly didn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and Unique Fragrance","review":"I read about the development of this fragrance in the book \\"The Perfect Scent.\\" It piqued my interest about the fragrance and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try this fragrance. I was not disappointed-it became my \\"fragrance for 2008.\\" It is light, clean, and subtle but with a unique and distinct finishing edge that is almost steely, In fact, it could be almost but not quit be worn by a man. When I wear it, I have always received compliments - the best sort because people are not quite sure that I am wearing a fragrance. If you like the heavy fragrances often sprayed on you in department store, this fragrance may not be your cup of tea. If you like the light and unusual, don't miss this fabulous scent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Like Any Other Summer Scent","review":"I'm a big fan of \\"non-traditional\\" perfumes - I don't care for sweet floraly scents, and I have been known to poach my man's cologne occassionally, just to enjoy the scent all day. So if you like citrusy/woodsy scents, you MUST try this one - it has an unusual top note and dry-down that are hard to describe, but anyway it never fails to get compliments from men, and the \\"WHAT are you wearing?\\" from women.It's intense, but it's not overpowering the way some Orientals can be. But it's also summery-light. I can't explain it - just try it. A couple of times. And for something even more unusual, try Jardin Mediterrenne (sp?) also by Hermes - the only perfume I've ever given 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woodsy, seductive and exotic...truly gorgeous scent","review":"The product arrived before the expected date.

Great product.But it looked like was opened already. WTF? there was no plastic wrapping around the product box and the perfume seems to have been used before. The bottle sprayed at full volume at the very first press, and there seems to be slight signs of being opened with the box. Not cool man, not cool. I don't know if that's just a Hermes quirk but it just doesn't look good when presenting a gift.If you are looking to get this.... I don't know, just be sure you don't spend $100 on something that looks like an opened item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I enjoy wearing this perfume. It has a light gentle fragrance that lingers in a goode way. Generally, I judge all my perfumes by whether or not they give me a migraine. I am subject to migraines by aromas and if a fragrance gives me a migrane then I know it is not for me. Un Jardin Sur Le Nil plainly does not do that! In fact, it makes me feel goode when I wear it. I wear it often and am glad that I purchased it. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing and different","review":"I do not usually wear perfume but I wanted a fragrance for my wedding and went searching for something that I thought went with a desert oasis kind of thing and settled on this.

Anyway, I love this perfume and will be sad when they stop making it eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh scent","review":"Garden (just like the name)is on my mind when I use this perfume.

Get a Gateway or Dell instead...two companies that actually care about their customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I thought that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a great book for kids. Its one of those books that kids love and read over and over again. The story teaches kids not to take food or anything from strangers even the least expected person. The story takes place in castle but when the queen orders Snow White to be killed she runs away into the forest. But, when the queen finds out she changes her identity and goes after her. Join Snow White in this dangerous and fun filled adventure as she discovers the beauty of the forest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This is a must read for any little princess (or prince) This classical story will never grow old or boring my kids love it as do I!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow White","review":"I think the person who said this book makes dwarfs look lazy, needs to re-read this book. It shows how much they loved Snow White and cared about her. Too many of you so called goody two shoes needs to really sit and think how wonderful Mr. Disney's books are. Those dwarfs cared about snow white showed that it was ok for a man to cry and be sensative. Some of the woman now a days need to realized that woman do cook and clean and men still do go out to work. As a single parent of three grown children, who worked and reared my children by myself, I read all the Disney books to my children and I am now reading to my grandchildren. Wake up America, Power Rangers are dangerous to our Children not Snow White. This generation now needs more stories like Snow White to show how sensative even Little People can be. Get your heads out of the ground. We all need to learn how to love one another and how to be sensative once again in this cruel world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow White Enforces Dysfunctional Relationships","review":"Snow White has NO character in the book but manages to marry a man who also has NO character. It portrays women as either perfect (Snow White) or entirely evil (Wicked Step-Mother). It contradicts it's own message in that the wicked step-mother's quest for beauty makes her evil but Snow White lands prince charming because of her remarkable beauty. It's not a good thing to fill impressionable children's minds with in my oppinion. I'll be writting an alternative version of most disney books and presenting it to them. Keep an eye out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dwarves Are People Too!","review":"I feel that Disney has definitely crossed the line in poking fun at a group of short-statured miners. Even though each in the group had their own quirks, they seemed to single out Dopey, just because he was a little slow. So not only are they insulting people with hormonal defects which affect height, they are also mocking the mentally challenged. Disney implies that these types of people are outcasts, living alone in a forest. Disney also suggests that they are incompetent and unable to care for themselves until a pretty young, unknowing girl comes along. They are forced to do nothing but mine for jewels all day, while Snow White cooks, cleans, and takes care of them. They carry heavy loads of jewels and rock everyday, yet they are portrayed as plump, and cannot even lift a broom."},{"rating":"1","title":"same as all of the other programs of this nature, that I have purchased in the past","review":"Over the years I have had several differant programs like this one.After listening to more then half of this set I find nothing new.The only thing good about this is, that I purchased it from Amazon so, I only had to pay $81.52.If I had purchase it from their website it would have it would have been over 100.00.I would have liked to return it but, figured since I had opened it They would not accept it as a return."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"When I read all of the positive reviews this book was getting--and it is getting them on important issues like wisdom and joy--I expected sage advice. What I found was a non-denominational, quasi-religious book that fails on all fronts: I felt depressed after reading the first few pages and that feeling did not relent through 300 pages. You do not have to take my word on this: use Amazon's \\"Look Inside\\" to see what I mean. Right from the beginning you will see the pattern of bromides and feel-good non-philosophy that continue to the last page.Religious people will hate this book because the author does not believe in a kind and loving God that sets absolute rules of morality to guide his children. Non-religious people should hate it because the author fails to teach you how to live your dreams. My suggestion is that you find guidance on the infinite possibilities somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip-off!","review":"This book reads like many religious nut jobs talk: if bad things happen to you it's your own fault because you did not BELIEVE!! This book is at least as bad as the Secret, which makes sense since he was involved in that too. Mike Dooley trys to get around every possible reason why this idea of you creating all of reality does not work. It is twisting and laborious. For instance, he brings up arguments other might make regarding their life experience showing it does not work.\\" Well, Mike, if thoughts become things is as predictable as gravity, then what about those dreams of ours that have never seen the light of day? Why haven't I won the lottery yet?\\". The answer? \\"We never want just one thing, and we never think just one thought..... Some of our thoughts may contradict one another or be mutually exclusive\\". Get it? It's your fault!! I have two words for this work of fiction: convoluted crapola.

I cannot recommend purchasing these CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is blatantly a lie!","review":"Like myriad other new age authors, Dooley states that there is no sin; no evil and no hell. Well, I'm here to tell you that I know; yes, I know that there is! Before I had even heard of Dante, I had the same experience he did, only I was taken to only three levels of hell. I could describe them to you in exact detail, but there is no point because people are going to believe what they choose to believe. Just because someone hasn't seen something or experienced it, doesn't nullify the fact that it exists. And if this man has been on this earth as long as he has and not seen evil, I must ask is he unfamiliar with Adolf Hitler; Stalin; Leopold II of Belgium; September 11th or 9/11), where a series of four coordinated suicide attacks were launched by al-Qaeda on the United States, and many, many other proofs of sin and evil?

As soon as I put on the head, a giant toaster began chasing me around a sunny field. While I was running, the daises in the field all began chanting, \\"Move to Fresno!

This is good company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinite Possibilities-The Art of Living Your Dreams","review":"The author, Mike Dooley,is evidentley a person of many realizations, for he expresses some very fundamental truths throughout the book. This keeps one reading, eager for the next revelation. Mike Dooley is unique among authors of such books as he shares his deep ponderings on the meanings of life. Perhaps he is an angel or some such being that has come to Earth, perhaps an Ancient Sage? He appears to have all the attributes of a Wise One. You will want to read the book again for its very simplicity is quite disarming. If his writings are anything to go by, he must be quite a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suffice to say","review":"Suffice to say, I have ordered twelve more copies - for family and friends. Having read 'Notes from the Universe' and recieved the daily notes via email, I used Mike Dooley's observations as a kind of \\"spiritual chocolate\\" treat each morning to set the tone for my day. However, this book resonates with me on a deeper level at this point in my journey - I am hearing and understanding the Law of Attraction in a new, more vibrant way. I believe that, having been on a path of self discovery, like so many others, and finding great teachers like Abraham, Eckart Tolle, Louise Hay etc., now is the perfect time for the insights of Mike Dooley!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can have it all and more","review":"You can live your dreams .this program is the best I have ever heard and I have heard them all!

I believe that is why many rational thinkers are turned off by what is basically a scientific law. If when we entered grade school as children, we came home telling our parents that we learned simple addition and its magical attributes of drawing abundance into our lives, our parents would withdraw us immediately and begin to home school.In order for humanity to accept the logical,scientific benefits of the Law of Attraction, it must be taught honestly, practically and with sound reasoning.

Maybe when I started reading I was just not in the right mood for it, but one thing it did give me was total disappointment (not what I was going for). I read a couple reviews that say the book is too \\"fluffy\\", and I wholeheartedly agree. All the spiritual tones to the book are worded in a super fluffy (for lack of a better word) way and of subject matter that is totally obvious. I expected this book to be more spiritual than religious, but was even further disappointed to read biblical verses taken out of context. If you're going to reference the Bible, at least do it correctly.

Rather it is a book that needs to be taken slowly, every word savoured, and every concept thought about thoroughly before moving on. I have found it a timely reminder about things I have always known but temporarily forgotten. I have used these concepts myself in the past, (I successfully manifested a car, and a wonderful husband too, incidentally), but somewhere along the line I forgot how to do this. This is the reason I am devouring this book so now. It is the ultimate guide to grabbing life by the horns and really LIVING it, literally making your dreams come true, and living in a close harmony with everything around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome","review":"Being a student of life, I have consumed many a program, book, seminar and other offering. What I found here from Mike Dooley is something that is first SIMPLE. The material is not simple, Mike just makes it seem that way. Great information and insights expressed in an easy to digest format make this program so enjoyable and productive. I've heard some of these concepts before, but Mike presents them with some real world examples in a manner that allows these truths to sink into the depth of my being. I find myself sharing these ideas, truths and concepts with many people I meet along this journey.Mike's style is simple, but the power of these concepts when placed into practice become Awesome. I have decided to live my life on purpose and Mike presents the technology and the tools to make that a reality.

Also, I have to say that the content of these CDs is extremely interesting, dinamic and 100% practical. I've bought several other audio programs of this nature before (Tony Robbins, James Ray, Deepak Chopra, etc.) and, even thought all those audios are very interesting and practical too, they are not as good as \\"The Infinite Possibilities\\" of Mike dooley. He is not trying to attach you to any coach or spiritual leader and he don't want to make you spend more money.

Do you believe the direct testimony, both written and oral in both the present and the soon-to-be-released past, of the man himself with a distinguished career spanning 4 Presidents?

This is exceptionally vague and unsupportable for a history/research book and it sometimes wanders into the realm of Monica Lewinski fantasy, but only lightly.3) The author seems to be giving offhanded slams to Bush (W). He frequently refers to ineffective missile strikes on Bin Laden by Clinton with terms like \\"empty gesture.\\" It happens enough that it seems to be alluding to Bush's frequent bombings of empty caves in Afghanistan and empty buildings in Iraq. It is confusing coming from a purportedly rightward leaner, and is a bit out of line to undermine a sitting president this way.

Those who prefer to blame Bush, who had been President for only 7 months and 2 weeks when 9/11 occurred had hardly had time to lay out a plan for handling the threat, will do so for political reasons; but there is evidence that 9/11 plotters were in this country in 2000 and had at least appeared on the radar of our intelligence services that year. It's well known that Clinton preferred to handle terrorist acts as domestic crimes; this weakened the transfer of information between intelligence agencies. Thank heaven, we've learned from his mistakes; and are making a real effort now to combat terrorism.

Even the eyepiece holders, Barlow lens and the 90' diagonal... Plastic. Chose to go with an Orion. I hope this model does not represent the average of Mead's design quality. During use, the flexibility of the all plastic construction allows for too much play in adjustment.

History reported the print had turned to dust, when one final nitrate was found in a janitor's closet in 1968. Only two rare video releases of \\"The Ghoul\\" have ever been available, and this is the better print. The picture quality is uneven, and sometimes the sound drops out, but anyone who loves the Karloff canon will want to own this \\"Lost Film\\". Karloff plays a demented Egyptologist who defends his sacred Scarab gem with a curse to return from the dead. The story builds to a eerie, fiery climax that you will want to watch again and again. Lovers of film lore get a peek at Ernest Theisiger, the famous Sir Ralph Richardson{as a vicar}, and perhaps the earliest film entrance of Sir Cedric Hardwicke(very nasty}. Pick this one up before it once again becomes a \\"Lost Film\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW, MOODY, ATMOSPHERIC","review":"THE GHOUL (MGM) is about a dying profesor (Boris Karloff) who has a gemstone called \\"The Eternal Light\\" that was looted from an Egyptian tomb. He believes the god Anubis will grant immortality through the jewel and makes his servant promise to bind the gem in his hand when he dies. \\"If it's stolen, I'll return from the dead and seek revenge.\\" Naturally, the servant steals the stone. You get the idea. The 1933 UK film features a young Ralph Richardson. Slowly paced with moody cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival","review":"I've tried watching this movie over the years and found it boring,cold and so confusing that I could never understand what was happening. With this new DVD, I decided to give it another chance. Verdict: it's just as boring, cold and confusing as before. Technically, it looks great. Wonderful shadows and lighting. But this film moves soooooo slow. And poor Boris Karloff. He does what he can in the role of the glaring, stumbling old ghoul but he acts embarassed by the whole stunt. Great Britian simply didn't have the know-how in the early thirties to make a great horror flick like those being turned out by Universal. Don't waste your time on this one. Watch the l932 \\"The Mummy\\" instead to see how a real classic looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"KARLOFF!!!","review":"Pretty dull, until the last 20 minutes or so.

There is literally not a scratch on this 70 year old horror from Gaumont British studios. My only slight quibble is that the contrast varies slightly - sometimes appearing a bit washed out. The sound too is excellent with good clear dialogue and no background hiss that usually accompanies films of this vintage.The film itself is an incredibly talky affair and only really kicks in during the final half hour or so - but it's worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ghoul a 1933 film with Boris Karloff","review":"The quality of the video was lousy,extremely dark you barely see it.

While it is very thorough, I found the structure of the book to be haphazard and unintuitive. There are a lot of occurances of \\"but first, lets go back a bit,\\" a sure sign of poor writing. While trying to keep to the problem-design-solution framework, the authors often introduced ideas in the problem phase, but never clearly addressed them in the design and solution phase -- often vaguely tying it all together with a statement like \\"and we took care of this problem as well\\" without really referencing it.There is a great deal of information in this book, but I found it very difficult to extract coherently. And saying \\"but its not for beginners\\" is no excuse for poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the beginner or intermediate programmer","review":"There is absolutely no PHP or My-Sql teaching in this book.

There is no better way to learn than the method this book enunciates - the construction of each module that makes up a web site is clearly described through each of its chapters. It was also refreshing to see that the application that was implemented in the book is available online - forums,newsgroups, news feeds, message boards, complete shopping cart with check out features, and a very neatly written final chapter that takes a look at what could have been done better - refactoring, templating etc along with a fullish perspective of the whole application.Kudos to the author team, for a job well done.

It comes with layouts of code on how to do pages like forums, creating ads, and taking polls. The only problem I had was using PEAR DB. As far as I know Pear is relatively new and it was way too hard to try and figure out how to incorporate that into my Database. I was using MySQL on CRUX, and for me it was difficult to figure out. They also use a lot of require_once lines. I know what they are used for, but the code was so long that for one page they used require_once for multiple different pages. I think for a beginner, this book is not the way to go. For people who have no dea what PEAR is or how to set it up, this book Not the way to go. If your experienced somewhat in PHP and know Pear, knock yourself out!For me, the book was too advanced, I have done some web sites in PHP but not at this level.

They write great lyrics, which range from creepy story telling, to introspective, hurt looks at lost faith. Todd Lewis' voice has a desperate urgency that keeps you holding on for more. This album will stand the test of time. It was without a doubt one of the best of the 90's.

Some key tracks on there include Possum Kingdom, Tyler, Mr. Love, I Come From the Water, and I Burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"I bought this for my 17 y.o. son.

Moreover, the authors seems to be quite qualified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Burgess Live","review":"Mark Burgess, once and futurely of the Chameleons, returns with yet another great post-Chameleons CD. Recording and releasing 3 offical albums with the Chameleons in the 80s, Burgess then joined the Sun & Moon and released his most uneven work. His \\"solo\\" career with the Sons of God started with Zuma Junction, very hard to find but worth it, and follows with the Spring Blooms Tra-La. This CD finds Mark in fine form with a strong backing band covering his career with the Chameleons and the Zuma Junction CD. While the Sons of God are not the Chameleons they do a great job of filling in the missing gang. The sound quality is good and surpasses some of the post-breakup Chameleons' releases. This is a good introduction to Mark Burgess and his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't we try....to ignore her?","review":"She totally butchered a beautiful Vonda Shepard/Dan Hill song!

Having said that, this tea is very good. The flavor is sweet, reminds me of dates, honey and has a very slight malt flavor. I'm drinking some right now actually :) This tea is not bitter at all. There is nothing exotic oe odd tasting about it, a nice everyday tea, like Earl Grey, but it doesn't taste the same.My father is a doctor and just came back from a medical conference about dieting.

In essence, I have thrown away $30.00, since one cannot return tea. I've learned a good lesson - DO NOT BUY ANYTHING YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IN A LARGE QUANTITY ! Next time I will make it my business to sample the tea somehow before buying. If a smaller amount is unavailable, I'll simply pass it by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for individual sale","review":"I should have realized how small this was. This is what they give out for free at the department stores and I ended up paying $10.00 for this! The shipping was $4.00 for standard delivery, and it arrived in an ENVELOPE! On the back it says \\"not for individual sale\\" I thought it would be cute for a stocking stuffer, but is it even legal to sell these? Or is it the \\"honor\\" system? If so, where is the honor? Watch out who you are buying from. It was stupid of me to not pay more attention,but shame on this supplier for SELLING free samples and then gouging you on the shipping! I will never buy any product from them, because I would not trust the source of their products, the age of the products or the quality of their products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic and timeless album - must have!","review":"I love all songs on this album, even the intro!

I just hope they stay together for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"True R&B Music laced by the New Jack King himself..","review":"BLACKstreet formed not long after the release of Bobby Brown's second album. Comprised of Chauncey Hannibal, Joseph Stonestreet, Levi Little and the New Jack Swing innovator Teddy Riley, the group went on to record \\"Baby Be Mine\\" for the CB4 soundtrack. Stonestreet left the group prior to the release of their self-titled debut and was replaced by ex-Jodeci background vocalist David Hollister. The first part of their album consists of supreme R&B dance tracks such as \\"Booti Call,\\" \\"I Like The Way You Work,\\" and \\"U Blow My Mind.\\" The latter half of the album is suited for those feeling romantic. \\"Before I Let You Go,\\" the summer smash of '94, emcompasses a Jodeci-like lead singer in Hollister. \\"Joy,\\" originally written for Michael Jackson, definitely sends out an MJ vibe accompanied by smooth piano background music. Overall, this album showcases BLACKstreet as an up and coming act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to Home","review":"An extremely realistic portrait of the area that I was born in to and spent the first twenty years of my life. This book is so well researched and insightful that I learned many things about the industry that sustained my home town. More importantly though it introduces the reader to the poor immigrant workers that slave away to produce the sugar that most give no thought. If you would would like to be immersed in a world that you know nothing about and learn of a culture, while American, is as different as you may find this book will entertain and educate you."},{"rating":"2","title":"British expressionism","review":"I can't decide between Kossoff and Auerbach who is best.Both use heavy paint. Sometimes this is overwhelming. Kossoff is at his best when he is painting family and friends. His humor is obvious. Some of his work is too close to Roualt .The large heads..for example. I like some of his landscapes ,as well.The text gives you a good idea of his struggles with paint.Luckily he found support, The Brits seem to be more generous in enabling the artists then we have in the United States. The U.K. is much smaller than the U.S.They manage to give their artists careers.The situation for artist in the U.S. is more competitive and difficult. I wonder why there are so many more books on Francis Bacon than Willem De Kooning. Someone said it is ,because he twisted the head of the figure in distortions like Picasso The book is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare thing","review":"This is something rare, a funny, contemporary easy reader with a clever plot, kid-friendly humor, and natural-sounding writing.

Where?The artists are merely footnotes in this saga; weirdos to be tolerated (barely) and joked about. I spent a lot of money on this tome hoping to read about some of them. Instead I got 450 pages of business talk with about 4500 witticisms to amuse and confuse.At least I found out why their awesome back catalogue has shamefully been left to earn whatever dollars it can in crappy 80's CD output (in the main) while other labels remaster properly and expand on their reissues - Warners just don't give a damn.Won't be reading it again, I assure you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which is more interesting...","review":"...music and the people who create it, or music executives and the deals they grind out?If you answered the latter, this book is for you.

It is definetly colder than earlier kraftwerk but I think that's what makes it. It's a good update of their sound and it could've gone horribly wrong. plus this single is just the tip of the iceberg, I recommend getting the whole album"},{"rating":"1","title":"One more disapointment","review":"This is one more pathetic Kraftwerk's (post Bartos) release.

Well done by one of the best contemporary directors of Egypt. Nasser deserves such a grateful look from everyone in the East and the West."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"If you are familiar with Arabic movies, this one is painfully predictable.

I have the hard copy (i.e., traditional book) version.St. Petersburg 1909 was where Akiba Rubinstein was recognized by most as being the legitimate challenger to Lasker. He defeated Lasker in their individual encounter in this tournament (a very famous game in its own right). Lasker does not burden the reader with extremely deep notes; his style had always been when annotating a game to give clear guidance to the reader about the ebb and flow of the game. For players of less than master strength, his notes will be exactly what is needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Find","review":"I listened and saw Ms. Lynda Lybeck in the Grand Alleutian Hotel in Dutch Harbor, Unalaska Island, Alaska.

However, when I saw and heard this music, she and her piano were surrounded by fishermen, rowdy sailors from the local fishing boats, and factory workers. From all that gruffiness, and raucous behaviour came this beautiful music. Play the songs and listen in a quiet space.

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in educating themselves about how scientific arrogance and corporate greed have contributed to the steady decline of life on this planet. Nikola Tesla's ideas alone would have spared us many of the ecological disasters we now face.

Then it flew out of the back of a truck this past week and it looked like it was history--several keys had popped up in addition to some bumps and scratches. When I got it home and plugged it in, everything other than the popped keys seemed to be working so I had some hope. I took it apart and found it quite easy to put the keys back correctly, and now it is working perfectly again.It has lots of great features for the price. I especially like the 6 track recording capability and the large variety of instruments. It's loud enough for normal use (too loud when some of my kids play it), and when I use it to accompany church choir practice I plug it in to my stereo receiver to amp it up. When it does finally die someday, I'll definitely replace it with a similar model."},{"rating":"2","title":"By No Means the Norm","review":"Judith Thompson has a way of describing grotesque and abstract circumstances with flair. Her abstract character choices and weird twists provide an unpredictable play. Some horrid situations are even humorous because of the characters' cartoonlike presence in the play (reminiscent of Sam Shepard's characters).The play is a wild ride of love, existential human connections, death, and omens. It's a fast read and intriguing story. It's refreshing to experience an original play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Knowledge","review":"This fifty year old book has withstood the test of time.

A mostly dull release in all regards. Plodding songs that show little varience go nowhere. I cannot get into this even after a decade.

Great space saver and easy to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album by Jana","review":"I must admit it's kind hard to believe that a singer that performs in a video like Dirty has something good to offer. But Christina does. Her album \\"Stripped\\" is one of the best I've listened to lately. She wrote almost all the songs (except Beautiful)and they're all great. The lyrics are amazing and meaningful, not only heartbroken songs and stuff like that. It's definitely better than her first album, that I also like a lot. But it's different. When you firt linten to it, you think it's a little weird, but listen the sencond, the third, the fourth time. It's amazing! You get rwally hooked to it. The best songs are Walk Away, Fighter, Loving Me 4 Me, Underappreciated, Beautiful, Make Over, Cruz, Soar, Keep Singin My Song. The other songs are also great! It totally worth your money. You won't regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!!","review":"She made us wait a long time for this cd but it was worth it. The songs are so great and she has such a great voice. I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 becase of Make Over and all the Interludes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Thoughts on Stripped (13 yrs. old)","review":"When I first bought this cd i had the intention of only listening to about one song, but after giving it a try I realized that Christina Aguilera put alot of hard work into it and developed really good songs like \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Can't Hold us down\\". Actually I like this cd most out of all the one's she has so far made. I would recommend anyone to buy this cd.. you might find alot of it impressive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped - Something DEFFINITLY worth singing about","review":"Wow...i must say this album is a far cry from her first album. Christina grew up and this is deffinitly an album for rock fans, pop fans, r&b fans and the like. Has a little bit of something for everyone and a very emotional and insperational feel and message...very enjoyable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Voice,but....","review":"I have a lot more respect for this gal then for Britiney Spears.

If your gonna buy it, do it for the voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I absolutle love this album, it is by far the best Christina has made. Her voice realy shines through and the quality of all the songs is WOW.

However this assumption about this album is not true it is more like her emotions are being stripped down and shown to the world this is a very powerful and touching album. Which, uncovers her true feelings about her life that has sad aspects to it. Christina Aguilera's voice is also original and her music has a flare of her own that she puts into her song. This is her best album yet and should be appreciated by audiences the world over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"My sister turned me on to this cd years ago, when it first came out. I didn't even know who Christinia was. She stole my heart. And till this day, I still pull this cd out and listen to it. What great talent, a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bland.","review":"This is a very bland album by Christina Aguilera. It is supposed to show her sexual side like Madonna did in Erotica but it just turns out boring. Besides I am sick of sexual music, I would rather just have her make quality music.

I don't recommend this album [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS AMAZING","review":"THIS CD SHOW THAT SHE IS TALENTED IN EVERY ASPECT. IT HAS MANY CATCHY TUNES. IT IS A ALL AROUND GOOD CD AND YOU GET TO KNOW ALL ABOUT HER. SHE IS VERY HONEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"This is a good cd, but it is nothing like what I expected. There's no doubt that Ms Aguilera is all grown up. Powerhouse vocals throughout. The tunes range from loungy cool, to powerful anthem, to all out pop. If you're expecting another pop cd that's all about dancing and boys, this is not it. But, if you're interested in strong vocals having something to say, this is a good cd to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice\\\\Just wish she sings differently","review":"The CD is definitely POP, she has a strong voice, but because she is on the POP side, I don't like how she sings her songs. Impossible, Singing My Song, and maybe a few other are good. Definitely not my liking, she has vocals, so I wish her continued success and hope she will continue to blow away the non singing pop singers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have never been a Christina Fan !","review":"You know I've never been a Christina fan at all. Coming from the R&B Background. Rock has never been a selection in my music favorites. However for christmas my best friend brought me the C.D. Stripped. And I must say I really enjoyed the C.D. Especially \\"Impossible\\" written by Ms. Keys. and in the song \\"Walk Away' christina proved she has what it takes to not just be labeled a Rock Artist , but an artist Who demands to be heard and let you know she's no longer a teenager she's a grown woman .And I was sold when I Heard the tracks \\"Voice Within\\" and \\"Sing my song\\". I can't stop playing the cd I enjoy it just that much. I have to say if the next C.D is anything like this one. Then I'll be adding it to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"x-tina rocks","review":"yo this album is dope....what can i say, she is the hottest gurrl on earth, and she's dirrty too...she can sing, she can dance, she is amazing, she inspired me to get my labret pierced ;-) i think she is fierce for not taking whatever from loser guys and i love her new style, she better work :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"geez, i was expecting the album to be much like Dirrty, but its not. It's really good, didn't expect that kind of an album from her.

You will start comparing her to Alicia Keys, Whitney and Mariah. Yes, it is that good.She listened to the critics and stop overdoing it with bountiful, unnecessary high notes and focused more on emotion. With the exception of \\"Dirrty\\", every song on this album is exceeded my expections by a mile and then some. My mouth literally dropped open when I heard the ballads, \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Walk Away\\". \\"Impossible\\" featuring Alicia Keys, \\"I'm OK\\", and the Pink-tinged, \\"Underappreciated\\" are some of the other standout tracks.I am not a big pop fan. I like jazz and indie European artists who most Americans have never heard of. So, even if you aren't a pop fan, you will not be disappointed by this cd. Christina has a long career ahead of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It","review":"Let me start off by saying I've never really been a Christina Aguilera fan (she's kind of skanky). But I do like her \\"I could care less what everyone else thinks about me\\" attitude. That takes alot of personal growth. But anyway, I'm stuck on \\"Infatuated\\" and \\"A Voice Within\\". And of course I'm still jammin' on \\"Fighter\\", \\"Dirty\\" and \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\". For all the Christina haters, even you have to admit yah, she's always showin' her arss but the girl can sing. Most of these other pop \\"singers\\" are ONLY \\"arss shakers\\". I gave the CD four stars rather than five because I would have preferred less slow songs and fewer interludes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina is the most underrated artist in history...","review":"I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My fav songs are \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Dirrty\\", \\"Figher\\", and \\"Beautiful\\"!!!And all u \\"Dirrty\\" haterz gotta admit, it's more fun than anything that Britney, Gwen, or, God forbid, Madonna could have done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"Well I did like Christina's first cd but you know after her xmas cd I should have had 2nd thoughts about this one as with the xmas cd she just went way over the top bawling out her lungs.This album I feel is a total mess. I would not recommend it and wish I hadn't wasted my money. It was a big disppointment. I think she's a very confused person if this album is anything to go by and clearly she should not have co-wroted these songs as it's obvious she has no talent in that area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Well","review":"Boring and pathethic. The songs are boring and the change of image is pathetic. Does an \\"artist\\" have to come up with a new image everytime he or she comes up with a new album? They should know by now that ONLY Madonna can do that! Anyway, \\"Stripped\\" is highly recommended for those who have insomnia. As for Christina, if this is her concept and understanding of \\"maturity,\\" goodness, I'd rather be immature. And one more thing -- you're NOT \\"Beautiful,\\" girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word \\"Trash\\"","review":"This is by far a waste of money, i cant believe i bought this crap, she might have a great voice but she doesent know how to use it, i dont recomend this album to anyone, Shes as Dirty as her Album's title, It should be called \\"Stripper\\" not \\"Stripped\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!","review":"I know most people will disagree with me, but what happened to cute \\"genie in a bottle\\" christina?This image of her does not impress me and neither does her music, her songs are soooooo depressing!!! I like optimistic songs please. I know she says that this album is actually her, so good for her. Because with the amount of albums she has sold, the people like her better this way too. So good for them. But please, if you are like me, and live a happy optimistic life, and LIKE it that way, DONT buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe The Hype- \\"Stripped\\" Isn't Really All That","review":"There were a few songs that I liked on the CD, but the rest were just boring. Oversinging doesn't really impress me; you tend to lose the feeling of a song that way and all you start to hear is a bunch of shouting. Christina needs to develop her own style and come up with some kind of vocal trademark. She has an alright voice but she pretty much sounds like a smorgasbord of various popular female artists. Anyway, I didn't know that Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Alicia Keys were singing back up vocals for Christina. Other than that, most of these songs don't stand out and I would rather listen to a Joss Stone album instead of this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This album is really nothing special, but it's packaged to appear to be an epic album. It's not a full-length listen, none of the songs are all that great, and the album is disjointed and lacks flow. The best of the worst is \\"Walk Away,\\" but even that gets old after a while. I suggest you skip over this album because it's overrated and pretty crappy overall. People calling this a \\"masterpiece\\" are incredibly delusional! Download \\"Walk Away\\" and be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's outdone herself","review":"Being a lover of all types/genres of music, i have to say that this is the best CD i have heard in a LONG LONG time. Who ever would have thought that this 'genie' was capable of this?? Christina incorporates at least 5 genres into her newest (and best) effort.. Latin, Soul, Pop, R&B, Gospel.. what more can you ask for? Her voice gives me chills, and the stories she tells through her music have a tendency to wrench my heartstrings.She speaks truth through her music, something more so-called *singers* need to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally vulnerable.","review":"Most people have preconceived notions of this album due to the decision to release \\"Dirrty\\" as the first single. Surely, most of those notions are negative. Stripped is not an album that should be defined by a sexed-up video. It is much more than that. Christina has matured and had her say in what went onto the album this time. She expresses herself very eloquently on most of the album and she is emotionally vulnerable. One should respect the honesty of this album, with the exception of two or three songs that clearly do not belong on the same disc as the others. \\"I'm OK\\" is a stand out track and, in my opinion, the best song on the cd. Overall, a great collection of songs. Now, if only Christina would dress accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"christina let's lose!","review":"this album is great!it is one of the best i have heard in a long time. this is christina's fouth album and as she says, she feels that this album is truly her. her songs represent her at her best, from being down right \\"dirrty\\" to being \\"beautiful (in every way).\\" christina also share's with us the pain of her past and the abuse she felt at her father hand. she has worked with some great people on this album and she should be really proud of it. everyone who feels low some time and underapreciated should listen to this album. there is also a hidden message within the lyrics of the songs. it tells us that we can get through anything and that we will be ok in the end. i rated this ablum: 5 stars, but really it deserves much more ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cristina's cd sure is beautiful","review":"I love everysingle song on that cd my number one song is beautiful. I listen to this cd about two times a day or more.This is sooooooo good. Buy it its worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try again, Christina.....","review":"Christina Aguilera has a great voice, she just needs to get better material. I was relieved, however, to discover that the rest of the CD is not at all similar to 'Dirrty.' Basically, Christina has decided to ditch bubblegum pop and go for a more R&B/rock sound. Still, considering the amount of time it took to make this CD, I was let down. There are a few good tracks, like 'Beautiful'and 'Can't Hold Us Down. If your looking for an innovative album, you're looking in the wrong place. \\"Stripped\\" is nothing more than your average pop-princess-decides-she-wants-to-stand-out-so-she-runs-to-'cool'-producers album. Unfortunately, Linda Perry couldn't do for Christina what she did for P!NK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay in da bottle!","review":"Christina... were do I start. First of all I remember loving the genie in a bottle, I mean the sexy genie in da bottle back in 1999. The blonde hair, the great smile and her angelic style in white, but all the sudden BLACK HAIR, MEDIUM SKIN COLOR, BLACK DRESSES and BLACK NAILS. I hate the dirty songs of this album the only song that i really like is the voice within and it is for girls, and what the heck about her million boy fans that she has, Christina has forgoten about us and saying stupid things about guys like in cant hold us down. Leave all the rock and evil style to Amy Lee she looks better in it. Its the only one that it fits to her but, Christina needs to go back to her style or else she will turn into everybodys clown and I will buy the tickets to the circus to see what style Christina has today !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where to Start?","review":"Wow I was so surprised by this album. I am also not a Christina Aguilera fan, but I cannot complain about anything on this album! In fact I was even more surprised by her new public image, it was a bit risqué and trashy. Her appearance alone made me judge her as a person and musician, I wasn't intersted in buying her new CD at all. A month after the new album release I started hearing the good buzz about some of the songs and even heard a few on TV. Gee am I a hypocrite! Goes to show you can't judge a book by it's cover, the important thing is what is on the inside. This is a grown woman singing from her heart and from her experiences! Track 18- I'm OK, so moving I want to cry every time I listen to it. This is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There You Go Girl...","review":"Christina Aguilera has a huge voice, and \\"Stripped\\" is this 21-year-old singer's fervid attempt to grow up fast. She ricochets from breathy ballads to pithy rhythm-and-blues to quasi-gospel to rock, collaborating on most of the songwriting.She also keeps flipping her image from vamp to victim to tough girl. \\"All these years you violated me,\\" she sings. \\"It's overkill, now I'm ready to fight.\\" Determined to shed her teeny pop past, she flaunts her sexuality and aggression in self-explanatory songs like \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" \\"Dirty,\\" \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" and \\"Fighter.\\" Perhaps it's no wonder she sounds overwrought in nearly every song, although she briefly quiets down for \\"I'm O.K.,\\" a song about watching her father beating her mother.\\"Stripped\\" is a blast of excess that risks alienating Christina's old fans without luring new ones, and it's bursting with misguided energy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiz! Bang! Your computer can produce CDs!","review":"It's clear Christina Aguilera is trying to do something a bit more daring than the previous teenybopper stuff, at least as much as her company will let her. Much has been made of the provocative nature of her videos and lyrics in songs such as \\"Drrty,\\" but this album is not especially dirty to listen to. The real problem is that amidst the many digital edits and attempts to link things together is a paucity of melody, or when one does show up it sounds schmaltzy and dull, like another ballad from 1985. The digital sound is eventually annoying (the bass guitar sounds like it came out of a machine, as of course the drums actually did) and the many gimmicky cuts and splices that are supposed to dazzle us grow tiresome. Christina has a pretty good voice, if not an original or defining style, but her voice does not justify spending the money to buy this long mess of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"No subject","review":"\\"Stripped\\" is a good cd, worth the money. The follow-up to herself titled debut is raw, suggestive, honest, and unapologetic.This album really shows Christina's range as a singer.I really love this album. \\"Fighter\\" is edgy and raw when Ifirst heard this song I stopped in my tracks I couldn'tbelieve this girl who was singing sweet little balladson her debut album was belting this song out with suchpassion and rage. Let me tell you this is the best workoutsong! My second favorite is \\"Infatuation\\" very deeply feltlyrics and emotions. Nice latin beat.I love \\"The voice withen\\" very beautiful, very deeplyfelt as well, it's message to trust your instinctsand listen to your heart, and that it's ok to beafraid. The album overall is nice. It took me awhileto buy it but I was still surprised to discover thesesongs. Hope I said something meaningful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped!!! --- A Must Have","review":"This album is exactly what everyone has been hungry for. A deep sparkling colorful album. Whether your in the mood for some feminazi power chords to some jazzy soul to depressant pink floyd trips to feelin like doing some dirrty dancing. this album covers it all. \\"Impossible\\", alone is worth buying the record but the whole album is fun and and unmissable."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!! I was surprised","review":"All I can say is WOW!!! I never expected. At first I was a little weary about buying it, but now I'm so glad that I did. I bought it 2 days ago and it's barely left my cd player since. I would recommand this cd to anyone. The songs are so great and the lyrics are so raw and you see the real person, not someone who is pretending to be someone else. If you are looking for a gift for someone this Christmas, your looking stops here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album I've Heard In A Long Time","review":"I've been waiting for this album for two years now, and the result is AMAZING...Christina really has amazed me with this album....all of the songs are sung with such GREAT emotion and to know she wrote every song on this album except two (Beautiful, and Impossible) is a growth within it's self...One of the most shocking and most emotional song on the album I would have to say is \\"I'm OK\\"..in this song she sings about her childhood and growing up in a house of dolmestic violence...I can't imaging how hard it was for her to sing \\"Hurt me to see the pain, across my mother's face, everytime my farther's fist put her in her place\\"...I can actually literally hear her crying on this song...and it's just soo amazing how she can let all those emotions out like that...Anyway IF YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT NOW AND DON'T HAVE THE ALBUM GO GET IT NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Christina fan but this cd is a surprise","review":"She did really well on this album. Most of the songs are incredible. Although, Dirrty is an absolute silly perverted song, I just skp over it. This cd is great and you should buy it. She really is talented and shows it in this album. The better songs are:Walk AwayImpossibleBeautifulMake OverSoarThe Voice WithinI'm OkayThere you go, the 7 reasons you should go out and purchase this album today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped of everything but that soulful voice","review":"This new album by Christina takes you on a ride through her life as it's been lately and what a hell of a ride it is. Using every genre that has held her interests in her young short life, Christina not only sets herself apart with her diverse vocal range, but she also sets her album apart from the rest with the many different sounds coming through your speaker. Everything from rock, pop, R&B;, hip hop,and yes even the blues. All used to tell her story, which is the common theme.Christina will take you up with \\"Soar\\" and bring you back down with \\"A Voice Within,\\"she will make you laugh and be silly with \\"Makeover,\\" and she will make you want to cry with \\"I'm OK.\\" With the song \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" she makes you want to get down and dirty and with \\"Dirrty\\" well let's just say that a much needed shower is next.There is something to be enjoyed by all on this album. I highly recommend it to true music lovers, it's a must for any record collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Roller Coaster","review":"When I initially bought this cd, I never expected what I heard. I felt like I took the journey with Christina through all of her pain and love. It was the most phenominal experience that I've ever had. I've read many reviews of Stripped and I'm not so sure which Cd the bad reviewers heard. It doesn't fit into any one genre. Stripped is like a mix-tape, but a good one. It has r&b, pop, hip-hop, jazz, and rock. It is one of the best that I own and i highly suggest it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive CD","review":"I never understood why people put britney and christina in the same category just because of the same age and blonde hair and revealing clothing. Christina can sing and she is a true artist who write lyrics coming from her soul. Dirrty is a crazy party jam though it isn't representative of the sound on the album, and that was what drew me to buy this CD. Most of the songs on here are up, close and personal and sang very well. This album deserved a grammy unlike justified"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry you can't define her....","review":"Xtina is truly in a class of her own. I was an average Xtina fan until I heard this CD & then I became & huge fan. Xtina puts Britney, Beyonce, Ashanti & those other so called singers to shame. If she can back away form the \\"I'm A Whore\\" image, Xtina will definitely become a icon if she isn't one already one.The album starts off with an interlude that could've been made into one song (add on Stripped pt. 2). Every song on this album is great except for Underappreciated & Make Over which in my opinion could've been left on the cutting room floor.The standout tracks in my opinion are \\"Impossible\\" which X-tina teams up with the very talented Alicia Keys for a soulful banger. \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" lets us see the romantic & softer side of Xtina that is beautifully done. \\"The Voice Within\\" shows Xtina at her best vocally. If you want to hear some true talent, then definitely pick this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cd.","review":"This is a really really awesome cd, I left my copy at my psychotic ex's house and don't think I'll ever see it again, but I'm definitely getting another one.

A great voice and catchy tunes. Take a look at the lyricks!!!I have always favoured Christina over Britney, not only in voice but also on the dare to be different looks.Here in Holland Britney has always been precieved as dull and boring...until she made Slave for U..but that didn't got on for the simple fact that she put on a show.Some comments were that Christina looked like a hootchie mamma but let me tell you: Her voice is great just as her talent.Sure , you might think she is a hootchie mamma but she does it with style...you go girl!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CD \\"Stripped\\" by Christina Aguleria","review":"This CD is so awesome, I could relate to the lyrics for every single song.

I LOVE IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alittleover30","review":"This CD is definitely worth buying. I didn't like her first cd at all (Too Teenybopish) but after hearing her sing a couple of songs live on MTV, I thought \\"oh what the heck\\"! So I bought it...the best decision I ever made! I love this CD...to this day I still listen to it and I am moved by her amazing voice! My favorites are \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Infatuation\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"The Voice Within\\" (amazaing), \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\", heck...I like the whole CD and to me that says alot. Never have I had a CD with all the songs on them great songs! GET THIS CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the genie smashes the bottle","review":"I knew out of all of the \\"teeny bopper\\" artists of the late '90s, Christina Aguilera had it in her to come back better than ever. First off, this girl's vocals are incredible. She can sing & scream like no other. When Christina's in the room her voice is heard. The long awaited sophomore was worth it. STRIPPED is awesome start to finish. It's personal, powerful, soulful, and it takes you into Christina's personal world. She makes a lot of statements all over this CD from break-ups (fighter) to soul searching (soar) to boys (infatuation). It's very personal. Christina wrote and produced most of the tracks here. She took a big step and it pays off well. STRIPPED shows tremendous growth from her debut. Christina smashes the bottle and comes out as a confident, opinionated young woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stripped(Better Skipped)","review":"I bought this album on thinking there would be Great singing as on her self titled Album.Instead I found poorly written music a lot of shouting and only one really good song with a singer and that's \\"Its Impossible\\".\\"Beautiful\\"Is a good message but the music isn't up to it.This isn't a good \\"Listening To\\"Album this is performing on stage music.I love Christina's Great Voice.This is not up to the Quality of music she should be singing.I understand she strained her Vocal Chords well this album is certainly why she did\\"Its a whole lot of shouting going on\\".I sent my \\"Stripped\\" Album to file 13 as Trash.But I'll continue to listen to Christina Self titled Album and hope her next work will do more to showcase her Great Voice if she has one left after all this shouting on Stripped."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dirrty genie...","review":"Before, I've always admired Christina for being sexy but not overly slutty. Those days are over now. She has matured and tried so many things to get recognized and be as successful as the other dirty dancer Britney, but to no avail. Sad to say, a lot of people are being disgusted with her image. The only saving grace in this album is \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"The Voice Within\\". And don't mind the rest! One star goes for the outstanding and powerful voice and that's about it! To me, she is not sexy at all!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"this cd is very boring. Stripped does show how good of a singer she is but all her songs are stupid and pointless. Dirrty is a good dance song but trash the video. that was a publicity stunt to show that christina has to fight for her trophy over britney. I will give her credit for some songs. Fighter is a great song, and Unfactuation. But if you want something more that christina singing about her problems. get another one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad!","review":"Sorry but this is too much this album is realy not that good at all the songs sounds so adentical to eachother I think the Christina fans are overating this album because its realy not as good as they described!Trust me you don't want to be stuck with this album it's a waist of money I feel so bad I bought it:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Christina, is so over","review":"This cd was okay, but no two star review though. Except for some okay songs, this CD will be in the Bargin Bin at Tower before we know(and it won't be there so they can order more, it will be there just to off load the remander of the CD's that they can't sell) Even though Christina is a grammy winner, does mean that she is any good any more. To put it the word's of Hilary Duff's song(NOT, I repeat NOT her own opinion about Christina,but in a song of hers) Christina is 'so yesterday'. Save your money and buy one of her other CD's or buy the CD's from the 'not real artists' that does not appeal to her own vanity. So, save your money.

The album's forthcoming success represents the irrationality of humankind; my grounds for this statement is, although music is subjective to taste, the songs played here are neither witty lyrically, and their over-produced musical background only delves into the cliches of big-studio production. Unfortunatly this album will lead to large sales, and sadly, more insecurity in all of womankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell It At The Flea Market!!!","review":"this cd was terrible! trust me, don't even listen to it on the radio. except maybe 'dirty' or'can't hold us down' or'im okay' i can't even rember any other song except those. even with thse, i had to rack my brain. there no remberal tracks on this cd. the only reason why i bought it was because i heard that it was good. well, that person(who is a friend of mine) needs to listen to actual music like, sarah mcglochlen or cheryl crowe or pat benatar,anybody besides christina. spend your money else where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album!","review":"Christina's new album is great!

But out of sheer curiosity, i went to her website and listened to the CD. It blew me away. I immediatly went out and bought the CD, and it is one of my favorites. The songs are, as the title song, \\"stripped\\" says, no hype, no gloss, just christina, stripped.

Overshouting till the point of annoyance. So much it ruins the songs. Shell lose her voice from shouting so much like that. Listen to when she sings normal and hear how much she stinks. When shes not shouting, she sounds like an average girl. She is imitating Whitney and Mariah and their voices were naturally deep and loud. Alicia Keys, C hristina Aguilera and Kelly Clarkson need to start singing and stop shouting. Then you'll see how horrible their voices are. If you want good fun pop music without overshouting check out Madonna or Britney (her debut, not her recent crap).

In her song \\"Beautiful,\\" she sings about how she is beautiful just being herself, which apparently is a pound of makeup along with numerous facial piercings. I give \\"Stripped\\" 2 stars out of 5 because Aguilera does have singing capability; however, she exerts far to much effort, in her songs, in trying to replace her past innocent image with a new sex-driven powerful persona."},{"rating":"1","title":"This girl STINKZ!!!!","review":"ok listen 2 me pple! christina augilera is worse than britney!!!

I love this c.d. and i can't wait to see what she is doing next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dee","review":"This is a great CD. Christina definately has powerful vocal talent. The songs are very well written and performed very well. Christina dug deep down inside herself to write these songs AND sing them. I would definately recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"Three years after her first album Christina Aguilera has finally released her sophmore album. It is most definitly worth the wait. Christina has grown as an artist and has begun to show what she's really about through her music. She sings about everything from her ex to an abusive father. Her voice is as amazing as ever. Unlike her prior albums she does not feel the need to hit every note in the book because the music is just so much better. She has definitly grown with her fans and probably will gain many more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I know that many are quick to dismiss Christina, especially with her recent fondness for nudity, and while the album's title could be mistook for a sexual reference, one listen makes it clear that the title represents the album's stripped-down emotion. This is Christina. Finally.Musically, Stripped ranges from blusey (\\"Impossible\\"), to rock (\\"Fighter\\"), to radio-friendly hip-pop (\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\") and more, and topics include society's sexual double standards, loving yourself despite outside negativity, domestic violence, relationships gone bad, and, erm, casual sex? Not every song is a gem, but they're darn-near close.And besides, with that voice, how much would bad material matter anyways?"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Back!","review":"I am sure all of Christina's fans will agree that this new album is very different than the first album. Christina's new album includes a little bit of rock, latin, soul and hip hop. My favorite track on this album is \\"Impossible,\\" written and composed by Alicia Keys. Christina shows her soulful side and she sounds GREAT! If I had my choice, I would enjoy hearing Christina sing more soul. However, as a true fan, I stand behind her and support her many different talents in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS ALBUM","review":"I'm reading some of the negative reviews and I can't understand how anyone can not love this album. No she's not like the genie in a bottle girl anymore...SHE GREW UP. That's what you do. Britney should grow the hell up and talk about real adult issues. I was blown away by this album and impressed by her honesty. If people can look passed the wardrobe choices and realize that she has an amazing story to tell and no one tells it like her. I felt that Keep on Singing my Song should have been her last single instead of The Voice Within. KOSMS really summed up how she feels about what people say about her. It's the \\"middle finger\\" to the naysayers. This album is one of the best I have ever heard and I can't wait to hear what else she has to say. She forever has a fan in me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album","review":"This album is a great album. There is no \\"pop tart\\" type stuff that Britany Spears seems to have stuck with. There is an amazing authenticity to all of the songs, many of which were co-written by Aguilera. There are many types of songs from R&B to hard rock to jazz to soft \\"diva\\" ballads. Don't let the hype around her new sexy attitude fool you, this is a high quality album and is a must have for any fan of popular music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped, a defiance of Christina Aguilera","review":"This cd shows Christina is nothing like those other singers. She is in a genre all of her own. \\"Stripped,\\" breaks all boundries and goes beyond any other artists attempts in writing their own lyrics for their own cd. She is hitting her true issues which other people do happen to relate to.

This is a very mature album and glad that Christina took charge of her direction in music. It definitely paid off and anyone who listens to it won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL Voice","review":"Forget Mariah Carey,X-tina has the REAL voice and the right material to sell records.She doesn't scream like Mariah does,Chris truly sings from her heart.This album is Christina's latest and Christina's best to date.Her voice ain't irritating like some other artists.All the songs are great but my favorites are Can't Hold Us Down feat.Lil' Kim,Walk Away(this song shows you the powerful voice that's Christina),Fighter,Infactuation,Impossible,Beautiful,Make Over,Dirrty and the Voice Within.Christina Aguilera is the best POP singer out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Dirrty","review":"Well In Late October, I Went Out & Got The Christina Aguilera CD. With Dirrty Being The Only Single Out At The Time. I Went Home And Listened What I Hear Was Not Only Different Than The Debut Cd From Christina but It Was Excelent !

Now The Next Single From Christina Will Be Can't Hold Us Down This Along With The Stripped Intros & The Sexy Song Get Mine Get Your's Christina's Stripped Really Stands Out.

This CD reflects her VOICE, verstality, GENIUS and her TRUE EMOTIONS. Every song seems to be coming out of her heart...Beautiful, Impossible, Infatuation, Make Over, Loving Me 4 Me, and Get Mine Get Yours are amazing, and the rest have great variety and quality. Go Christina, sing it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clothes off, hands down, best album of 2002","review":"This cd is amazing. Christina Aguilera did an amazing job as writer and producer. There's such amazing attention to detail. The lyrical and musical content is excellent. She covers everything and does it right. There's hip hop tracks like \\"Can't hold us down\\" about double standards and women being strong to party tracks like \\"Dirrty.\\" You also have the smooth R&b sound of \\"Get mine get yours\\" and power gospel anthems like \\"Soar\\" and \\"Keep on singin' my song\\". There's also a beautiful piano ballad, aptly titled \\"Beautiful\\" about love and acceptance. There are rock tracks like \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Make Over\\". Everyone song on the album is beautifully sang and is worth the price of the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"stripped a bit too bare","review":"20 tracks of angst and poor pitiful me. Which is unfortunate -- yeah yeah, you're so put upon. The production is excellent, the musicianship outstanding and Christina is in great voice. Might be best for her to give up writing her own stuff until there is actually some life to write about."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm...","review":"Let me just start off by saying that I am not anti-Christina, because I am a small fan of her which is why I purchased the CD. I was disappointed when I listened to the CD. There were a few good tracks, such as \\"Infatuation\\" and \\"Fighter\\"(which is why I did not give the CD 1 star), but I was not impressed by the majority of the CD. Christina has definitely created a new sound in her music which did not catch my attention. Only buy this CD if you are a truly devoted Christina fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Filth!","review":"If you're a fan of screaming and female empowerement, this album is for you.

Lets just review the tracks.1. Intro- Whatever. Unremarkable.2. Can't Hold Us Down- This has a weak beat! The lyrics are too self involved.3. Walk Away- Too long and too dull.4. Fighter- Dave Navarro please step away from pop.5/6. Infatuation- Damn good song.7/8. Loving Me 4 Me- Best track on here. It is totally awesome.9. Impossible- Bland. She's no Jill Scott.10.

Can't hold us down, fighter, beautiful, cruz, soar, dirrty, a voice within, singing my song are good songs. The rest are so absolutely dreadful, you'll want to throw up and never listen to her again. Get the song fighter and her first and christmas cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I miss the old Christina. This is so not like her. If you want a real pop album, buy the album Christina Aguilera. I would have given this - 5 stars if I could. I only like one song and it's called The Voice Withi. But even thats CRAPPY. Never buy this cd. It's trash. Why do you think there is a half naked woman on the cover. Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This is an awful CD. I don't understand what people like about it. Christina has the potential to be a good artist but she makes herself into a cartoon instead. I can't stand the way she sings, she sings a few notes and then starts screaming. And I'm so tired of hearing about how abusive her childhood was, if it was so painful then she should be in therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great.","review":"I admit, Christina has a great voice. She can make any dull song very good with just her voice. However, when all the songs on a CD are dull, it just gets too boring. Not ONE song on this album has stood out as anything remarkable. Most of them are slower tempo songs that aren't too appealing. Her older younger-aged fan base will mostly find this CD boring. However, that means she will gain attention of newer and older-aged fans. What I don't understand is.. why did it take her 3-4 years to make THIS? I don't find anything remarkable about it at all...Let's hope album #3 from Christina turns out to be an improvment. She has a great voice, I'd like to see it happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Christina..........what have you done to yourself?","review":"Christina used to be so beautiful, she used to be so talented, her music was so fun, so catchy, so sweet. But now she's turned into a [...]. This is absolutely tragic......"},{"rating":"2","title":"christina aguilera","review":"this cd is amazing because christina aguilera is amazing and shes the best ever!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not your typical bubble gum album","review":"Like the title says, Ms. Aguilera has stripped herself of all her superfluous garb to produce a very intimate and revealing album. Unlike her flashy \\"Dirrty\\" track, many of the songs in this album are very powerful and cover a wide range of topics from self-esteem (\\"Beautiful\\") to family abuse (\\"I'm OK\\"). Her lyrics are liberating and self-asserting - something our youth could really use now-a-days. On top of that, the music to the lyrics ranges from slow melodies, to latin flavor, to heavy pop and jazz. By far, her best album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Voice but...","review":"I personally think that Christina's voice is good (except when she just shouts), but in this album, most of all the songs are ballads, A cousin lend it to me, and i didn't finished it, it start's good, but it became kind of boring, Some songs has nice lyrics, but the beat is poor, I have just one advice, if you enjoyed the first cd of her, this would seem to you disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"What can I say? This cd spoke to me in so many ways. So touching and so deep! I don't agree with some of the things Christina does-but hey, it's her life! In that way, she is such an inspiration to me. Unlike her rival, she is real!!!- and her music is a beautiful example of this. Her amazing voice just echoes in my head after listening to this cd. It helped me through a very bad time- and in dealing with extreme depression. Her cd was a very comforting friend at this time. Definitely buy this- Oh, and lest I forget, this cd rocks!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina really grows on Stripped","review":"Christina is not the sweet, innocent, and charming girl that we were introduced to with her first CD offering. Instead, she is a woman with a painful past. Stripped takes us through some of the pain and joy of her life. Ultimatley, Stripped shows us the growth of Christina from her days as a \\"Genie in a bottle\\" to today's \\"Dirrty\\" girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT COMBACK FOR XTINA!","review":"i think that christina as definately showed that she has made the all-time comeback. She has a little rock (\\"Fighter\\") and a lot of personal songs (my favorite, \\"I'm OK\\"). THIS CD IS AWESOME! i absolutely looooove it!!!!! :-)i stronly suggest to buy it. i just cant believe all of this great music was under \\"genie in a bottle\\". what a better change."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice!!","review":"Hands down one of the fu_ best albums ever made. Five stars... Just not enough! Bought her latest and she just keeps getting better.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Make Over for Christina...","review":"Never would have thought of buying this album from just hearing the song Dirrty on the radio & seeing the video but I listened to it at a local music store and it rocked so I wound up buying it. Really digging Make Over - what a great song - love the edge - sounds kinda like Sinead at the end - very cool. Christina should do more like songs like that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I was slightly disappointed when I first heard the cd because I had been waiting forever for it and the writing was not up to par. Some of the lyrics are just okay and some words seem to simple and just put together because they rhyme. The more i listen though, the more I really love the cd. There is definatly a variety of songs and music. My favs are Walk Away (Bluesy-her voice is amazing in this song!), Underappreciated (kind of a funky motown song), Get Mine, Get Yours (beat and music fit well with lyrics), Keep On Singin My Song (Great uplifting song). I do not like Make Over...sounds too much like Pink with Linda Perry but i like Christina's attempt to change her singing style with it. Overall, this is a cd worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I think this album is brilliant. It's got everything... callaborations, catchy melodies, meaningful lyrics (unlike Britney Spears who just sings about guys and doing it). In my opinion this album let's us see what Christina is all about.It also shows us how much Christina has grown up in the past few years. My fav songs are Soar, Fighter, Dirrty and Can't Hold Us Down. If you like Christina and you dont have this album, I strongly urge you to go out and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever","review":"I think that she is one of the best singers I have ever heard and that sometimes people judge her by her clothes when the music matters the most. Her album was beautiful and as a man I looked past her good looks and listened to her CD and it was excellent. \\"Beautiful\\" should be an inspiration to a lot of people and that song alone makes her album a must have. By the way if anyone says that her ablum is trash or Britney Spears is better, they should get their ears checked."},{"rating":"1","title":"All you hear is yelling and screaming","review":"The title of this comment tells everything...all she is doing is yelling"},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah baby poiseBABY poise yeah, poise yeah baby..","review":"sugar coated bimbo greedy needy sleazy cash dispenser sleek and chic ready for the trash heep of newer newer younger is better tokyo fetish cotton candy feline,purrscome percoscious or precious hither vodoo doll little girl play dress up pin up all primmed up by her pimp marketers, over and over again and again..

Never has an album been filled with so much crap to make up the song numbers. A waste of $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmmm!","review":"First of all I am no Christina fan. I find her annoying. I find her voice annoying and this album is pretty much annoying. the reason why I don't like this album is because it's not just so long. but it contain to much of different music,style,vocal ranges,arrangements and beats that it becomes a big whole mess. The lyrics which often feel like they're written by someone else ( I'm sorry that I am not a virgin. sounds Like Britney not Christina). and the lyrics for the song I'm Beautiful. Please Who in earth do you think you are. This album will proabbly do well because there are so many TRL fans that love Christina but I Do not think she's going to the right direction. There are some songs on it that I think are allright but I think Christina should grow as a person before growing as an artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUX BUT BETTER THEN BRITNEY","review":"I HEARD THIS ALBUM FROM A FRIEND OF MINE AND I'LL SAY IT IS BETTER THEN HER FIRST ALBUM.

I don't like her music, it's not really my taste. And I don't like the way she shows off her skinny little body. It sends bad messages to little girls. But I do love her voice. I don't care who you are and what genre of music you are into, Christina Aguilera has an amazingly beautiful voice. She is talented. I have to give her credit for her vocial abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG this cd is sooooooooo amazing","review":"this is literally the best cd on the entire planet!!! i love it soooooooo much! every song kicks ...! i really love get mine, get yours. the whole cd has the attitude: take charge, women rock, we dont need men to be in charge. i love that whole attitude. nothing i could say here would do it justice. i mean, her vocals are so amazing. its as if shes Gods personal angel singing from heaven. and no matter how many times u listen to it, u never get bored cuz the songs have such powerful messages and they're GOOD. i love this cd and i totally recommend it to everyone. I LOVE CHRISTINA AGUILERA!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True feelings and true tears","review":"This album has been great inspiration for me. This girl knows how to put emotion into her song.Personally, my favourites are Beautiful, telling you that no matter what is different about you, you are still beautiful. The voice within, which tells you that when you have no-one to turn to, you just look inside to your soul and find the strength within. And lastly, a song that means a lot and actually made me cry was I'm Okay, where she talks about her father physically abusing both her and her mother. This album is a must and you are crazy if it doesn't get to you. an all time tear jerker. P.S the fact that I'm gay dpesn't have anything to do with it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This was an awesome CD--I couldn't stop listening to it for over a month. Fighter was one of my faves--her recent new single. I was very impressed as Christina co-wrote almost all the songs on the album. The album has a nice mix of pop, rock, and blues--very different from her first album. For any Alicia Keys fans, there is one written/arranged/produced by her called Impossible. Also, I was blown away (almost to tears) by her song, I'm Okay. The song is so honest and brave. And, she apparently she sang it in one take! Kudos to an amazing singer and an awesome album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous voice","review":"I am not into pop or teen girl music, and I have to say that this Cd pleasantly surprised me. She is one talented lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"..::**Stripped--Christina Aguilera!**::..","review":"Christina Aguilera's long anticipated new CD both shocked and pleasantley surprised me. Although her new, more controversial image has driven some of her fans away, I actually like her better. The music on her CD is absolutely phenomenal. From wild, party-type tracks such as Dirrty and Get Mine, Get Yours to chilling ballads like Walk Away and I'm Ok...all the songs on this CD are great! Christina has matured vocally and in her musical expression as well. This CD is so much better than her first release. It's deeper, more personal and obviously reveals the real Christina. I look forward to more music from her in the future.Favorite Songs:Can't Hold Us DownWalk AwayBeautifulDirrtyThe Voice WithinI'm Ok"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped","review":"I think this CD is excellent. Each song is very personal, genuine and soulfull. Easily Christina's best album to date and i look forward to future albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album! Bad First Single","review":"This is a great new album. Her first single choice was a very bad one...it does not represent what's on the album. It has great songs and I think she has proven she can write her own stuff. Her rumored next single, \\"Beautiful\\" (written by Linda Perry), is a great song with a positive message. I recommend this CD to all Christina fans - even if you hate her first single Dirrty, like I do. It's a new Christina...and although I hate her new look/image, she IS talented and she did a great job on this album. I love it. She's unique (she's not copying Britney Spears; they're both great artists though) and this album shows her maturity. My favorite songs: Stripped interludes, Beautiful, I'm Ok...The rest are great as well. Go pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely breathtaking at times","review":"Wow. I'm speechless after having given STRIPPED my inaugural listen. Well I must say that Christina has very much come into her own, musically speaking. I'm still reeling from \\"Keep on Singing my Song,\\" the final track. In the key of E, this semi-breezy, and very soulful song is just a testament of what Ms. Aguilera can do when given the leeway by RCA bigwigs. It is amazing. The real stand out tracks are:Loving me 4 me: almost a mix between Mariah and Jill scott.Impossible: Alicia Keys knows how to get Christina to take us all to church.Beautiful: Absolutely amazing. Reminiscent of something you might hear on a soundtrack for \\"The Wonder Years.\\" There is a very open, liberating feel to the song.Cruz: BeautifulSoar: One of my favorites, has a gospel choir that lifts the song up into the stratosphere.This CD is a must have for the fan of good female vocals. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped is the Best","review":"This is as it seems an autobiographical album of the grammy-award winning singer. I've listened to several songs on here which she wrote and co-wrote and really I give her points for honesty. The best thing about her on this album is her voice really is perfect. Her album shows her vulnerability all her feelings. This really made me respect her more as an artist because really she is. Why she's compared to britney spears ill never know (Britney can't sing! she's too fake). This album is not like her previous one where it seemed all pop-like. NOPE! This album is a mixture of genres: a lil hip-hop, a lil pop and a lil rock (Fighter is the best song on here with the rock sound to it!). Really its an album that shows her maturity perhaps her explicit sexuality which many people seem to be bothered by it. She's made a mark with the release of this album. Give this cd a chance you'll find out she's so SUPER talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rebutal to all who Think Christina's CD is bad","review":"I am a movie buff so my experties is in that field. However I am a huge fan of music and belive that all music deserves a listen before being judged. Now to continue on with the review.If you are expecting a pop CD get that thought out of your head, this is definatly not a pop CD. This is however one of my favorite CDs of all times (Right after eve6 \\"Horrorscope\\", and KISS \\"the greatest hits\\"). This CD really show's off Christina's talent as a writter and a singer. She has one of the most amazing voices I have heard in years. really this CD is by far a great sound that any person who is willing to put aside their biases for an hour and just listen to it will most likely appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"Christina really shows her vocal and music boundrys on this cd, and as far as i'm concered, she passed. Xtina's first single was 'Dirrty', and if you liked that, then you'll love the whole album. I do hope that she brings out 'Impossible', as it's a song in which alot of people could relate to. The Voice within is a great song, and is beautifully written by Christina. This is in fact one of my favorite cds of her, and i have changed my feelings towards Xtinas music. Around june last year i was a little embarrased to buy her first debut album, but now i just buy everything by her! You go girl"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"I really think Christina is one of the most talented singers ever. Her powerful voice has conquered the hearts of millions of fans. That's why I picked up this CD without hesitation. Well, i have to admit that i am quite disappointed with this CD. I feel this album is more of a venting place for her than a musical work for the fans. Most of the songs deal with her personal issues and the music [is terrible]. what a waste of resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album By CA!!!","review":"Loved this album!! Songs were all really well written, and you can tell she will be a fantastic artist in years to come!!!

Nobody wants to listen to that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rather boring","review":"unfortunately i find this album rather boring. what is interesting in someone belting out \\"dirty ,naughty\\" etc. her voice is more screaming/belting than singing and the songs are rather weak. One song even sounds like a weak copy of the Sugababes first hit \\"Ovaload\\" (UK No.1). Christina really didn't \\"grow up\\" with this album...maybe the next one will do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this cd that much.. I think I lose my money!","review":"Well, well.This is what I think. If you wanna have a good cd, I think this is not the most correct cd to buy.I bought this cd because I heard in a interview about her cd and I thouhgt this may be good, but I was a little wrong.The think was that... how she can said that if the people don't like her clothes and what she is wearing, they don't need to look at her? that's so wrong, I mean what about childrens who watch her, is not fear that they must see her appearing like that.If she wasn't such b%@#%$, well the people would put more attention about her real voice, because she has the voice, but not the personality..And how about the pearcings and the picture or Rolling Stone Magazine.What we show is what the people learn from us."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Stripped'of talent","review":"This CD is bad. Well, not'bad', but a dissapointment I'll say. The only danceable tracks are obveiously \\"Dirrty\\" \\"Fighter\\" \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" \\"Make Over\\" \\"I'm Leavi'n\\" The only problem with this CD is that it is too over produced. In some songs, you can barely hear her voice, so it appears that Christina can't sing, which draws me to a one star rating. Christina can sing,but her attitude twards fellow pop singers is monstrous. That too draws me to my one star rating. Anybody who is that child-like to hate everybody who is the slightest competition should be in grade school still. Her lack of maturity and honor for life is appaling. All of these personality trates show up in her songs,even though the CD was made before the comments were."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Average Cuts and Way Too Long","review":"The good news is the Christina has a good voice, much better than her mumbling counterpart, Britney Spears. I don't own any other Christina album, so I can't compare it with her others The albums does have some good ballads, such as Beautiful but most of the songs are average or less. No need to discuss her radio hits, we all know them. These songs are disposible and will not stand the test of time.She spends way too much time on this album trying too prove she's a woman. She comes across more like a little girl crying for attention.And then we have the length of the album. It's too long. This explains why it's a weak album. Another reviewer said that 12 songs would have been enough. With less songs we can concentrate on the better ones. I felt exhausted after listening to it.This album isn't good enough to keep. Sorry X-Tina fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ROCKS!","review":"This is Christina's best album so far.

To put it simply I was digusted. Christina just followed Britney's example of maturing. People turned their noses up at the name Britney Spears. Yet, they can stand Christina? And the whole thing about role models!!! Well, Britney is MY role model while Christina is just a : She is a *, *, bimbo, unholy, harlot, hooker, hustler, a woman of ill repute, trollop, courtesan, and a hussy, prostitute,and baka!!Her songs are poorly written expect for a few have a good meaning such as Fighter and Beautiful (WOW! That is a surprise!). But her voice lacks and cracks. I know, my mom's friend is a voice teacher and we talked about her once.So, what do we do about this woman of ill repute romping around our children, ladies? We shout louder! NOT!! Women do not shout, we go outside the White House and picket!Christina just get out of town and terrorize my siblings."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO Christina!!!!!!","review":"Has anyone asked you who u rather prefer either Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears? YOU BETTA SAY CHRISTINA and this CD is totally awesome I hate most POP but I love Christina she is beautiful and sexual and not afraid to show it. She has an amazing voice and a great personality. Every Song on this cd is fabulous and will make u push repeat about a thousand times. The other thing that I love about Christina is that she isn't Decisive about whether or not she is a sexual or a goody pop icon which I love she just is sexual and I love that and she isn't Britney which I love too thanks Christina for Changing and I love her new CD its the best from the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!","review":"I never liked her before, but when I bought this album and listened to it for the first time it was awsome!! You have to buy this album. It has 20 songs, and they are all about 3,4,5 or 6 minutes long. The cd is filled to the edge. She keeps it real, co-writes all of her songs (except for 2)and I have listened to this album at least 100 times. No joke. I LOVE IT! DEFINETLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"Christina shows in this CD her great talent! She really matured, not like Britney!! Singles off this album are 'Dirrty' feat. Redman, 'Beautiful', 'Fighter' and 'Can't Hold Us Down' feat. Lil' Kim. I hope there is more to come.My favourite Songs:#1 'Soar' - inspiritual song, wonderful sound#2 'Infatuation' - latin-style song#3 'Dirrty' - a party song#4 'The Voice Within' - nice song#5 'Cruz' - song about leaving home (or someting else)I don't really like 'Make Over', 'Walk Away', 'Get Mine Get Yours' and 'Impossible', but there is no bad song on this CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This C.D is worth even more than 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! :):):):)","review":"This C.D shows Christina in a whole new place. She's a lot more grown up and her songs don't mean \\"\\"genies in bottles\\" anymore. Each song on the C.D is like a short biography of her life...especially \\"I'm Okay\\" She really put her feelings in that song. \\"Stripped Intro\\" was a great way to start the C.D. You can hear how everyone's reacting to the new Chrisina. Here are some of my favorite songs on the C.D. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\"- A song fighting for women's rights!:)lol! \\"Fighter\\"- A rockish song about being dumped and then being stronger. \\"Make-Over\\"- A great song with good tempo. \\"Beautiful\\"- Telling that everyone's beautiful. \\"Cruz\\"- A great soft song to relax to\\".\\"Dirrty\\"-The only song on C.D that is a great party song! m Okay\\"- A very strong song with tons of feeling. \\"Keep on Singin'My Song\\"- Great way to end the C.D!!!!You really wanna grab hold of this C.D...it's so different than her first C.D. KEEP ON SINGIN YOUR SONG CHRISTINA!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising","review":"I was pretty impressed with this cd. I don't normally like the genre, but bottom line is that the girl has a fantastic voice. Best songs on the cd are the ones where she is just belting it out, 'cause we know that she can pull it off. I think this girl's got a solid future if she'd depend more on her voice talents then on her ass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina's Best! The best of 2002!","review":"In Christina's \\"Stripped\\" album she shows us everythin inside her, thats why its titled \\"Stripped\\", its not covered up by bubbly gum pop and hot lyrics to attract many, but stripped down to who she really is and is an excellent album! All songs on her belong becomming singles, even some interludes are capable of introducing a song. If I were her, I would spend a long time creating each as a hit.During the past year, this album payed off by making her know to the world and have 5 #1 smash singles to top the chart:Dirrty- October 2002Beautiful- November 2002Fighter- April 2003Can't Hold Us Down- July 2003The Voice Within- October 2003I think that her next single should be \\"Keep On Singin My Song\\" for Thanksgiving/Christmas 2003 and before New Years, introduce \\"Soar\\".This is an excellent album and deserves to have all songs be made singles within the next few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"POP PRINCESS'S BEST YET","review":"OH MY GOD. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH WORDS THATCOULD DISCRIBE THIS AMAZING CD. I LOVE EVERYSONG ON THIS CD. I LISTEN TO IT EVERYDAY BECAUSE IT IS SO INSPIRATIONAL TO ME. ONCE AGAIN SHE SHOWS US NOT ONLY THEAMAZING TALENT SHE HAS BUT HOW DEVOTED SHE IS WHEN IT COMES TO RECORDING A SONG.SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BECOMPARED TO BRITNEY SPEARS.I HATE TO SAY IT BUT BRIT, YOUJUST AREN'T ON HER LEVELCHRISTINA IS AMAZING! AND ITS NOT HARD TO RECOGNIZE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I have heard all year long...","review":"This has probably been one of the most awaited cd's all year long. I am glad to say that it has been worth the wait. This cd is all around excellent in vocals, production, lyrics, and all of the songs strongly relate. Christina has one of the best voices I have ever heard, and never oversings unlike some other diva's. Stronger moments on this cd include \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Fighter\\", and the beautiful \\"Beautiful\\". Anyone can relate to the song \\"Beautiful\\", and knowing all of the jealousy this young lady has saw she is not going to let anyone bring her down because she is beautiful no matter what they say. A personal favorite of mines \\"Impossible\\" along with Alicia Keys shows a R&B side of Xtina, this is Aretha Franklin material. Well I couldn't possible run out of good things to say about this album... BUY THE CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best cd of 2002","review":"Forget about Genie In A Bottle or What A Girl Wants, Christina's new album Stripped is NOTHING like her older stuff. Gone are the bubble gum pop songs and the sweet little girl next door image, and in it's place is a grown up woman who is finally doing her own thing and being herself. This cd is absolutely brilliant, I don't think there is not one bad song on it. Christina's vocals are amazing, she still hits all the right notes but she is not over the top. My personal favorites on the cd are Fighter, Loving Me For Me, Beautiful, Make Over, and of course Dirrty. You simply cannot go wrong with this cd, like I said this is by far the best cd of 2002!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"One fact that can't be denied by anyone about Christina Aguilera is that she is one of the most talented people in the music industry. Her vocal ability, while it may have been a little too in-your-face on previous albums, shines beautifully here. As a true Christina fan, who has been desperately awaiting this albums arrival; it's amazing to see how much she has grown. She has seemingly gone from an artist unsure of how to maintain popularity and sing what suits her to a powerful image of what true artists can strive to be. This album is composed of soul and emotions that cannot be found on her first \\"Genie\\" release. Thank you Christina, for taking a risk and being willing to sacrifice a bit of yourself even when you knew that you would receive criticism from some. She was born with a gift, and that, no one can take from her. Thanks for allowing us a glimpse of where your journey has taken you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive! \\"Loving Me for Me\\" is worth the money alone","review":"I liked her first album knew that she could \\"blow\\", but on this CD she has great lyrics and puts a lot of feeling into it, the dance songs are hot \\"Dirty\\" and It's definitely worth adding to your collection. There are so many songs that I like, but hands down \\"Loving Me For Me\\" is my favorite. I really hope this is released as a single and a video is done for it, it' a softer side a Christina, she's not oversinging on it and the music compliments her voice very well. This CD is a bit long, but it's overall very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Adult CD","review":"This album is really fantastic, and my tastes run more to Alicia Keys, Lucinda Williams, and Erykah Badu than to Britney Spears. Christina really breaks into the adult audience with this LP. She has a fantastic, soulful voice, and I'm looking forward to more."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's talented!","review":"Christina Aguilera is talented people... admit it. The cd was a pleasant surprise to me. I enjoyed the whole thing, but songs that definitely stood out to me were, \\"Can't hold us down\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Impossible\\", \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Singin' my song\\", \\"Infatuation\\", & \\"Soar\\"...all of these songs address very important issues with girls today. Christina has the guts to stand up & sing about serious issues like self asteem, getting hurt by your first love, going for your goals, dealing with domestic abuse, & so on. She sings beautifully on each track & sends out a positive message to girls everywhere. (the only naughty girl songs on this cd are \\"Dirrty\\", & \\"Get mine, get yours\\"... everybody needs to learn to look past Christina's scantily clad exterior...listen to her voice & her lyrics...then judge her for her talent, not the outfits she wears. Keep up the good work xtina!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"I was expecting this album 2 be perfect, but unfortunately Aguilera slips up some. Don't get me wrong there are some good tracks and she has a good voice, but these songs just aren't that memorable!Plus I think she was going for originality on this record, when really, its not original at all!! \\"Impossible\\" sounds exactly like and a Alicia Keys song(mabe cuz she wrote it and prodiced it??) \\"Dirrty\\" is Christina's \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Beautiful\\" is her \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" only Britney's songs are more first class. This is just Christina trying to act all mature. Sure all the critics will probably rave but this cd is not that good..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirrty yay baby","review":"All i have to say is that i really love this cd.. i ran out and bought it the day it was released and i havent stoped listiong to it since... fighter and walk away are my 2 most fav songs on the cd right now... just give the cd a shot and im sure youll love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Xtina's new album rules!","review":"Christina Aguilera's new album is great! Xtina's music has changed though, this album is one that she doesn't sing teeny-pop music like Britney Spears! I have to admit Christina is better than Britney. :) Anyways, back to the C.D. The first song I heard from this album was Impossible, where she sang it LIVE on MTV. I love the song! Alicia Keys wrote this song for her. And the other song that I like is Soar, and Dirrty. At first I thought I wouldn't like this album but now that I listened to it more, I like it alot! Christina rules! :) I reccomend that you buy this album today.."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT JOB","review":"I really hope that people get a chance to listen to Christina's whole CD. It is nothing at all like \\"Dirrty\\". There's only one other song that is as sexual as that one. The rest of the songs are beautiful, soulful, and you can tell they come from her heart. She sings with such passion on this record, especially on my favorite song \\"Walk Away.\\" The first time I heard it I started to cry b/c it was so emotional, and you could tell Christina was singing it from her heart. Some of the songs on this CD sound like something Alicia Keys would sing. It is that good, and I hope that Christina gets the recognition she deserves for her amazing voice and ability. Hopefully this CD will get nominated for a Grammy. It deserves to."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's time for Christina to get her props!","review":"This CD is incredible! It has been stuck in my stereo since I bought it! I like it more everytime I listen to it. Forget everything you have ever read or heard about Christina and listen to this CD. You will have an entirely different opinion and won't be able to put it down! This girl can sing! My personal favorites are \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Fighter\\". This CD truly shows how versatile Christina is and how truly talented! Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Job Christina--","review":"Christina Aguilera shines on this album, pumping out everything shes got. People who are just judging her by her \\" style \\" need to grow up. The album is phenominal, ive had it for 2 years and im still listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great effort from christina","review":"when I first heard Dirrty I really loved the beat and knew I had to get the CD, and it confirmed even further that christina is NOT in the same category as britney spears at all musically, lyrically and vocally. I bought the album and the result was a musical diverse album that is mostly r&b and hip hop with sophisticated songwriting christina had a big part in, and also hints of rock, jazz and beautiful piano ballads, as well as memorable piano and guitar hooks throughout the record. I'm not usually into r&b music by newer artists but this album was an exception and is definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's OK!","review":"This CD is good. I still like Dirrty, and Fighter. Beautiful got old real quick! This CD is good, but she is given a lot of freedom way too fast, which makes it kind of a mixed bag. I liked a bulk of the album but some songs could have been left off. These songs were Cruz, Walk Away, Soar, The Voice Within and Keep on Singin' My song. these are bland and cheesy but otherwise this is a good one. Get it for Get Mine, Get Yours which is a dirty little ditty but has a beautiful melody. I also like Can't Hold Us Down even if Kim does touch a bit of raunchiness. This CD is worth it, but if you aren't into her, steer clear"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album I've bought all year","review":"I was really amazed with the difference of this album, compared to her previous ones. Its a grown up, more mature vertue and it really complemnts her voice. I had my doubts, but its full of different flavor and its an excelent item that stands for respect of woman! I like #5...ITS GREAT and i would reccomend this ro EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage!","review":"I can't understand why people choose to buy and listen to this garbage. Maybe in her own way, Christina has a good voice, but frankly, I can't stand her voice. She has no vocal control at all and spends more time shouting and over singing to the point that it hurts the ears. The endless and needless embellishments and trillings are enough to make my skin crawl. Her performance on the Grammys was so nauseating that I had to turn the channel. As for the album, it is full of stupid songs with no substance starting with the trashy 'Dirrty' song and the equally annoying 'The Voice Within'. As long as the teeny boppers keep on buying this garbage, Christina won't 'go away' like I wish she would. Her trashy image and the way she has marketed herself are the only reasons she has lasted this long. What will it take to encourage people to buy music by artists who can actually sing. Enough already of the Christinas and the Britneys not to mention the Shanias, Kylies and Avrils out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"This is probably one of if not THE BEST album i've ever heard. track for track this album is phenomenal. it's beatiful, it's vulnerable, it's endearing, it's amazing.let's hope she keeps making music like THIS. if so, she'll be around for a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I cannot believe how amazing this album is. Since the day that I bought it, it has not left my cd player. This is one of the few albums that I don't skip around. All the tracks are worth listening to. Beautiful is really beutiful, Walk Away is so vocally astounding and I'm Okay leaves you in tears. Ms. Aguilera has definitely turned me into a fan of hers. She's got the voice and writing talents to last her for years to come. You go girl!! You are beautiful, no matter what they say."},{"rating":"2","title":"stripped of the past","review":"This cd just grows on you and keeps growing. Christina's voice is wonderful, the words powerful and invigorating. Whereas the first cd had a few good songs on it, this cd has every song that is worth listening to over and over. It's hard to believe this is the same girl who sang Genie in a Bottle. Maybe a bit over-pierced, but you can't alter the beauty of that voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"this is more of what I hate. Bad singers, who are only there for their looks.Honestly, these songs are some of the worst songs I've ever heard, and I've heard some horrinle songs! This cd is really bad and so is Christina, So DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...","review":"Lets get this staight..Christina is trying to hard to be sexy. She's not goodlooking and I dont see why little girls look up to her. I dont understand it. I will admit though She had a beautiful voice but her music isnt all worth listening to. I respect her singing voice to be honset but I am not big on the pop music and the little kids going all crazy over her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped Her Soul","review":"I didn't want to buy this album at first, because Christina's appearance as of late was a little too dirrty for me and over the top. Just think of the outfit she wore to the MTV awards. I thought that Dirrty was an alright song, but not one worth buying the cd for. Then I heard Beautiful. That is such a great song. Very uplifting and a good message...I listen to it every day. The album is very much about Christina and things that have happened to her in life. The songs hit very close to home for me...trouble in relationships, needing to be a strong woman, realizing beauty. The message in her cd is very powerful and good for any girl to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move Over Whitney....Christina Is Back!!!","review":"I love Christina Aguilera's new album it is very different from her Debut album she made.It has more edge & alot more R&B.I always loved her powerful voice.My older sister likes Christina better than Britney Spears & she thinks that Christina can sing better than Britney.She is just like those other singers is Mariah,Whitney & Aretha.Christina Aguilera is A DIVA!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S NOT RIGHT ; BUT IT'S OK","review":"A good album by one of the better voices world wide. OK, it's a good album, but I don't think this will be HER album. I expected more from this. Maybe I'm a bit dissapointed, I was waiting for more funky-hip hop music. There is a lot os Soul! And there is a lack of Spanish tracks...CHRISTINA!, Spanish fans need more than \\"Te quiero\\", \\"Ritmo\\" and \\"Puerto Rico\\". Please, bear in mind next time!! Thanks a lot!!P.S.

I'm not criticizing the film's director/producer because he showed everything like it really is in the gay porn industry: a bunch of empty headed, shallow, narcissistic twits. The egomania (Johnny Law needs to quit reading his press releases) is nothing more than a cover for insecurity and damaged psyches. I get an overwhelming impression that most of the \\"actors\\" got into it because they figured doing porn would make them feel better about themselves or they might gain some approval - whether they want to admit it or not.The only shred of normalcy (such that it is for a porn actor) & being level headed was Cole Tucker. I got the impression from him that he did porn because it was just something he wanted to do, enjoyed doing, and yet had no illusion that it was a gateway to better things. Everyone else in the film just struck me as pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn life","review":"Well, it's about guys who make their living through sex.

I have been a fan of progressive music for years - first listening to Yes and then moving on to other more experimental bands like Procol Harum and, of course, Genesis. On advice from a friend, I purchased the Tristan Park CD and listened to it from start to finish. What I heard I could not believe. By the fifth cut, I felt tingling in my legs - and they have been without feeling for almost six years. I was moved to tears and nearly collapsed at the Cd's conclusion. Oh, what joy! What rapture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant !","review":"I have listened to Tristan Park for several years, and find that they are always sitting at the top of my play list - both for singing along to in the car, as well as through headphones at the office.

The influences (can you say stolen bass-lines) from Rush, Genesis and Elton John are worth nothing more than litigation fodder for the Record Company suits.

He returns home to his ranch, girlfriend (Willa Ford) and unemotional father who is in a wheel chair. He discovers his ranch has been run into the ground and the bank is ready to foreclose. Meanwhile, he has flashbacks to various aspects of the game and Iraq.When a ranch hand (David Born) gets his hand caught, Lance runs at super-human speed to save him. He doesn't remember how he moved that fast. During this early scene we discover two things: 1) someone is watching him and 2) the special effects are about the same as the \\"6 Million Dollar Man\\" and we don't get the cool background bionic noise to go with the motions.Lance \\"zones out\\" and goes into rages, like the Hulk, with severe anger management issues.The plot is weak.

It is a good fan overall, not sure how the ionization feature works, and I am pleased with it, I just wished it cooled the room faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but how to clean?","review":"Fan is impossible to clean in a dusty area.

So, they're both in the dumpster now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Air Conditioning","review":"I was holding off on buying ceiling fans because of the money and now I don't think I will even bother. After buying one of these and trying it out, I bought two more right away. They are that good. They push enough air to easily cool a 30X40 room. They are comparable in terms of air movement to ceiling fans and the oscillating feature makes them better in some ways. Noise is louder than a traditional ceiling fan on high speed, but you can easily fall asleep to it on low speed if you are sensitive to sounds like me. Rotation is quiet with just a bit of noise, but I prefer to just keep them stationary. The remote control is very handy and includes an led light to help you see in the dark.Update: 1 year of heavy use and all 4 are going strong. The filter gets dirty very quickly, so make sure you stay on top of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to give it away...","review":"I would have sent it back, provided I could have reboxed it, but with it weighing about 20 lbs, I was less inclined to try to get it in the box and send it back.What was wrong?

I tried fabreezing it, I tried washing the filter, taking it all apart, and within a few hours, the whole house stunk like bad foot order.The plus side: if you get one that doesn't stink, the fan is fantastic!

I'm getting the Lasko 52\\" Oscillating Pedestal Fan which I've heard nothing but good news about, plus its easy to work anyone can use it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"I was really hoping this fan would be similar to my old fan where you have 3 speeds, remote, turning options etc. It has all of that...but the remote is weird and cumbersome, it goes through 3 speeds and after the 3rd shuts off and you start all over haha. I wish it would just stay on and let me switch from the high, mid, low. It is however VERY quiet compared to other fans. You just have the sound of the air being blown vs. other fans where you hear the choppy noise and the mechanical noises it makes.

However, regarding the Honeywell Fresh Breeze Tower Fan with Remote Control:1. The fan did not work at all.2. The included batteries for the remote control were DOA.3. When I installed my own fresh batteries in the remote control, I determined that the flashlight on the remote had one LED bulb that did not work.One would think that, with all of the negative press surrounding the quality of the products made in China, China would take steps to improve the quality control in its manufacturing plants.Note to Honeywell: Suggest that you start manufacturing your products in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't get the temperature setting =/","review":"This product is actually great, I absolutely love it and it's worth every penny. I really like the fact that it has a air filter =) My only issue I really don't know what the temperature setting is for - I adjust it to make it 'supposedly' cooler, but nothing really happens...maybe a default. Oh well, I'm not returning it...it's being doing absolutely great for me; would recommend to others for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"light weight plastic doesnt blow enough","review":"Yes, we are having a heat wave, but this is cheaply made, putting together the plastic base, one part literally bent . It did still fit togeher and I have it on the highest setting, and it is supposed to cool a large room; I have it in the small bedroom on the highest setting, having followed all instructions, and it's like a small puff of cool air.Previous tabletop desktop fans have been much better; it looks more streamlined, but provides very little in the way of air circulation unfortunately"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it worked as good as it looks","review":"Bought this fan based on the great reviews it has received. Big Mistake. Use it for a fan in the bedroom year round just to circulate the air. It is not even powerful enough to do that. On the stand it is very low to the ground (about waist high) so if you have a high bed as I do you wont feel it. Remote is awful & poorly designed. The Fan has a lot of buttons that do nothing. It looks nice but dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special ...","review":"I ordered it and had high expectations after reading the other reviews. I have the desktop version and it is insane! The low speed is way too much wind for me usuallyThis one however is nothing special. And is actually a bit short which is annoying, i have to keep it on a chair to have it at a good level.It does blow wind, but i expected better performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This fan BLOWS!","review":"I bought one of these fans locally and I liked it so much that I ordered another one from Amazon.Here are the pros and cons as I see them.Pros:1. It pushes a lot of air - I can get a nice breeze from as far as 25 feet away.2. It doesnt take up a lot of room.3. It is not ugly like many fans are.4. The remote control with flashlight is a nice feature even though I rarely use it. For the person who complained about one LED being burned out straight out of the box. Only one LED is for the flashlight. The other is for the remote control functions and doesnt illuminate.Cons1. The breeze feature is kind of annoying because of the fluctuation of the noise level.2. You have to hold the remote in a specific postition to make it work. If the fan is oscillating, its hard to find that position."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many great reviews misled me","review":"So many great reviews saying the fan \\"pushed a lot of air\\" led me to buy two. The first broke during assembly - all the little plastic \\"flanges\\" that are supposed to connect the fan to the base broke off; I'm a frail arthritic old lady; anything I can break is very flimsy. Thankfully, there was also one screw to attach the two pieces, so now I have a somewhat unstable, but useable fan. When I plugged it in, I was shocked. It pushed less air than a $12.95 20\\" box fan. Yes, it does oscillate a full 180 degrees. Sitting 15' directly in front of it, I can barely feel the air move about the time the fan completes the second 90 degree arc of it's oscillation.It is quiet. So is a palm frond waved gently thru the air. They create about the same breeze.Needless to say, the second fan was returned unopened. Since the first is broken, I can't return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Noise","review":"I sleep with a fan every night. I have been very happy with my Lasko fan and have ran it every night for 8+ hours for over four years now. It is JUST starting to get a little quieter with less output, hence I am looking for a replacement. I ordered this fan based on the positive reviews and I have to tell you, I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I repeatedly woke up in the night thinking that the tornado sirens were going off in the distance because it has SUCH a high-pitched blower noise. It isn't a loud noise, but it was just enough to wake me up repeatedly and start heading to the basement. I thought maybe I would get used to the noise and tried it a second night. I ended up unplugging it and plugging my old fan back in. Needless to say the fan has been returned. Not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I had found the fan of my dreams","review":"This was the best fan ever... but after about a year it started to make a rattling noise and is now only usable during the day when we are not trying to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this fan. When running, it gives off a \\"plastic\\" odor. I'm hoping it will fade with time.

It does run fairly quiet, which is a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for air just for looks","review":"I bought this fan based on previous reviews saying moves lot of air but its not true its just a show peace.In high speed it self don't feel that much air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't start!!","review":"Maybe I got unlucky with a bad piece, but the one that came in just did not start. There is some fuse mechanism built into the plug of this fan. I thought of fiddling with it but it's construction was just too intricate and hence decided otherwise.Returned it back to amazon, amazon promptly refunded the full amount and I went in and got a different fan from Costco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fan but...","review":"I think I broke mine =X I would highly recommend this fan because it's quiet, powerful and very sleek looking, but, don't use it for long periods of time over several months. I think I blew the motor on mine over the summer through having it running constantly (which, in retrospect, I know was not a good idea). Overall, it's a good, solid, not too expensive fan. I only gave it 4 stars because it broke and I've only had it for a few months, and even if the breakage was my fault, it broke too quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete","review":"Great if shipped unbroken and with all parts intact.Amazon customer service slow to do what customer requested as far as a replacement label, but eventually came through.

That being said, I still think this a well made fan and will last years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned the next day","review":"Very unstable.

Going to try one more unit, due to amazon's return policy,then still smelling burn and wala it must have burnt my outlet out, plugged in to another outlet and it works now but my other outlet is not working now.

There is a heat wave going on and it seems this fan is traveling across the US to get to him. At one point I got notice it had shipped from PA. Then went to Orlando Florida, then to Miami.. What the heck? My son lives in Mass. PA & MA are not even close to Florida. Not sure why they shipped that way but seems a waist of time and money especially in this heat. I gave them a P.O. Box because my sons neighbors steal all his mail/packages. Just recently they asked where they should ship it? Will never order anything from \\"The Nerds\\" again.

Then, after about a month of sporadic use, the motor died. Initially, I assumed it might have been a faulty electrical outlet. I mean, I am stationed in Korea, and living in the dormitories on base, so it's not completely impossible for the problem to be building related, right? Well, it turns out the problem wasn't building related. The motor just gave out, after about a month intermittent use.I am now in the process of trying to get Honeywell to send me a new unit. I will update this rating after that process comes to a conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another disposable fan","review":"Bought one of these new on a clearance sale and the oscillate function didn't work out of the box. Honeywell (actually a company called KAZ that must have bought rights to the Honeywell name for consumer goods) would not fix it and when I attempted to disassemble it I found that I couldn't get to the oscillation mechanism leaving me with a broken fan. I was also not impressed by the rickety stand with just a few plastic prongs and one screw holding it on.It's sad too because I'm sure if they'd spent another $10/fan to design and build it properly it would be a fine product as it really pushes the air out. However as it is the build quality is quite poor and I suspect even a good one is unlikely to last more than a season or two before something breaks. Mine's probably going to the Goodwill and I'll be shopping elsewhere for a fan, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"The fan is great: it's quiet, easy to use, has a nifty hand remote in case you want to turn it off, and works really well. Only reason for no 5 would be that nothing is perfect and when on oscillating the rotation is sometimes TOO WIDE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fan","review":"This is a great fan. Easy to setup no tools needed. It has a built in air filter that seems to work well. It is very strong and works great. I have one compliant about the remote.

The company instructed me to return it to them at my expense for a credit. Sounds fine so far.However, it will cost $45 to ship via UPS ground from NJ to PA. So, I'd have to pay $45 out of pocket for them to give me a credit for $49--no option for a replacement fan.

Our living room is about 600 sq ft, we only needed to turn the fan to the lowest setting for the room to cool down, so the AC can be kept at 78 degree. Although the fan is not silent, it does not interfere with watching TV or anything. I love the ionizing function, the air feels fresh and cool! The base wobbles a bit if you try to move the fan, but not during oscillation. I've only had the fan for a couple of weeks, so cannot comment on its durability. Hopefully it lasts several years.What's strange is the packaging - there wasn't any! It came in a manufacture's box with an UPS label on it, that's it. Fortunately the fan still works (so far).

And they leaked - not a lot, but enough to get paint spread all around the room, which is a pain to track down and clean up even with washable paint. I do love the concept, and my son and I really enjoy playing with the Do-A-Dot version."},{"rating":"1","title":"REGRET BUYING THESE","review":"The bottle is such hard plastic and the paints dry out, it's really hard to get the sponge tips wet again, because you can't really squeeze them. I don't know if its because they are top heavy or what, but they tip over easily, and they are awkward to hold. After a year of wrestling with them, I'm throwing them out (still half full) and ordering the Do-a-dot Rainbow Art Set. I shout a loud DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY to any potential buyers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go by the picture!!","review":"The item in the picture it not what I got.I had the same problem ordering other items from the Amazon.com site.One other problem is there is no part number listed in the packing slip ( or online)to check it against."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BAND EVER","review":"i dont know what this is or what is was supposed to be but its terrible. its more of a poor attempt at metal than hardcore.its boring,corny,generic, and predictable.hopefully this band stays upstate,maybe even continues north to canada as long as they stay outta the city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean cup!","review":"I have a vacuum brewer, a Chemex, a French Press and this little guy and I think this one makes the cleanest cup of all.

We got him Bear for Christmas last year and he hasn't had a day without his friend. He drags him everywhere.

I definately reccommend Bear to all the children who cannot get enough of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and snuggly!","review":"We bought this for our son's first Christmas - at which he was 11 months old. He snuggles with Bear in his crib and while we watch Bear on Disney. He loves to watch Bear and we all love to read Bear's books.When you press Bear's left ear he says cute phrases like, \\"How about a nice bear hug.\\" and \\"Great bear hug.\\" and \\"I smell a friend.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but...","review":"This Bear is very cute. But, the description makes it sound like Bear talks when you hug him (although admitedly it does not actually say that). Bear actually talks when you squeeze his ear. I ordered this for our son's first birthday so squeezing the ear isn't as easy for him as hugging Bear. I'm still happy with him, I just wish I had known before ordering and thought someone else might want to know, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's awesome!","review":"My daughter received this for her first birthday. She watches Bear a lot so she knew who he was and his voice makes her smile every time. However, I do have a problem with his \\"shedding\\". So far, in less than a week, I've found three tuffs of fur on my carpet. He is better suited for an older child who doesn't pick at things as babies can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bear Is the Best","review":"My 2-yr. old loves bear!

It was lower and kind of scary. I'm not sure if this was an individual issue, but she hasn't really taken to this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"an underrated, style-defying gem","review":"By underrated, I mean this is the album I listen to once 'every great while' and while I listen to it I'm left in rapture and wonder why I don't listen to it more often. Prick is a great band that came out with this self-titled debut and apparently fell off the face of the earth right after. Like fellow Nothing artists 12 Rounds, Prick has a unique tendency to throw multiple musical genres into a blender and press 'liquefy,' the end result being a style that's near-impossible to define. Frontman Kevin McMahon's vocal and lyrical range goes from playful innocence ('Communique,' 'I Got it Bad') to eloquent maturity ('No Fair Fights,' 'I Apologise') to dark-humored id (the amazing album closer 'Makebelieve'). Prick isn't pop nor industrial nor Goth, but if you're looking for some intellectual ear candy, it doesn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful! fantastic! the best!","review":"ahhhhhhhh i love this cd!!! it has to be one of the best around! it is too good for words! i wish they would come out with more. if u love or even just like nine inch nails u MUST buy this. everytime u listen, tiny new things appear, makin a cd that will never loose it's intrest."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW.","review":"I have had this CD since its release and it still amazes me. Words fail to describe how talented PRICK is throughout all of their songs, Makebelieve and No Fair Fights most of all. This is most definately the CD of choice for the industrial fan or the simply soft sound fan. On a scale of 1-5, i would give this a 10! This CD is a MUST HAVE! Years of this music really sank in, and these lyrics are just awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average band with nothing original on the tracks","review":"The first thing that sticks out after listening to this cd is how similar the music is to NIN. After reading the liner notes I found that Trent Reznor produced more than 1/2 of the songs and it shows. It makes the cd feel like karoake. Guitar chords, electronic blips and drum beats all sound like they were taken from NIN downward spiral cd. If you are o.k. with that you may like the band. The singers voice sounds like David Bowie.A better choice for industrual music would be Ministry, Lords of Acid, KMFDM, and 9 Volt"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"I have literally thousands of albums, and PRICK is one of my top 50 of all time. Each and every song on this rock/glitter/EBM masterpiece is fascinating, strange and MEMORABLE. Of all the albums of its genre, PRICK is one of the few that contains 10 songs that you can play on the piano, re-arrange, or do anything else with. It's songs first, production second.Of course, that production second is second to none! This thing is crispy, crunchy, distorted meyhem with enough depth to keep you listening throughout.Influences? Bowie, Front 242, Led Zep, The Cars, and just about every other truly influential act pre-1995. Hearing it (gulp) 9 years after its release, this is the overall most rounded album to come from nothing in the nineties. The Downward Spiral is a more cohesive and focused blast of rage, but PRICK really bears more repeated listenings.Amazing. One of my top 10 of the nineties."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Risk Here","review":"The topic of this anthology of poetry, \\"risking everything,\\" is perfect for anyone needing or starting a new venture in life. These poems encourage us to throw open the doors and try again. What is not risky is the quality of the work. Some of the genre's most beloved and accomplished poets are represented: Mary Oliver, Rumi, Derek Walcott, Emily Dickinson, Rilke, Hafiz, and so many more. Well-done translations, too. Whether you attempt or only dream of change, the introductory chapter will set you up for whatever comes next in your life, and the poems will follow through with a one-two punch to your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"An alphabet joke book","review":"When I read this book to my grandson,he immediately got the joke. Whenever I am down, I pick up this book and laugh myself back into a good mood. The illustrations are hilarious especially the moose in cowboy boots. This is a real change from ordinary alphabet books- because the joke is on the reader. Someone observant sees its the animals doing the actions that are the real word that corresponds with the letter. I just bought this for my grandson because he kept asking me to get it for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Is for Salad","review":"This book is an alphabet book intended for both children and adults. I say that because as I read, I could not stop laughing. Each page has an illustration of an animal representing the letter, but the animal is performing an activity. A perfect example the cover where \\"A Is for Salad\\" refers an alligator eating salad. It will be a challenge for youngsters and a delight for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical alphabet book!","review":"I work at a public library in the kids' dept., so when I saw another alphabet book I almost passed it by, but the picture on the front of the book of an alligator eating a salad really piqued my curiosity. \\"A is for Salad??? What???\\" I said, and had to open the book to see what was going on. I didn't just look at a page or two, but had to read through the whole thing - it was just so cute and had me smiling as I figured out what each letter REALLY stands for. Great to get kids thinking while having fun, each picture depicts an animal beginning with the featured letter engaged in some activity. For example, an alligator is eating a salad. There are a few animals, such as the iguana and narwhal, which have helpful clues as to the animals' identities hidden in the pictures. Kids may need help to identify the jellyfish and vulture, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A is for Wonderful Book!","review":"A is for Salad, by Mike Lester, is a wonderful book! My children (ages 7 and 5) love the humor, and so do I. It's a fun break from the plethora of alphabet books on the market. We laugh at the irony. We are buying this book to share with my older daughter's class - I think it will fast become a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginning Sound FUN.....","review":"This is a WONDERFUL beginning sound challenge book. Good for grades K & 1. My class was thrilled with the crazy characters, and couldn't WAIT to tell me thatthe LETTER on each page did NOT represent the WORD, but, rather the ANIMAL. It's written very well, and the pictures are comical. Kids LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information on an interesting subject","review":"This book filled in a lot of information for me that I had wondered about. It is well written and easy to read. If you are interested in early Mormonism and the origins of what used to be called the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (RLDS), this is a good source.However, it does have some gaps. It doesn't give us much about his mother and their relationship. It doesn't really delve into the man's spiritual life beyond what he did when and only talks about his revelations as they affect some program he was trying to bring about.But I was very interested to learn about his role in the persecution of the Utah Saints in trying to end polygamy. And I did find it kind of funny that a man who was obsessed with others having more than one wife ended up having three and children with two of them. The last one being far younger than him. Sure it is a serial form of polygamy, but...I am glad that I own it and have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infromative book","review":"Infromation compiled from a series of newspaper articles.

(you would have to specify a date and time to veiw older recordings). fastest forward scan is about 60x and rewind jumps back alot so it's hard to review the footage. no problem i thought since i can transfer footage via USB and review it on the computer, however watching on their player software isn't any better and the files are propietory format. you can convert it to AVI through the software but in realtime! it plays while it rerecords it to the AVI format.i like to know what has been going on while i was away so the process of reviewing the footage is important to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor man's Malevolent Creation and a bland band with good musicians","review":"Hate Plow is basically a side project of Phil Fasciana (ex-Malevolent Creation and Rob Barrett (ex-Malevolent Creation, ex-Cannibal Corpse). The singer Kyle Symons even later replaced Brett Hoffmann for two Malevolent Creation albums.As you can already tell, much of this band relies on the existence and notorious instability of Malevolent Creation. Although the charm that makes MC albums worth listening to isn't represented here. Some worthwile humor replaces what this album lacks musically. There is even room for the occasional goofy scripted \\"screw up playing\\" that made S.O.D. what they were (a la \\"What's that Noise?\\"). The songs blend together after a while and it gives off the impression that the entire album was written and cut in under an hour.If you're a die hard Malevolent Creation or Cannibal Corpse fan and can find this for a couple bucks, you might want to get a couple listens out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a basic book for database programming","review":"This truly is only a basic book for the understanding of database programming with vb6.

His lyrics are very spare; they remind me of the daily horoscope that seems to apply to everyone because the descriptions are so vague. The production of the CD is great, very clean and intimate-sounding, but this is pretty lightweight stuff. The only melody that has stayed with me is \\"There's a Rhythm\\", and I can't recall one song that breaks what I would call mid-tempo. Lullabys.

I watched it be shoved in to a truck and have tons of other campers stuff stacked on top. It was returned from camp with the same \\"gentle\\" treatment. The latches held up great despite daughters packing it to its limit in both directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy - Poorly Made","review":"The plastic on this trunk is flimsy and bends easily. When loaded, the weight of items in the trunk is sufficient to flex the plastic and allow the latches to disengage. That's before the cheaply riveted left latch broke on mine. I was definitely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Product","review":"Extremely disappointed...the box does hold stuff...that is about it. It is paper thin plastic, not very durable, latches do not line up and hence do not work. I had to repair the cheap hinge right out of the shipping carton. It was not damaged, just poor manufacturing and quality control. Had I seen this product in person before I bought it, I would not have considered it..it is terrible. Contico make a similar container at far less money that is really nice, but does not have wheels. When this piece of crap falls apart (soon, I am sure) I will buy a Contico at Lowes for 2/3 the price.....what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my money!","review":"I purchased two of these trunks to take with me on a deployment to Afghanistan. Both of them were broken in multiple places. I noticed that the box had minimal protectant around the trunks. So it was just cardboard around 90 percent of the trunks. I would have sent them back and purchased something else but I did not have enough time to send them back order something else. The quality of the plastic seemed to add to reason of them breaking. This is not by any means a heavy duty trunk. I was worried about the trunks crushing on the trip over and all of my personal stuff splilling out. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THESE TRUNKS TO ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardware just too flimsy","review":"The plastic is solid, size is good, and price is right, and if you don't anticipate hauling or shipping this thing much it will get the job done at a good price. But if you intend to check it on an airplane or bus or haul around (we took it on a week-long canoe trip where it was hauled from point-to-point by a luggage service) then it just simply won't stand up to the stress. VERY lightweight closing hardware started to pull away within a few days.Recommended for STORAGE only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I bought two of these some time ago and right out of the box was disappointed. As previously mentioned, dimensions are outside, and the odd insets, reinforcements, and quirky angles greatly reduce the inside storage area. One trip through the Fedex system, and they arrived with huge cracks running through both lids. Save your money and find some real footlockers if your looking for durability and efficient use of space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, look elsewhere","review":"I received this box tonight and was disappointed. The plastic is warped so that I cannot close the trunk top properly. Also, when I finally did get the damn thing to line up properly and clasp, I found the clasps to be loose to the point where they will fall off. The clasps are not tight at all. Perhaps this is just the one I received.For the most part, this box will do what I need it to do for now however, I will be looking around for a better one.All in all, look for something in steel if you're serious about storing AND toting around anything of value. I use mine for photography lighting and backdrop equipment. I would store my tools in there but not until I find something for all of the other stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are cheaper in the military.","review":"This product is overpriced and I have found it for half the price I bought two of them brand new for the same price as the one that i bought on here. cheap plastic and very flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fragile!","review":"We were so excited - a very reasonable price and other reviews were positive. The plastic is brittle - it broke after being sat upon. These would be perfect for storage; but they aren't up to the task of scout camping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy!","review":"We bought these trunks to take items with us to Africa for a mission trip. They did not arrrive in one piece. Our previous experiences with trunks that LOOK like these was much better: the trunks survived several trips over and back! Neither of the two trunks made by this manufacturer made the return trip! They literally fell apart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Storage box","review":"It is the second box, with exactly the same characteristics that I bought.

I have had to purchase several of them for trips CONUS to OCONUS and back. All the boxes I have purchased have one problem or another. Some of the issues are: Wheels fall off, handle pops off, latches bend easily and every last one of them is cracked one way or another. Someone needs to come up with a case that has rugged wheels for the bowling ball gardens and moon dust. It should be light tan or olive drab in color and twice as thick plastic to resist cracking or warping, and above all, absolutely affordable for the troops."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointing in so many ways","review":"The storage trunk arrived broken in two places, and after I had opened it to see how bad the damage was, I was unable to latch it securely again without help because the latches were so poorly aligned.Also, the website says \\"Ships Separately in Original Packaging\\", which I did not understand meant that they slapped a Fed Ex label directly on the storage trunk. The only \\"packaging\\" aside from the shipping label was a packing slip stuck to the inside of the trunk.I might buy this again, if I could get it locally (so I could visually inspect it prior to purchase) AND at a discount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel broke off first time I flew. One of the latches is loose. Very disappointed.","review":"Very disappointed in this product. A wheel broke off the first time I flew. The day I got it, one of the latches is loose.Wasted $40. I am asking for a replacement or my money back.Buy another brand!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable as stated","review":"We purchased this item for our child to go to camp. We shipped it by UPS. On the way there one part of the loop that held the lock broke. The container was cracked. She had to tape it with a whole roll of duct tape. On the shipment back, the whole locking loop broke off. There was a cracked corner. I am very disappointed. We wanted something that would last for years and it didn't even last three months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storage Trunk","review":"I purchased this product for my son's use as scout summer camp. We found the latches to be very flimsy. In fact the first trunk we received had one of the latches broken off, when we opened the shipment. Amazon quickly replaced it. The trunk itself fulfilled its purpose, but the latches are poorly secured to the trunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for campers !","review":"I got 4 trunks for my 4 children going to summer camp this july. The 4 trunks came back with the lid split in 2 . I was a bit surprised and my kids told me they had to step on the lid in order to climb on their beds !! so these trunks are certainly good for storage but not for campers ! Unfortunetly I will have to buy new ones next year, but heavy duty expensive ones I guess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Camp Mom","review":"I purchased this trunk to ship my child's clothes to camp. It was roomy enough, but I was disapointed in how it withstood shipping! Although we used the lock-hole, the actual lock was ripped through the hole (so no protection there). The closures were extrememly beat up and bent, but still usable. If you use this to ship via USPS, re-enforce the closures using strapping tape (NOT regular shipping tape!)all the way around both ends of the trunk for extra security. The shape will warp if not secured on both ends, leaving the contents accessible to anyone. I will not buy another trunk of this type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller Than Advertised","review":"The trunk is lightweight, and sturdy enough, but it is significantly smaller than advertised -- my measurements of this case are: 36\\" x 15\\" x 12\\" as OUTSIDE dimensions; INSIDE is much smaller due to structural ribs -- 31.5\\" x 13\\" x 12\\". Now I'm debating should I order another, using two cases, or send this back for a larger case. Capacity is a critical issue in a case, and the indicated size is a clear misrepresentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ IT!","review":"A gripping read!

BUY IT TODAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I was absolutely captivated. Between the well-developed characters and excellent writing I truly felt their pain. I finished it yesterday afternoon & I am still thinking about it today. I wouldn't let my daughter leave the house yesterday, I just wanted her to be with me. It's a rare book that can affect you so deeply on so many levels. I related to the characters as both a mother and a daughter. I want everyone I know to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"Enjoyed the background to and development of a very close relationship that was different from anything I had read before"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book is very well written with characters that are identifiable, a story line that has you hooked from the beginning and an ending that will leave you with tears in your eyes. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"This novel was probably the best book I have ever read. The book is about 2 people who grew up together and fell in love. This book drew me in immediately and kept me interested throughout the whole book. There are so many suprises in this novel, it will keep you guessing throughout it. There are a lot of topics and issues that this book discusses, the book really made me think. I tried to put myself in the young girls position, but I couldn't imagine what she was feeling. I think this novel is so awesome because it was things that happen in everyday life. I would love to go on forever about this book, but I don't want to give anything away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pact","review":"This book kept me turning the page. I loved it. The ending haunted me. I wanted to read a sequel. I thought about it for days afterword."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"Heavy hearted story with real characters. No neat and tidy ending. Melanie is a real and unforgivable character who let her daughter's secrets die with her. All together the characters wove a rich tapestry of the human condition.

Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"The Pact kept my interest peeked the whole book. I could not put it away toward the end. Jodi Picoult researches her subjects thoroughly and that makes for a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Touched","review":"Jodi Picoult's ability to keep reader's on the edge of their seat left me unable to put this book down! I absolutely loved it!I have never read anything by Picoult until now and I definitely will read more in the future.The Pact was amazing. I could relate to many aspects of the novel and each event left me thinking. The story makes you wonder how life could be so perfect and then change in an instant. Picoult uses great detail in showing the love between two teenagers and how their once close famalies become split apart, left with a mystery of one child dead and the other accused of murder.This book truly touched me and I would strongly reccomend it for readers who enjoy the strength of love and the search for truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Love Story\\" ? Ugh!","review":"Although \\"entertaining,\\" the storyline was implausible and left too many questions unanswered. The characters were a bunch of the most selfish, self-centered people I've encountered in a novel in a long time. Just what is the author trying to say about love? A book that definitely does NOT leave the reader with any good feelings at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outraged!!!","review":"I don't think I have ever read anything so ridiculous in my life! So not worth your time. I wonder if this writer has ever known a teenager in her life. I found myself just laughing at the stupid reasoning in this book that tries to make you believe the plot. Chris has got to be the worst boyfriend a girl could ever have. His girl friend wants to kill herself and he goes along with it because he thinks she'll just do it anyway. Not that he should help her and believe that she could get past all her troubles. He supplies the gun! I have suicide in my family and I find all of this offensive. I was hoping the Chris would go to jail just for being such a jerk. For real!!! Can anyone believe this stuff??? I can't. Don't bother. I can't believe this got published!!! Anyone who has been touched by suicide should be outraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much more than a love story","review":"Jodi Picoult tells more than a love story in this book. \\"The Pact\\" is an eager unravelling of a relationship and of a love unlike any other. Emily is shot on the first page and subconciously leaves behind a chain of unanswered questions, doubts and lies. Through a series of police investigations, Chris interprets their story, painting a moving story of a \\"suicide pact\\" between them. Yet in the end, a different story is told. It evolves into a truth no heart could fully know; it is really, an unfathomable truth of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the term page turner was to be described as one book this would be it","review":"Loved it- definately one of my favorites. It's not predictable and you can relate with the character Emily. Keeps you guessing up until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartaching tragedy","review":"When I first purchased this book- I was so excited to read it! Every page only made me more interested and I felt something deeply for the main character, Chris- who, was going through so much.This book is a love story, a suspense- its a combination of what we love to read. It made me cry, it made me angry- I literally could not stop thinking about this book- during class, during work- I'd speak about it to everyone- letting them know how entrapt I was with this novel. Its brilliant in the most depressing way possible.I loved it and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Jodi, Im not all that impressed","review":"I really expected so much more from this book. I've heard great things about this author but after reading my first by her I must not read anymore. Overall it was so dull and a bit annoying. A few parts made me feel sad but not enough to make me like this book very much. I didn't like the anti abortion message."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read it twice","review":"I read this book twice just to make sure i didn't miss anything the first time. It kept me coming back to see what the characters would do next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I absolutley love Jodi Picoult books and this one was no exception.

Great page turner and drew me in from first page. Not for the emotionally fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brava!","review":"Jodi Picoult did it again. In this dramatic exploration of what it means to love, and the sacrifices made, Picoult vividly paints the relationship between a boy and a girl in love. Until it all came crashing down. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries, romance, and believes that life is not black and white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbraking","review":"The Pact is a sobering look at how people truly do not realize how much their interpretation of happiness and expectations can muddle a child's life. This is a harrowing tale of love and heartache that was a quick read o a difficult topic. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picoult never fails to get my wheels turning","review":"Couldn't stop reading. The story was very riveting and thought provoking. It touched on many hot button topics. I enjoyed the pace of the story - how it went between past and present to weave all the pieces together. Can't wait to get started on the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love Story","review":"This was very much worth reading. I highly recommend this book to anyone. Its not just romantic but suspencful all at the same time. This book kept me turning pages untill the end. The ending was Good!! It wasn't how expected the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I am an 18 year old college student. I love to read. This book is probably my favorite one ever.

I absolutely loved the book. However, I gave it 4 stars because the ending was somewhat confusing to me....I didn't really enjoy how the book was ended.I would still recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still thinking about it!","review":"This is not a \\"feel good\\" kind of book. It's dark and you will experience many different emotions throughout reading it, which is what I loved about it! It grabs your attention, and weeks later I am still pondering the psyche of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE J Picoult's works -- EXCEPT this one!","review":"What a disappointment. I've read everything published by Ms. Picoult and loved nearly all of it until this book. She fails to create a plausible picture of the factors compelling Em to be desperately suicidal, and why-oh-why wouldn't Chris try to get the woman he loves help? -- that is help to live, not to die? Unlike Picoult's usual work, The Pact is awkward and slow-moving, and the plot is full of holes. Too bad; not up to Picoult's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I can see by the reviews on these pages that there are a lot of people who loved The Pact. I am not one of them. While the story may have had some potential, Picoult doesn't develop anything. There is nothing special about this novel at all, it's just a run-of-the-mill story. No humor, no character development, no believable characters, no thought-provoking observations, nothing to distinguish it as anything but a quick read. She skims the surface, gives us predictable and somewhat boring and indistinguishable characters. As a quick read, it's not awful, but that's about the best I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow","review":"Because this book is so 'readable', people are claiming it's art. But try and look a little below the surface (and this book is all surface) and see that it's really unbelievable and very shallow. The characters are so thinly drawn, that they have only one characteristic each (Gus is forthright, James is reserved. And what about Kate? Was she anything more than a plot device that popped in and out as needed to forward the story?) The telling monents, such as Emily grabbing Chris's hand immediately after she is born is so contrived it's cringe-inducing.I know a lot of pople will tell me I'm heartless for not being affected by this story. But when something is this blatantly manipulative without offering any genuine insight, I can't fall for it. But obviously, there are plenty of people who like to be emotionally manipulated.Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it well written? Absolutely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too impressed","review":"I read \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" by the same author recently. While implausible in some places, it was a page turner, at least until the absurd ending with characters that you genuinely cared about.Unfortunately, this is not the same. Until I read it, I would not have believed that a novel about two young kindred spirits who make a suicide pact, and how the survivor deals with a murder accusation could be so dull. But it is.While I felt sorry for the protagonists, I never felt engaged with their plight. Perhaps this is due to the author, perhaps it was me. I have no idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful","review":"When I first read the back of the book, I put the book aside because I wasnt sure whether I could read such a depressing story. Sure enough I read it and I loved it! You become so attached to the characters that you feel like they are a part of your own family. Im glad I read this book and gave it a chance. Two thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I had this book recommended to me after my friend saw I was reading 'Change of Heart'. I finished 'Change' in a few days. 'The Pact' took me at least a month. It was a tragic story and Jodi does a fantastic job of capturing the heart break of everyone involved, but there were a few loose ends that I was hoping would be tied up. This book deserves a continuation. I want to know....what now? It's a great story and I was happy with the end, but it left me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great but difficult read","review":"This is a great but difficult read. Wow, I am almost left speechless after experiencing the unfolding of this book. The layout for this book was fabulous causing me to sit on the edge of my sit, in shock and of awe of this book. Very gutsy topic I would say. I shed tears over this book. I've lived nothing even close to this in my life but my heart just went out to these young teenagers. If you can handle a roller coaster of emotions, sadness verses curiosity, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woiuld not recommend it","review":"The author had an interesting idea for the overall plot, but about half way through it just falls flat. The characters have no real level of depth, therefore you could really care less how things turn out for them. Especially Emily, who seems to, out of the blue, decide that suicide is her only hope. Also, the verdict for Chris at the end of the story is ridiculous. I also don't understand the sudo \\"affair\\" between the Emily's father and Chris's mother. It seemed to have no place in this story. I found myself intrigued by this book early on as it seemed like it would be a real page tuner, but it just turned out to be a big disappointment with too many ridiculous, irrelevant story lines and unanswered questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my fav books","review":"I love this book. I love jodi picoult books most of the time too. This book is one of her best. This book makes you think how much do you really love someone. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to put down!","review":"This was the first Jodi Picoult book that I had read and I was overall very pleased. It is the type of book, that is extemely hard to put down. The book's set up makes the reader feel as if he or she is a detective, trying to gather clues to figure out the case. The characters in the book are the type people, one would run into on a daily basis, making the book easy to relate to. Although, I did enjoy reading the book, I was extremely dissappointed by the ending. I felt as though Picoult left the reader hanging with more questions and I wanted more answers. Overall, I would suggest this book to anyone who is looking for a book that keeps one's attention, and likes the aspect of trying to figure out a crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"the pact","review":"i have seen this movie and am really looking forward to getting my hands on this book; i also own plain truth, which i have also seen the movie on lifetime. one thing that i have found is that the books are usually like 10x better than the movies-all i really have to do is find time to read them! this is one author that i have heard nothing but great reviews about, so i suggest that anyone who has not yet read a book by her too pick one up asap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pact.","review":"I didn't like this book as it was too sad. I think it was well written and most of what happened could really happen in real life. It was so well written I felt it was a real life story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing premise","review":"Jodi Picault always finds a way to create a twist at the end of her books, and that is true here too. Although the premise is a very dark one, she explores the feelings of her characters in depth and allows the reader to determine what motivtion there really could be, in a situation as disturbing as this one.

I couldn't put it down.In typical Jodi Picoult style, the story moves through time not in linear fashion, but in past and presentwoven together to create a suspenseful and unpredictable plot.One of the things I liked most about the novel is that it involves courtroom litigation. I enjoythe dance of prosecutor vs. defense attorney. As always in our legal system, it is not so much a matterof guilt or innocence, but of reasonable doubt. The fact that it is a likeable young man whose fate is at stake makes it all the more compelling.I read this book on my Kindle. As much as I love my Kindle, I wish I had the book in my hands so that I could have easily gone back to previous pages. As the story unfolds, the meanings of passages written in previous chapters spring to life.I am currently reading Salem Falls, another novel by this same author.

I absolutely could not put it down--everything around me became obsolete while I became engrossed in this book. It was given to me by a friend, and the first I have ever read by Jodi Picoult. Well, I finished it in less than 4 days. I could not even think of anything else while reading this. I can seriously say that nothing could have added to this book to make it any more perfect--but as I reached the last page, I wanted nothing more than for the book to continue on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"This book is impossible to put down.

I am dying to see it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable for its timely topic, and one character","review":"This is a very well-paced novel that kept me going till the end. I didn't believe in the ending, however -- it just didn't ring true. Ironically, the character who seemed most vivid to me was that of Emily, despite being mysterious and absent throughout the book. The questions of her choosing death have stuck with me long since reading this book several months ago. This is the sort of book I enjoyed most when I was in my teens because it inspires discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the hype!","review":"Shallow shallow shallow! This is the kind of book that seems to have been written with either the movie deal or Oprah's book club in mind. The NY Times review is right: the characters are one-dimensional, the plot predictable. If you have ever read one legal thriller, or have even a high school education, you can easily figure out what \\"plot twist\\" or \\"emotional turmoil\\" will come next. What's worse, the paperback version of the book comes with discussion points, as if the themes of incest, social class, career, and showing of emotions were not obvious enough. This book is truly an example of the dumbing down of America."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend it","review":"I have to say that I did enjoy reading it but it is the ending that vexed me. You are waiting for this mistery to be solved and when you get to the end you are terribly disappointed.

I have seen the Movie made about it twice now and they both are wonderful. I would recommend this book. Its a Must Read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic, boring, depressing.","review":"Does Jodi Picoult have a freakin' sense of humor? Yes, the subject matter is serious and tragic, but REAL families will have light moments even after tragedies in their lives. I wish I had read the first page and then the last page of this book and skipped all the life-wasting time I spent on the rest of this ridiculous and meaningless story. And I get the impression that high school literature classes are making teens read this? Surely they can find something else that deals with teen suicide than this plodding and endless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read most of Jodi's books and this was the most disappointing one of all. I found it to be a bit draggy and melodramatic and only to find out that Em committed suicide because she was pregnant?!! Considering the family loved the idea of them falling in love and being family friends, I didnt see why Em would be so upset abotu being pregnant and its not as if the two families hated each other (aka Romeo and Juliet). So I found Em's character not having common sense and too dramatic. Aside from this though I did enjoy reading about the beginnings of both of their parents relationship, the same timing of pregnancies etc which explains the 2 stars rating otherwise it would have been a one star rating.But other than that I would not re-read this book at all unlike other books Jodi wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick service. :)","review":"The book came in a timely matter. It also came in the condition it said in the description. Thanks! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite book","review":"\\"The Pact\\" is an amazing book about two young teens and their stuggles in life to meet up to their expectations while telling the tale with a well written perspective.Two teens who both have been raised together truly love each other, but in what way? How do they deal with all the pressure?There is so much going on in this book I can't even begin to tell you.It's just so good..Just buy it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"It was an ok read. Pretty predictable with lots of drama. Seemed like it was more the teen crowd. Kind of reminded me of an 80's TV movie of the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book :)","review":"If you've never read a Jodi Picoult book, this one will get you hooked. I enjoyed the book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing book that I didn't want to put down!","review":"This book definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. It went back and forth from present to past time and made me want to keep reading to find out what happened. It was pretty sad, but a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true love story","review":"Spellbinding to the very end. Impossible to even attempt to guess how the story will pan out. Highly recommend. A++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a fan of Jodi Picoult but I found this to be the weakest of her novels.Perhaps she intended to leave us with many unanswered questions, but I found it to be a very unsatisfying read. Her characters and their motivations were not well developed. I didn't really understand any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PACT","review":"Great Love Story. Keeps you intrested. Loved the ending could not guess the outcome! Makes you want to look at you kids with more intrest and concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't what I expected!","review":"When I bought this book, I didn't expect it to be that good, to pull me in and keep me in till the very end. I was hooked the second I read the first word. I'm nit going to tell you want it is about because that spoils the whole book.There were a couple times when I cried, and I don't cry at books or movies unless they really hit home. There were quotes that I highlighted just like most people. There were funny moments.All in all, buy/rent/whatever this book, because it is just that good. These characters will stay in my mind. Especially Jordan, the lawyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate","review":"I don't even know where to begin. I am so glad I was aimlessly walking through the library when this novel found me, and to think I was going to go home and watch tv! I opened this book in the morning and finished it that night. It took over my life for a number of days. I was in tears over it often, my feelings are incapable of being described. I grieved for the characters in this book as I grieved for deaths in my family, and longed to live where they did just so I'd have the right to cry for them. This book touched me in a way I have never experienced and I urge everyone everyone everyone to read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help! I need a nail appointment!","review":"...I bit off all my best nails reading this book-- it's that suspenseful. All these 5-star reviews might make you suspicious that this author has a really big family. But I swear, I've never met her, just read the book on a recommendation. It was completely riveting. Suspenseful, painfully honest, thought-provoking. I was reminded somewhat of MIDWIVES by Chris Bohjalian and THE MOST WANTED by Jacqueline Mitchard, but I felt THE PACT was more suspenseful and better written. Not a \\"comfortable\\" read due to the subject matter, but a wonderful read. Believe all the passionate reviews here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another book by Jofi Picoult that keeps you interested","review":"I kept reading to find out hoe it was going to work it self out. I felt like I hadit figured out and then it would take a twist. Just like all of Jodi Picoult booksit always keep you interested. Looking forward to more of her books. I got this from Amazon for my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I loved this book, but I do wish the author would have given more insight into Emily's mind and why she felt the way she did.

Sad ending.I will share with my Kindle Fire sharing friends/sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loverly","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was like a warm cup of coffee on a rainy day. It was easy to love the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the list of Top 5 Books Ever.","review":"I just finished reading this last night. It is quite possibly one of the best books I have ever had the privilege of reading. Often it was so disturbing that I had to put it down for a bit. That is not a bad thing. Any author that can bring you to the point of emotional devastation with the stroke of a pen is truly gifted. I feel for these characters in a way I have never felt before.What a wonderful, horrific, painful, real story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbed!","review":"I began reading the book and immediately fell in love with the characters. I became absorbed by the memories and the love they had for each other. It's important to remind ourselves as a parent or parent's to show our child(ren) the routes of communication are always open regardless of how alone they must feel that there's no way out of pain. In this day we can place so much pressure on our kids they feel the need to be perfect, when all we want is the best for them. Although fiction I can see this being realistic. Excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"A crazy page turner. I feel like jordan, jealous, but like selena woeful. To love someone that deeply. Wow unnerving"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pact","review":"The Pact was easy reading. It was hard to put down. Could not wait to see how the story line would end. I am excited to read more of Jodi's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"On reading this for the 2nd time - I still found it captivating. The depths of teenage angst will awlays remain a closed book.","review":"The plot is well laid out, keeping you guessing. The characters are all accessible and easy to empathise with. Suicide is still a very taboo topic even in this 21st century and we do not know and never will know why suicides happen in 90% of cases. Something is lacking in society - I cannot put it into concise words, but not only with teens, but with anyone - the \\"need\\"to end ones life can trul;y appear to be the only solution and we, society must when in doubt, actively invade people's hearts and minds to check whether they are truly ok. Jodi Picoult is a true story teller with a message(s) in every novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - good characters","review":"Although the ending might not have been a surprise I was gripped to the story line with the last minute twist in the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read!!!","review":"Simply was unable to put this book down! I recommend this book for anyone wanting a captivating read! A true page turner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been a big fan of Jodi Picoult's writing. Unfortunately, The Pact was a great disappointment. Although the characters were interesting and well-developed, I simply did not find the core plot believable. A young man of Chris's background and good sense would not have been lured into \\"the pact\\" as described in this novel.I have done extensive reading on the issue of teen suicide. This story misses a great opportunity to address this national problem.A much better fictional work which addresses teen suicide with indepth character development, positive resolution, and even humor is The Turning Hour by Shelley Fraser Mickle. Read it and compare.M. Wagner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The Serious Reader","review":"The Pact resembles nothing so much as a puchero, the Spanish stew made of leftovers and highly spiced in an attempt to marry and mask the component ingredients. Picoult pulled stock characters out of her refrigerator--gorgeous weepy teens and upset mothers (one capable, one dizzy)--and put them into the old cast iron love story. She then spiced it up with a suicide pact and attempts to serve it in the context of a criminal prosecution.Completely missing are (1) character development; (2) acute observations of love, loss and commitment; and (3) cleverness.By the way, doesn't New Hampsire penal law embrace lesser included offenses? Someone needs to do a little homework. But not me, I am busy reading more serious stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!!!!","review":"Her books are not for those struggling with their own depression...if anything, they'll push vulnerable folks over the edge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could throw it in the trash! There is one story, from the first page to the last. It is depressing and unbelievable. the characters are unreal, The story is weak and when you mercifully get to the end, you still have no answers. You still don't know why this privlidged, spoiled girl, has to commit suicide. You don't expect parents in the middle of crisis, one only child dead, the other a top student and amamzing boy, on trial for his life, to be caught in a flirtaous and ridiculous almost affair. Throwing in a litlle of the lawyer, who cares. I will never buy any of her books again. I hated it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"same old, same old","review":"I knew this book was going to be bad after the first few chapters.It was so predictable. I could have guessed that Emily was going to be pregnant as this story line is used in other lame books. Chris just creeped me out, I could almost feel my own skin crawl everytime he had sex with Emily and the sex scenes between the parents could have been copied from some cheap, sleazy porn magazine. There was no suspense, Chris killing Emily was a given and to get the not guilty verdict was just laughable.If I could give this book no stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a real page turner but had a very disappointing ending. I felt that Miss Picoult could have done so much more with this story. It had the potential for so many twists. I was beginning to think that Chris and Em were brother and sister since it seemed as though Michael Gould and Gus might have been close in the past since they seemed drawn together by this trial and Michael said that he was testifying for Chris. And, that maybe Em found out and it may have devasted her more to be pregnant by her own brother! But it turned out there were no twists and the ending was totally boring. This is my second novel by this author and I won't be reading any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fast read, but not believable","review":"This book entertained me - I won't lie. I read through it quickly and wanted to find out what happened in the end. But then, I was thoroughly disappointed. Without spoiling the ending for others, the book is completely implausable. Chris' explanation of what happened the night his girlfriend died is absolutely ridiculous. Further, the jury's finding, at the end of the case, is highly unlikely.This is the second Jodi Piccault book I have read - I read Vanishing Acts too - and I preferred Vanishing Acts because at least, the story was logical. I don't think I would pick up another Jodi Piccoult book, however, because she isn't a great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment at end!!","review":"I expected something more at the end of book when we \\"found out\\" what really happened, it just seemed so.... so, I don't know even know what but just not what I expected. On a separate note, it was a bit bothersome to have the author use the Lord's name in vain sooooooooooooooo many times and often with laced with profanity. I think she should perhaps be a little more thoughtful to people of the Christian faith and how over the top her use of it was. Maybe next time she use a profanity using buddha, confuscious, etc., etc., Just saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I am so disappointed after finishing this book. None of my questions were answered and not in the good way where it's left to your imagination. The characters are superficial. We never get beneath the surface with any of them and least of all Emily. I feel I knew Emily the least and that is the character I really wanted, and felt I should, know deep down. So many aspects are hard to believe. I really wanted to like this book and thought I did while I was reading it but for it to be so heart wrenching and then come out with nothing is really frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I agree with other reviewers who were disappointed with this book. Although it was beautifully written, I felt cheated, ripped off, and let down at the end. The plot was not sufficiently developed through to the end. There were too many blanks to be filled in, too many loose ends, too much left unsaid and undone. There was far too much drama and not enough substance. I think it's fine to leave a few things in an ambiguous state at the end of a novel, to leave something to the reader's imagination, but c'mon, Picoult, FINISH THIS BOOK! Also, the storyline and dialogue during the trial got tedious and ridiculous. Was I, as the reader, supposed to feel any sympathy for Chris? I surely did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last of Picoult's books for me","review":"This is the fourth book by this author that I have read and I must say it will be the last. They all have been disappointingJody Picoult's books follow a formula: the controversial/shocking theme; the lawyers; the jail/prison (she dwells too much on this area) and the twisty, contrived endings.Enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"After hearing my mother and best girl friend rave about Jodi Picoult for YEARS, I finally picked up The Pact and decided to see what all the fuss was about.WOW- even with my expectations high, I loved this novel. The story of two childhood sweethearts and their saga of growing up in love was not only riveting but authentic, emotional, and impossible to put down! I stayed up until 2am just to know what would happen in later chapters.Although I have yet to read another Picoult book (I am sure I will read many!) I feel that this one was top-notch and a good recommendation for anyone looking for a profound, riveting story of young love and loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put the book down. Read it in two days.","review":"Jodi Picoult develops the characters so well that the reader becomes totally involved with the intriging story. You are curious about the characters; you cannot wait to discover the truth; the characters are on your mind when you have to put the book down. You will never forget them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing.","review":"I have been wondering why Jodi Picoult is so popular for some time now and never picked up any of her books. I read \\"The Pact\\" at the recommendation of a friend who said this was one of her better books and am regretting it.I almost always finish every book I start and this one was one of the hardest ones to finish. I kept waiting for the writing to get better, and for something to happen that was not already laid out. The corny dramatic endings of some of the sections were unbearable and the story dragged on. It felt like reading a bad script of a ho-hum episode of \\"Law and Order\\".I am glad that I have not wasted my time reading Picoult and will probably never pick up any of her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually love Jodi Picoult but.....","review":"I can honestly say that there aren't a whole lot of books I have read that I didn't like, but I did not like this book. I thought it was hard to get into it at first and when I finally did, I was just wanting the get through the book to be done with it. I usually really love Jodi Picoult's characters but in this book I didn't make that connection. To me it just seemed kind of boring. Even after I finished the book I wasn't exactly sure why she felt like her only option was suicide. My recommendation is to skip this book and read some of the other Jodi Picoult books instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mining other people's misery","review":"This seems to be a fictionalized telling of a murder that happened in Maryland 20 some years ago. We know Jodi Picoult can write - but she's weak in plot (My Sister's Keeper - the ending? The lawyer who has a grand mal seizure and is driving a sports car a couple hours later?) but it is rather soulless and completely parasitic to take the killing of a real live person and make a boo hoo novel out of it - even if we are 20 years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!!","review":"This was my first Jodi Picoult book and quite possibly my last. I found the first few chapters interesting enough to continue, but the book just seemed to drag on and on and on....In the end to propose the idea that a 17 year old boy would make a decision to assist his girlfriend with suicide is outrageous to say the least. The author suggests to the reader that he loved her enough to end her pain. You call that love? I call that stupidity. If as a reader you aren't aware that suicide is the \\"easy\\" way out, you surely aren't going to be corrected by Jody Picoult. I pray no one ever loves me the way Chris loved Emily, I'd rather have a man willing to call the suicide hotline any day. She wants us to believe that in a vivid stretch of the imagination it is beautiful. Please. She can't be serious.This sappy little so called love story had me wishing I hadn't wasted my time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Soap Opera only fit for Sob Sisters","review":"When you finish \\"The Pact\\" -- after you dry your eyes, catch your breath, and compose yourself -- take a minute to think back on the story and you'll realize \\"you've been had\\". The characters sketched in this book (and they are only just sketches) simply don't add up. The plot is completely manipulative and utterly implausible. I realize Jodi Picoult is a popular author with a faithful following, but if you insist on even a shred of intelligence in your reading material or in the characters you read about, this book is not for you. For a fully-realized and satisfying treatment of some broadly similar themes try Maeve Binchy's \\"Circle of Friends\\" instead. For courtroom drama, just watch an episode of \\"The Practice.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"uhhhh....NO","review":"my best friend absolutely loves picoult, so i decided to give her a try. the only thing i can say is \\"what publishing company gave permission to distribute this book?\\" maybe its not my cup of tea, but i could not stand \\"the pact\\"...i struggled through the first couple of chapters and eventually gave up after realizing that it would never get any better. i don't understand all the hype about jodi picoult's books...in my opinion, suburbanite American housewives need to find better forms of entertainment than reading this thoughtless boring trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pact.
