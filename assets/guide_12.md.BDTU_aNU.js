But this collection of all Phil's love songs has all of the songs I just listed. It has lots of other great love songs too like Can't Stop Loving You, You'll Be In My Heart, Please Come Out Tonight, and One More Night.

Long sealed off from the advancing society around them, the culture of the mountain people was forever changed by the explosive coal revolution.

This is the second to last film in which he has that infamous death scene which he shows the reluctance of the body to give up living (even if one is struck with three or more bullets) Sorry to dwell on the legend of Lee Marvin, if you want to know more about the overall movie or the quality of th DVD I politely sugest you seek out another review.

They are trained actors and if they can't bring themselves to study these roles and put themselves into the character than what is the use of their acting talents? William Hurt is am emotionless, bland, dispassionate actor who truly was the wrong choice for the role he played. He can't seem to keep a British accent going and he comes off sounding very American in some of the scenes which makes absolutely zero sense to me. The pace of the film is very slow, but the mystery factor of it is definitely there. I am a purist. I would have preferred Russian actors in this film. But if you're going to play a Russian character, then make it more believable. Otherwise, it doesn't work in my view.

It was confusing because at the begening Tom rides the train and controls it then in the middle he plans of making a candy store and tries to make it work and at the end he has a basket ball game which has nothing to do w/ the candy store . You would explain this book like a book that was going on the right track (like maybe a pretty dress) then after too many things get added ( like designers putting too many pathes on it) .

At the Academy Tom has to deal with the horible Father Rodriguez the superetient at the school.

As others have alluded, this is more of an autobiography than a book about the city or the culture. And a worthwhile autobiography it is not - I wasn't particularly impressed with the way the author chooses to live his life as a lazy unemployed slob while his wife struggles to make ends meet.I feel generous giving it two stars - the second star appearing mainly for the catchy title and the sporadic bits of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self absorbed","review":"Boring. Sean comes across as self absorbed, lazy and whiney. The laughs seem forced. The story meanders and doesn't seem to go anywhere or achieve anything. It's probably a personal preference, but I prefer my travel books to reveal some sort of journey - spiritual, emotional or physical, and this book is not one of them. Shallow and pointless.

I lived there and my two sons were born there, over 40 years ago. I am always homesick for Amsterdam and visit as often as I can. I wanted to enjoy this book for those reasons, but in fact I didn't. I was annoyed with the author's contemptuous, cynical attitude toward the city and the people. So I skipped through it, reading only a page or two, every 20 pages or so.The best I can say is that I did find some of the stories amusing and some of the satire grounded in recognizable truth, but the author's self-identified wastrel life style was off-putting. However, I'm now a grandmother and he is a young man. So perhaps if you are an urbane, cynical young person you might find the book amusing.

Yes, it does have a few editing errors, but they are only a little tarnish on what is essentially pure gold.Why do liberals hold onto a faith in something that has been proven wrong again and again throughout the whole twentieth century?

Installation was easy...looks nice, fairly solid etc..Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that when you turn it off, the handle has to be in the middle.

At others, melancholic, tugging at the tender parts of our heart that still holding sadness, it coaxes out soft tears from the hidden folds of our being, so we can heal.

The 1/4 also feels slightly nicer but also rougher along the edges and its uncomfortable on my ears. After only 2 days of having the cap the color is already starting to fade so I have to question its authenticity and if what I am buying online are quality products or just cheap knock offs.

The story starts out with ten year old Harvey Swick being persuaded to go to The Holiday House on a promise that all of his boredom will vanish. To his surprise, the house offers everything that was promised to him and much much more. The turning point of the book is when the truth is revealed and Harvey realizes that the house is actually evil and that for every day spent at the house, a year had gone by in the real world. The climax is when Harvey trys to fight back towards the house.I recommend this book to everyone. Although this book was aimed for children, it is liked by adults as well as children. This book can teach valuable lessons that should be with children and adults also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids!","review":"Clive Barker has done it again.

It is compulsively readable, and with its short chapters, you'll find yourself hurrying through it to find out what happens next. Clive Barker is doubtlessly one of the most important writers in our times, and this work is just further testament to his growing string of successes."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the best book I ever read!","review":"I loved this book!

This is written in a plain, straightforward manner, making it an easy read that intrigues you from the very first paragraph."},{"rating":"2","title":"students mesmerized by Thief of Always","review":"As a 5th grade teacher, I read to my students every day. It is a constant search for books that will keep my students'attention. The Thief of Always holds them spellbound and there are no distractions when I am reading this book. It is magical and the lessons it teaches are many. High School students still claim it as their favorite and many own their own copies.

She recommended it to me and since we have similar reading tastes, I expected it to be pretty good but it was just weird.

Because it's a good, solid story - fable, actually, as the subtitle suggests - that can keep me entertained for a little while as this great gray month plods on. The story of young Harvey Swick is what we wished our childhoods could have been. It is enveloped in magic and mystery and acts of heroism. We are reminded, however, that fantasy is only a nice place to visit. Those who stay are no longer truly human, and eventually we must give them up - give up our childhoods, really - if we are ever to truly grow. Read this to your kids, if you have them. It's written in a style that is perfect for storytelling, with interesting voices and short chapters to get the little ones to sleep faster.... *grin*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Upset. Its a comic version.","review":"Well, I got this for myself for Christmas last year and was upset to find that it is not my beloved childhood memory... it is a comic book... graphic novel... and I decided to write this review because Christmas is here again and I still want the REAL thief of always.

So that is why it got 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clive Barker at his best","review":"Do really great stories have something in common?Perhaps that is a generic question, but a fair assumption would be that the stories that get into our hearts and stay there for the rest of our days are stories we can really relate to.The Thief of Always is about something everybody can relate to - the process of growth. The Thief of Always is about the metamorphical change that occurs when we go from being children to being adults, it more than hints at how the precious untainted hearts and souls of children can be threatened by a horror beyond the comprehension of most adults.Right up there alongside Stephen King's The Eyes of the Dragon, The Thief of Always tells us a great story about what being human and growing up is all about.It is perhaps Clive Barker's best short story - not just for hardcore horror freaks, The Thief of Always is a great experience for all ages and all walks of life.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My FAVORITE Book!","review":"This book was just AWESOME! I had actually seen it on television, saying something about Clive Barker doing the artwork in it. I found it in my local library and just could NOT put it down.

However, the reason for my rating is primarily its lack of progressive plot. While this stagnancy is probably due to the time-frame (one day) over which the book takes place and its stream-of-conscious-style points of view, any innovation attempted in Ulysses loses its appeal with the following consideration: a man hailed as a literary genius seems to have focused more on showing off his intellect (like the Stephen in Ulysses) than on creating a readable and interesting piece of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"video serves a purpose, but...","review":"AFter having read Joyce's novel, I thought that seeing a movie version of it would be interesting.

Couldn't it get the rights to West's 1993 \\"Greek Lyric Poetry\\" at least (also published by Oxford)? More disconcertingly, we get an English Empedocles here of the vintages 1880 and 1898. Most of the major poets fare better, but Sophocles' \\"Antigone\\" is in H.R. Fairclough and A.T. Murray's 1902 Wardour Street (\\"didst thou\\") version.With no reservations, I can declare this a very poorly conceived anthology. Anyone would do better to buy up a bunch of good translations in used paperbacks.If you absolutely had to have an anthology, I'm not sure what is best, but \\"The Norton Book of Classical Literature,\\" ed.

Both are in the movie, ROC being when Batou was heading to the store to pick up dog food, and FM being the end song.The rest, with vocals, are somber, multiple chorus singers, but they make the songs fit well. There are three different renditions of the beginning theme throughout the CD, which I enjoyed most. Both Doll House tracks also make it enjoyable, if you like creepy yet cool orchestrated music, which was playing when, well, Batou and Togusa entered The Doll House.I would buy this CD, but then again I am a hardcore Ghost in the Shell fan and I love all kinds of music.

His last two books have sought to make a mockery of the young men who won WWII. He wrote a very good book \\"Thank God For The Atom Bomb\\" and an OK book on WWI and its effect on Western memory. This book is dull and in reality little more than a short story fit for Harpers or The Nation. Basically we won the war on the backs of 15 years olds and almost despite our disorganized selves. At least I think this is the author's point. The writing is muddy and I came away unsure of what he was really driving at except all the G.I.'s were poor stupid dupes. From what I have read here his most recent book continues the theme of the US soldier as inept coward. He can rail against cruel fate all he wants but he can't change his ultimate destination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"The title of this book and the actual text do not match.

There is a very selective use of fact in a number of places in this book, leading in some cases to absurd conclusions. Like Fusell thinks the destruction of European Jewry was caused by Hitler's need for Lebensraum. Where in God's Great Left Field did that come from? His presentation and commentary on desertion, sobriety, whoring,implies that American Infantrymen in World War II were more criminal than German infantrymen in world war II.This book is an insult to millions of Americans who fought and died in Europe in WWII.

I looked forward to the book as something different, the story of the 18 to 20 year olds in the Infantry in Europe in 1944-45.Thats not what the book is about.It is a general review of the war in Europe that has litle new information, almost no specific stories of young G I's.Fussell must have written it on a week end and pulled general information from the WEB.To be fair the mismanagement by Gen Hodges in throwing Division after Division into the Hurtgen Forest with massive casualities is clearly spelled out. Hodges should have been removed from command. He failed to lead properly in the Hedgerows of Normandy. Hurtgen Forrest and in the Bulge.That would havwe made a better book.My favorite book on the Infantry is Visions from a foxhole, a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest generation was not that great.","review":"Since the late 1990s, people have romantized the generation that fought WWII. Fussell doesn't dispel that notion, but puts a dose of reality in this crusade against Nazism and militarism. mong the young soldiers who fought WWII were cowards, criminals, people who shot themselves, and deserters. Many of our soldiers were heroes, but this generation included the usual people found in any population. Fussell gives us the lowdown on this Greatest Generation. The soldiers who fought WWII were young men just entering the world. They made their share of mistakes on the battlefield like everyone else. They were not superhumans, but average people put into a difficult situation.This is a great short read. I would hope people who have fallen in love with the concept of the Greatest Generation should read this book to temper their outlook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic incidents from WWII in Europe","review":"This is not really a narrative or a story but rather a series of well written incident descriptions.

I was struggling to remove grout with a small grout removing saw and utility knife. When I tried this I was amazed at how much easier it was, and still a hand tool. It doesn't require a lot of pressure as all the pressure goes into one point, not spread over a length of saw blade.

It has definitely improved my attitude about this job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the saws!","review":"I was skeptical of this when I saw it online, but I have quite a lot of grout to remove and was not having much success with the two grout saws I had. After reading the reviews I decided it was worth a try. It works much better than the saws - it seems much sharper than the saw blades. The handle is well made to allow you to grip it easily. I also liked the fact that the blade is double sided. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that the screw holding the cutting edge kept coming loose. Even after I found an allen wrench of the correct size I still had to tighten the screw repeatedly. But, without this I'd probably be still sawing grout.

We tried it out by placing some little princesses inside, they fit but it was clear that you wouldn't be able to move them around and do any kind of immaginative play with them utilizing the roomes. We returned it and bought the teamson princess castle - more expensive but well worth it plus comes with figurines and furniture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hit of the Party","review":"I gave this beautiful castle to my granddaughter on her 3rd birthday, with the accompanying furniture, family, and horses. She had been opening gifts and hurrying on to the next one, but after opeing the castle, she just wanted to stop and play with it.If your child uses a lot of imagination in their play, he/she will enjoy the many different ways to express themselves with this toy, and if they are not into imaginative play yet, this castle can certainly encourage many opportunities.The construction was better than expected, but as a rule, I am not disappointed by Melissa and Doug products."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my best purchases in years!","review":"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter's birthday. Not only does she love it, but my 1,3,6, and 10 year old daughters play with it also. Very well built/durable and just the right size. I thought it might be small - but was pleaseantly surprised. An excellent item that is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pretty, very durable","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old and 4 year old, castle crazy daughters. They love to play with and it is so durable I don't worry about them being too rough. I know most girls play with their princesses with this toy but until we get some that are the right size, thye have been using their Littlest Pet Shop animals! Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fold Up Castle","review":"This a wonderful gift for a little girl. It is even a little baetter than the fold up doll house I bought at Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality wood castle","review":"My 4 year old and 2 year old are both enjoying this castle. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with any dolls or furnishings so you have to purchase those separately. We have the Melissa & Doug castle doll playset, some Disney princess figurines, and some furniture from Playmobil. These seem to work well but I really wish they would include the dolls and furniture. The kids have played with it every day since they got it though so it's a hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the little girls squealed","review":"I can still hear the squeals of the 3 and 6 year old granddaughters as they opened the castle.

They mostly use play characters of miniature disney princesses and happy meal toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for two years","review":"I bought this for my daughters who are now 4 and 6. The received it for Christmas and were overjoyed when they opened the box! It remains one of our most loved toys and is always a hit when friends come to play. My girls still play with it more often than other toys. I agree that the rooms are small, but my kids don't care at all and it is fun watching them improvise. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged before sent.","review":"It wasn't the product...it came damaged. The top of one \\"fixed\\" tower was splintered right off. It didn't happen in shipping because the shrink wrapping around the whole castle was in perfect shape. No time to send back and wait for an exchange for this is for Christmas. Did some glueing to the broken pieces and made it look o.k.,but this product was pricey. All in all, the castle is adorable and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Splintery edges","review":"I just opened shrink wrap on the castle and was sad to find that all the edges were very splintery. Most edges on the castle are roughly cut with no sanding so there are jagged splinters hanging off all over. at first i considered just sanding the edges myself but realized it was a problem through the entire castle. It is unsafe for a young child to play with.It is also not put together well. Two wood panels that are glued together are cracked apart on my castle. The design is adorable but I am extremely disappointed with the quality. I expected more from this brand, and price."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP","review":"This castle is incredibly cheap.

As noted in other reviews, the hinges were broken upon arrival, in my case the wood split where the hinges are screwed into the wood. There were also a couple other places that broken loose. I was able to fix it all with some wood glue rather easily. As long as this thing isn't moved around a lot, I think it will hold up fine, but it definitely too heavy for the weak hinges/thin wood combination.But otherwise, its very cute and provides lots of entertainment for the kids. My daughters use all sorts of dolls and my son gets in on the act with his animals and superheroes, etc...I would be more disappointed in the construction quality if I had paid full price, so keep that in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome castle","review":"This castle is awesome!

The second one showed up from UPS with the same issue. Although we never even opened the second one and it was well padded in the box, the wood was broken with the hinge not even in the wood. My daughter is bummed as we have not seen another castle. Finally, as another person wrote, the openings in this doll house are very tiny! Disappointed and I love Melissa and Doug products,.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap material and quality, not sure why it had such a high rating","review":"We bought this as a gift and found cracks all over the place. The castle was built by \\"plywood\\" not \\"solid wooden\\", and the worst part is the quality of wood glue they use. I know we can probably ask Amazon for refund or return but that's not the point, especially when you get it right before Xmas and there is no time to do anything without having to break some little one's heart.Please see my photos:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/moZGJVFRUR5YKA/B000NKH0E6/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2PKN7L8OYEMH9/B000NKH0E6/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_linkhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1KG0VU7ABVZSA/B000NKH0E6/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, sturdy castle... but the \\"room\\" are a bit small","review":"My three year old has been very interested in doll houses lately, and my husband found this beautiful castle! It is very well put built (I'd expect no less from Melissa and Doug). The Disney \\"figure set\\" princesses fit perfectly so we didn't buy any dolls, though some of the dolls with the bigger skirts don't fit in some of the passages. Unfortunately the rooms are very small, almost unusable in many ways. My MIL bought her the \\"castle furniture\\" meant for the doll house, and you can't really put it in these rooms. Mostly she just opens the castle to play, and puts the furniture in front of it (or in what you might call the \\"courtyard\\"). Overall we're very happy, I just wish the rooms and passages were slightly larger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, but Poorly Made","review":"When this castle arrived it was everything the good reviews said it was; beautiful, folded up nicely, and kept my 4 year old daughter busy for a long while. However, after a week of light play, for a child who takes care of her toys, the wood started chipping and peeling off. I mean, she could have gotten a terrible splinter. So very disappointing!!! I would not recommend it now. It is too bad because it really does have nice features and it is very pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Review","review":"I love that this is wooden and not plastic like some of the other castles avaliable. It is large and appears quite durable. I agree with other reviewers that you will likely not need furniture and that small dolls or other princess toys like safari or papo figures are the perfect size. Lovely coloring and well played with by my daughters (and son who uses his papo knight figures)."},{"rating":"2","title":"mediocre workmanship","review":"It is a nice little castle and my daughter loves it. It is the perfect size for 3\\" princess figurines.My complaint is on the build quality. overall I would rate the build quality as \\"just okay.\\" The hinge that holds the two halves of the castle together is pulling apart right out of the box. The castle itself is made up of some type on engineered wood like a plywood. The hinge is only anchored into one layer of the plywood and that layer is pulling away from the rest of the castle. The operation of the drawbridge seems unreliable as well.Other than those two problems the rest of the construction does seem reasonably solid. I would still recommend it, but I don't think \\"melissa and doug\\" products are as good as they once were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but the hinge came right out when it was opened for the first time!","review":"Very sad that it is already broken! We just took it out of the plastic today and when we opened it up for the first time the hinges came out of the wood. Really disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"We were delighted with the Melissa & Doug Wooden folding castle. It is well made, attractive, and SUPER value for money. It folds out, and there are two towers which are not attached. My daughter likes to move these around adding another element of play. A bridge is included that can connect the two towers. The painting style is attractive, and with the pink it does add a wow factor for most little girls. I can't think of any other brand that compete with this, in price or construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Year Old Daughter Loves, Loves, Loves this set!","review":"I read many reviews but was hesitant that my five year old might be too old.

Excellent set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite after a whole year!","review":"My 4 year old got this for Christmas last year and is sitting here playing quietly with it today, almost a whole year later! It still looks as new as the day she got it and has been played with on a daily basis. She absolutely loves it! We got both doll sets that go with it and the furniture.

The item came shrink wrapped in a sturdy box. I did not open the shrink wrap but on inspecting it from the outside, I saw quite a few edges that looked rough and easy enough to get splinters from while playing. There were a couple of places that the product was already nicked. Unfortunately, this is on the front side of the castle. So I'm hoping I can exchange this for another piece instead and fewer issues. There was also something rattling and I'm not sure if it comes with any loose pieces.That said, the castle is well made. It is really pretty and we are going to either go with the Disney characters or the Calico critters. Those critters are cute!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking off one star because","review":"someone should have sanded down all the edges before sending this out. There were little splinters on each edge that we had to eventually sand out ourselves. But it's a very cute castle. My daughter LOVES it and she learns how to use her imagination with it.

This was a great find (and at a great price). Warning: the Melissa and Doug doll house furniture are really too big for this. SOLUTION: The Playmobil stuff,Royal Bedroom #4253 by Playmobilfor instance, is PERFECT. They have several rooms meant to extend the Playmobil castle that fit nicely as additions to this castle (we have the kitchenRoyal Kitchen). All the playmobil stuff goes in a box, the castle folds shut, and the whole thing can go in the closet when my daughter is not playing with it. Yippie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Openings are not small: they are tiny","review":"The castle is very cute and girly. I bought some play mobile furniture as suggested by another reviewer and some of the items are too big to get into the room openings. My daughter is just about three and cannot get the furniture in and out; most of the items sit out infront of the castle. I wish that I had purchased a different house with more spacious rooms (or several usable rooms). It is large, well made, and pretty; however it is not practical for the pretend play that I had in mind when I made this purchase. Most of the space available will not hold the play mobile sets (which are small) and just don't serve any purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had it for 3 months and she's played with it EVERY SINGLE DAY","review":"We got this for our girl's 3rd birthday.

The bulk of this book deals with what the author ate and when he slept and how much he missed his wife. The actual battle descriptions are rushed through, sometimes in two or three sentences, while the author's personal daily routine goes on and on for pages. It is interesting to note that although the HMS Safari is touted as one of England's most deadly subs, the majority of it's sinkings were of small craft and schooners by gun action. Even enemy ships which ran themselves aground to escape being torpedoed are counted by the Brits as tonnage sunk! Overall, I couldn't wait for this book to end.

This version is just a replica of the original books and does not include the full text as heard on the audiobook. Then I found the version I wanted, subtitled \\"Translated by Mark Twain\\" and it, like the audiobook version, is really something special. To anyone interested in these wonderful \\"first family\\" stories, I recommend searching for the Fair Oaks Press edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diaries","review":"The Diaries of Adam and Eve is a great book for pleasure reading or for research. It isn't as well known as some of Twain's other works, but it displays his amazing wit and sense of humor. Adam is a couch potato, while Eve is a stereotypical chatterbox. The book is set up as a series of diary entries by both Adam and Eve. These entries tell the creation story in a fresh, amusing way. Twain may have been influenced by Milton's epic poem \\"Paradise Lost.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty","review":"I bought this book because it was referenced in another book I read. I found the book to be witty and humorous. It's a fun and short read, thats great for a train or before sleep.The diary entries alternate between Adam and Eve and deal with subjects like intimacy, talking (in Eve's case talking too much), and sexual roles (why does Adam name everything?)Some of the entries were a little dry (hence the 4 stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slamming the Doll House","review":"It's a sad thing when a memoir causes you to dislike the author.

I agree with the other reviewers who say that there is no depth or reflection here. It is quite a catalogue of woes, and there is a sincerity and honesty in the telling. But.... As a piece of writing, it is not at all distinguished, and there is not much nourishment as in something left to reflect on, observations worth mulling over, whether in agreement or disagreement. It is, sadly, like some of the worst celebrity autobiogs on the shelves.

While the account of her early years makes for decent reading, Ms.Bloom's glaring lack of learning and GROWTH from her failed relationships with men is disturbing, even angering to read. Despite a brief sentence or two of some insight on how abandonment by her father led to her disasterous choices, a few pages later she crushes any \\"hoorah-FINALLY\\" the reader might feel when she again meets with the clearly disturbed misogynist Roth after their terrible divorce, and allows him to abuse her yet again.

But, surprising as it may seem, the warriors are marked by their rarity, Jim Kasler is a WARRIOR.Having been a POW with Jim and being an aviator (Navy) I can verify that this account is reliable, factual and even handed. It doesn't try to tell any one else's story but Jim's own. It is not a revisionist history. It pulls no punches. It tells it like it is (was).

This CD has become a favorite because it is filled with \\"personal anthems\\" that I sing throughout my day. I listen to it on the way to work, at my desk, and on my way home. Yes, it's that awesome! Get this CD - it will be a blessing to your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise and Worship at its finest","review":"A friend of mine turned me on to this cd and it truly ministered to my soul!

If you are looking for a great gospel, praise and worship and/or prophetic word, purchase this CD. I feel the presence of the Lord moving and every time I listen to this CD I am brought to tears.

You will truly be blessed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GLORIOUS","review":"Up until a few months ago, I had never heard of Martha Munizzi, how I'm not sure. I certainly thought my music collection was up to date. God is so great, because He allowed a sister from church to suggest this cd to me. To convince me to purchase it-she allowed me to borrow it for a few days. I was/still am simply blown away by the power and grace of Mrs. Munizzi's voice. From the first song to the last, I sang, laughed, danced, rejoiced, cried and more than anything praised God. The Lord is so beautiful and its evident in the anointing He has placed on Martha Munizzi. I can't help but tell everyone I know about her, get the cd, you will be blessed. I pray that the Lord will continue to prosper and move Ms. Munizzi and her family (husband who's also awesome) into the lives of many-there is deliverance in this music. If you are wondering if you should by this CD-buy it you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, perfect resource.","review":"I ordered this for my dh for Christmas and he LOVES it.

On a sliding scale from mesomorph to endomorph I've always fallen between the two but closer to endomorph. I ordered both a medium and a large jacket based on the sizing comments in other reviews. If I was at my optimum weight of 185 - 190lbs the medium would be an excellent fit (I plan to get back there so I'm keeping the medium). The medium still fits but at my current weight it looks like a fat guy wearing a jacket that's a tad small. The large fits great! So, if you are built like me (~5'10\\" and packing 30 extra lbs) the large jacket will work well for you.The jacket is well made. The zipper could keep a gorilla in its cage and the material used in its construction is heavy. I'm very satisfied with this jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad service for return","review":"Unfortuneately, the vendor and I had a difficulty with the description of the item, and what I received.

The nature of my negative review prompted them to offer a return acceptance of the item if I would remove the negative review. I advised that I could not alter the facts.

The problem is that it's so realistic they kept the huge fit of the real military version. I wear a size large or a slim XL, and I took the advice of ordering a size smaller and got a medium. It was still too large though. I lost about 7 pounds this last semester and it no longer fits me, so when I came back from school I gave it to my younger (larger) brother and it fits him great. I don't know why anyone would lead anything larger than a size large. I would strongly suggest ordering at least 2 sizes smaller than what you wear. I'm a large guy (6'2, 188 lbs) and I will have to order another, size small as the medium was too big.

And the look is classic. I love it. This will definitely last a lonnnnnnnng time. The only draw back is the sizing. It is so big. I bought a medium even though I usually wear a large but I think I should have bought a small. Even with the liner (sold separately) it is still huge. I kept it because me and my husband can both share it. But in the event he claims this one, I'm buying a small or maybe an extra small if they have it.So in case anyone reading this doesn't get the point, buy 2 sizes DOWN from what you normally wear!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great M-65 Replica but WAAAAAY too big.","review":"It's a nice M-65 type jacket but it's massive. The sleeves are a good 6 inches past the tips of my fingers. I had to roll the sleeves back quite a bit. I think that I could have gotten away with a medium on this jacket.

I couldn't help but chuckle over this sweet grandfatherly type man, with no interest in women whatsoever, trying to avoid her advances.I enjoyed seeing and learning about the World's Fair through the eyes of the characters.

Plan on re-applying one to two hours again after first application because this scent does not go the distance. White flowers are like that and this is a white flower perfume all the way.

It smells like you're in a makeup room where you powder your nose. Also this scent is more of a grandma scent in my honest opinion. I'm 19 years old and that's what I think of with this perfume. I think it's a bit too strong and mature for younger girls. I don't think guys will be attracted to the scent (At least not in my age group). This is my honest opinion and I hope I can help someone from spending their money and regretting it (like me). From now on I'm just going to buy perfumes at stores AFTER I smell them.

Not just Amazon.Fragrances bought online DO NOT smell anything like the ones bought in store. Why? I have no clue. But that has been my sad experience for the last few months. Disappointment after disappointment. Money and time spent and lost.Yes, it is cheaper than buying in store, but the trade off just isn't worth it for me. All the money wasted on 4 bottles would have been sufficient for one at the store that I wouldn't be disappointed with.If you've never used a fragrance before buying it online, you probably won't notice the difference. But If you have, as I have been, using White Diamonds for years, this has been such a headache! It just does not smell the same as the one bought in store.

The directions were wrong to two of them (I lost about two hours at one, just driving around trying to find the trailhead). The third one, when I finally reached it, was not exactly what I would call a waterfall. I think this writer needs some lessons in how to write a guidebook. The book appears to be self-published (it's full of photographs of the author's friends, the layout is so garish it looks like it was done by a third-grader, and it is loaded with misspellings and bad punctuation). I read somewhere that this was supposed to be a \\"coffee-table\\" style guidebook... what a laugh. Don't waste your money on this one.

It only works on airforce delta strike or unless there is another game that is compatible.

You get stable set-and-forget throttle control, and one hand controls all 3 axes of motion. But it's plug and *almost* play -- it is severely out of calibration by default and requires recalibration every time you power cycle the game machine. After just a few hours of play the cheap internal trimpots got tired and I started getting unsmooth/erratic motion over the full range, making calibration a frustrating and finally impossible task. Also the stick has a huge amount of play that isn't helped a lot with center position calibration. For the price I didn't expect a lot but the unsmooth motion was a big disappointment. Bottom line, I will not be wasting my time on a flight stick from this price/quality level in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not Logitech's fault the joystick isn't supported by more games","review":"Blame the game developers for not programming their games to use the joystick. I have a lot of fun with Airforce Delta Strike using the stick, and I find it tragic that no other PS2 flight sim supports it... or any flight stick for that matter. I can't guess as to why, but I suppose all my other flight sims will be played on a PC (anybody want a copy of Ace Combat 4?). At least I know that no one will be trying to get this stick from me, since it's pretty difficult to find the only game you can play with it... and no, I won't be parting with mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOSHIBA 27A45 HAS MANUFACTURING DEFECT","review":"GREAT PICTURE UNTIL about 40 days of using this TV it went completely DEAD.

It was very presumptuous for the authors to attempt this story with apparently as little research as they did.This book is riddled with errors that a good read through the original would have rectified. Errors in ages, names, positions, family connections and character dispositions are scattered throughout the book, and each new chapter seems to bring another. These errors are jarring and distracting, and detract greatly from the story itself.The story itself, with many twists and turns, and familiar characters interwovern with new, is quick moving. It is mainly a plot story, less focused on character development than Pride and Prejudice.I would heartily recommend that one pass on reading this book if one considers the details important, or if one has read the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"who is lady susan?","review":"The book starts out well following the story almost to a \\"T\\". I belive that it might be a toleratable book had they had Darcy's mothers name right. Her name was Ann not Susan.

Basically if you have read Pride and Predjice you have read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presumptuous","review":"The first page of this book reinforced my belief that no one should attempt to reproduce Jane Austen's writing style. The cumbersome results always sound as if they were written by Mr. Collins. Presumption: An Entertainment is no exception.

It would be that simple if the right person chose to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-candy for the uncritical","review":"How I wish I'd gotten this used! Its appeal must be to those who crave regency romances, no matter how superficial or awkward.

I agree with the editorial reviewer who said that it is a restatement of the P&P plot with different characters. What fan of P&P would believe what the authors tell us happens to Caroline Bingley and Mary Bennet? Both were totally out of JA's character creation. It just doesn't make sense. I love the idea of a sequal to P&P because I want to know more and more about the characters, especially Georgiana, but this was not even close to what would have happened had JA written it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissident voice","review":"Perhaps I am alone in thinking that Presumption is a fitting title to this horrible work. However, I have conferred with a Jane Austen scholar and several ladies in my JASNA chapter and realize, I am not alone. It is presumption indeed to expand upon anything a GREAT novelist has written and insulting to even categorize this book as comparable. I was disappointed by this book, to say the least, and appalled at the content. It was forced in style and phrasing, thin on plot and characterization, and certainly did not capture the laugh out loud irony which characterizes Austen's work. Jane Austen masterfully captured the irony and wit of pre-Victorian English society. No amount of research or clever phrasing can replace talent. My suggestion to Ms. Barett is that she stick with what she knows (as Jane Austen herself did) and leave Jane Austen books alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"an exercise in futility","review":"A futile attempt by the author to continue wonderful story by Jane Austen. It is perhaps a little ungracious to say that this is a terrible book, lacking warmth and insight into the hearts of minds of all the principal characters of Pride and Prejudice. Julia Barrett is better off writing a new book with fresh ideas and characters instead of writing a sequel to Pride and Prejudice. An exercise in futility indeed !"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read","review":"This is the first sequel to P&P that I've read. I was slightly skeptical, but based on the other reviews, I expected a decent story. And I wasn't disappointed. It's certainly not from the pen of Jane Austen, but the author does a fair job of capturing Jane's spirit and style. Some of the characters, particularly Lady Catherine de Bourgh, are exaggerated and come across as caricatures of their original counterparts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The author has obviously done her research, right down to the stolen-lace incident involving Aunt Phillips that actually happened to Jane's own aunt--that was fun to discover. I'm on to more P&P sequels now--but Presumption has set a pretty high standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fitting or particularly entertaining sequel","review":"If you want to read about Elizabeth and Darcy, this isn't the book for you. As a Jane Austen fan and a fan of the A&E movie with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, I was very disappointed in the book. The focus of the book is on Darcy's sister Georgiana, and Lizzie and Darcy take a back seat to her romantic wanderings. If she has learned much from Elizabeth, as stated in the final chapter in Pride and Prejudice, it isn't evident here. The authors also drag the poor Bennets through even more mud than Lydia's elopement did. The best part of the book is what happened to Caroline Bingley; a fitting end for the snobbish sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended to Jane Austen fans","review":"Those of you who have read Pride an Prejudice and are excited to find a sequel to the book, I suggest you forget about this one. I expected this book to focus on the lives of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy but this is too focused on Georgiana. Elizabeth is missing for more than half of the book and it doesn't go into details. For example, in Pride and Prejudice, it tells how Mr. Darcy is falling in love with Elizabeth while Presumption doesn't even explain how James Leigh-Cooper falls in love with Georgiana. He just says he has loved her from when they first met. If you're a Jane Austen fan I recommend you not to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Varies from Austen's implications","review":"While Presumption is true to Jane Austen in many respects, there are too many errors and recharacterizations. Though this is a sequel to Pride and Prejudice, the author(s) spend little time on the main characters. Elizabeth is fearful of meeting Darcy's mentor and life-long friend, which is hardly likely considering her fearlessness in P&P. The novel focuses on Georgiana, who seems to be rather uninteresting. I suppose it is fitting that she ends up with someone equally dull..... The whole idea of marrying below one's station was already canvased in P&P, making it a bit redundant. Those who are well aquainted with Jane Austen are better off not reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shedding Light on georgiana","review":"It is amusing and sheds a whole different light on Georgiana, Jane and Elizabeth. I have a new perspective of how Jane and Elizabeth would be concerned about their new roles as new wives and mistresses of impressive households. I enjoy most things that shed light on Georgiana. It had me guessing somewhat until the end. I had inklings here and there but it was still surprising. Let's just say Caroline, Caroline Bingley....aaahh"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING LIKE JANE AUSTEN!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is nothing like that of Jane Autens. I was sadly disapointed in finding that the ending was rushed and that the book was not focused on the main plot (in fact most of the book is focused on the side plots or some tiny detail that was not at all important to the book) The main character was not really the \\"main character\\" because the author wrote about what many of the other characters (less important) were thinking and feeling. It also felt like the author was as dull in reading it as I was, for she rushed the ending and seemed like she was glad to have finished the book. She should have left it alone and let Pride and Prejudice rest with the happy thoughts of all faithful Jane Austen fans. I strongly sugest that you do not get this book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Presumption....better not","review":"I love Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, and I like the fact there there can be many interpretations to the ending. This was not one of the endings I would have considered and do not find interesting in the least. The reviewers said it was funny... but I dont see why...and really deserves about 1 1/2 stars, but since it is coming from such a great story I had to give it the extra 1/2 point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea poor execution","review":"I felt that while the concept of the book was good, it was poorly developed and didn't flow. The end completely took me off guard. I felt that the writer got tired at the end and instead of creating a proper ending, just shoved something together so she could finish.Too many of the characters did things that were out of character. The writing style was Austen like, but I would have prefered reading sequels that are perhaps less Austen like in style and more Austen like in spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"(attempted) style and no substance","review":"At first glance this book about Georgiana Darcy appears to follow in the Austen style. The author tries to capture the witty writing, she attempts to remain faithful to the familiar characters while introducing new ones of the same fashion, and she fills her story with the little intrigues and romances that all manage to tie into one another in the end. However, PRESUMPTION was disappointingly lacking in sophistication and heart. The story operated on only one level so it wasn't much more than a period romance. The characterizations were a bit flat so I never felt any real warmth towards Barrett's Darcys, Bennets, and Bingleys or any real interest in their new friends and enemies. All in all, this book felt tedious even though it was a fast read. Perhaps it was too fast a read because there wasn't anything to make you stop and think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good effort to duplicate the one and only Jane Austen","review":"this was the first Pride and Prejudice sequal I have ever read and I thought it was pretty good. My hopes for it were high, since Pand P is my favorite book. The style was very much in keeping with Jane Austen, especially Lady Catherine, who remained very much herself. I thought it ended a little quickly, though - maybe a coouple more chapters so that we understand more how Georgiana fell in live with James Leigh-Cooper. Heyward was a perfect scoundrel. Elizabeth was still very witty and perspective. I hear that Letters From Pemberly by Jane Dawkins is supposed to be very good - all the reviews were five stars so I'm checking that one out next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"I am quite a Jane Austen fan and have enjoyed a few of the attempts made by modern authors to finish her uncompleted novels; but I really don't have one good thing to say about this book. It's a mess. Don't waste your money or your time. If you want a really great completion of one of Austen's novels that captures her wit and style, try to find The Watsons, by John Coates (1958). It is hard to find, but worth the search."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I like the measuring cup for it's markings, weight & ease of pouring.

Jimmy the Robot does a good job filling the sound void of a Prince Adam-less Aquabats by dropping his own sax and focusing on his brilliant synth's and keyboarding.More emphasis has been placed on the already strong backing vocals of the band, with heavy 'whoa-ing', gang vocals, and echoing, which give the album a rich delicious sound.And surprise! Some upbeats surface! Find them yourself, it's a pleasant treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed!","review":"As a fan of the first few aquabats albums, I faithfully bought \\"Charge!\\" hoping it would have the same great sound, however it did not. Much to my dismay I found that the aquabats had done away with ALL of their horns and replaced them with a synthasizer! Personally I think this new synth is too dominant in their new music and is just odd sounding. So if you're into that weird techno punk stuff, I guess you might want this but if you are a real ska fan or old aquabats fan try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uhm...","review":"The horns are gone... who cares? Instead of putting out another album that was a clone of their previous attempts, The Aquabats were able to use their new sound to create a very catchy album that is a nice addition to their discography. Seeing as how their first album came out about a decade ago, I think it's only fair to expect a little change over time (and when the change is this good, embrace it). (!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Aquabats album ever!!!","review":"I've been a huge fan for 5 years, and this is the first Aquabats album to completely floor me in it's complete awesomeness from start to finish!!! This is the most stellar mix of tight songwriting and awesome musicianship that I have ever heard from any band. The songs are consistent and arent' as jokey as their previous albums. Not that I have a problem with that, but hopefully this disc will gain them some much-deserved mainstream popularity, and dare I say--radio play?!! My favorite track is \\"Look at Me (I'm a Winner)!\\", which kinda sums up this album--a winner that must be heard to be believed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes me wonder if this world is plastic....","review":"Im not the greatest fan of the Aquabats, i knew 5 or 6 old songs and they were pretty good. This album is very different, theres less trumpets, its more rocky (not to the extent of actually being rock music though) and dare i say it, a hint of angst creeps in?Most of the songs on this album are very good. Instrumentally less complex but keeping to the same formula of singing, the aquabats have conjoured up catchy tunes that are also well rounded songs. Fashion Zombies is a great start to the album, the singing style perfectly complimenting the bouncy background. In fact, apart from 'Meltdown' which i could take or leave, this is a very solid album.The album isnt for everyone as the lyrics may prove to be too repetitive for some (look at me look at me look at me, im a winner, im a winner!) but its great if youre an aquabats fan or generally like a ska singing stylei personally think this album is great, i hope they make many more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lithium Battery Went Dead Within 2 months","review":"I installed the Mace Motion Alert in an outside shed.It worked well until the alkaline battery went dead in about 1 month.

The main reason is the care and detail in which Dr. Kutcher sets forth the (for me) basic axiom of treating children, which is that each child is unique, so each medication trial is, in effect, a research experiment with a N of 1. He provides an excellent range of measurement tools, including making up your own for specific symptoms.

However, I can not approve of this book, even for adults. I have to admit I haven't read the whole book. Years ago in a book store, my mother showed me two pages and I had no desire to see any more. The first was the S page: \\"S is for Stanley, Stanley likes to kill little children.\\" The second was at the end where he tells children not to tell their parents they have read this book.

They laughed themselves sick at each and every page. When their 13-year-old sister came home, they made her read it cover to cover.

I distinctly remember understanding that the humor was cynical, and this very much helped to contrast \\"normal life\\" and this dark, fascinatingly morbid parody of same. I absolutely adored the drawings, they are some of the earliest (and best) images that I can recall from that era. As humor is infinitely \\"subjective\\", this book is certainly NOT for everybody.

This book begins with a forward about hating children (so brilliantly written you think he loves them until you take a second look) and then commences on a journey to bring as many perils upon children as there are Alphabet letters- and then some! There's even \\"game time\\" where the kids are taught a way to play hop scotch- with reall scotch! It's great for older people, but like I said, beware if a child gets this book.

It feels as though the writers started not caring about what they wrote, as long as it was seen that mormons \\"are bad people, becuase they are human...shame on them, shame!....\\".All told, I wasted $2.50 for a used copy of this book and increased my stupidity for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enlightening","review":"I was a young girl living in Ogden, Utah when these murders occurred. I read this book shortly after its publication, and found it very enlightening and true to form. It was a terrifying mystery when the events occurred, and the media never fully explained the behind-the-scenes facts surrounding the bombings. I feel this book was very objective about the Mormon religeon and its reaction to the events surrounding the bombings and forgeries. The book is a fascinating account of the greed and murders, and anyone remembering the events will find this an eye-opener.

Amazingly, Hoffman used forged documents to exploit the Mormon leaders' need to conceal their Church's true history from their members. This increased the price of his forged documents. Although the Mormon leader was a seer through whom \\"secret things can be made manifest\\" he was fooled and paid substantial sums. After Hoffman committed murders the Church leaders tried to obstruct justice so that they could continue their deceptions. It's a factual account of deceived deceivers in Salt Lake City."},{"rating":"1","title":"The True Greed here is that of the Author.","review":"The Author here uses sensationalism and unfounded research to place blame for the tragic deaths of innocent victims on someone other than Hoffman who acted on his own and for his own selfish and cowardly reasons.

As one intimately aware of the facts I can tell you that the authors were very selective in their use of the facts, and in some cases were quite inaccurate.

It is unfortunate that this book has received a much wider distribution than other more accurate and less sensationalistic works."},{"rating":"1","title":"How true is this \\"story?\\"","review":"I knew Mark Hoffman, the central figure in the horrible murders noted in this book.

For me, this casts serious doubt on the authenticity on the entire tale as it is told here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalist tripe with a few interesting points","review":"As an interested student the Hoffman forgeries, I'd not recommend this book. The writers' agenda keeps showing and gets in the way of the tale. Of interest, though, is the cops' story which is told better in this book than many of the other accounts.

The only thing that bugs us is the doors not hanging straight but I think that is from the bed shifting. They hung straight for the first day or so. The under-bed storage is a huge deal for us since we rent and don't have a lot of storage options. We can fit so much stuff under there and his room can still look neat and organized. He has never had a problem with the ladders, just had to show him once and he got it. We are using a bunk board and a twin matress. I think it helped when moving him from his crib because it still gives him that crib feeling. The bed is pricey but for all you get, it is well worth it. It is one of the best purchases we have ever made. We are very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bed!!!!","review":"We bought this bed for our son who was 21 months old when we got it about a month ago. He has slept in it perfectly since we got it, he has never once tried to climb out at night or nap time. He also loves to play in the bed at other times, and can climb in and out easily!!! I was really nervous that he would climb down out of the bed and try to play at \\"bedtime\\", but that has not happened at all. We used a piece of plywood under the mattress and that seems to work quite well.

One spray and I was checking the directions to see if I was supposed to nip something off of the end of the straw first.Surely something was blocking the end of it? Nope. My girlfriend blasted me in the head with her highly compressed can of 3M dust remover and called me a dope for buying it .

Also, regular canned air has enough pressure to damage the shutter/curtain mechanism of the DSLR (learned that the hard way on my D100).If you want to clean computers, keyboards, etc. this is not for you. If you want to clean delicate mechanism, not gum-up electronics, etc. then this is for you.The alternative is a hand blower like the Giotto Rocket, but it's bulkier to carry around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't perform efficiently","review":"I first bought the 4 replacement air cartridges only, w/ no holder to place them in, which I found in the sell-out bargain bin at a local store and was told that they were going to discontinue selling this product.

It hardly has enough air pressure to make any difference and doesn't last but for a minute and I have to put in another air cartridge. Not worth you time and certainly not worth your money.

The Air Dr. can barely (and I mean barely) blow the dust and dirt away from the sensitive connection areas on the phone. The capacity of the cartridge is only a few seconds and the last 50% of the life of the cartridge is at significantly reduced pressure.

See how stupid my last comment was? That's how stupid the entire movie was. Not even worth a rental, this movie certainly goes on my top 100 worst movies I have ever seen.

Second movies are hard to make when a movie was as succesful as 'National Treasure' but this one is pretty good. Family entertainment all the way and those movies are hard to find these days. Sorry to use the cliche but it works. It's very difficult to find a film that all family members will enjoy, it's pure fantasy but not the creepy kind and covers all the bases.

Don't allow the absence of actual nudity and sex lull you into thinking that the film is positive or has an OK message.Language was very clean, but other than that, the film was mostly stupid. How finding the lost city of gold would clear Ben's family name completely eluded us."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Treasure 2 - Book of Secrets","review":"This is one of the worst sequels to a movie I have seen in a while. Ridiculous premise and really a sad commentary on Nicolas Cage agreeing to make such a film given his skills.

This is the second installment of the Benjamin Franklin Gates story. Same basic characters as NT1 but a whole new story. Same formula, follow clues to uncover treasure. Of course there are rival treasure hunter on the same quest. In this case, the rivals want to prevent Gates from being successful for purposes of hiding the truth about a historical event. This treasure hunt has lots of good action, some surprises and some way-out-yeah-right things (such as, kidnapping the President of the USA). A very well crafted story with some cool artifacts that all leads to a great ending. I do highly recommend this movie; fun to watch; kid friendly (its Disney) yet adult interesting.

The story line is extremely stupid, the clues are completely rushed and non interesting, and the mystery is almost non existent. A lame excuse for a sequel. The bad guy in this movie is retarded. His reasons for doing what he does, and the things he does do just show you how little creative thought went into the movie and it's plot. I did find enjoyment in some segments of the movie however, so I'm not going to say it's completely unwatchable. Just take what you can get out of it and try to forget the rest.

After the second time of using it very gingerly, it worked for a few seconds then it would turn itself off. I played with the buttons for turning and vibrating, but nothing happened. I tried to change the 3 AAA batteries that it requires, but it came to no effect. It was also very slim, maybe an inch in diameter or so.

Sadly you only have 30 days to return it. At this point it has been 45 days and inside the red covering you can see some gross looking discoloration from something.

THe authors did do a good job, but should of verified more of the TRUE facts of the story by other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"As a Librarian and, almost life long reader of true crime, I must say I was very disappointed in this book. I purchased it based on the high reviews. It's hard, for anyone so close to a story, to report completely objectively. It was little things that bothered me, such as on the first page of the prologue where Cindy relates \\"Perhaps the vodka she accidentally drank at the party was fogging her brain...\\" A horrific thing had happened to her family, yet it appears that even as an adult, Cindy can't admit that as a teenager she drank alcohol at a party. It was inconsequential whether she drank or not. This made me question her other portrayals, since she didn't seem to be able to portray herself honestly.The story is related mainly in dialogue. The dialogue is stilted and unbelievable. I admire Cindy's strength and this is an interesting story, but would have been much better if written by someone further removed from crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such Bad Writing","review":"The actual murder case seemed interesting, but I just couldn't get very far in this book because the writing was SO BAD! There were endless amounts of dialogue that were just in no way shape or form how actual people speak. It jars you right out of the story when the people in the novel spout stupid nonsense that rings amazingly false. I would like to read about this case in a book written by someone else, someone that leaves out all the useless and stupid yet copious amounts of dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"You have to read this. I bought it at 7:30 PM. I finished it at 2:30 AM. It's so difficult to believe that this is a true story. The horror, the reality, and finally the courage of Cindy Band is remarkable. The beauty and the soul of which it is written by Julie Malear has never been matched in any book that I have ever picked up. When they say fact can be stranger than fiction, this book was in mind. No author could come up with a story like this. And to think the monster lived among us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Product came brand new factory wrapped.

Francine TELLS ALL!","review":"I also discovered my hidden psychic channelling talents last week! I've now got this spirit guide named Bob, who's really good friends with Francine (Sylvia's alleged spirit buddy). Bob the ghost told me that Francine has been REALLY fed up with playing second banana to Sylvia, who's raking in the cash while constantly making up stuff that Francine NEVER TOLD HER! Can you believe it! So I asked Bob to put me in touch with Francine, who told me that she's most certainly NOT talking to Sylvia any more, thank you so much, and is in negotiations to publish her OWN tell-all book! Francine promises to give us all the REAL dirt on UFOs, crop circles, ghosts, channeling (and a wild three-day party involving Ramtha and two dead celebrities!), 2012, and the TRUE fate of your hamsters in heaven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the rest of her books","review":"I am very disapointed in this book. Basically it is a review of stuff she already talks about or goes over in Life on the other side. I read the whole book in under half an hour and the whole time I kept saying to myself \\" I already read this in her other book\\". I didn't play the cd, don't think I even care to at this point. I think she should just sell last chapter in this book with the cd, because all other chapters are review."},{"rating":"2","title":"my spirit guide","review":"This is fun and go back to book. I enjoy the meditation CD that comes with it and I might have found my guide but still working on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sylvia Brown \\"Guide\\" is on target!","review":"Sylvia Brown's \\"Contacting Your Spirit Guide\\" is most interesting and comforting! It is my first Sylvia Browne book, and despite her tougher exterior as seen on her Montel appearances, she is a gentle and evolved human being. She introduces us to \\"life after death\\" and basically explains how it is on \\"the other side\\". She presents a believable case to ensure us that we never die, but live on. She obtains information from Francine, her spirit guide who tells us of life after life! Her accompanying CD is very comforting and good for meditation, yoga-stretching, etc. I believe this is a very important, informative book. How can she top this one!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Huge Stepping Stone to Improve your Life","review":"This book along with all of the other books written by Sylvia Browne is worth more than any other books I have ever read. This book is a true self help book that touches on every aspect of your life and truly helps you to find your own answers to your questions on anything. As far as I'm concerned there is no other book or author that can help to find what you are seeking no matter what it is.This is truly a life changing book as all of her books are and I highly recommend it as priority reading for everyone, male and female alike.I rate this even higher than what is allowed, and if you want to help yourself to look at and handle any situation in your life no matter what it is, then I highly recommend this book. And if you pay attention and listen inside yourself, your life will change dramatically for the better. Mine has!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!","review":"This is actually a fun book. The best part is the audio CD that has a spirit guide meditation led by Sylvia. Sure her voice sounds like she's either been gargling acid or she smokes too many cigarettes, but the meditation , if you're in your right mind ACTUALLY WORKS! This is a must-read for any Sylvia fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot contact spirit guides","review":"I was not satisfied with the book at all. There is little or nothing in the text about how to contact your spirit guide, except fora verbatim transcript of the included CD. The book is all about Sylvia and her relationship with her spirit guide. I do not recommmend this book to anyone serious about anythine metaphysical."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Book","review":"This is another wonderful book by sylvia browne about contacting your spirit guide and there's a cd that comes with it that explains how to contact your spirit guide and I recommend this to everyone who's looking and trying to find out how to contact there spirit guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like this one a lot","review":"I am always intrigued by Francine and always want to know more about her.

She quotes the Bible, but totally twists the meaning of what the Bible says. She does not believe that Jesus died on the cross so that we can have eternal life. She is a pyschic and the Bible clearly states to stay away from pyschics and mediums.S he mixes a little truth with alot of falsehood and outright lies. She believes in re-incarnation, which the Bible does not teach.A book that exposes the New Age, that I recommend is by Johanna Michaelsen. Her book \\"The beautiful Side of Evil and \\"Like Lambs to the Slaughter\\", expose alot of these lies.I pray for Slvia Browne, because I know God loves her and everyone, but He doesn't want any of us to be deceived and that is what she is doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total baloney","review":"This book is total fiction masquerading as fact.

Thank you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So misleading","review":"I think the idea of being guided by a spirit with your wellness in mind is very appealing. This book should be filed in children's fiction. There are so many protests at this woman's events I am surprised she is still able to convince people that she has a meaningful connection to the spirit world. Especially with all the footage of her bombing on youtube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Following directions&Paying attention","review":"I have read everthing Sylvia Browne has written and found the CD included in this book to be extremly helpful.It is imposible to meditate while you read,so the CD was an excellent tool. Even thought the book is short it holds the key to open the door to meeting a very special sprit that is yours alone.I have meet my guide,Marcia,by folloing along with the CD and it was an experience that I can only compare with the birth of my childern.I know that anyone who wants to do it can.You must let yourself be clear in your mind and open to the experience.I promise it is worth the effort.Sylvia has made it easy and very possible and I thank her for it.Give it a try and you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Enlightening!","review":"As a new fan of Sylvia's work, I have to admit I bought this book because of the meditation CD it comes with. The CD is wonderful and has brought me to discover who my Spirit Guide is. I am excited and in awe of getting to know her better. A must have if you are into challenings your spritual beliefs and learning about life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Francine's story","review":"I admire Sylvia Browne. Reading her books and seeing her work helps the learning process. This book about contacting your spirit guide is more Sylvia's story about Francine, one of Sylvia's spirit guides. Very interesting, but not as personally informative as I'd have liked.Everyone has a spirit guide - this book doesn't hook you up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or dollars unless you have lots of spare CF cards","review":"I bought a NEX IA when they first came out and it was barely worth it then and is basically a paperweight now. I thought I would/could upgrade to a microdrive larger than 1 GB but no go. The largest CF card or drive I can get to work in the player is 1 GB. The player uses 2 AA batteries and is large and heavy compared to any other player on the market. The only possible good use for this paperweight is in your car, and then if you have a stack of spare CF cards loaded with music and labeled. You can buy a 12volt lighter plug in adapter to power the unit and I happen to have a cassette player that I can plug a headphone to cassette adapter into. I am trying to make it last as a car player, otherwise, I'd toss it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashed after a couple times.","review":"I never really wrote reviews before, but I should start writing more and warning people about bad products. I was looking for a cheap alternative to those Ipods, and I thought this would be it. I was unimpressed with the casing and the buttons, but I was ok with it because it was so inexpensive. But I found out the MP3s wouldn't play back correctly, then occasionally I see an hourglass on the screen which meant that it crashed. I had to remove the batteries to clear it up. A couple reviews mentioned the exact same problem. Don't be misled by the 5 stars one that say it's excellent and perfect. Please read ALL the reviews and then judge. I'm just being honest and want to save people the hassle. I returned it and got my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good mp3 player","review":"I love this mp3 player. It is the only one I can find that uses the compact flash memory card, which I have tonnes lying around. Unlike most other flash players in the market, the NEX IA is not too small where the buttons become impossible to press and control. It is also very simple to set up. All I had to do was plug it into my PC and voila it shows up as a drive, where I can just drag and drop mp3 files to it. No special software was needed.Most importantly it sounds great. It is very loud and with very deep bass which is perfect with heavy rock music that I like listening to. All in all, a very good player. Just one downside, the FM does not work that well."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but transfer speed sucks","review":"I bought the player and it seemed like a great deal at the time.I had a hard time to get the microdrive flap open. The unit is nice but everything has that cheap plastic feel to it - like you would want to handle it very carefully lest something snaps off. After putting the microdrive and batteries in, it was pretty heavy considering the weight before that.The USB 1.0 transfer is just so SLOW... It took 6 hours, yes 6 to load 550 MB of songs on it. That is its WEAKEST point.Radio tuner is lame and you wont get a decent signal unless your'e standing infront of the radio station building.The unit also guzzles batteries down like an SUV.It crashes/freezes very often and to get it started again you have to remove the batteries and put thenm back in - a very annoying procedure.Good qualities: Sound is very good. The backlight is bright. The remote works fine.In the end it is a good looker with no performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid MP3 Player","review":"I was given this MP3 player as a X'Mas present. I owned a couple of MP3 players before but I find this NEX IA to have the best sound. It is simple to use and operate. Everything is very self-intuitive. I didn't even need to read the manual. Customer Support was helpful as they responded to my inquiry within 24 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned mine","review":"My unit that quit working after 2 days. Started to skip, lose sound, and stall completely after I downloaded more than 100Mb. Also didn't quite care for the product for the following reasons:1. Cheap plastic casing with a track button that wasn't quite centered.2. Cheap headset.3. Software was ok but kept prompting me to upgrade ($$).Returned for a refund (hopefully)! Maybe it was just my luck, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Received the player with great expectations only to find it virtually unusable because of the extremely poor fit of the headset plug in the player's jack. The plug wobbles around and loses contact so that the only way to listen to the player is to hold the plug in by hand. Still with any movement it loses contact. Frustrating for an expensive player. Am in the process of contacting Frontier Labs for repair or replacement. Will update the review later with their response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great (for 6 months)","review":"[...]Anway, I continued to use the mp3 player and actually found it very useful for the last six months. Last week, the FM transmitter failed and now there is a noticable hum in the mp3 playback. From the beginning it was apparent that the build quality was very questionable. As others have said, I should have paid an extra $50 and gotten an MP3 player from a reputable company (Apple, Creative, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"FM RADIO DOES NOT WORK AT ALL","review":"Mp3 part is great but FM radio will not receive any station without noise. My digital walkman does receive in the same location 25 stations with perfect sound.I tryied 3 units and the same problem. If you will be lucky you will get 1 station out of 25 and still with noise. Piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Player For The Money","review":"Easy and simple to use... The sound is great and I like how it looks like the iPod. Fits right in your hand and doesn't skip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice player. Non-existent support.","review":"This is a pretty nice MP3 player, unless you need service. The FM reception is awful, but I knew that from reading other reviews before I bought mine. The MP3 player is quite nice. It sounds good, is easy to connect to the computer, and takes Compact Flash, which is rare in an MP3 player.Then the CF card that came with it went bad. I've sent email and left voice-mail at least 8 times over the last month, and I haven't heard a word in response. I consider myself lucky that it's just the CF card, since I can replace that quite easily myself (which I've done). If the player itself were to break during the warranty period, I'd be completely out of luck.I'll buy from a company that stands behind their products next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was defective right out of the box","review":"I recieved the MP3 player for Christmas, and it worked fine, untill I tried to hook it up to my computer and discovered that the USB port on the player was defective. 97% of the time, the player wasn't even recognized by my computer, rendering it useless.

I would not buy another product by FrontierLabs again...EVER!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEX 1a is having lots of problems","review":"One thing that is good is the quality of the sound (if unit works).But the rest is just bad design. FM radio will work if you sit on the transmitting antenna of the FM transmitter. In urban area where your cheap radio is receiving 50 radio stations this one will receive one if you are lucky enough.Cheap plastic chassis, with falling apart FC card cover.Controller is not doing what you try to do, select this but it will run something else.Songs stops or skips in the middle.Battery indicator is crazy, shows half the power but unit stops.Sound level indicator is jumping like crazy with 5 seconds delay what you listen.Voice recoreder very low level. FM recordin useless because FM is not workingProduct not recommended for buying. How this was able to get to USA market. Just rip off.Technical support says all is fine but it is obviously not.Please buy iRiver or iPod you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I bought the NEX ia over other models because of the FM receiver. That was a bad decision because living just 20 miles out of central Houston I can't get but maybe one obsure station. Battery life is nothing like claimed. I get about 4-5 hours before it starts freezing up and skipping. My remote quit working after about a week. The download is agonizingly slow. There is no cover over the computer connect port unless you use the cover which I do for running to help protect from moisture (sweat).On the positive the sound quality is good but you will need new headphones and it is stable while running."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEX ia vs Rio S10","review":"I received the NEX ia from Amazon. It was hard to get a connection with the PC. Usually took about 3 tries. It did not like re-chargeable batteries. The Joy stick started sticking. There was no service number to call in the U.S., only an e-mail address that returned answers after one day with simple minded questions to a question that got me nowhere. The manual was very poor. I sent it back. The user interface of the unit was fine except for not being able to monitor NIMH battery levels. Their support by email only was unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE !","review":"I would rate Frontier Labs with a big zero if it were an option, otherwise they get a 1. The MP3 player we bought was a piece of junk. Crashed repeatedly and locked up regularly. Customer service was terrible and no help whatsoever.

While his wife (Kristen Scott Thomas) finds his schemes amazing and actively engages in beating him in his own game, valet is trying hard to win over the love of his life a book shop owner he knew his entire life and he desparately want to marry. Wonderful cast, great script, very european topic (curtains joke is typical european joke).

She plays fantastic ice queen/business woman with a cheating husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good french farce","review":"Daniel Auteuil was excellent as usual.

Not quite what I was hoping for...there isn't much here in terms of literary terms or poetic techniques I could highlight and the writing was quite stale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Thai server - made from aluminum","review":"Another reviewer points out that this is not made of \\"strong\\" material. This is true - it is made from aluminum, and is soft and subject to dents if not cared for. The pressed pattern on the outside of the bowl will hide most scratches and minor dents, however. This is exactly what you would get in Thailand - so as long as you know to expect a fairly thin stamped aluminum bowl, you should be very happy with this item. Never put it in the dishwasher - the harsh dishwasher detergent will cause staining and pitting of the surface. You will get many years of service if you treat the bowl properly - just don't expect a heavy gauge aluminum. If you want something more durable, there are stainless steel versions (also made in Thailand), but they don't have the traditional stamped pattern and are not as attractive - in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRAGILE","review":"Its not made by a hard metal.

The story is convoluted, but the twists and turns make it all convincing. Teens and adults will love it!Without a doubt, the best part of this film was Melissa Joan Hart's acting skills. This might have been a silly, screwball comedy, but she brought to it a degree of subtelty that I truly admired.

If you are a fan of romantic Christmas comedies, this is one you will want to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unbelievable but fun story.","review":"How does one find a fiance when one doesn't have one in time to spend Christmas with family at a cabin in the mountains? Simple answer, handcuff someone and convince them to go along with your implausible scheme. Okay, I get it, it isn't rocket science, but it is a charming movie starring Melissa Joan Hart and Mario Lopez. Some may call it mindless entertainment, but in my opinion, it is a Christmas movie for the entire family. It is wholesome fun and a real feel good story. One small caveat, there is some sexual content and it may not be for everyone, but most people, I believe, will enjoy this fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!What a great story.","review":"I love Melissa Joan Hart, and feel i can always trust the quality of her shows. I know they will always be humorous, and in good taste, which is a rarity these days. The length is perfect for the story, because you are always hanging on, to see what comes next, and especially the end! Buy it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deffinitally Deserved to Hit the Big Screen!","review":"Melissa Joan Hart and Mario Lopez are hysterical and incredibly believeable in this ABC Family film!

I read the story line and loved the actors so I felt safe in buying this movie. I was very wrong! This is not your typical \\"feel warm and fuzzy\\" Christmas movie at all! It has unnecessary adult content in it that I wouldn't want my children to see..not even my teenagers. I was embarrassed to own such a film and traded it the first chance I got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday in Handcuffs","review":"Melissa John Hart shows that she still is the actress capable of turning in an outstanding performance in this holiday movie.

I would give this movie a PG-13 rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the WHOLE family","review":"I was really excited to get this for Christmas. I normally love ABC Family movies. I was really disappointed in how many sexual references and innuendos were made in this movie. This was not a movie for the whole family. I would not want my kids watching it, and don't even want to see it again myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a family movie","review":"Let's just say I wish I had read all the one star ratings accurately given to this movie before watching it!!! It didn't seem \\"too\\" bad, wasn't entirely terrible and was actually rather funny at times until it was ruined about 2/3rds into the movie when the homosexual part comes in and was accepted and embraced as OK, laughed over, and even the Dad who wasn't OK with it at first, becomes OK with it in the end when he meets the son's 'boyfriend'. If you are OK with this lifestyle then you might not have a problem with the movie, but just be advised that this along with other sexual referances are made through out the movie... and it's only rated PG. And holding somebody at gun-point, even if you aren't intending to fire, is not acceptable. She was just lucky that when she accidently fired, the bullet missed....not too realistic to show to our children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and disgusting","review":"This is not a family film. It is not ok to kidnap someone, and it just got worse from there. Lie upon Lie, the dysfunctional family is full of dishonest relationships. It is disappointing to think this is considered a family film. The homosexual relationships are a contradiction to family values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude, crude, and badly scripted","review":"The holiday season should be about gratitude - I was grateful when it was over. This movie did not have a redeeming quality. If there was a way to give no stars, I would have chosen that one. I'm a fan of the holiday season and this did nothing but annoy me. I thought the idea had potential for romantic comedy, but they blew it on both levels. What's the fun of watching people argue, make bad choices for which there is no believable consequence, and have a stressed-out Christmas? I wouldn't let my kids watch this and I broke the DVD into pieces before I put it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sexual content for family fare","review":"I wish I'd read all the 1 point reviews before I bought this DVD - they are absolutely correct. It is NOT family friendly and I would not recommend it to anyone. Too bad, because the idea could be cute and there were some funny bits in it, but overall it is not worth viewing. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good up to the end - ABC blew it","review":"We watched this on TV last year. It was a good \\"Christmas\\" special up to the last third of the movie. ABC had to throw in a side story line of Melissa Joan Hart's character's brother being homosexual. If you don't have a problem with that choice of lifestyle, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you disagree with it (as my family does), you will most likely want to skip this movie. It didn't even add anything to the story and was, in my opinion, pointless to put in the movie.If you are looking for a good Christmas special from ABC Family, I would recommend Snowglobe from that same time period. It was a cute, corny and funny special that I would consider mostly family friendly. I am not adding Holiday in Handcuffs to my Christmas movie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but trouble","review":"This D-Link DUB-C2 cardbus adapter for USB2 but caused so many problems I gave up on it.

Nice card: two USB2 ports (one powered via adapter, one unpowered), one firewire 6-pin and one firewire 4-pin ports.Most support and forum gurus say not to install the proprietary drivers but to let W2K with SP4 find and install its own drivers.

I've had several corrupted hard drives from trying to use it with a USB2-IDE adapter cable under XP, and on OS X 'Tiger' on my G3 Powerbook, it causes the machine to lock up if it tries to go to sleep while the card is inserted.

I quickly changed to a different book series. These relatively poor at explaining the underpinnings of the language. My biggest complaint by far was the sheer lack of interest the books produce. I useWheelock's Latin 7th Edition (The Wheelock's Latin Series), and while it may seem dull compared to some of the other book series (Ecce Romani I: A Latin Reading Program : Meeting the Family Rome at Lastand theCambridge Latin Course: Unit 1, North American 4th Edition, both of which use fictional narratives to teach Latin and classical culture), my Latin students were giddy at how much better Wheelock was in comparison. My advice is simple: choose another series that will make Latin interesting, teach some Latin culture, and give your student something that is more than a long build up to saying \\"Ave Maria.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sig Transit Gloria...Emo from Illinois","review":"With emo coming back from the Sunny Day Realestate breakup, S.T.G. really redifines what it means to be an emotional teenager. The rather young ages of the band members increases the veracity of their honest, heartfelt and truthful lyrics. As a musician, I often call upon the words of Kurt Cobain, \\"..Lyrics are secondary, [music] always comes first.\\" Sig Transit acts oppositely, I believe. The musicians tend to feed off their own voices as a primary source of sound, which is hard to come by now a days. Despite the simplicity of the guitar, it is unique in the way it blends with the keyboards, bass and vocal capabilities.They have incorported so much into their music, emotions, obviously, being number one. Obvious or not, emotion is what this music is about. It is a rarity these days to do what these boys from the suburbs of Illinois are doing, and I incourage it.

In the meantime, I highly recommend (and use often when helping parents understand the crisis of their babies premature birth)Newborn Intensive Care: what every parent needs to know by Jeanette Zaichkin and published by NICU Ink. In 1983 we were just beginning to involve parents in their babies care and seeing them as an integral part of \\"the team\\".

Although this game states that it is for children 3 and over, I think that this is a good game for younger children as long as you can help them out. This is basically a collection of very basic games which cover counting, shapes, colours, etc. If your child already has the skills to use a mouse and is well versed in shapes and such, then I agree with some other reviewers that this may be too simplistic, but for a younger child - especially one who loves Dora - this adds just a little bit more interactivity to the \\"Dora experience\\" and can help get him/her more comfortable with using a mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"We loved this game!

The book attempts to cover Puerto Rican weather, politics, the social climate, and the main focus: a Russian ballerina and her dance troupe. But the novel fails to cover anything well. The book never fleshes out the characters. Every scene which might engage the reader and become exciting happens off stage so that we're left with a narrator's lackluster reference to it. We don't even really see the ballerinas warm-up, let alone feel their joy in dancing.

It was clear that Ms. Rupp is an intense personality, very different from myself, but I nonetheless came away encouraged and motivated, rather than intimidated and thinking I could never do it all.She does, however, spend a conspicuous amount of space on her differences with Christians who home educate. I wondered why she felt the need to comment at all.

It doesn't break any barriers or really has nothing to say musically that's interesting. He might have been a great jazz guitarist during this time, but his songwriting is awful. Nothing deep about this music. I also have to say that his improvisations on this album are totally cliche of jazz at that time. What a disappointing album.

This was the worst book ever","review":"I have read many Nancy Drew books, and this one was the worst. It gave away the whole mystery in the beginning. I couldn't even finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gleaming Pop Album Full Of Beauties","review":"The latest and most probably the best result of Garbage's unique blend of alternative and pop genres, BeautifulGarbage is truly stunning and exceptional -- and on a stronger claim, one of the best pop records ever.From the opener, hip-hop flouvered Shut Your Mouth to the melancholic ballad Cup Of Cofefe, the album delivers a colourful musical journey that is both agressive and playful, accompanied by Mrs. Manson's breathtaking vocals. The first single off the album, nu-rock/R&B anthem Androgyny is just blissful, along with Cheery Lips which is probably the funniest song the band has ever recorded. Parade comes as another highlight, before the album finally ends with So Like A Rose; a peaceful and retrospective piece dedicated to the young Shirley Manson in her room, dreaming to be a singer.BeautifulGarbage is the fullfilment of that dream, and luckily we are all here to witness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Velveetagarbage, Limpgarbage, Sadfan.","review":"Seems we fall into two camps, here. Those who are big fans and outright disappointed in Garbage de-evolving into velveeta rockers, and those who love this stuff. I fall into the first camp. There's just too much good music out there for me to put this bland CD in the player often. Where is the intensity of their earlier music? There are occasional flashes of Garbage's Brialliance but otherwise, it's downright boring. Not bad, just boring. Maybe I was expecting too much?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BeautifulGarbage should be NotTypicalGarbage","review":"I loved Garbage's first CD. I thought their second CD (Version 2.0) was very good, but not great. I anxiously awaited BeautifulGarbage, and I was extremely disappointed. For the type of sound they were going for, they did a pretty good job. However, I am not a fan of the sound that they were going for. I will just have to wait for the next CD to see if it will be any good. Until then, I will have to find an artist that will fill the void of \\"My favorite artist\\" that BeautifulGarbage has left open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunchbag letdown","review":"In my opinion, this record is a total disappointment.I waited and waited for the new release because I have seen Garbage live, bought their disks and enjoyed their videos as being very imaginative and smart. I felt secure that edgy guitar rock with intelligent lyrics had a safe home with Garbage.I recommend that you not waste your money buying this maudlin elevator music.Weeks after buying it, I am having trouble believing that Butch Vig and Shirley Manson are responsible for this yawn fest"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the name","review":"After waiting a few years for this album to come out I realized, Garbage 2.0 was amazing, this one is not. It's almost as if the group took a lateral step in making music, as if they're trying to find themselves. The record is all over the place and not too enjoyable. I almost get the feeling that this album was made up of B sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"title just about sums it up","review":"I like Garbage. I have their other two albums. I had this one, too, for about an hour. I bought it, listened to it, and sold it back to a used cd store. It has some catchy hooks, don't get me wrong, but it is just too bubblegum pop-ish for my tastes. If your looking for the driving beats and raw emotions present in past Garbage albums, do NOT buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifulGarbage, the antidote to boy bands & Britney clones","review":"With \\"beautifulGarbage\\", the band led by Shirley Manson once again challenges the Status Quo of the music industry and offers a much-needed, refreshing alternative. Amidst a passel of lookalike and soundalike boy bands and Britney wannabes whose CDS will be quietly rotting away in the $1.99 within 5 years, Garbage have once again created an album you will listen to again, until it becomes part of your life. I paint, and I can't imagine a session on canvas without popping at least one Garbage CD into the player during the afternoon. From the heartrending \\"Cup of Coffee\\" to the wild energy of \\"parade\\", if you liked any songs on other Garbage Cds, you'll find a lot to like here too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"I was expecting something much better from Garbage, considering that 'Garbage' and 'Version 2.0' were great albums and that they took a lot of time to come up with 'Beautifulgarbage'. I was wrong. 'Beautifulgarbage' is mediocre.Nothing particularly bad here (except for 'Androdyny' and 'Untouchable' - those might better fit a Britney Spears album). Nothing particularly good too, with the notable exception of 'Silence is Golden'. The renaining songs are listenable, but I really don't care about them...I'm going to regard 'Beautifulgarbage' as I regard all of the Highlander movies past the first one. I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Those saying they sold out on this album, it's too pop and not enough like garbage need a reality check. Garbage was ALWAYS a pop outfit. Yes they did things that other rock bands hadn't done when Garbage was released, but it was decidedly pop music.What this album brings to the table is a wide palatte of influences.When was the last time a mainstream band channelled Phil Spector, Blondie and the pretenders on one album? This album manages to have songs that sound current and retro at the same time.I for one was thoroughly impressed by the craftsmanship of the songwriting and generally superior (and frequently autobiographical) lyrics.For those that just can't take liking pop, just remember, the other albums had far more POP hits than this one.Personally I'd recommend this album to just about anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!","review":"Now, let me say I'm a big Garbage fan. Their first two albums rocked and were full of high energy and a total in-yer-face sound that few can match. So, I've been looking forward to this since last year when I heard they were back in the studio. And now I have it, it grieves me to say it's a bad outing. It's just a pop album that's all too fluffy and underwhelming. All the loud guitars and mechanical wizardry have been dropped...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Question, Their Worst","review":"I love Garbarge. I think their first two albums are pop landmarks for the last several years. But everything that makes those records great is absent from Beautiful Garbage. Yes, Shirley still sounds good and so does the band. But they have somehow been drained of all their creative sparks. Gone is the cleverness from their songwriting, gone is the edge from their sound. This is a dull pastiche, an swath of sounds lifted from other eras and other songwriters applied without imagination. Could they try any harder to incorporate various sounds of electronica from recent years? Could they fail any more miserably? And finally, wherefore Shirley the vamp? Lyrically, she sounds beaten down when she used to sound in control.Let's all hope they recover on the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT IS GOOD.....","review":"I CANT SAY THIS IS AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD, GARBAGE.

I STILL THINK \\"VERSION 2.0\\" IS MY FAVORITE ALBUM FROM THEM, BUT THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT BUT IT IS A GOOD DIFFERENT. I KNOW ALL TRUE GARBAGE FANS WILL LOVE THIS NEW CD!!

You knowI don't have to tell you. Alternapunkrockandrollgothpoptechnodance..hows that? Version 2.0 was a bigdisappointment given the strengthand direction of there first. Whywere they unable and/or unwillingto further that? Please Shirley...someone tell me/us! So it is with Beautiful Garbage that we have an even more watered down version of 2.0. I was able to find some tunes on 2.0 not only listenable but returnable.Maybe there are 1 or 2 on BG.Gone is the edge they once had.The dark introspective music andlyrics.I surely hope they wise up andget back to there roots next timeout. Stop selling out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage at their best","review":"I bought this yesterday without hearing any of the tracks on it before it was released. Its as good as their first album and a great antidote to the boring same-same drab music on the radio these days. A blast of fresh air."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP IT!!!!!!!","review":"I considered myself a die hard Garbage fan until I bought this CD. Any true Garbage fan would not like this CD, because it is NOT Garbage. They have turned into a completely different band... If you loved their last 2 albums like I did, you will be HUGELY disappointed. Shirley's woice doesn't even sound the same. Some of the other reviews I've read on this site have called it \\"Top Notch\\", and \\"Beautiful\\". All I can say is they must have not been listening to the same CD I did. There is absolutely nothing original or groundbreaking about it. The few songs that actually sound like attempts at the old sound, fall way short. \\"Shut your mouth\\" is the closest to the old sound, and it is boring and repetitive. I hate to be saying all this, because like I said earlier they have always been one of my favorites. All I can say now is \\"What were they thinking?\\" This one is getting sold back to where I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Version 2.0 is one of the best album's I own and I was hoping for another excellent array of tracks from what I once thought was a group capable of providing the best blend of techno,trance and pop.

Yeah theres alot of different styles but hey, a band needs to be free and change it cant keep kicking out the same songs all the time. I really like Shut your mouth, Androgony, Cup of Coffe, Untouchable, Cherry Lips, and the rest, just a few im not into. But if you like garbage even a bit, its worth looking into"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something New","review":"Well, I know there's a lot of fans who were disappointed in this album, but I know there are also some who appreciated the new turn Garbage was making in style. I fall in between, because while I find some songs entertaining (Shut Your Mouth, Cherry Lips, Untouchable), some reminiscent of old (Silence Is Golden, Parade) and a couple of pretty ones (Drive You Home, Nobody Loves You), it isn't a CD I listen to without skipping because the styles are DIFFERENT. It depends on your taste and exactly how open you are to new things if you'll enjoy this. I did, and I hope they continue to take new directions that keep the sound fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Garbage is garbage","review":"I couldn't resist the pun, but I'm disappointed in this CD. I thought their first two CD's were much better. When I was playing \\"Cherry Lips (go baby go!)\\" I was struck by how much like the Go-Gos the CD was sounding, particularly the recent Go-Gos' CD. (I didn't like the recent Go-Gos' CD as much as their older stuff either...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Garbage?--BEWARE!!","review":"If Shirely Manson was held down and gang raped by The Cardigans, the resulting bastard child is the person who would be most likely to turn out this CD.Garbage and Version 2.0 were terrific. They didn't sound exactly alike but there seemed to be an almost logical progression from one to the other.Not so here. The synth-y pop sound is common and uninspired and I only wish I could say that Garbage co-opted this sound and turned it to their own purposes instead of being lazy.Yes, it's true that artists have a right to explore and change their sound, but that doesn't mean we have to like it, or buy it.Anyone considering this CD based on their affinity for the previous two CDs should BEWARE and borrow it from a friend or otherwise listen to it first before shelling out any hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again.... Beautiful Garbage Brilliant","review":"Garbage has once again done something different with the direction of the music. Its strong, creative, and catchy. Never have they been like any other band... a sound all their own. I have ALL of their cd's, including singles and exports as well as the videos. It has a certain air of confidence that extends to the listener as a sort of \\"pick me up\\". If anyone has been burned by an ex lover, this is a MUST in your cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not beautiful, but pretty","review":"I'm a big Garbage fan, and I love Shirley Manson's voice, which gets a full workout on this album. I prefer Garbage's previous two albums, as this one has a lot of slower songs, and I think Garbage's upbeat songs are thier strong point. Still, there's plenty to enjoy here, including the addictive Cherry Lips, the haunting Nobody Loves You and the rocking Breaking Up The Girl. Not as cool as the other two albums, but still cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who told you this was a good idea to put on the market?","review":"Dear Garbage,Please turn the synth machine off. I don't know whats been going on these past few years but I haven't liked it. I thought album was awful. I listened to it twice and the only thing that caught my attention was Cherry Lips (which i can't get out of my head) and had I heard that song on the radio Garbage would be the last band i would have though behind it. Clearly the band has \\"evolved\\" from the moody sounds of their first album, but guess what? That album was good, this one sounds like some assortment of pop [...] that was pulled off free Internet radio stations.Maybe the album is good, and if thats the case then old fans beware, this music isn't for us anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"pop sensibilities with an alternative flair","review":"The album is fun and whimsical while remaining true to garbage's dark-sounding beginnings... in all a very well written alt-pop album.(well worth the money for the first song alone)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced Garbage","review":"This is one of the worst most over hyped band's in the last 5 or 6 years .This music has no soul at all . Every bass line every chord every vocal sounds very calculated and produced and not very well at that . Shirley Manson is NOT a good singer and the musicians on this album have marginal talent. This band like Gorillaz earlier this year is one experiment that just didn't work out .This band is the Ishtar of music they have been promoted up the ying yang but no one is buying it. This band could be good if they got a new lead singer and if they didn't over calculate every single move they did"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Garbage fans will be disapointed","review":"I'm so glad i didn't spend money on this cd, i figured sence it was Garbage i was sure to like it, but this album doesn't sound like garbage, its way too mainstream pop. there are only 2 good songs on this whole cd.

Maybe next time they will go back to there roots from 1995."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an opinion..","review":"She is a good artist but this album was not very good.

Much better than Version2.0 and the 1st album, by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifulgarbage","review":"I picked this CD up the day it came out and let me say that it's another great outing for the band. They mixed things up a little (literally and figuratively) and came up with something familiar yet expanding. So far Garbage is batting a thousand. And if you haven't seen them live... oooohh... you don't know what you're missing. The band rips up the joint and Shirley is a rock-goddess. Buy this CD. You can listen to it all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bagging' Garbage","review":"This is the bands 3rd album, and it has been a long wait for garbage fans around the world, but good things come to those who wait.And this cd is beyond good.Very different from traditional Garbage, but isn't that one of the reasons we love this band. It's very diverse, its like they took elements from every possible kind of music style there is and combined it into a blender and came out with this new cd.\\"Shut your mouth\\" is a great opened and a rocker, what better way to begin listenign to a cd than a song that just makes you wnat to rage out a lil bit.Then its off to their first single \\"Androgyny\\" and its a cute song.I could go on to every single song and describe it to the feeling i get form it, but thats no fun.All i can say is that it's an emotional rollercoaster ride.There is so much feeling in this cd, and Ms. Manson, well her voice it got stronger.Best song on the cd is \\"Nobody Loves You\\"I give it 5/5 stars its truly a wonderful cd well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not Version 2.0, and that's okay. . .","review":"I read your reviews before I bought and was really concerned about the high number of \\"hated it\\"s. Beautiful Garbage is NOT 2.0 - I agree. 2.0 is tighter, more consistent in flow and content, and I think better. That said, Beautiful Garbage is a great disc in its own right. Different from 2.0, which was different from Garbage. No disc hits 14 home runs on tracks, but it's strong. BG evokes multiple moods - it rocks on some songs, wails and mourns on others (and two I just click past). Shirley is strong vocally, and pushes into new styles. Music is tight, and on most tracks is very \\"hard\\" in the Garbage style fans love and expect. I like BG BECAUSE it's different from 2.0. 3 albums, 3 evolutions in style and substance. If I want Garbage that sounds like 2.0 - I'll pop in 2.0. Beautiful Garbage is a great work, and broadens its appeal to listeners because of its creativity and variety. Don't bash your band for evolving. Everything grows, or it dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Good","review":"I really loved the first two Garbage albums but this one is just sort of flat. Plus, my copy has some sort of copy protection or something on it so it won't play right on my PC which is where I listen to most of my cds. I hope they figure out where they want to go next time before they start the next sessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED!?!","review":"I consider \\"Version 2.0\\" to be a near masterpiece of composition & musical layering of the highest order. There's not a song there that isn't more than what it first seems. As with many great bands, Garbage albums take a few listens to sink in & perhaps \\"beautiful\\" will become that for me too. However, I highly doubt it because the themes & melodies here, with a few exceptions, are so unoriginal & sophomoric that they are truly unworthy of such a talented band. I'm all for bands trying to expand themselves, but to wait four years for something that is not so much a giant step backwards as it is a giant step in the wrong direction. What happened indeed? I'd like to get these guys in a dark room & torture them until they spilt the beans. I can't imagine the answer they would give but I'm open-minded. I purchased this on faith, something I rarely do anymore. I won't do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shirley Spears?","review":"This is simply not Garbage. I love it when bands try something new, but they shouldn't make a complete different type of music. Some tracks are simply terrible, like \\"Can't cry these tears\\" or \\"'til the day that I die\\" and only very few tracks are ok, like \\"Silence is Golden\\" or \\"Andragony\\"...finally, if you want to get into some really good music, by the debit an Version 2.0"},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have released this using a different name","review":"Simply, this album absolutely blows, and this comes from an old-school fan of GARBAGE and the GARBAGE 'sound,' none of which this album contains (aside from possibly the first track, which sounds like a throw away from 2.0). While the songs are intricate, and obviously performed by accomplished musicians, they aren't very memorable and sadly sound nothing like GARBAGE, coming across more like a Britney Spears - Jessica Simpson hyrbid. I'm actually quite irritated that I spent money on this album. If Vig, Manson, et al., wanted to experiment sonically so far away from the GARBAGE 'sound,' they should have released this album under a different name. Of course, given that they have a built-in consumer base, why would they? The label undoubtedly knew that fans of the band would rush out to buy their third studio album, and they did. Sadly, this is one fan who won't make that mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The name fits","review":"Unfortunately, I was unable to find any talent that warrants the plastic the data was burned on.

It wasn't what either of us expected, and not in a good way.If you love Garbage for the dark undertones, Shirley Manson's incredible voice, the techno, the energy... this album doesn't have it.If you like light sounding pop, this CD is all for you. Shirley's voice is good, but it doesn't have that sultry sound to it that made me love her. I'm sure there will be times when I'll pop this CD in and be fine listening to it, but this just is not the \\"Garbage\\" I love."},{"rating":"1","title":"and like a disposable diaper, this CD needs to be tossed!","review":"First off, my actual score for this incredibly rotten record is ZERO stars!!!Gone is the super song writing and stellar performances of the first two Garbage records.

They managed to be innovative and accessible, brutal and mellow, playful and dark all at the same time. They sounded more futuristic than Radiohead. Their memorable songs eclipsed Bjork. 6 stars for band's debut. 5 for Version 2.0.All had been well and good...until they started hanging out with No Doubt, who shamefully corrupted the Garbage sound. The result is this horrible atrocity called \\"BeautifulGarbarge.\\" The band sounds like they are doing ND cover songs...trite, empty, confused, crippled and out of focus. Skip this pile of garbage and wait for the band's upcoming \\"Bleed Like Me\\"...unless, of course, you are a ND fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"Hey Shirley... Toni Halliday and Belinda Butcher called.

A couple redeeming songs on the second half, but stick with Version 2.0 if you want the closest thing these guys have done to a solid release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage does it again!!!","review":"On first listen, one might think this CD belongs to an entirely new band. Upon further review, this CD is classic Garbage. Garbage has constantly challenged the musical binds that tie most artists down. Their first two albums were both commercial and critical success. Now on their third album, \\"beautifulGarbage,\\" they have pushed the envelope once again. Filled with edgy guitars, haunting vocals and booming beats, \\"beautifulGarbage\\" turns the tables on anything you've ever heard before. Shirley Manson appears to take on many voices as she sings such incredible songs such as \\"Shut Your Mouth,\\" \\"Cup of Coffee,\\" and the first single, \\"Androgyny.\\" Her lyrics are tighter than ever and transcend gender boundaries. This has to be one of the top albums of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Garbage style","review":"The first time I listened to this album, I was disappointed. It didn't sound like the garbage I knew at all. It was a different band.And that's all this album is about: garbage re-invented. Don't buy it hoping to get a \\"Version 3.0,\\" you won't; in this new album, the band uses different styles, different lyrics, going to a new level never before seen, but with the same good music and with the same great Shirley Manson as always!!Thus, make sure you give this one a try; you won't regret at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but awesome","review":"I can't really compare this CD to Garbage's first two, it just sounds so much different from them. In my opinion it's even a little better. All of the songs on this album rock, but my personal favorite is \\"Silence is Golden\\", I've never heard a song that good before. It's like a mirror of myself. All in all an incredible CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifulgarbage rocks","review":"Unlike most artists garbage have now shown that they can make three completely different albums, and make none of the songs sound at all the same. Shirley Manson has managed to right some increadable lyrics, like the emotional 'silence is golden' and the heart felt 'cup of coffee.'With this third album garbage have shown that they are hear to stay and have an increadably diverse range of songs.Also the music on this album seems to be a lot more cleaned up, they have a much nicer and proffesional sound. This album has their most 'popiest' stuff, like androgyny. And there darkest material, 'like Nobody loves you.'Shirley manson said that all of the songs on this album mean something to her, and showing that this album is not a load of rubbish that has just been nocked up in a few minutes.This record took almost two years to make. And this can be seen by its increadably excelent quality.Beautifulgarbage is definatly one to buy, and one that people of all musical tastes will like."},{"rating":"2","title":"posted revue to your forehead","review":"beautiful garbage is exactly what it says it is.level three for the gang. with bonus points scored.happy faces dancing. stars around the rings of fire.this band always takes me back to a past tense i was not a part of,as they blast me off in to the futureoh dear, its acceleration. dance party adreneline.timeless...priceless...how is it for marketingbottom line.their sound is sacred.and the words are gifted.viva la anthem hymns. viva la sexual revolution.below the dotted.i also adore the rare imported packaging of a pop up rose.with love (makes me feel some thing ive longed for)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"At long last some new garbage to listen to.

Now if I can only get a chance to see them live!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The title says it all","review":"I thought it would be pretty hard to beat Version 2.0 as one of my favorite CDs but this little gem did. One word can describe this album : DIVERSITY. This is the most unique album I have ever heard, and I have heard quite a few. Every song fits with the other, but none sound the same. I hate to admit it but I did skip some tracks on Version 2.0 and Garbage, but I cannot skip a SINGLE track on this album. ALL of them are fantastic. My favorite Garbage song ever would have to be on this album: PARADE. This song ABSOLUTELY ROCKS!!! It makes me smile just listening to it and it stays on repeat, believe me. ANDROGENY is my second favorite on this album. CHERRY LIPS is a great kick back to the 80's and Shirley's voice is just awesome on it. This album is one of the best ones I have ever purchased. If you are a Garbage fan, this album is a must-have and the best one they have ever released."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't want to write this","review":"I bought all the early singles. Rushed out and got the albums on the day of release. I bought Garbage records unheard. Seen them live loads of times.I *really* wanted to like this album.It's just not that good compared to the last two. Really it isn't. There are too many weak songs hidden with nice packaging and over-produced effects. However, there are a couple of good tracks here, notabley: 'So Like a Rose.' Some tracks will get Garbage a shack load of air play probably, hopefully new listeners will buy the back catalogue.Buy this one second-hand, or better yet, buy Gift by Curve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long wait, disappointing","review":"After waiting years for the release of a new Garbage album, I was really disappointed with this one. I listened to it several times to try to force myself to like it, but no luck. The first two albums were a wonderful mix of dark electronic and pop, but I can't figure out where this album is going. I realize that artists need to evolve and change musically, but I still don't like this CD. Do yourself a favor and buy 2.0 instead. Two stars anyway for the lovely Shirley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifulgarbage will rock you","review":"Once again, garbage is right on and readyto rock your world.

Here is my advice, listen carefully to what Shirley Manson has to say in Garbage's new album: Beautiful Garbage. Music that you have never heard, but still, you feel it like yours. That is one of the many reasons why Beautiful Gargabe must be with you. Once again, Garbage presents a totally new concept to the world. You will find it hard to classify this work of art, but still, there's something in Garbage that will bring all the answers to your head: just what you were looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage no more...","review":"I purchased this CD with my anticipation, but ended up with nothing much but something I wouldn't mind selling.Compared to Garbage's past two albums, truly this CD comes no where close to comparison. The new material on this album has become to diluted with so much digital sounds that it sounds like the material could be produced for Britney Spears. The only two great songs from this CD is Shut Your Mouth and Androgyny. The rest do not leave a memorable imprint as their past songs. Their direction surely has changed, and I am not saying that it is a bad thing, just totally different from what I had expected. I have hope still for their next released album, maybe their material would be much stronger. Until then, I recommend Garbage's debut album, Garbage, and version 2.0, where you can expect to find and hear great content."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happenned?","review":"I bought this CD when advised not to. \\"Too poppy\\" I was told. I guess I'm a hard-core fan, because I'd loved their previous albums and couldn't (wouldn't) believe that they could miss with this one.Beautiful Garbage certainly moves away from the electronic lean of their previous releases and into ground that makes me wonder if they'd simply run out of ideas.This album lacks the emotion of their previous discs, which saddens me because that's what endeared me to this group in the first place. It has a retro-airy-pop feel to it that leaves you feeling sort of empty when the songs are finished. Perhaps that's because as a fan I'm really wanted more.Some tunes I enjoyed. \\"Cherry-Lips\\" for instance is catchy and radio friendly and \\"Cup of Coffee\\" had something about it, but there are too many fillers on this album. I don't want to judge them too harshly, as I think these guys are great, but it didn't work for them this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage indeed","review":"i would have given this album a rating of 0 stars, but i didn't have that option. so, unfortunately i was forced to rate it higher than it deserves. i loved garbage and version 2.0, but beautifulgarbage is awful. i don't know, maybe shirley and the boys are getting old, cos this album is adult contemporary!it's like george lucas following the original 3 star wars movies with the repugnant phantom menace, but i digress. i returned my copy. i suggest that you save your money for something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"garbage\\" indeed","review":"I liked Garbage's 1st and 2nd album a lot, but their 3rd album is very very bad, nothing special or standing out on this album, I feel sorry and I only listened to it once, and never want to listen to it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"stuck somewhere between great and [uninteresting]","review":"After listening to this album I felt that about hald the songs were good and about half were boring and felt really uninspired. Androgyny, Untouchable, Breaking up the Girl and Cherry Lips are all great songs hat I fell in love with in just one listen and Till I Die and Shut Your Mouth are good and managed to grow on me after a few listens. The rest of the album just bores the hell out of me. I tried to force myself to listen to them more then once and I just couldn't do it, they're just completely uninteresting songs. It's nice to try and be experimental, but only if it works and the only songs I liked were the ones that at least sort of followed their old ways, so hopefully they go back to the old formula after this album or I might not buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disappointment","review":"Version 3.0 is one of my favorite albums of all time. Needless to say, I'd been anxiously awaiting Garbage's follow-up to it. Unfortunately, it's a huge disappointment.What makes Garbage such a great band is that their music is usually upbeat and rockin. This album is brooding, slow, unoriginal, and frankly boring. A newspaper review I read called it, \\"a step backward for the band\\". I couldn't agree more.There are a couple of exceptions like \\"Androgyny\\" and the fun Disco-throwback song \\"Cherry Lips\\", but the music is so over-produced and synthesized that they will never be able to reproduce it live.One of these days, bands are going to learn that their fans don't like change. Hopefully Garbage will figure this out and go back to making their own brand of unique rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid follow-up record","review":"pretty good. solid songs. shirley manson's voice is good as ever, some soft, and some angry. but i was expecting some more edge songs after their \\"version 2.0.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"all over the place","review":"go baby go is cool. rest is good. far better than most of the junk on the radio. a nice break from all the Creed crud and faux-punk that is devouring radio. i miss the rockin' stuff, but bet they'll do more of that on the next one.if the donnas could get production this good, they'd rule the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good...","review":"Beautiful Garbage is a cool CD, it really has some great songs to do whatever to....and there are a couple songs that got me wondering what they were on when they produced them. Honestly though, I like V 2.0 a hell of a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind!","review":"After purchasing this album i was a bit skeptical at first i guess that how everyone is when you buy a new album. But my gosh this album is so incredible. You can definetly hear a wide range of dfferrent music styles but at the same time you know its the band GARBAGE. Its one CD you'll find in my CD player. Its takes alot to please me and this CD did just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect CD.","review":"Melancholy at its finest. I cannot beleive people expect the same thing everytime a new CD comes out for any perticuliar band. If that is what you expect, go be a Limp Bizkit fan. If you want a band that matures as time passes, be a Garbage fan. To call these beautifully crafted lyrics unoriginal is not only unfair to the whole band but downright absurd. We are lucky to still have a few bands that dare to be experimental."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifulgarbage! completely astounding!","review":"This album totally drove me wild the first time I listened to it. From the beginning track \\"Shut Your Mouth\\" where Shirley Manson proceeds to knock down typical sellouts and everyday posers to the following tracks filled with androgyny and a break-up reaslized over a cup of coffee. The album amazingly carries a modern 'garbage' sound combined with a '50s Prom vibe throughout the duration of it's play.As always amongst the midst of their anger and awe filled songs, they've placed their ballads of beauty and sadness with \\"Drive You Home\\" and \\"So Like a Rose\\".Whether you're an old time Garbage fan or just coming along for the ride, you'll thoroughly enjoy this album through and through! It definately deserves a spot in your cd collection!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Beautiful Garbage turned out to be like nothing I would have expected. Instead of the Pop/Rock stylings feuled by attitude, the CD was more like Pop/Soft-Rock feuled by estrogen. To be more clear, I see this CD to be sort of girly. Though I should have expected this from the title, I assumed Beautiful Garbage would have the same presence as V2.0 (Garbage's last album). I'm not saying the CD is bad, I enjoyed it (Especially \\"Cherry Lips\\"). However, this is not the type of music you play at a football game to hype up the crowd. If your a person who enjoyed past Garbage songs that were on the mellow side like \\"Milk\\", \\"The Trick is to Keep Breathing\\", or \\"My Lovers Box\\", buy this CD. And one last important note, this CD contains a few curse words. Something old people like to consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful !!!","review":"This album is really great! If you've heard that this album is too 'pop' give it a chance anyway. It definitley has the Garbage style, although with slightly different sound. With the exception of \\"Androgyny\\" and maybe \\"Cherry Lips\\" there's not a lot more pop sound than there was on Version 2.0. The lyrics sound like Garbage. The group tried something new with this and they pulled it off. There's a variety of songs--upbeat like \\"Parade\\" and depressing like \\"Nobody Loves You\\". It really is Beautiful Garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Garbage CD","review":"I bought this Cd the day it came out. So far i've listened to it over and over and over again. A lot of work went in to this CD and it's just as good if not better than the previous Garbage albums. This Cd is worth the money spent you can listen to it from beginning to end without skipping tracks. If your a Garbage fan go out and buy it. If your new to garbage i still think you'll like it. Shirley's voice sounds really great and this album reminds more of thier debut album than version 2.0 Enjoy !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couple of ok songs. Little else","review":"I loved V2, but this CD really disappointed. It doesn't even sound like (or maybe it does) Garbage. Androgeny is OK, Cherry Lips is alright, but maybe I'm just making myself listen to them, so I feel like I got some value out of the CD. I would use it for a coffee coaster, if it weren't pink. Good thing I got my Blair Witch CD for that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was a rabid Garbage fan until this","review":"Boring, bland, and unimpressive. Yea, stay away from this one. I own 400+ CD's, and Garbage's first 2 CD's make it into my player quite often. I've got a collestion of b-sides, that I listen to regularly. I currently Have Shirly Manson as the backgound on my desktop. I'm siting typing this wearing a Grabage t-shirt I got when they last pasted by town and, I'm looking up at signed Garbage poster. And i'm telling you to avoide this CD like a mailman walking down the street with an uzi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this CD in hopes of hearing some cool female vocal alternative rock... something the music world needs more of. This CD contains pop-like, even some 50's style music. Maybe I'll learn to like their new style, but it's just not the Garbage I know and love. Disappointing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage-It is this time around","review":"If you are a fan of Garbage like I am, and have been anticipating a great album as thier two previous ones are, then you will be very very disappointed. There are at least 5 slow songs and there are no fast electronic, beat pumping songs like paranoid or any of thier previous efforts. The third song sounds like a girl group song of the 60's. This cd is very disappointing. Maybe they will get back to the old style soon. I would listen to mp3's of this cd before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Crippling Blow For A Great Band: Near-Britney Nonsense.","review":"Garbage. Not the band, this album. Besides the exhilerating \\"Shut Your Mouth\\", this album has none of the superb wit or cunning sexual ambiguity that make Garbade stand out in the 90's alternative wave. Hell, this isn't suitably perverse enough for most teen pop, which is exactly what this record really is. If the intent was Phil Specter-esque retro-pop then this is an even worse failure. Shirley Manson once seduced the listener while grinding a knife in our backs. And we loved her for it. Here is a shell of what once was. If the Pretenders were the obvious influence of the first two albums, this one is a slap-in-the-face insult to eveything Chrissie stood for. Beware this disgraceful, ugly little record. And pray its not the future for what was one of the great hopes for the future of rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty is in the eye...","review":"Garbage's third album sounds almost nothing like their previous releases, and for me that's a huge disappointment. This time they've traded in the guitar grit and good tunes for a giant polished piece of studio tripe.I can't really see Garbage converting anyone with this release, and they're certainly in danger of losing a lot of old-school fans. Really the only good songs on the album are \\"Shut Your Mouth\\", and, well, that's about it. I'm not sure who they're trying to appeal to, but I don't think it's going to work.It's really too bad, because until now they were one of the best this country had to offer.As far as I'm concerned, this album is a very large misstep."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"a couple really good tracks. pretty ordinary though - it all kinda sounds the same, for better or worse. the \\"enhancements\\" to the cd are absolutely worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"I've been trying to digest this album for a couple of months now. I thought it might be like Badly Drawn Boy, where the majesty slowly dawns on you - no such luck. I dig the lyrics and totaly respect the empowering message, but that's about it. Their electronic elements sound thin and inexperienced. Too frequently, their guitar and drum riffs roar up only to suddenly disappear. When they do keep charging, it sounds crashy and disjointed. They start some interesting trends on this album, but there's no coherency. I hope they bring it back together on their next album. This one's going in the 'for sale' bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for Garbage","review":"This isn't a one-star album in the Britney Spears sense, but Garbage has packaged the 13 least interesting songs they've ever put together into one convenient package. While it would be quite expensive and time consuming to try and collect every artist they ripped off on this album, no one in their right mind would try. For a singer clearly dealing with as much anger and frustration as Shirley clearly is going through (read the studio diaries), this album is annoyingly tepid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"I can't believe this is a Garbage album. Aside from the song Shut Your Mouth this doesn't sound like them at all. I'll go as far to say some of these songs would feel right at home on a Britney Spears album. Beautiful Garbage is just a mess. I would have prefered them to break up than put out music like this. Thumbs Down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"I'm a huge Garbage fan. Have no problem with the band trying something new; however, it's not just a departure...it's Garbage selling out on their original sound and feel. It's sad to see another great band moving along down the mainstream of (yuck) pop music in hopes of better sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck...","review":"I am a major fan of Garbage..saw them in concert..I bought this album today, and what a MAJOR dissapointment!! This is not the true Garbage that we have all come to love!! The songs are terrible!! There is only one song that I like and that is Till the Day That I Die...and that is it! I hope that I can take the CD back...Back to the drawing board Garbage!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"Nothing like Version 2.0 - in fact, I'm not sure what exactly happened to the band. Don't bands usually get BETTER with age?Thankfully, I received this as a GIFT and didn't spend my hard-earned cash here... however, it's definitely going to be collecting dust. \\"Shut Your Mouth\\" is a fairly decent song, and it was a good way to start the album... \\"Androgyny\\" and \\"Til the Day I Die\\" aren't too bad... but \\"Cherry Lips\\" is downright irritating and sing-songy, and all of the other songs are melodramatic and unimaginative, overall a pretty boring album.Don't waste your money if you're a fan of their music... there's a reason that most radio stations aren't talking up a storm about this cd like they did for Version 2.0. :P If you get the cd as a gift as I did, see if you get can the receipt and TAKE IT BACK for some QUALITY music.What a disappointment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 years of waiting for this .... Garbage","review":"Well, It's the end of Garbage as knew and loved them. They're done. I was afraid this was going to happen. The first two albums were stellar. A fantastic mix of pop / alternative / and dance/techno for lack of a better description. This new album has a few flashes of that brilliance but utlimately falls flat into monotony. The songs seem so uninspired. It shocks me to think that it took 3 years to make this ablum when it sounds like it took 3 months.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughh-what happened to my beloved Garbage?","review":"Garbage's first two albums are great, both easily belong in my \\"10 that I would bring to the deserted isle list\\" .Unfortunately, Beautifulgarbage seems to be aimed more at the Madonna/Britney Spears pop crowd. I've given it four listenings so far, and suspect that it will soon be relegated to the used bins at my local CD shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unstable and very well done","review":"Garbage returns with BEAUTIFULGARBAGE. After the excellence of VERSION 2.0 I wondered what would be next for this great band. With this album it's as if they took every style of music and threw it against the wall and wrapped it up in a neat pop package. BEAUTIFULGARBAGE features pop, rock, alternative, electonica, 60's girl group, whatever else you can think of. This is one of the most unstable albums i've come across. I was very pleased as to how well Garbage executed it all. It's very well put togther with Shirley's lyrics and vocal delivery. She's not her usual vampy, vixen self on this album. Shirley shows more emotion on BEAUTIFULGARBAGE with songs like \\"cup of coffee\\", \\"silence is golden\\", \\"drive you home\\" and \\"so like a rose.\\" This album is not as beat driven as their previous either. It concentrates on a more straight forward delivery with rock being the front runner."},{"rating":"2","title":"One More Reason to be Intrigued","review":"I'm a latecomer to \\"Garbage\\". I became \\"intrigued\\"by them after seeing a video of \\"The World Is Not Enough\\"from the Bond flick...of the same name. Loved them!I had to have anything I could find. What's so intriguing?Shirley Manson's voice for one and the sound of the band.I'm a 40-something rocker,and I thoroughly enjoyed\\"2.0\\" and the debut as well! \\"Beautiful Garbage\\" is \\"greatfun\\". I hear a little \\"Blondie\\"...later stuff...and\\"Pat Benatar\\" in this album. My favorite songs?...\\"Silence is Golden\\"...also \\"Shut Your Mouth\\". Some people commented about the ballads. I think they are fine...I loved \\"2.0\\",but a\\"3.0\\"...no...I liked when Pearl Jam experimented a little with\\"No Code\\"..I like anytime a band spreads their wings a little.If you agree, you'll love the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Dissapointing.","review":"I loved version 2.0 and the original Garbage because of how different they were. They were a hard type of electronica rock, they did all types of music ranging from pop, to jazz, alternative, hip hop, a little bit of country, and of course rock. This entire cd sounds like Britney Spears to me. Everything sounds so incredibly fake. It sounds like those little kiddie keyboards you buy.. and Shirley Mansons vocals has lost it's touch entirely lost in all this. True the lyrics might be deeper and more personal but some words that seem to be sad lose the feeling when there sang in these throw away happy go lucky poppish songs.Don't get me wrong, pop is great to listen to. Just... not this kind. And if you are into teen pop and music like this.. think about it.. would you rather this kind of music being performed by (Ugh) Nsync and 98 degrees, or a bunch of 40 year olds who have lost there touch?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than mostly everything else","review":"This another solid album from the only band like themselves out there.

Go buy this album and be happy it's not Limp Bizkit or incubis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shimmery, shiny pop confection","review":"Shirley's all grown up, and it turns out that love ain't what she thought it would be. Tender songs of unrequited love? That's not really her style. Shirley's got it bad. This is the kind of love that her mother presumably warned her about! The album is looser and grittier than \\"Version 2.0\\". It's the standard flashy, trashy Garbage that we've heard on \\"Garbage\\" and \\"V2.0\\".As usual, Shirley is right out there in front: sneering, sighing, grabbing her crotch and tearing into some willing victim. The plaintive \\"Cup of Coffee\\" is powerful in its simplicity and restraint. Two songs, \\"Shut Your Mouth\\" and \\"Til The Day I Die\\" are loud and crunchy, featuring lots of guitars. Shirley seems to relish chewing on these songs before moving on to the next one.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new concept for Garbage, but rather disappointing...","review":"To say that Garbage has changed its sound is quite an understatement. Garbage has completely evolved into a more of a pop band, mixed with electronic elements. I liked the Garbage's self titled album a lot, and was looking fowards to Beautiful Garbage, (unreasonably so).The title of the first single, \\"Shut Your Mouth\\", sounds quite like the old Garbage- much more in your face. However, don't judge the book by its cover. Their whole sound is watered down into the same old pop syrup. Unlike their previous CDs there aren't really any real intricate grooves played by the band, and Shirley's vocals have lost their typical abrasive-like quality that I enjoyed. Every single track encompasses the same idea as the first track and is not slightly intriguing.Basically, Garbage sold out like No Doubt did with Rock Steady."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...","review":"To me, Garbage always seemed like a band that had the potential of going from cutting edge to uninteresting pop. Guess what? Beautiful Garbage leans right into the sound that makes Britney Spears and Pink so cheesy. Some people take fame and use it to develop new ideas other people get caught up in the glitter and become part of the system that generates tons of bland music. I hope Garbage turns away from this sound. If your'e going to use the current trends in your music, at least be creative about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?!?!?!","review":"I wish I could be more articulate in this review, but it's hard to summarize how deeply disappointed I am with this CD. Is Butch Vig even in this band anymore?Yes, I'm sure the critics will get on their little hind legs and speak of \\"lush textures\\", \\"bold new directions\\", and \\"lyrical growth\\", but come on.

A major dissapointment. I loved the first Garbage album, thought the second one was ok, but this one is really lousy.

The band apparently couldn't decide whether they wanted to be Madonna, Shania Twain, The Sherelles, or Sean Puffy Combs. I'm guessing that the studio sessions lasted two or three days.Their first two records are wonderful--melodically sophisticated and ethereal. It's surprising that a band so good could go downhill so quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking steps backward","review":"Some bands see an evolution in their sound, while others change it completely. Unfortunately, this represents the latter for Garbage. Instead of building off of V2.0, they came back with something that is so scattered, it's hard to listen to all the way through. I'm sure most fans would agree that while we didn't want V3.0, we didn't want this either. Pretty disappointing considering how spectacular the last album was from start to finish. I will say that the album has grown on me after repeated listenings, but only slightly. Don't pay full price if you want to buy this album. Look for it used, or on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Do I have to even give this one a star?!?I absolutely love previous Garbage titles, but Beautiful Garbage is horrible.

Every track has all the electric edge that defines the Garbage sound! This CD is a departure from Version 2.0, but in no way does it deviate from the high standards and quality we expect from the group. Of particular note is \\"Cup of Coffee\\", a bitter journey through the pains of love lossed. It's heart-gripping, tear-jerking, and anger-inducing all at the same time.

There is a few alright songs on here \\"Shut your mouth\\", \\"Parade\\", \\"Silence is golden\\".

Garbage has outdone theirselve again with an album that stands out from the rest of their work, there is no way one can get bored with this creative bands imagination and ambition.

Look forward to future recordings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible...","review":"Garbage has taken their music to a new level with a very mature Junior album. Shirley's lyrics are at an all new high as she uses past experiences to influences such songs as the very dramatic Cup of Coffee. They explore a variety of rhythms on this album from classic (Can't Cry These Tears) to heavy (Silence Is Golden) to pop (Cherry Lips). Cherry Lips is quite a contrast to previous Garbage. However, it is a nice contrast. Parade and Breaking Up the Girl make very nice additions to the album with solid beats and a solid Shirley. Over all, the album is a classic.

An equally amazing performance is given by Richard Basehart as Il Matto (literally, The Fool) who goads Zampano into an outrageous act of cruelty. This film is funny, beautiful, and moving, and well worth seeing, even with subtitles. There are several great circus and clown scenes in it, but it's the performances, especially by Quinn and Massina that make this film a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Strada","review":"I knew this movie very long time ago, almost 35 years ago, now I see it through DVD I just purchase. It really a good movie, but every thing in that movie made people feeling sad, sad about the story, sad about the scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed, I cried, it was better than Cats!","review":"That is Fellini's real life wife?

Watch this movie when it comes to cable or for the low rental price of $3.99 or less (try renting for less than this, that's all it's worth). I agree with some of the other low rating reviewers the movie was badly scripted and subtitles were bad. The actress is a five footer. Definitely don't buy this movie. It leaves too much of a bad taste in my mouth just thinking about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fellini for Fans and Non-Fans Alike","review":"I've never been able to warm to most of Fellini's \\"classic\\" films: a few memorably imaginative sequences lost in a deluge of party scenes and idle chit-chat. \\"La Strada,\\" however, is a remarkable and beautiful accomplishment. Giulietta Masina's lovable conflation of Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx is both endearing and moving; rarely has a simple-minded but good-hearted character been portrayed with such sensitivity. Anthony Quinn is equally fine in his own way, and the film makes a strong impression that is not easily forgotten, even days (or years) later. Just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obviously, based on ws142's review, La Strada is a classic","review":"The opening line of ws142's review shows he is inarticulate, crude and ignorant which is reason enough to make me want to run out and buy La Strada immediately. It's obviously NOT Armageddon, American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding which is obviously the kind of film that appeals to ws142's IQ level. If it's as good as Nights of Cabiria, which I own, it's obviously one of the greatest films ever made. Cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A simple but effective fable, La Strada has been romanced all out of proportion but at its core it's a well-made little movie; if you don't expect anything more than an uncomplicated but well-acted film, you're likely to be pleased with what Fellini serves up."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Strada","review":"Beware this version of the famed Fellini classic, La Strada. The label says it was distributed by Public Media Home Vision. Cover says New Subtitles -- by that they mean the Italian has been over-dubbed in English making it almost unintelligible.

Its simplistic symbolism left me cold. I saw it again, 10 years later. It's simplistic symbolism made me weep. And I knew why. Yes, La Strada is a movie with a very mundane premise (as is life) which reduces the man/woman relationship to its most base. Men, at their most primal, are selfish brutes. Woman, left unnutured, are masochistic twits. Fellini offers a stark and staggering perspective of humanity which forces us to relate to characters whom we see as appaulling and pathetic, yet are uncomfortably close to all of us, left with the same options. The ending is obvious, but it says it all. BTW: Woody Allen made a regrettable remake of La Strada entitled \\"Sweet and Lowdown\\", No credit was given to the original (as far as I know.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a flawed masterpieece","review":"This is possible one of the ten best films ever released but Criterion has botched it.

Special Agent Whitcomb did a superb job. The action kept me on the edge of my seat. The humor was perfect and kept the story moving as well as rounding out some of the people that Mr. Whitcomb worked with (or had to put up with). The descriptions of HRT's duties overseas (especially Kosovo) were particularly disturbing. If you have a chance to read this book-DO IT! It is a classic along with other titles such as ROGUE WARRIOR, THAT OTHERS MAY LIVE, GOOD TO GO and ZEN IN THE MARTIAL ARTS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was an excellent novel and for someone who wishes to enter the FBI I found it very inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sincere and Illuminating","review":"The author talks about his career as an FBI agent and his successful entry into the HRT (Hostage Rescue Team). The author is sincere and gives great detail on FBI missions. He also discusses how the FBI's HRT handles missions not quite military, but too intense for law enforcement. Very good book and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Lover","review":"\\"The world looks different through a rifle scope.\\" With this opening line Special Agent Whitcomb grabs the reader and doesn't let go. From his first day on the job (in Kansas City) then on to HRT training and finally to places like Ruby Ridge, Waco and Kosovo we get to know the man who believes in this country. A man who wanted to make a difference and did. As the mother of two sons there are times when Christopher's story causes my heart to skip, but as an American I am so grateful for these men (and women) who risk so very much to protect us. The writing is fast-paced, compelling, and on target. This former speech writer has a story to tell and he tells it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book from a 'real' point of view","review":"I could not put this book down. I am facinated with military and anti-terrorist groups and was so excited when I heard about this book. This book was from a point of view of a real agent. You saw the life of a HRT operative through his eyes. It wasn't glamourized or over dramatized like you see on tv. Whitcomb also as a lot of personality. You see that he has real fears and real concerns about the world and also a sense of humor through all of it. It is refreshing to see someone as passionate about serving the people and doing what is right. I congragulate Whitcomb on a wonderful book and look forward to his next one in early 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"An excellent overview. Mr. Whitcomb was on Art Bell last night, and he was both honest and articulate. His descriptions of what happened at Ruby Ridge and at the Branch Davidian compound are both reasonable and sincere. Yes, conspiracy theorists and other anti-government folks may disagree with Whitcomb, but his observations are compelling and well thought-out.................."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A disappointment after making promises to be a first-person account of thrilling FBI sniper missions. The first half of the book was just about engaging with its descriptions of the tough training required to make it to FBI's elite units. After that, the missions Whitcomb described were just plain dull and dreary. His philosophical musings make for more entertaining reading than his missions and it wasn't supposed to be that way. I am sure there are better books of this sort out there and I am going to find them. Whitcomb has written more books after this one but I am not interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Maiden : EN VIVO (Blu Ray)","review":"I'm just received the item (Iron Maiden: En Vivo Blu Ray) and watched it several time.

Also, the accompanying booklet has numbered discussions of each of the 50 cards, yet no numbers appear on the cards which makes it difficult to find the text that corresponds to your chosen card.I also found the discussions to be rambling and in many ways hard to even associate with the original quotation!All in all, I would say if you are looking for daily inspirational readings, others offer better words for daily guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have done without them","review":"I like her books a lot but very disappointed in these cards.

The reason...The Ten Commandments! The image of Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea kept playing through my head. I eventually got over it, all due to the narrative that this wonderful author told this story. I found myself captivated. Hurston made Moses human, with human needs and problems. This made his faith more real. Wonderful, I can't praise it enough. Check out Chapter 27, pg. 180 for a famous quote. I couldn't help but to think that Hurston knew more than she was telling. I have the feeling that she forsaw the Civil Rights Movement, some 20 years before it actually happened, this book was published in 1939. Very good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To know about the Old Testament is to read Ms Hurston's book","review":"To read Moses, Man of the Mountain, is to read the book of Exodus in the Old Testament Bible. Ms Hurston has a wonderfully unique style of presentation.

I was so moved by this book, I went on to read many other works by her, such as \\"Their eyes were watching God\\", Jonah's Gourd Vine, etc....I have mentioned to many others of how Moses, Man of the Mountain touched me in so many ways! Zora Nell Hurston indeed appears to have been a woman before her time!....."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's no Scott Turow","review":"This book was a disappointment. I've only been a law student for a month, and most of what he said I've already learned. I think it'd be good for outsiders to understand what goes on, but most law students should already know that the big firms are slavedrivers. \\"Double Billing\\" is a much better, much more readable book dealing with the same topic. Keates is an intellectual, and at times he does a good job teaching (even if his audience should already be aware of the facts) and at times he does a good job writing, but he doesn't seem to be able to combine the two. The book gets dull. I would have to recommend \\"One L\\" or \\"Double Billing\\" for people interested in the same topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"WILL CONVINCE YOU NOT TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL!","review":"I would never even consider going to law school after reading this book. The excerpts from the author's diary enable readers to see through the veneer of prestige associated with large-firm law practices and understand what life is really like at a top law firm. For years, I've been hearing that lawyers are often highly dissatisfied with their jobs and lives, despite the high salaries and professional prestige. Until I read this book, though, no one could effectively articulate the specific reasons WHY lawyers tend to be so unhappy (other than the long hours they often work). This book finally fills that void by slowly building the case, chapter by chapter, against life in a large law firm. Through his diary entries, Keates does a fantastic job of describing not only why he is professionally and personally dissatisfied, but also HOW his dissatisfaction affects him over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sincere and true book","review":"It's a very well written book, sincere, honest and profound, with accurate research to back up the conclusions made by the author. Unfortunately, it tells the truth about legal profession, the truth most people are not ready to hear. I would recommend it to anyone making a choice to pursue legal career. It will definitely help you to make an informed choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well made","review":"This radio has a very good rich sound for such a small speaker. The 1 bulb LED flashlight is brighter than I thought it would be. The rubberized case is solid and durable. Two minutes of cranking has consistently provided 45 minutes of play time at average volume. There are 3 big drawbacks. 1. The tuning knob is very small and next to impossible to read. 2. The crank handle is the smallest I've seen and feels like it will break easily. 3. The worst feature is the on/off switch for the flashlight. It is a \\"push\\" round button mounted on the side that keeps turning itself on when you hold the radio or pick it up.

The writing is clear and the examples drawn from contemporary life are particularly vibrant, but this book is not all about Aristotle. It seems to me that the author's vision has been informed more by his spiritual position than by his wrangling with Aristotle. The author is benevolent (benevolent, whose etymolgy is erroneously revealed in these pages) but he writes with the intent of applying Aristotle as a salve for the modern problems he finds most disastrous. Vanier writes best about Aristotle on the topics of desire and friendship. The rest of the book appears a conflation of many ideologies, with Aristole the minimum ingredient."},{"rating":"2","title":"RipDrive 20G by PoGoproducts.com","review":"I love it, highly recommended.

If I could have given it NO stars I would, but the lowest possible rating was one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wes Craven what were you thinking?","review":"The movie was not quite what I was hoping but for the cheap price that I got it for I can't complain much so if you can get it for less than $5 get it just because it is Wes Craven..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craven's worst film.","review":"And I've seen \\"Vampire in Brooklyn\\" and \\"Cursed.\\" This film, however, is humorless and dull. I wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. I knew I was in trouble when my brain shut down during the many conversation scenes between the main character and his best friend. And the finale was all over the place, with characters popping up one after another and tying up plot holes with forced dialogue. I felt like I was watching a spoof of a whodunit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this is the work of Wes Craven!!","review":"Well there's 107 minutes of my life i won't get back (yes, i kept hoping it would redeem itself but it never did). Hands down has to be the most terrible slasher flick I've ever seen. Seriously, not even worth the rental fee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good...for the first 20 minutes","review":"This movie was really good for the first 20 minutes and it had us completely hooked in and scared. After that it started to go a little down hill and got kind of silly in parts, but overall it was still a good movie. I think what kept it from being great is they didn't keep up the momentum created in the first 20 minutes and also the acting wasn't top notch by a few of the characters. This had the potential to be a truly scary movie and I wish it would have kept that feeling from the first 20 minutes up. I still enjoyed the movie rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie Overall","review":"Ok, so yes, this movie uses a lot of elements that have been done before. So what? It uses them well. Max Thieriot does a fantastic job as Bug, and the movie's more a story of growing up and the loss of innocence then anything else It's interesting, and it moves pretty well. Unlike the other reviewers, I am not a fan of Wes Craven movies, but I like this one. If you love horror and slasher films, this probably isn't for you. But if you, like me, love thrillers nd psychological films, then you should definitely watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertaining movie","review":"This is a pretty enjoyable film I had pretty low ecpectations based on what some of the other reviews were saying about this movie. Sure its no oscar winner but if your looking for a fun slasher movie with a supernatural twist definitely check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Soul to Take","review":"I read a lot of reviews about this movie, many of them bad, so I decided to rent it. I''m a Wes Craven fan and I thought I would give it a try despite some of the reviews I read. I'm glad I did. This seems to be a movie you either love or hate. The plot instantly drew me in and I was very impressed with the storyline and the actors. I would consider this movie a cross between \\"Scream\\" and \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\". The bottom line is -if you have read the movie summary and it sounds interesting then rent it and give it a try. I feel this movie was underrated, did it blow me away, no, but I really enjoyed watching it. I hate to say this but the remake of \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" was good but, paled in comparison to this movie and I love Freddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"my soul to take","review":"this movie was awful, if you have A.D.D. then maybe you'll luv it but other than that, you think you are getting a thriller with some scary moments but in fact you are getting part comedy and half crazy. don't buy this, it was a waste of 20.00 dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER...

When it comes to his films no middle ground seems too exist whatsoever. My Soul To Take falls under the category of dog. This film is a watered down slasher movie with supernatual overtones. No suspense, no gore, a confused plot and hideous performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend?","review":"What happend to Wes Craven?His movies used to be so good.I guess he doesn't have the touch anymore.This movie was bad in so many ways.I think it's time for ol' Wes to retire.Do Not waste your time or money on this cr@p!you'll be sorry if you do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not deliver scary","review":"I expected to really be scared, or in suspense with this movie, but I didn't find that, it dragged a little, it was different, but the only real suspense is finding out who really was doing all of the killing not a real shocker once you find out. An okay movie that probably will not get watched twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but not a great film","review":"I was really looking forward to this as Wes Craven was writing and directing like he did back on Nightmare On Elm Street. However in the end it just did not deliver. It was shot really well and the concept was great, but it did not equal the sum of it's parts. It got confusing and lost its focus half way through. it wasn't terrible, but I was just hoping for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie. Other reviews don't do it justice.","review":"I absolutely loved this movie. The movie is a twists together mystery and psychological/supernatural thriller themes. Of course it's not Craven's best, but it is by far his worst. The reviews of this movie just don't do it justice. When watching this you need to make sure you pay attention right from the beginning and have to use your mind to do a little thinking to figure things out. I figured out most of the movie before most of the major facts were revealed just by paying attention and thinking things over to form conclusions. Most people don't want to do that and that is probably why they didn't enjoy this movie. I for one would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Wes Craven thinking?","review":"This movie made me sad. I've loved Wes Craven films for years and was really looking forward to seeing this. Wow, was this was a bad movie.Things start making no sense almost immediately. The dialog is completely inane. None of the characters are likeable, or sympathetic. The story makes very little sense. It's not scary at all. The special effects are laughable. The only character development comes at the end of the movie. The ending is a giant jumbled mess.I don't need my horror films to be full of gore to enjoy them, actually quite the opposite. But a decent, plausible storyline is a must.This was a terrible disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"good standard slasher film fans of the genre","review":"this movie was nothing real special a simple slasher movie like scream you find out who it was at the end of the movie. buy this only if you are a fan of friday the 13th freddy kruker and the halloween series and last but not least the scream franchise. This movie was made for fans of slsher films. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take My Soul...Please","review":"Utterly amazing that anybody could think this clunker was a breath of fresh air, but I digress. All this was, was a big old mess of nothing. Introducing characters who are spiteful, mean, and lacking opposable thumbs AND then building your \\"story\\" around a child's game of \\"tend-like,\\" does not make for good entertainment for anybody. Questions are asked--but NEVER answered, e.g. was \\"Bug\\" schizophrenic, possessed, or just had a bad case of gas? Well...you'll NEVER know. Another shockingly bad plot \\"twist\\" was an entire TOWN gets together to celebrate the grisly murders of seven people. What happened to the Fourth of July? With yet another piece of doo-doo to add to his credit, it seems Wes Craven is fastly gaining pace with George Romero to see whose career tanks first. Right now, I'd say they're neck and neck.The movie is rated R for language and violence, and is a complete waste of time. Rent--if you must--but don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"7 friends share a birthday with the day a serial killer died...are they possesed? Neat idea, bad movie.

This year something different happens. During the annual \\"Ripper day\\" festivities Bug (Thieriot) is chosen to \\"fight off the ripper\\", after he fails his friends say its all a joke anyway and not to worry. But then things go wrong. This movie had a very neat idea : the ripper had seven multiple personalities and seven kids were born the day he died, supposedely with each of his personalities. After the initial build up, the movie never really gets going. I found it to be very boring and not scary at all. I think it was trying to be a \\"Friday the 13th\\" type movie but never got there. This is a movie where after you watch it you feel nothing. I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - Nope"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The front cover says \\"Spine Tingling.\\" When, where, or how was this movie spine tingling. The acting was terrible. The movie was boring and slow and offered nothing that we haven't seen before in horror films. Severe lack of effort here in casting, plot, and dialouge.

They have stuck to her country sound, but added some fresh sounds, including some great harmonica. In these days of abstract \\"country/pop/rock\\", Strong Heart sounds great. Not to say Faith Hills' latest isn't a great album. But for the people that enjoy a good CD with some great country tunes, Strong Heart should be on your want list. Particular standouts are That's The Kind Of Mood I'm In, You're So Cool, and Strong Heart. My only complaint: should have had more music on the CD. Ten songs isn't enough. Thanks Patty for sticking to your roots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patty.....You're So Cool!!!!","review":"This underrated gem ranks with Patty's best work! Patty is always excellent and this is why she will always remain an \\"evergreen\\". She is the only country singer who can take a 60's type song like \\"You're So Cool\\" and make it listenable and before you know it you're singing right along with it!! Reba, Faith, Martina, Shania, Carrie Underwood, Gretchen Wilson and all the rest of those \\"fake country singers\\" are not fit to fill Patty Loveless's shoes. This project is often overlooked but it really is fantastic!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Ill admit first off, I love Patty Loveless she is a great singer. This album was her first real studio album since 1997's Long Stretch of Lonesome. So it was almost 3 years since her last. Thats a long wait, and after such a great album, one of her best yet, theres Strong Heart. Theres the fun Thats The Kind of Mood Im In which is the standout, but otherwise the collection seems to drift into nowhere and the songs dont seem to flow well together. I found it personally a little disapointing after such a long wait, and after such a great album as Long Stretch of Lonesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Effort","review":"This album is not Patty's best, but it isn't her worst either. I like how this album is so diversified with such a different variety of songs-all flow into one another great. The opening track, \\"You're So Cool\\" sounds kind of like something a child singer would sing but the more I listen to it Patty pulls it off somehow. The albums strongest songs are \\"Strong Heart\\", \\"That's The Kind Of Mood I'm In\\", \\"Thirsty\\" and \\"She Never Stopped Loving Him\\". It may not be her best but this album is a welcome addition to any CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT resource!","review":"Can't say enuf about the excellent in-depth knowledge about the video business that's contained in this book.

I do not think it is to do with the storyline. I think the setting is ripe with potential, a coming-of-age novel, set in ancient Greek about a courtesan's daughter and how she finds love and freedom. The author has done her research so most details are accurate.No, it is the writing that fails it. A boring portrayal of a very interesting setting. The writing was stunted and not at all smooth, making the novel an agony to read because one couldn't read it quickly enough to get involved.

They've mixed a nice compilation of deep techhouse and very minimal tracks.

This is the duo compiling some of their favorite tunes and their all in the deep, micro house vein with alot of dub effects. That being said, don't be scared away because this is one of the best mixes to come around in a long time.With cuts from Luomo(Vadislav Delay) Basic Channel and Akufen to name a few, you know what you're getting: sparse, deeply dubby groovers that completeley engulf you in their sound.

Gina does an OK job in singing, but the movie is titled incorrectly. The band that this is about is a punk band, not a rock & roll band. So, the title is very misleading. Punk and Rock & Roll are not the same genre, so it should have been titled \\"Prey for Punk\\".Gina is a good singer when she sings slower melodies, but she doesn't know how to sing punk or rock & roll.She is incredibly attractive though. So, if you just want to see her looking hot, then buy this. If you want a good quality film, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"'prey' for the end of this movie","review":"The opposite of love is not hate, it's apathy and that's how I feel about this movie. It's not great, but it's not terrible, it's just so...mediocre. Gina Gershon's Jacki is not a has-been because, at 40, she never was.

Marc Blucas (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Wes Craven Presents THEY) has a decent role as the brother named Animal of the drummer of the band, played by Shelly Cole. Drea DeMatteo (The Sopranos, Tv's Joey) plays the bassist of the band who has a alcohol problem and also a rapist boyfriend.

I know she spent a long time getting to this realization, but more time should have been spent on writing a decent screenplay. The heroine/madonna, herion addict, lesbian couple seems played out.The energy is there, but when you add awful lines about addiction and why these women have stayed so long in the business, not to mention that if they have been prey to to this lifestyle called Rock N Roll, I just don't buy it.

This CD compilation fills in all the gaps. It is a joy from start to finish. CD 1 contains all the old favorites and some less familiar songs. It's all spare, quirky, driving post-punk fun and will likely be the favorite of people who remember them from that time. CD 2 is a revelation and is fast becoming my favorite part of the album. LiLiPUT's later songs have them exploring no-wave and funk territory that sounds so New York. I had no idea. At turns they resemble the Velvet Underground meets DNA, the Bush Tetras meet the Contortions, Y-Pants meets Teenage Jesus and the Jerks. But always they are uniquely LiLiPUT. Their music still sounds fresh 25 years later. I am more a fan than ever. These two discs are essential for post-punk fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Finally! When I heard this 2-disc album was being re-released, I thought it was very appropriate that this label in particular would put it back out. Kleenex/LiLiPUT is one of those groups that makes fun songs to listen to. Put on this CD and you'll want to sing along to it everytime. Oh yes, and the songs \\"Ain't You\\" and \\"Boatsong\\" are among my favorites. The whole thing is great though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Punk Genius","review":"As a long time fan of Liliput, it is fantastic that I can finally put to rest my old (and worn out) 45's of this band.

Mine stopped being recognized by computers a month ago, and creative labs (terrible cust. service by the way) is telling me i have to pay 40 bucks to get it fixed. I really have a hard time trusting in these products when creative labs themselves can't trust the products they make enough to give them at least a 1 yr warranty.

Excellent picture in blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Hoot!","review":"After watching several movies that really stunk, this was a refreshing change. Filled with a bleak atmosphere, this dark story kept me interested from the first scene. I loved the WW1 inspired machinery that is peppered throughout the story. The hero, or as I call him, \\"Sarge\\" was a great caricature of the tough army NCO that keeps on going. The special effects are great, though the gore was a bit overdone.As typical for this type of movie, there aren't many survivors, so it's just a matter of guessing which sidekick gets knocked off first.This is certainly not everyone's cup of tea, but it kept me awake and entertained from start to finish. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ridiculous","review":"Do not waste your time or money for this movie.There is no plot; You wait for it to develop, you wait and you wait some more but nothing happens. There is no character development or whatsoever; the mutants are nowhere near scary... I cannot even find intelligent remarks to review this movie. It is ridiculously bad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid is as Stupid Does","review":"Mutant Chronicles was destined to be a B movie with low production values, budget effects and second if not third string actors. I like Thomas Jane and The Mist is proof that he can act if given somewhat decent material. Alas, with The Punisher and now this bookending The Mist his career seems destined for films that are low budget and maybe even straight to DVD. I wouldn't waste my time on this one unless you can appreciate it despite the bad acting, the horrible effects, the dismal plot and the complete stupidity of it all. I like bad movies. It takes some kinda genius to hit that master stroke that turns a bad movie into a good movie. The Mutant Chronicles goes straight to bad and never pushes past that to shine and become good. If you want to see a good low budget movie with cool effects get a copy of Outlander. That movie, complete with Norsemen battling alongside a spaceman against an alien dragon was far more entertaining then this pap could ever aspire to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I had such high hopes for this movie since it had some steam-ish elements in the trailer. Well, it relies on the same old good versus evil gimmicks, science vs religion, corporate heads exploit the workers, rich people screw the poor, blah blah blah. There were times where it was visually interesting, but it really fell flat. Dull script, flat characters, no real plot, even the actors couldn't save this. Only if you are ridiculously bored should you bother watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I can't believe that anyone gave this more than 2 stars. I was hopeful when I saw the cast, but the people who say the CGI was good and the acting was good...I cried a little that I lost 2 hours of my life. The story doesn't even make sense. The mutants take humans to the machine to be changed, and from what the movie shows, it takes a long time to get someone down to the machine. So the fact there is this rampant mutant outbreak in like five minutes or even days is ridiculous. It might be the only movie I have ever told someone to completely avoid. There really is nothing worth watching in this...except maybe the...nope, nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing unclear plot for the uninitiated","review":"First time I watched this blu-ray, it felt like I had gotten plopped in mid-movie, or perhaps in the middle episode of a serial TV series. The whole backstory is explained very poorly, and it took till halfway through the movie to understand key plot elements. In some cases, it took until I watched the extra features before I really understood certain elements. I get the feeling the writers assumed the viewer would already be a fan of the role-playing game and already understood the basic \\"world\\" that movie is set in. For uninitiated viewers like myself, much of it was terribly unclear. Also, for me personally at least, I did not enjoy the overly video-game look, particularly dominant in the first part of the movie, where the soldiers and war scenes looked totally fake and CGIed and it felt like you were watching a video game instead of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cult Classic in the Making","review":"I initialy found this movie looking through comics related stuff, and thought it looked like total crap and wrote it off as just that. It continued to pop-up here and there in searches and I continued to ignore it, then I saw a movie on SciFi Channel and it immediately caught my attention. It wasn't long before I realized it was Mutant Chronicles and by that time I was hooked. For me, this is one of those movies that strike a cord within the imagination. I instantly started looking for anything else related to Mutant Chronicles. This is a brilliant, albeit \\"B\\" grade movie with great actors delivering super performances. It has an awesome atmosphere accentuated by the cinematography and washed out colors. At the end I found myself seriously hoping to see this as the beginning of a series. It's simply a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of a bunch of other movies","review":"It seems every year Hollywood dumps out a movie that is some combination of zombies, alien invasion, gory violence, gunplay and swordfighting all rolled into one. For 2008, this was Mutant Chronicles, a movie about an ancient alien device that is re-awakened by WWIII and starts to turn mankind into zombies. An international crew of soldiers, both guys and gals, are teamed up to destroy, or at least turn of, the alien device. The movie has nothing special about its plot, dialogue, or even special effects. All in all, a waste of almost 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been worse","review":"There is really nothing compelling about this film. While the concept is not terrible - rather deadly, somewhat mutated \\"zombies\\" overrunning the earth in the far future (2400 or something), across a barely surviving earth, the actual execution leaves much to be desired; not the least the gaping plot holes.Above all, why can't the humans just drop a whole bunch of big bombs, or a nuclear bomb, down the hole with the \\"machine\\"? Or can't they cave in the hole and seal it like the Vikings seem to have done in the year 600 or something?The acting is exaggerated, with dull uninspired characters.So what's good about it? Well, it's not just a zombie movie. And the several times over post apocalyptic world is well done for a lower budget film. On the other hand, there is really no depth or \\"insight\\" from this film, like 28 days later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whole lot of nothing...","review":"Wow, I can't believe all of the good reviews for this piece of crud.

I start to vomit in my mouth when I think I spent money on it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil Mutant Machine must be destroyed","review":"We watched this on the SciFi channel because we like some of the actors in it. This is a rather typical post-apocalyptic 'save the world' storyline. The movie starts with steam-punk trench warfare a la World War One; and then the mutants are unleashed. Of course some nice monks have been saving the knowledge of how to defeat evil (think 5th Element) and they gather a band of unlikely heros to destroy the machine that is making the evil mutants. Meanwhile a small portion of the Earth's population flees to colonies on Mars. Lots of predictable fighting transpires as the hero team gets killed off one by one. Then the main hero plugs in what is supposed to be a bomb and activates it, and the evil mutant machine is actually a spaceship that launches. The closing scene shows the ship arcing towards Mars. Poetic justice and all that. A solid B-level movie, very dark, very violent, and pretty boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Story...","review":"A very readable story that happened 30 years ago.

One of Lexmark's suggested fixes for when I couldn't coax anything from my X85 was to unplug all the cables and let it sit overnight -- mixed results. Reliability has become more erratic with time. It may be that I have updated my operating system, and although I have downloaded new drivers that are supposed to work for my new OS from Lexmark's website, the software is very buggy. Also worth considering is the X85 really doesn't seem to like you to refill your own cartridges -- too bad because the cartridges are very expensive and it is a nasty waste of materials to throw these things away.Perhaps this product works OK in the Windows world -- I don't know.

The only thing with this is that when she swallowed bits of the bone before I was able to see that she'd bitten into it, she developed a serious rash all over her body and one of her eyes swelled almost shut. I gave her benadryll and that seemed to do the trick. Beware of not checking this bone often for small parts eaten off; the color on the ends is deceptive because the undercoating is the same color. It would do fine for a dog with not such a strong bite reflex."},{"rating":"1","title":"bloody mess...","review":"Not a healthy chew toy. Ends of bone are made of hard plastic which becomes jagged and sharp after only a little bit of chewing. Because of bulbous shape of bone, the jagged plastic rubs against dogs' gums, causing bleeding.There are other bones made from similar plastic, that are much flatter shaped--helping reduce the chance of plastic cutting into dogs' gums.Or you could try the Kong rubber bonesKONG Goodie Bone Dog Toy, Medium, Red. They last pretty long with our two mid-sized moderately aggressive chewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy this again","review":"I bought this toy for my lap puppy who is 6 months old. Within 24 hours, small shards of the plastic were wearing off. I immediately threw it away because I was worried about him digesting the small pieces of plastic. I cannot believe someone has not made the Nylabone folks pull this off the shelf. It really worries me that they say it is Vet approved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for heavy chewer","review":"MY GSD loves this bone. Like most GSDs she absolutely destroys any normal non \\"K9\\" type of chew toy. However these last a long time (9 mo at least) and don't form sharp edges until the chew has finally given it's all.

I would not recommend this item for powerful or extreme chewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not be buying this again!","review":"I know that my 1 year old bulldog is an extreme chewer, so I bought him this toy. I had read the reviews about the middle part being chewed off, but I didn't think that my dog would or could chew off the middle part, especially since he had different nylabones before and he loved chewing the part he was SUPPOSED to chew. I WAS SO WRONG. The first thing he did was chew up the middle part and had chewed pieces off in less than an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only thing that lasts!","review":"I have 7 dogs....from 18 pounds to 117 pounds.

Once we bought these bones for them it has made our life much easier. They love them and they seem to really satisfy their urge to chew. Even our older dog loves them. Every night after dinner our older dogs spends about 30 minutes chewing the heck out of it. I guess it's her tooth brush. They don't get slimey or have pieces breaking off like other chew toys we have tried... and they last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nylabone Big Dog Chew Bone","review":"I did not like this chew bone AT ALL. My poor lab's mouth started bleeding after just chewing a few minutes. My daughter noticed pink in her mouth. After checking the bone I decided to return it. The nubs on the end turned pointed immediately causing the bleeding. I like Nylabone products, just not this one. Amazon sent me a return shipping label and credited my account right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great nylabone","review":"The thing I like best about this nylabone, is that the ends are HUGE.

With the introduction of a new German shepherd puppy into the household, I remembered what a hard time I had the first go round with chewing.

He is a very aggressive chewer as well. We don't know how he has any teeth left. This bone lasts about a month for him constantly chewing on it. The ends of this seem to be big enough that he cannot get his mouth and teeth around it in order for him to really break it apart. After a while, he chews the very tips off and then it's all down hill from there for the bone, but it still lasts about a month total. I buy these often and he absolutely loves them. I highly recommend this bone for aggressive chewers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Repeat Purchase","review":"This is the second time I purchased one of these. The dogs love it because it has different textures. I love it because it lasts! This size is good for a large dog (lab, golden)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the ends are not solid","review":"My 70lb yellow lab is a power chewer, and seems to think her mission in chewing is to pick things apart (like meat off a bone). I've been really pleased with almost all of the Nylabone products that we've given her, and my only reservation with this bone was that she might go on a search and destroy mission on the green part.But what happened instead was that she picked apart the end pieces, getting \\"too large to ingest\\" chunks off, and revealed the hollow center. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"one day later the rubber center is in bits all over my living room floor","review":"I had such high hopes for this bone! I own a staffordshire bull terrier who is a powerful and voracious chewer. The plastic ends of the bone would be perfect for her, but they put this rubber layer in the middle (the green part) and she has torn it to shreds. I gave it to her last night and this morning I have little green rubber bits all over my floor and she ingested a fair amount of it (says it's non-toxic and hasn't seemed to bother her). In any case, if your dog likes to shred rubber this is not a good option!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for aggressive chewers","review":"I just got a little dog-a terrier cross who weighs fourteen pounds soaking wet. He is the most aggressive chewer I have ever owned. He goes through toys labeled \\"Battle Tested\\" and \\"For Large Dogs\\" in less than a day. Even worse, he swallows everything he bites off his toys. I didn't think a Nylabone would work for him because the really durable ones are so big but I was at my wit's end so I got him this toy. He loves it-he will lay there chewing on it for half an hour at a time and so far all he's managed to do is scuff up the ends a little. He also carries it around, despite its size, and sometimes even tosses it. He has a lot of fun with it and I finally have a toy he can play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's terrible that Otto Dix remains a silent genius.","review":"This book is damn wonderful.

He's dead you know, shouldn't he be getting more attention?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Flute, Less Accompaniment","review":"The premise is nice, but before the end of the first track, I was disappointed. The flute was drowned out by what should have been the background music. Indian flutes have a very beautiful and unique tone and sound, but it was difficult to hear on this cd. At times it did take center stage, but for the most part, I felt the \\"star\\" of this genre played second fiddle to overimaginative keyboard music.If you want to hear the flute in all its beauty, I suggest some of Mary Youngblood's music, particularly Beneath the Raven Moon and The Offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of DVD space, less than a half hour!","review":"What is this new trend that Warner Brothers is doing with their Hanna Barbera product? We already know that the DVD sets are a success.This episode is from the 1980's revival of the show, so the episode is not in the Season One box set.

The episode is only 22 minutes long (even though the box says 27 minutes), having had 3 minutes cut out for extra commercials. Also, the ending titles are not the original ones and the opening titles have the \\"modern\\" version of the theme over the visuals. The remaining running time is filled with trivia and ads. This is actually a DVD version of a VHS tape that came out right before the Jetsons movie was released years ago.

This is a very slim text (especially considering how much it costs), only 139 pages in total, and not surprisingly, there's just not that much in it. Pfaff covers a reasonably large range of topics, including stationary ARMA processes, cointegration, unit root tests, etc, but only a few pages are devoted to each topic and no worked examples are provided to assist the reader's understanding (exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, but no solutions are given). As the title suggests, some R code is given to implement various techniques that are described throughout this book, but this is never annotated and you would be better off looking at one of the various R tutorials that can be obtained for free on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While I love the colors and look of this dish set, like so many other reviewers I have found some serious shortcomings. The dishes do chip extremely easily. As one reviewer put it, \\"they chip if you look at them\\" which I have found to be a very apt description. Additionally, you can't practically use them in the microwave despite being \\"microwave safe.\\" They become extremely hot to the touch if you heat long enough for your food to become warm. (I use a hot pad to take them out without burning myself.) Finally, the dinner plates themselves are huge and don't fit into the dishwasher unless I move the top rack to its highest level. Of course you are guaranteed a chip if you put them in the diswasher.... I would not recommend these dishes to anyone and will probably not purchase Pfaltzgraff again. If you do decide to buy them, treat them more gently than you would your fine china."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Pleased","review":"I received my set yesterday and I must tell how BEAUTIFUL it is!

I did not write my review immediately because I seldom write reviews. Since I could not afford to right away, I am now trying to replace this set with Fiestaware.

In several of the songs, it is often weird and intriguing (even if it is for minute or less; five minutes or more).

I like the tone, the flavor of this harkens-back-to-olden-times-of-storytelling piece, but the author's run-on sentences and paragraphs, his dialogue that is smooshed into the narrative action, just becomes tiring and not as effective a stylistic device as I think he intended. The drawings by Peter Sis are not nearly as inspired or as evocative as the ones he did for Dominguez's \\"The House of Paper,\\" which adds to the disappointment I had with this book. Short, but definitely not sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting mythic poetic story","review":"This beautiful little fable has been compared to Antoine de Saint-Exupery's \\"The Little Prince.\\" It can easily be read in one short sitting, but skip the jacket blurb, which detracts from the impact of the book itself. A man goes to the door of petitions to ask the king for a boat so that he can find the unknown island. The king is busy waiting at the door of favors for boons from his subjects, so the door of petitions is finally answered by the cleaning woman. When the persistent petitioner finally receives his boat from the king, his destiny becomes linked with that of the cleaning woman. The peculiar punctuation of this book makes the reader search within for meaning and adds to the book's poetry, depth, and wisdom.If you've already read this book and want more in this vein, trySnow : A Novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tale of a quixotic quest","review":"\\"The Tale of the Unknown Island,\\" by Jose Saramago, has been translated from Portuguese into English by Margaret Jull Costa and is accompanied by illustrations by Peter Sis. It's a short book--only 51 pages long. A capsule bio on the dustcover notes that Saramago was born in Portugal and received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998.This short tale has the flavor of a parable or fable. It concerns a man on a quest to find an unknown island. The story opens in an unnamed kingdom, and none of the characters have proper names; this gives the tale a sort of universal, mythic feel.The story is well enhanced by Sis's charming, surreal illustrations. Saramago weaves some nice concrete details into the story. His prose style, as translated by Costa, is smooth and clear. This is a story of discovery with an open-ended but satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"sixkillerseries","review":"DVDs arrived in a timely manner and as described by the seller.

Perhaps it's because, by the nature of the narrative, Merlin must now take a back seat to the adult Arthur, the High King and a growing legend to his people. The enchanter is also growing older, the power of the gods is leaving him bit by bit, and he's relegated to undercover espionage work in the north of the country, spying on Arthur's treacherous half-sister, Morgause. Stewart does a good job of re-interpreting the legend of Merlin being shut up alive (\\"waiting\\") in his cave in the hollow hill, and, as throughout the 900 pages of the trilogy, the author displays amazing powers of description, both of the characters and of their surroundings. Give it ten years to settle into my unconscious and I shall be re-reading this marvelous epic yet again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best king Arthur story.","review":"This is a great book and concludes a fabulous triology. Stewart finds just the right balance of historical fiction and fantasy, creating a Merlin and King Arthur who are not as they really were but are has they might have been if we indulge a imagination just a little. The characters are real and compelling. And though all three books are accessible to young readers, the books are just as entertaining for adults. I can't say enough about this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Audio Version is Truly Moving","review":"I have just finished listening to the Chivers Audiobooks' recording of The Last Enchantment, read masterfully by Stephen Thorne.

He brought the many characters and scenes completely and vividly to life. I know that years ago I read and enjoyed The Crystal Cave and The Hollow Hills, but I have the audio versions on order at the library so that I can enjoy Mr. Thorne's reading of them. In listening to Mr. Thorne read them, I know he'll bring a completely new dimension to the stories.

It's a heavy rock sound as you would expect from the year 1970 and plays much in a Hendrix style. The lyrics sung by Frank Diez are in english with only a mild accent. I guess there are some progressive elements but it's mostly made up of heavy guitar riffs and some good soloing as well.The six tracks consist of some fine original material along with a Spooky Tooth cover and a 10-minute rendition of Jeff Beck Group's Rice Pudding as well. A nice addition for fans of 69-71 heavy guitar rock and kraut rock in general.Track listing:1. Round2. Open3. Oh Man4. Rice Pudding5. People Talking6.

I liked it so much, that I bought another. The same thing happened, the seams came apart, but this time it happened almost immediately. I contacted Trager and they asked me to send it in for repair or replacement. I did this. Then I NEVER heard back from them again. I have emailed, called and left VMs and tried everything. They have never responded to me. I now have to buy something else as I have been without the bag I was using every day.

It measures in tenths of a pound.\\" When I got it home to test it out, I discovered by the next day that it was only measuring in increments of 1/2 pound. That may be fine for most people, but I am losing weight at the rate of 1/4 pound per day, and a scale that measures only 1/2 pound does not help me keep track of my weight. Nowhere on the package does it say that it only measures in increments of 1/2 pound (I bought this scale at Costco from a large display.) Amazon, to its credit, does say this in the description, in fact they are the only ones to mention it. Bravo for Amazon! I will be taking the scale back to Costco which is a shame, since I bought it there for less than $20 and it seemed like a good deal at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT for Nokia 2600","review":"I ordered it thinking it was a charger for my nokia 2600.

I have been using it in my devotions and have found it refreshing in my studies. It makes translating the text much easier by leaving out the words that appear over 50 times in the Greek.If you Greek is limited or your are a Greek student wanting a Greek New Testament that is both readable and easy to translate then this is your book. I would still encourage you to refer to the complete Greek New Testament from time to time to keep your translating up to date and in line with proper Greek exegesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Blessing","review":"While the editors have greatly added to the ease of picking up more vocabulary than is learned in Mounce's course, there are two major drawbacks to this Greek New Testatment. First, is the use of a somewhat italic Greek font that results in some characters differing considerably from other Greek fonts. In particular are the characters for rho (which looks like an omicron with some form of subscript) and the kappa which looks like a lower case English \\"x\\"). The second, and more critical drawback, is that this is a reverse engineered text based on the selections made by the NIV translation committee (per the editors description in the introduction).At least the latter of these should be made clear in the book's description and the editors should certainly consider a more standard font in future editions.It's not that I will pitch this volume out, it is that I wish it could have been better than it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Stuff!","review":"I have found this to be quite a useful tool! I have only taken one full semester (and a third) of Greek but I am taking this to church and using it and it actually helps!

I do still use my English Bible alongside it but it is a great encouragement to have and use as I study Greek. It's definately cool stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a useful tool, especially if you don't like carrying around a lexicon","review":"The nice thing about this particular Greek NT is that words occurring less than 30 times within the NT are defined at the bottom of the page, which is convenient and makes reading the text much smoother. As a student of Greek, I've also found it helpful for figuring out what the verb is for some of those vastly irregular forms.

What I got was a rotten story that confused me. I think Pras and his unknown partner shouldn't write anymore books. This one was the worst I ever read. Just when you start getting into one character, the writers start spending ten pages telling you about how wooden benches in a church looked. And there were a lot of long words used in the wrong context. It was as if these writers tried to be \\"intelligent.\\" The book has not suspense in it. The ending was also unclear and badly written. Everyone was in one room pointing guns at each other like a Quentin Tarantino movie. This book is played out. I should have known when I saw the writer Pras on the cover in a disco shirt that he's more about style over substance. Save your money and don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Diamond\\" in the rough.","review":"This book was not as good as I thought it was going to be, but it was not as bad as it could have been. Centering around Diamond St. James, and his struggle to rise above the poverty surrounding him and his mother, by using his talent in rap music to become a star. Offsetting him is best friend, Gage, who has a violent streak in him a mile wide and will use his muscle and malice to gain enough money to keep his friend in rehersal studios until his big break comes. Easily misled by Gage, Diamond sometimes find himself assisting him and his ill-gotten plans to finance his future, and promises himself it will be the last, until the next time the well starts to run dry. The part of the book that was so distracting was the fact that the story was told in various points of view, but you had to read two to five lines before you could figure out who was doing the talking. All in all, a good, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet","review":"I have traveled to most all \\"corners\\" of the world and purchased many guidebooks.

Those two talks plus another two in the same package and that cheap? I had to buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heart of Passion","review":"This is without a doubt the most powerful, inspirational DVDs I have ever watched. Although meant for young adults primarily, Lou Giglio speaks to all ages with a passion that reaches each heart. Not only have my husband and I bought the set for ourselves, but have bought his DVDs as gifts for our adult children and friends. They speak of the power and grace of God in a way that speaks to Christians and non-Christians alike. Two of these DVDs show in detail the remarkable creation of God using science...Indescribable and How Great is Our God. I want to share this set with my whole world and they make a great witnessing tool.

It's hard enough trying to wrap your mind around the forgiveness that our God can offer us, and that he was once human in Christ Jesus, but to see a \\"glimpse\\" of how BIG God is.... it's impossible, and amazing, and life changing all in one.

The most interesting and important part of the story is the cast. One develops a real affection for many of the characters, and the wrap-up lets the reader find out what happened to them after the main story is concluded. It's rather like being able to stay in touch with old friends. I do think that the book was poorly served by its cover, which gives no hint of the quality of the writing. I observed that this might be Dalmas' best book yet because as a writer he continues to grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Sorry. If I could give less stars then I would have.I was very disapointed and had to look at Mr. Dalmas peers in the field to see why I didn't like it.First, There is a very large gap of technical knowledge in this book.Cyborgs called Warbots? How are they armored? How are they powered? Can their sensors be disabled, What does a bottled Person think about?What are the capabilities of a warbot?What are the weapons fired by a trooper? What exactly is a pulse? Is this a sonic distruptor or plasma weapon?You have Heavy gravity worlders traing on a lighter world then their own and the drill instructors are also from a weaker world. What problems did it cause? What about hand to hand combat?This book just never lived up to its potential and if I can save anyone from wasting their money on it all the better.

It is easy to get the knives in and out and to see which one I'm getting (blades not hidden in a knife block.) Unlike magnetic strips, there are no exposed blades.

Buckley's history-in-fiction books have all been excellent, and this one is no exception. Having had much exposure to Randians in the late 1970s it was nice to get a clear picture of the movement and it's foundress. As also the JBS folks. One understands the animosity between the JBS folks and the NR folks a bit better. The truth hurts. I hope he writes more of these! Buy the book and have a nice dinner at Paone's in NYC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"A compelling read. I particularly appreciated the characterization. Ayn Rand as Jim Jones, with just a touch of Colonel Klink, was inspired. Dead on, and don't let other reviews fool you - wonderfully perceptive vis-à-vis the Witchdoctress that was Rand and her cult.For a slim volume, there was a sprawling, across-the-years feel that delighted as well as informed.I have always enjoyed Mr. Buckley's work. This was no exception, and hats are off. Could Mr. Buckley be persuaded to apply the same dramatic instinct with knowledge of recent history to finally do justice to President Reagan?The ending, although something of a letdown, was true to the novel, and true to the era and the people it portrayed. What else could Woodroe do?Highly recommended. A great gift idea for your conservative friends - and an even better idea for your leftist ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wretched excuse of a novel","review":"As a long-time professional reviewer, I've had the good fortune to read any number of wonderful novels. But luck wasn't with me this time. William F. Buckley's purported historical novel is utterly wretched, either as sound history or as readable fiction. The lapses in drama, dialogue, and characterization are laughable; the liberties taken with historic facts and the reputations of historic personages are unconscionable. The only reason I didn't score this piece of [garbage] a zero here, is that the option wasn't available to me.

Buckley, the Renaissance man in gear as an entertaining, witty, talented underrated in a dumbed down culture, novelist.

The novel is artfully written and quite fair and accurate about events non-mormon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a book I have had since I was a very small child, and is the book I think of when I think of being very small. My father read this book to me every night, and one of the reasons why I loved it so much was because it is filled with amazing, unusual stories, poems, and songs that you don't just find in any story book. The stories are a perfect length, so you can read one and have a great bedtime story, or read a bunch of them and have a great way to spend a rainy day. I was looking to get a copy for my boyfriend's niece and nephew and find it very interesting that it is so much money (I never thought this amazing hardcover book would be so valuable!).

Singer Dave Brothers is at the center of a tight, hard-driving rhythm section, delivering poetic knock-out punches like \\"Got to love it, got to lose it/ Weed art road soldiers/ Like song to the kill\\" (the \\"it\\" being life likened to the Cadillac Ranch out west, where cars stand nose-dived into the earth).The only real short-comings here are the tinny, choppy acoustic guitar on the opening track and a few production shortcuts that probably came down to funding issues. Also,the lead voice is sometimes too prominent and too dry, and a few more harmonies might be nice.But overall, the band is hot, the delivery full of angst (give the free download of \\"Blue Blood\\" a good loud spin if you don't want to take my word for it) and the writing literate and a little bit wild.I hope this is one unknown that might start getting more of the attention it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skin Tight is for the reader who craves excitement and humor","review":"I stumbled across this novel in my friends pile of books, and on his recommendation, started reading.

I thought all of the characters in the novel were fully-developed and each had a personality of its own. I like Hiassen's creative description of people, places, and things, such as Chemo's weed-whacker prosthesis, the \\"Gay Bidet\\", and Mick Stranahan's personality.

Ultimately, it feels like Carl has begun to \\"mail it in\\". His books are now so formulaic....it's like a college kid wrote a derivative Hiaasen novel...hell, I think I could write one by now. It just isn't well or thoughtfully written, and this from someone who has loved Hiaasen's work in the past. There are a few chuckles, but it all seems forced. It's like he peaked with Nature Girl and has lost his edge.I wouldn't recommend this book....I was bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moral indignation expressed through cynical, viscious humor","review":"While I was reading Skin Tight, someone asked me what the book was about. As I tried to describe the basic storyline, I realized that the plot is not only hard to explain but extremely farfetched,bordering on preposterous. However, that's beside the point.The joy of reading this book comes from the way Hiaasen uses his wicked sense of humor and his vast writing skills to lambast society's corruption and greed. While protagonist Mick Stranahan is fighting mafia hitmen and outsmarting crooked cops, Hiaasen himself is busy skewering inept plastic surgeons and their narcissistic patients, made-for-tv lawyers, on-the-take politicians, corrupt judges, tourists, sleazy journalists, actresses, fashion models . . . and, I almost forgot, tree trimmers.Hiaasen's collection of colorful characters, fast-paced dialogue and ascerbic wit make Skin Tight an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Carl Hiaasen writes it then I buy it!","review":"This is the 7th \\"Skin Tight\\" book I've purchased, it's one of the funniest books I've read, Carl's sense of humor is terrific.

I would expect no other author to create an ex-Amish hit man with a horrible facial disfigurement and a weed whacker for a hand replacement, and make him believable. Unlike some of Hiaasen's other novels, the situation here isn't completely outrageous... just the cast (including Reynaldo Flemm, who is so obviously patterned after Geraldo Rivera in his early days of being attacked by white supremacists). Someone is trying to kill Mick Stranahan, and once he discovers that it's related to the disappearance of a young woman four years ago, he figures the best way for his life to return to its peaceful normality is for him to solve that mystery. It becomes a game of kill or be killed for Mick, and along the way he may just have met his 6th wife.

But I don't get it. The jokes seemed familiar, like ones I'd heard before. The characters were just too lame to endure. It's not that I demand sympathetic characters, it's just that I'd like a reason to care what happens to them. Maybe a more compelling mystery would've kept my interest. Maybe not. Wacky just wasn't enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Note","review":"Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil. He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our \\"hero\\" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place. The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.You can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"I ordered this book after reading the superlative online reviews it recceived here. Perhaps Hiassen is an acquired taste, but this book left me cold. The characters were not well developed, the plot was not compelling, and the writing was not crisp.

Hiaasen does not believe in complex people who are mostly good but sometimes tempted into evil.I stopped counting the bodies at seven. The higher the pile of corpses, the less clothing and/or morals.This book came highly recommended, so I hung in there to the end, hoping it would get better. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time to read","review":"Clearly one of the worst pieces of junk I've ever had the misfortune to read. I can't believe it got into print.

I want to hear what someone can do with a pair of 1200's and a mixer. (If the mixing is done via computer - why would I even care what the DJ's name is?)I also thought it was a bit annoying to make the first track a couple of minutes of silence for a DJ that passed away. I mean - that's what liner notes are for. I'm sorry DJ Liquid's friend passed away - but I've got all the silence I could ever want if I turn the music off, I don't need to buy cd's with blank tracks.The track selection was a bit cheesy, but there are some good breaks here.

It's pretty pompous for him to title himself as a DJ, when he is clearly not anything similar to a real DJ.Secondly, the music is terrible.

Now, unfortunately, it's not really complete because \\"River of Dreams\\" was released afterwards; but good sheet music is available for that album as well.Now that the collection is comprehensive, my only real complaint is that the transcriptions don't include the solos and other idiosynchrocies, just the basics (though Billy's \\"basics\\" are often more complex than other pianists' solos).

Why someone would put religious comments in a job search book is beyond me. I threw this book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds good in theory, but ridiculous in practice","review":"This book is absolute garbage. My only regret with this review is that I can't give it less than one star. Bolles' advice is impractical and seriously misleads a job hunter. The \\"old way\\" of getting jobs, which Bolles disparages, is still the only realistic way of landing a job. Sure, its a tough process, but its the only thing out there.If Bolles really had the answer, his book would outsell McDonalds. And it hasnt. Save your money , and your time. Avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"My parachute deflated...","review":"I was confused with this workbook from the second I started using it.

Get a book by J. Far instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Color Is Your Parachute Workbook","review":"The book is mostly limitless propaganda. I had to order it for a career building course."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Color is Your Parachute","review":"The book was shipped in a timely manner, however it was in horrible condition. At some point it must have been dropped in the water and the whole book is a mess. Not happy with this. The book was advertised as in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some diamonds, a lot of rough...","review":"Two stars for practical tips on job-hunting and interviewing. The book starts to lose focus about half way through as it spends several long chapters on things like \\"determining what skills you have\\" and \\"finding out what you want in a job\\". These parts were useless for me (but they may be useful for others).My biggest complaint: As other reviewers pointed out, at the very end of the book, the author totally shifts gears and delivers an utterly inappropriate Christian sermon as a 20-page epilogue. Regardless of your own religious beliefs, you will find the change in tone from the last chapter to be very jarring, and you will wonder if you are still reading the same book. Where was the editor when he slipped THIS into the presses?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of pages, little content.","review":"Parachute had a lot of \\"fluff\\" and rambleing in it. Also the exercies in the book all did the same thing and seemed rather pointless. Several situations seemed unrealistic and some of his suggestions for the interviews may make the interviewer somewhat rude. It applys that everyone in the working feild is going to help you out as much as they can even though they never meet you before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fluffy","review":"This book has some interesting material, but is spaced out so much. It is too chatty, too religious. It should be brief and concise, then people would have a realistic chance of reading it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much religion","review":"This book should carry a warning label \\"Prepare to be bombarded with Christianity!\\" I bought this book in hopes that it would live up to its reputation unfortunately I'm not sure I'm going to be able to gain any benefit from it because of wading through all of the religion the author forced into the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required Reading for me","review":"As a student taking an internship, this book is required reading as part of my program. I am on the last chapter right now and have found this book to offer little insight on any kind of career choices, and the tips for interviews are either common sense, or far-fetched. This book may offer some insight only if the reader knows their general direction and may need motivation, but to a college student I would suggest getting some other information elsewhere, say a career development center. This book should be a last resort if you really have problems getting hired."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book does not apply to all","review":"As a professional with graduate degrees in business and science, I was extremely disappointed in this resource for 3 reasons. One, the \\"language\\" of the book is characteristic of grade schools texts and inherently instills doubt in the books arguments, objectives and goals. Two, the statistics compiled in the text are outdated and discounted by the author on multiple occasions. Finally, and most importantly, the resource appears to be most applicable to those in the blue collar field. Many examples and self-marketing strategies target positions or firms which require less education and even experience.Overall, the book is written at a level for children and suggests strategies that are great if you are not a well educated and seasoned professional. For a book that generates 20,000 copy revenues per month, I was shocked. This text is not for a seasoned professional contemplating a vertical or horizontal career change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool for job seekers","review":"This book (and accompanying workbook) has been a great help to me in trying to secure another job after being recently downsized. It arrived in good condition from the provider, has some wonderful tools in the book to help with job seekers, etc. It includes some self-help features, and ways to help decide what career you prefer over job 'getting a job'."},{"rating":"2","title":"still here - still great","review":"I love this book. As a career counselor, I'm delighted when a client refers to Bolles or a specific component of Parachute. I then know I'm working with a focused, dedicated and diligent person, willing to do what it takes.It's important to know what Bolles does not do. He doesn't cover career trends or updated Labor Dept. information. He doesn't compare resume formats extensively.In the 2002 edition, Bolles goes fearlessly into the spiritual aspect of career. Many of us fear being dogmatic on this topic, so tend to avoid it entirely. Yet clients (some of them) are eager to explore a sense of vocation for today's troubled planet. Bolles opens doors into exploration of one's mission which I am eager to pursue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly outdated for 2003","review":"What can I say? This book is totally out of date.

The exercises take some time and thought, but they really led me to a rewarding and fun career I would never have considered without them. The whole attitude towards job hunting and life choices presented in this book is fabulous, and it is never boring or condescending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype","review":"After hearing so much about this book, I was excited to give it a try. I really should have listened to the bad reviews - it was terrible.I don't have anything new to say that hasn't already been mentioned in the other negative reviews, except that this is really more of a job-hunting manual than a guide to fresh thinking about your career. If you want to know how to prepare for an interview, fine. But if you are looking for a new direction in your life, you won't find it here.If you really want to do some self-assessment, skip this one and go straight to the What Colour is your Parachute workbook. It's much cheaper and gives you the same exercises without all of the author's self-satisfied rambling."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a complete career change, consider a different book","review":"This book was not helpful for finding the right career, in a complete career change. I lothed the career I was in. This was the first career book I bought because of the recomendation of several people including a couple of career counselers. I believe people recommend this book because of its popularity and not its content. Finding the right career is not a quick and easy 1,2,3 process, it takes time and consideration. I believe this book makes it a bit more difficult than it has to be. I found this book wordy and lengthy; and it seems to have lots of useless information. The excersizes, while interesting, leave alot to be desired and they are a bit time comsuming.

What I have found is that most people neglect to do the introspective work that is necessary to really get down to their deepest passion around vocation. This little book, helps you to do exactly that and provides a structure to do it quickly.While this book has some value as a standalone resource, it is best to use it as a companion to WHAT COLOR IS MY PARACHUTE. You don't necessarily need the most recent edition either.This book is expensive in terms of what you get with respect to the number of pages and words, however,the idea behind it is excellent and the structure provided will certainly save you time and provide you with many useful insights about a career or job change."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stolen library cd collection - really disappointed","review":"I had just recently ordered a book on audio cds of \\"What Color is Your Parachute\\", after having taken it out of my local public library.

For a person with financial obligations and bills to pay, the book is about as useful as a screen door in a submarine or a peanut butter sandwich in the Sahara Desert.

I found it incredibly disappointing and wonder how He could've handled it worse. I found an answer. HE COULDN'T.

This is a could have been movie. There is a good story, but the filmmakers didn't put enough into the making of this film.The first half sets up the story. It makes it out to be a drama because the first killing doesn't happen until over half way through the movie. That is when the story stops. Because of the first half of this film, I kind of wished that they skipped the killings and developed the story and characters.This movie is strictly rental material unless you are, like me, a collector of horror films.Don't expect too much from it and it could be enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"really wanted to like it, but just couldnt","review":"Ive heard of this movie a while back and really wanted to see it.

Of course, this allows for an easy but very lame decapitation scene.- The *blind* kid telling Isaac Hayes' character where to fire the cannon- The mysterious change of Sam's face: the first half of the movie has him looking like Freddy Kruger.

She has transformed another piece of Irish history into a very entertaining read. The descriptions are well done without being too wordy. The action is paced nicely and is exciting. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because, while interesting, the history being related to us is simply not as fascinating as the rise to power and reign of Brian Boru (told of in Llywelyn's Lion of Ireland).

You're probably both some 13 year old kids that think you know everything.

I'm an avid player of Daoc and have been for over 2 years now (soon I will be beta testing the next expansion for it), I've been frustrated at times, but I still get enjoyment out of the game.

The only complaint so far that I have seen about NF is that it is laggy for people with dial up.

To have fair chance in battle those should have access to similiar combat abilities. Lastest expansion Trial of Atlantis is a very time consuming and bugged piece of you know what. It takes any chance from casual gamer to be competetive or even participating in realm warfare unless he is able to spend literally months in player versus enemy environment(so he has those fancy new abilities and without them he'll be on loosing end constantly).

In addition to the new graphics, which puts DAoC on par with all but the most resource-hogging MMOs out there, Catacombs significantly cuts the leveling grind that DAoC has been known for in the past. Catacombs features generous mob drobs, adds mini quests that can be completed in a few minutes for mucho experience, and it adds instanced dungeons where solo players or small groups can hunt.

You can get lost in the wonderfully composed music. It takes you back to the movie in every way. I can hear Peter's voice, and I can picture the movements they make as I sit back and listen to the songs. For anyone who enjoys music, this is a beautiful and extraordinary score to listen to. I would definately recommend this to everyone, even if you haven't seen the movie. Just picturing the movements from the movie is as good, if not better, then being taken back to the movie. The emotion that James Newton Howard put into the music is amazing, and its emotion that you can feel. Both the suspense and the excitement are beautifully mastered in the songs. This is a perfect soundtrack to an even better movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Missing something..","review":"This soundtrack is the best soundtrack I have! The only thing missing is about half an hour more music that's in the movie, like when Wendy kisses Peter and he turns pink, and Wendy and Peter first meet, all that stuff, why isn't all of this music in it? It's such a beautiful CD already, but I feel as if it needs a little more. I listen to it all the time (I have for the past 9 months) and I wish they could somehow add the music from the movie to the CD and resell a 2nd soundtrack, like a special edition or something, like Moulin Rouge did as well as others. But it's still the best soundtrack, definitely worth my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Pan CD","review":"The service,Product, and follow up facilities ie. tracking of order were excellent.Ten out of ten to you People. Regards Samantha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the child in all of us","review":"James Newton Howard did an extraordinary job for this soundtrack. The music is delightful, inspiring and up-lifting. Somehow you do feel like you are in Neverland.Or for the track \\"Dance of the Fairies\\" you are transported to a time when nothing else matters but you and your imagination. That particular score is beautiful in a sense that it is sweet and poigant at the same time. Other well-deserved praised tracks are definitely \\"Flying\\", \\"Fetch Long Tom\\" and \\"Tinkerbell\\".Personally I enjoyed every single track on this album. I believe this album will become a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music For The Heart","review":"I really enjoyed this sound track. It has a very nice New Age appeal to it and a lot of great orchestra. It's a lot like \`fairy music'. Very soothing and relaxing.I really thought that it fit well with the Peter Pan story. The music is very charming and caring."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SOUNDTRACK!","review":"I loved this movie and bought it as soon as it came out on dvd. I then purchased this Soundtrack and fell in love with it. I've listened to it several times, in the car, in the house..everywhere I can listen to it! I have found a \\"hidden Child\\" in the music, it brings back all the memories of the movie and if you listen to it closely, you can hear the story in each instrument. Each sound tells the Peter Pan story. It's amazing. I recommend this cd to all who have loved this gem of a movie. I give it 10 stars!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD !!!","review":"This is an intriguing CD I totally enjoyed it. I bought it because I was mesmorized by the songs on the trailer! Just to warn you though the song I was looking for is called clocks by Coldplay and it is not on the CD. It is just on the trailer. The CD is awesome if you really like the movie because of the music, and you enjoy instrumental scores! My personal favorites are Flying, Fairy Dance, andI do believe in Fairies. The show is awesome if you haven't seen it. A very different display of the boy who never grew up! Reminds me of the old days with Disney on ice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music from the Disney Year of a Million Dreams Commercial","review":"I don't know if anyone else has been going crazy looking for the music from the current Walt Disney World \\"Year of a Million Dreams\\" commercials but I think this is it. The \\"Flying\\" and \\"I do believe in faries\\" tracks sound almost identical to the ad. I didn't even know this live action Peter Pan was a Disney movie. I wish I had found this 2 weeks ago for my Christmas stocking. Oh well I'll just have to wait. It is a magical sound and I love it. I hope this helps anyone else looking for the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic","review":"I purchased this soundtrack because I enjoyed the movie, I never expected to love the CD even more. The composer tells a story of Pan better than the movie does. The flutes and chimes are amazing. The music is almost dream like in Fairy Dance, and inspirational in Learning to Fly. I began to appreciate instrumental music after taking flute lessons, and now I throughly enjoy the language of it. This CD is a must have for the imaginative mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Okay, so the movie rocks, right? How could the CD be even better? I am mystified as well, but James Newton Howard somehow accomplished this. This CD is my new favorite, ranking as high as the scores of The Return of the King and Edward Scissorhands. It has the most amazing sounds you've ever heard, and the different songs inspire emotions of all kinds. Another rare thing that you don't find in other scores is the songs can stand on their own: they each have a unique arc. Honestly, this CD has been in my CD player for seven days straight. I recommend it to anyone who likes good music. Seriously, go and get it now before the store sells out, because it will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!","review":"Great CD, one of the best I own. A great soundtrack to a great film. Would definitely recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely magical!","review":"It's difficult for me to buy cd's because I'm *very* choosy... I rarely like half of the songs on most of the soundtracks I buy, even my favorites. Not so with Peter Pan. I love almost all of the songs, my favorites being the Main Title, Flying, A Note From the Teacher, Come Meet Father, Peter Returns, and *especially* Fairy Dance- just beautiful.This is definitely a must-have soundtrack. It captures the feel of the story perfectly. Songs like Flying and Come Meet Father set the playful mood, while the Main Title and Fairy Dance give it a beautiful, dreamlike quality.I promise you won't regret buying it! Believe me, it's worth every last cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD LISTENING","review":"I bought this soundtrack for my 14 year old daughter. She had enjoyed the movie and always takes note of the music in the background. We enjoy listening to this together.Kathleen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beautiful, incredible","review":"After my third trip to the theater to see this film, I found myself humming tunes from the score -- and that's when I knew I needed to buy this CD. And so I did. It's exceptional; it has made me remember how wonderful James Newton Howard is. It is also helping me from going absolutely crazy waiting for the film to be released on DVD. As far as I know, this CD contains every piece of music that is used in the film (NOT in the exact order, but almost). Track #2 (the music from when they're flying to Neverland) and #14 (\\"I do believe in fairies!\\") are my two absolute favorites, but the others are great too. I have listened to this CD at least two dozen times, in full, since purchasing it. It's calming when you want it to be, but also thrilling -- and it's a great CD for any fan of good movie music OR the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.

I received it as a gift from my sister-in-law who was school librarian and getting rid of some titles in favor of newer versions.This novel combines a healthy dose of adventure, danger, and tragedy. It is one of the most unique of the Xanth novels and perhaps a but more serious than most.The scenes are magical and perhaps even could be considered psychedelic at times. It is the journey to the source of magic itself that gives readers a great understanding of how Xanth works and the dangers that lurk in its myriad corners and wide open spaces.I still recommend this novel to young adults, especially boys. It is a great and fun adventure story with a healthy dose of magic. (Reversal mo above comment intentional)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic yet entertaining","review":"I found this novel enjoyable, but I'm not sure that I can continue with the series. I feel like each book will be more of the same. Go here, run into strange creatures, escape from danger, talk about attractive or irritating females, solve problem, return home. The characters aren't very interesting, and Xanth is no more unique than it was in the previous novel. These stories would be better with a force of evil or sense of purpose. The puns are amusing at times and irritating at others. Overall, these books are decent light reading, and would serve you well for a brief escape into a different world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just enjoy it for what it is!","review":"I enjoyed this book. Served as a great book to read while on vacation by the pool sipping a drink! Ok, so I am easily entertained, but so what! I read some of the reviews and there was a lot of griping about how women were put down but I find it interesting that the women who say that don't bring up the fact that there was equal time for men!!! I mean admit it, men so weak they can't resist the call of a siren? Get kinda tired of women crying oh woe is me! Now if any of those characters were not heterosexual men, there would have been no trouble getting past the siren! The siren would have been totally ignored by any gay man unless of course if she had a fabulous gown and matching tiara! Come on people, get a life, this is entertainment and should be appreciated for the entertainment and creativity it is! Just sit back and enjoy the ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents beware","review":"The second installment of the Xanth series has Bink searching for the source of the magical land's magic. (A quest he is sent on primarily to give him a break from his 7-8 month pregnant wife, inconveniently in her \\"ugly/smart\\" phase.)This story continues with the sexual themes (though not as blantant as in later books, if I remember correctly) that are geared to entice the adolescent boys who are the target audience.**Spoiler**On a further note, if you are someone concerned about the controversies sometimes found around the Harry Potter stories, be warned that the source of magic is, literally in this story, demonic in nature (as in coming from a demon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you should be reading!","review":"The Source of Magic is the best book that the Xanth series has to offer! I liked it because the author actually put me in Bink's shoes in his quest for the source of magic. It also gave me a sense of discovery from page 1! I would recommend this book to anyone with a good sense for the supernatural elements. If you have that sense, you won't be able to put the book down. In fact, you may even have to read the book twice! Hint: The book doesn't turn out as drastic as the end of the summary makes it sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic's Burnout","review":"This second book in the Xanth saga does not deliver like its predecessor, A Spell for Chameleon. In The Source of Magic, we join Bink and company once again for a journey to find out waht makes the land of Xanth so magical. The quest itself is very boring, drawn out, and redundant. However, the answer to Bink's quest is quite interesting, and worth the read in and of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thor - 'Thunderstruck-Tales From The Equinox' (Star USA)","review":"Liked this CD just as much as I did his 'Thor Against The World' effort(see my review).Realize that many 'real' metal fans may not appreciate Thor's work as much as I do,but hey!It's YOUR loss.Tunes here I got a big charge out of were the bare bone-smashing \\"War Hammer\\",\\"Rag-Na-Rock\\",\\"Apocalyptic Explosion\\" and his two unlikely covers,King Crimson's \\"The Court Of The Crimson King\\" and Music Machine's \\"Talk Talk\\".Well done.Cheese metal CAN rule,at times.Semi-recommended if you like what you read here."},{"rating":"2","title":"More funny than Spinal Tap, plus he is for real...","review":"His first appearance on live TV was a gig for the Merv Griffen Show at Las Vagas, and he's Heavy Metal.

The build.xml files in the download are laughably different from the book, and several steps need to be taken which the book mentions nothing of.It's a major shame since the book looked very good. But I completely wasted my 38 and have wound up using the (confusing) online tutorial.Apparently a FCS version of the book is coming out in several months. Wait for it.

This book is a dead-tree of the online JWSDP tutorial, with the benefit that you can read it while off line, the disadvantage that you pay for the privilege. Either way, I dont think it is that good a tutorial; it covers the Sun way of thinking, but doesnt get into the details of interop problems, maybe because SUNW dont seem to be participating in the SoapBuilders interop fests. Interoperability is the bane of and key to the success of web services, and if all you are doing is taking existing EJB beans and turning them into web services, you arent building a real web service. If you are using the Axis framework, there are better books, like the SAMS press one. No doubt something great will come along for the Sun product, but this is not, yet, it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great For Balance, But Won't Last Long","review":"We purchased the Skuut after reading reviews and closely examining the competition (primarily the Likeabike). First, the good: bike assembles easily, looks cute, and rides fast and true. The bad: it started falling apart within weeks, to the point of becoming completely unsafe. Our child is on the small side, just turned three, is 36 inches tall and weighs under 30 pounds. I can't imagine how a heavier child could ride one of these. As much as our child loved it, it just wasn't safe. We were able to send it back even after the 30 day period (way to go, Amazon!) and replaced the Skuut with the Kettler Sprint. Even though it doesn't look as cool, the Kettler is so much sturdier. The resale value will be higher too, since Kettler is such a well known quality kid's bike builder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - cheapest materials- no customer service","review":"The idea of a glider bike for kids learning balance is brilliant. I bought this Scuut bike. It is made out of the cheapest materials. The tires and tubes were defective. There was NO response from the Scuut customer service number which I called many times. You buy this product and you are on your own. Next I bought a Strider. There is no comparison. For effectively the same price you get a bike that is metal and made to last and has all the range of movement of a larger bike (with infinite seat and handlebar adjustments). The Skuut is just bad design and over priced for what you get (limited adjustments, cheap materials, bad design) with no support to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check box for hardware/parts - everything missing!","review":"It is Christmas Eve and I ordered this Skuut bike for my 4 year old for tomorrow - Christmas. We just started wrapping presents tonight and when we went to put together this bike - all the parts were missing. Can't even put it together. It is sad because this was actually the ONLY thing that my daughter asked for for Christmas when she saw Santa several weeks ago.I am so upset right now as this has never happened to me. The box was perfectly intact and everything inside did not look like it had been opened - just missing the parts to put it together. What a I supposed to tell my daughter tomorrow? Or should I just leave it out all disassembled?I bought this her from Amazon in November...it was not a last minute gift. I am so mad at myself for not opening it up and putting it together before tonight. As like most parents, this is what we do on x-mas eve...we wrap and put together toys. I will never do that again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't buy it","review":"I was going to buy this bike, but when its price jumped almost $10 within 24 hours, I decided not to.

You can make any bike (i.e. the one you probably already own) one of these by just taking out a wrench, and taking the pedals off your kid's bike. It works. Trust me. There is no magic about these bike other than the fact that they have no pedals, meaning if you take the ones of your kid's bike -well you saved yourself a lot of money. Also, it seems logical to have your kid learn on the actual bike he or she will be riding - not learning on one of these - and then switching to the real bike.Try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but give kids the wrong idea","review":"My kids love to play with this bike my oldest daughter's first bike was a tricycle my sons first bike was this well my daughter knows how to peddle a bike this taut my son that you use your feet to make a bike go so now were trying to reteach him to ride a bike i wouldnt buy this unless you plan on teaching your kid to peddle a bike also"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"where are the pedals\\"","review":"I read that this was one of the best bikes you can buy but when it arrived and I assembled it my kid was just plain confused. She wanted to know where the pedals were. I knew there were none and attempted to explain to her how it worked but she still felt the need to pedal.

It's smooth and fast on sidewalks or dirt trails. I was hoping to transition my son straight to the bicycle after this, but a friend gave us a bike with training wheels, which sits higher, so he just had to ride that.

A great, innovative, safe, and fun product."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Loves The Skuut","review":"My 2 year old is afraid of anything too mechanical and noisey and this is perfect for her.

Don't use training wheels; use this instead to teach your young child to balance a two-wheel bike. My 4-yr old found it very easy and fun to use and I'm sure he'll be ready to ride a real bike next year. His friend, who uses training wheels, cannot begin to keep up. This is far better. Not sure yet about the durability, but it doesn't have to last too long because it will be replaced with a pedal bike in about a year.

She went on to use a bike with training wheels and was off of the training wheels before she turned 5. Our 3 1/2 year old son inherited the Skuut, has ridden it for about 3 months and yesterday learned to ride a two-wheeler without training wheels. The bike is no longer great looking but still in very useable condition and I will be able to resell it for $30-$40 with no trouble.10/18/2010 We sold it within 15 minutes for $40.

In a few rides he was coasting short distances and having much fun. So how do you explain to him that tomorrow his new favorite toy is disappearing and going back to the manufacturer? I'm generally pretty forgiving about minor product imperfections. These aren't minor. The Skuut arrived stinking of mothballs (the seat still smells strongly). Within less than a week, the wood bushings on the rear wheel assembly had become separated making the back wheel dangerously wobbly and unstable. Not helpful to a kid trying to learn to balance, and, I think, unsafe as the bike speeds up. Doesn't matter how fun, educational, etc. a toy is, it's useless if a kid can't play with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tire blew---birthday not too happy!","review":"The front tire of this bike blew after my daughter was on it for about 20 seconds---on her third birthday! What a great way to ruin a birthday, Skuut. I've seen other reviews complaining about the tires, perhaps it's time you listen to consumers and do something about the quality of your material. I know things happen, but seriously, couldn't be more disappointed with this product. I was so excited for my daughter to ride, and now we're sitting here figuring out how to return it. Won't be recommending your company to any of my friends looking for a balance bike for their children! And can I say one more time--What a way to ruin a birthday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Heavey Too Cumbersome.","review":"I bought this when my son was 18 months old. It was so heavy that he could not balance it well at all. Also it is simply too tall for him that his feet could not touch the ground even when we lowered the seat to the bottom at 18 months old even though my son is 95% on weight and height of his age and he was quite strong. I immediately sold it and bought the \\"Chicco Red Bullet\\". What a difference. My son immediately got it without any couching. He was able to manipulate the Chico Red Bullet\\" without any problem. He is now 3 year and 3 months old and still going strong with his little \\"Red Bullet\\". The price of the \\"Red Bullet\\" is also $30 cheaper than the Skuut. My son now is 42 lb. and 44 inches 95% of a 3-year old. The \\"Chico Red Bullet\\" definately was the best toy I've purchased for him. He has had so many good times in the skate board park with his little bullet, almost every weekend when the weather permits.

The seat also could not be lowered enough to fit our two year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Affordable but quality mixed","review":"We purchased the Skuut balance bike for our 3 year old who wasn't really confident on a 'real' bike with pedals. After only about 3 weeks of use, mostly in the house, the vinyl on the seat started to wear away at the front, leaving a white patch which seemed to get larger by the week. We returned the bike for a replacement, but then the replacement arrived with a cracked wooden piece on the wheel. We returned that one as well and will now look at a more sturdy bike for our son, as this one unfortunely didn't stand up to regular 3-year old usage. He loved riding it though, and it was lots of fun, so I think it's a good concept, you might just want to buy a slightly more expensive and better built brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but unsafe","review":"We got one of these for our 3 year old at Christmas last year. There is no doubt that our daughter loved it, had great fun riding it, and found it easy to move on to a regular bicycle by the end of the summer. The problem is that the material is incredily shoddy. One day while she was riding it, the entire front handlebar/wheel assembly popped completely off, sending our daughter head-first onto the pavement. Fortunately she was wearing a good helmet (which was split completely in 2) or else the outcome could have been catastropic.This is a great idea, and there may be better-quality balance bikes out there. But this particular model is just too hazardous to let your kid ride on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"choose a different balance bike","review":"OK,after spending the morning once again duct taping this bike together, I thought I should share my thoughts. We love the concept of this bike and our son absolutely adores the activity. Unfortunately: 1. we patched the tires so many times in the first couple of weeks that we wound up buying 2 higher quality tires almost immediately. 2. As we watched numerous neighbors break their Skuts when they fell, we were not suprised to crack our own when our son fell off a curb. Our kid did get a lot of play out of the bike, but you don't want your kids getting punctured by the bike when they break in half. Also, we would have liked it to last through another sibling. 3. The hardware is a joke, be prepared to replace pieces as they become useless. Conclusion: stay away from this particular brand, and maybe go with a metal model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor experience with the tires and wheels","review":"First, I did not buy this from Amazon- we purchased from REI based on a suggestion from another reviewer, in case we had problems. Good thing we did, because right out-of-the-box we had issues with the wheels/tires. I have to say, my husband is a \\"bike guy\\"-- he knows his way around all types of bikes and so it helped to have a knowledgeable source for installation and troubleshooting. Anyway, the issue was had was with the actual tire and tube BOTH splitting apart, which then damaged the rim of the wheel. After multiple emails to the manufacturer, we did receive a new wheel/tire/tube in the mail. Installed it and within seconds, the same thing happened again.Thankfully, REI agreed to take back the bike and allow us to purchase a metal-framed balance bike. I got the distinct impression they have done this exchange many, many times. I would personally not ever buy this bike again based on my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of fun for a short time","review":"My 2 year old loved his skuut until it broke - few weeks after the purchase.Since then I've been on a quest for spare parts.

My initial impressions are that the build quality seems good, and it was easy to assemble. I purchased it, because I have seen other kids who learned by riding on these pedal-less bikes. They hopped off of the skuut, and rode a pedal bike with ease at a very young age. They already knew how to balance, so they only had to learn to pedal. Some of the pre-schoolers I have seen at the cyclocross races (pdx), are so small that they have to ride the tiny 12 inch pedal bikes when they outgrow the skuut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wood Ikea bike","review":"It's like a wood Ikea bike.

He was a little small for it at first but started riding it about 3 months ago. He's crashed it the way that a normal 2 year would. First the wood around the handle grips started splitting. My husband duct-taped which worked fine. But the handlebars completely popped off and the wood split from the screws making it completely un-fixable after a normal fall on the sidewalk. Pretty bummed because now I'll be out another $100 replacing it with a more durable metal version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skuut is a durable balance bike at the right price","review":"We purchased the Skuut for our 2 1/2 year old son who had mastered his trike and wanted to ride his 5 year old sister's 'big kid bike' with training wheels. He hasn't expressed much interest in the Skuut yet. However, our 5 year old daughter learned to ride a 2-wheeler recently, but had trouble getting started without having someone push her. She rode around our sloping driveway for a week on the Skuut, then to our suprise jumped on her 'big kid bike' and pedaled away on her own. Apparently the balance she learned from the Skuut helped her get the feel for how to balance a 2-wheeler when shoving off on her own.We are very pleased with the Skuut. While the original Like-a-Bike balance bikes are wonderful, it is hard to justify the $300 price for its purpose.

It would be better to listen it again after you tried to repeat it.- In the end of each lesson you are asked to take part in the dialogue, but you don't know exactly what you should say after you heard the saying of the another person.- The music after each small part of the lesson is annoying.So, if you really want to learn German while driving or jogging, then buy Pimsleur course instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality","review":"I did not know there is such bad floss before I used this. do not try it.

Every time one reads it, a different layer reveals itself and the mastery of the story telling craft makes it enjoyable to read every time. This is not a book of a story. Its about the search for meaning and wisdom. The quest is presented by two view points one Eastern, i.e. Brahminical and other Western. To my mind, this is the closest that any one came near to synthesize the essentially different view points of Western and Eastern philosophies.A definate read for any one seriously inclined towards literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wholly engaging, challenging and brilliantly subtle triumph!","review":"Powerful and complex film that pulls you deeper into mystery even as it offers seeming clues to the story and the characters involved.

Truly a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be done much better","review":"I normally swear by the Exam Cram series. I used the CCNP series (all four books) and passed all four tests the first time. So when I went to order a book for my next test - Network Design, I got the Exam Cram one. Errors abound, half the questions don't make sense, some of the explanations are flat out wrong - The author states that a test-taking guideline is to not include anything not specified as a requirement in the case studies, then proceeds to break it in the answer to the next test case study with no explanation. This was going to be a key study, because with the Microsoft tests you have to learn the Microsoft way of viewing the topic. How MS designs networks is alien to any other network design, so what they believe is the key to passing their tests. This book failed to be clear on what MS wants their network design to be. The book covers all the topics, but it needs more explanations as to which design rules MS follows and less errors and inane questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff.....","review":"This is not your ordinary spoken word material. Tonya Marie Evans along with her co-horts Stephanie Renee and Damon \\"Dizzy Fingers\\" Bennet brew up some seriously groovy tunes, with styles ranging from house to progressive soul to acid jazz. Tonya Marie's voice is smooth yet commanding and when coupled with Stephanie Renee's own phenomenal voice the result is truly wonderful.

There is no nudity, mild bad language and only comedic violence. Following this girls life in the animation industry is one of the most interesting things I've seen in Anime OVAs. It's really educational too, so people wanting to work in the animation industry should take a close look at this and see what pressure you're going through when working. And for once, the jokes here will actually make you laugh!Great animation, great designs and the music is memorable. I still hum the theme tune today, 2 years after watching it. When the price is just 6 bucks, there is no reason not to pick this up. It's only 40 minutes long, but it'll be worth the little sum of money.I'm really happy this once aired on a swedish TV-network, undubbed. It has shown me that OVAs with a total of only 1 or 2 episodes can be really unique and fun, as long as you're an Anime fan.

I also didn't notice when ordering them that they had laces which i didn't like..the end kept getting stuck in the shoe. I will give these to charity and use my other sketchers slip ons.

I am a fan of Skechers in general. I needed to replace my last slip ons. I was a bit hesitant to buy these at first based on other reviews about the laces defeating the purpose of them slipping on. However by following advice to order a half size bigger I have had no trouble slipping these on and off. I think the ticket with these, as others have mentioned is to order 1/2 size bigger to get optimal true to size fit. They are very pretty sneakers and I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skechers mule sneaker","review":"I had a pair of sneakers like this before. Comfortable fit. I like the easy slide in.

TERRIBLE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"I don't really care to enter the fray that this book seems to have caused, but having read it and having expected something more from it, I guess the only thing I learned was that the old adage about judging a book by its cover (or in this case its title) is true. Other marketing books make mistakes by overloading on case studies. This one does the exact opposite. I can't understand why an author of a book like this wouldn't use case studies on every page (a la Seth Godin's Purple Cow) to make his points unless he's either A) afraid that if he uses an actual client example someone will check up and find something negative or B) that there simply are no case studies to prove his point.By the way, I am not an ad agency employee or a marketing expert. I am simply a businessperson who feels like this book does not deliver on what it appears to promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your markting department accountable","review":"It's a simple premise, but one which can't be emphasized enough - don't spend money unless you can quantify the results. As someone who has worked in both large and small operations, I can vouch for the author when he says most businesses are spending marketing money because they have to - if only to keep their budgets up for the next quarter - rather than because the marketing is increasing their business. That kind of sloppy planning is exactly what is wrong with most marketing today - from superbowl campaigns to the ubiquitous calendars you get at the dry cleaners. This book has a few tired phrases (extreme marketing? - can we stop being extreme please) but it is a valuable blueprint for holding your marketing department accountable for sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ad Agencies Do Not Like This Book","review":"For once someone took a different approach to how a company may sell it products.This was a refreshing new look at all the advertising and marketing dogmas there are in the business world. If many CEO's would read this, they'd fire the marketing people they employ as they are wasting the money spent on worthless advertising campaigns and ad agencies. You only have to look at some of the reviews presented on this site and you can tell that some of them are so called marketing gurus who feel threatened that their way of life might be challenged. By the way, I'm not related or in no way have ever had any contact with the author. I'm just a businessman that is tired of the same old Ad Agency theories day after day that are not helping my bottom line."},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT","review":"This man just went on national televison and referred to a bunch of hard working American women as \\"terrorist\\" His product is a bunch of garbage with out a single original idea. As a New Yorker who lived through two actual terrorist attack I find him very offensive and clueless. Do not waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy Title, No Real Substance","review":"The only thing this book has going for it, is the title. Those who know nothing about marketing will buy on this title alone. But should you be one of these individuals, let me spare you, save your money.I inquired into client results for this company and found there were none. Strategies are based on the whims of Mark Stevens and nothing else. There are no proven methods here at all. Just a madman who wants to take your money, so he can spend it on luxury items to make himself feel better. This may sound like a personal attack, but is the truth.Please save your money and your sanity, do not get involved with this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Marketing Sucks!","review":"Did anyone ever stop and wonder why Stevens wrote this book? If his ideas and strategies were so wonderful, why is he not a successful marketing consultant with successful clients? Why would he need to write this book - to share all of his insight and knowledge with the business world? I highly doubt it. It seems to me that it is for the paycheck! If anyone would take the time to look into the business history of Mark Stevens they would find out that he has no more expertise or success in marketing than a recent college graduate with a marketing degree. Nothing that he says in his book is new, and in fact, I don't see any case studies in the book where he gives the reader examples of his successful marketing campaigns. As a businessperson, I would not take any advice from someone who cannot prove his success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste","review":"I bought this book over the weekend out of curiousity despite the bad reviews on amazon.com. After the first two chapters, I stopped. I returned it to the bookstore and got my money back. I should have paid attention when the titled screamed, \\"I need attention, buy me!\\"The only purpose of this book to generate sales with its title (smart? maybe). Bottomline is that it offers no real value (Stupid? definitely). Save your money and go with your gut instinct. Any business person with worth, will know that marketing starts with examining what the ROI will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better marketing books out there","review":"Ross Perot is a billionaire Biz man. Success doesn't mean he would be a good prez. There are a few good ideas and suggestions in the book. Not much is new or innovative. I am a mulit-millionaire as I suppose Mark Stevens is also. In my business I would only find about 3% of this book useful. If it is about Coke, Pepsi, Tide or IBM it's all same rhetoric. If your trying to establish yourself selling Bridles, Trowels, Carpet Cleaning,Frame Shop, Gas Station, Tile Adhesive, RV camp ground or branding a name in an niche industry you would be hard pressed to view this as a helpful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was \\"suck\\"-ered","review":"My biggest problem with this book is that it tells you nothing you can't already figure out if you have any kind of common sense and the ability to step back from your marketing plan and give it an objective once-over. Maybe it deserves some credit for that, but for all the hype that the first couple of chapters generate (in some cases ad nauseum), there's absolutely no way that anything that follows could possibly deliver on the promise. This in itself may be a good lesson on Mark Stevens. I picked up this book because I saw a lot of local press on it and the title was intriguing, but that's all it did. I think Stevens is teaching us suckers who bought the book that it really is all about style rather than substance.I'd suggest forming a 12-step program for others who were similarly conned but I think we all know better. Someday we'll wise up and realize that no one who writes a book like this really knows anything except how to promote themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"not your best marketing book","review":"I bought this book thinking it would give me some insight into how to market my business - but I found no useful examples. Had I read the negative reviews on amazon.com I would have skipped this purchase.So, instead, I am on amazon.com warning others who my be considering buying this book. I'm going to attempt to return this book to the publisher as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice","review":"What a waste of time. The most basic ideas, repeated over and over again as if they are new. Know what you want to achieve! Know your product! Good marketing sells product! Bad marketing doesn't! Wow. That's certainly insightful. The author advises CEOs to avoid ego projects, but this is certainly a vanity project.If people don't know the aim of their marketing, their audience and ways to reach them, and don't measure their results, then shame on them. But this book still won't help them do it. However, you gotta give him credit for a catchy title. Shame the rest of the book didn't measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"To suck...or, not to suck?","review":"This book is required reading for managers in my organization who struggle to make the connection between the cost of marketing activities and the need for quantifiable and satisfactory returns. Although Stevens devotes too much space to self-promotion, his message is clear and understandable, a useful quality for the reader who needs to draw only a few critical conclusions. The key takeaways from this book, while few in number, are worth the short effort needed to extract them. The title, by the way, prominently displayed on your shelf, is worth the cost of acquistion, as it makes for a great conversation starter."},{"rating":"1","title":"No worth your time","review":"I thought perhaps this book would offer some insight as to best marketing practices. What I discovered was a book targeted to individuals who know nothing about marketing.If you are not a marketing expert, I highly suggest that you read other marketing books as well. Especially one with real case stuies. How can you recommend marketing tactics without actually having some experience?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple","review":"I bought this book during my summer holiday, and as a student with some marketing experience I found it quite funny at first, as there were some nice 'examples' of how not to do it. But after a while the author was just repeating himself.You could summarize this entire book in one breath: \\"Do not engage in any marketing activities that do not have a positive NPV.\\" Something that someone with the slightest bit of common sense could conclude.The cover however was brilliant as it did exactly what it was supposed to do, draw my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"marketing isn't the only thing that sucks...","review":"simplistic cover design, simplistic messaging and simplistic writing style make this testimony to the obvious simply dreadful.Without a single fresh idea to offer, the author lambasts nationally recognized advertising campaigns and the Fortune 500 companies who use them - easy targets in an age where creativity seems to have left the marketing/advertising industry. The few points that this book makes might be a good marketing/business primer for someone who had never worked a day, but any business owner who does not grasp these basic tenants already has no business in business.The \\"in you face\\" style of self promotion that the book's name uses is nothing more than an old fashioned huckster's trick - smoke and mirrors - designed to sell a sub-par offering. Even this is nothing new, traveling medicine salesmen used this tactic often in the 1800's - usually right before they were ridden out of town on a rail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"I wish it was worth my time to claim my money back. I think the title is great but there's not much content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as advertised","review":"The impetus for purchasing the book was the glowing testimonials on the back from reputable marketing experts. Not sure what they saw in it, though.Pretty basic stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"This book is like one of those diet books that spends a lot of space telling you how great the diet plan is. In fact, the first 46 pages of the book tell you almost nothing, except how the author will let you know how to market your company in upcoming chapters. Again, like a diet book, he has come up with a cute term to sell books: \\"Extreme Marketing.\\" And like those diet books, which can be summed up with, \\"eat fewer calories than you burn, and exercise for your health,\\" his ideas are simplistic. Here is the summary:- Make sure your marketing activities are accountable for sales. Any marketing activity should have a direct correlation to increased sales and a measurable return on investment (ROI).- Use multiple marketing activities at the same time for the best results.- Make sure you have the trained salespeople to follow up on marketing activities and close the sale.That's it. While good advice, it doesn't justify a whole book. But, neither does, \\"eat less, exercise more.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"If Slightly Thicker, Might Work as a Doorstop","review":"My opening line is already taken by another smart reviewer: \\"buyer beware.\\" Examples of bad marketing are everywhere; citing them endlessly throughout this book offers little value to the reader. Stevens pushes for \\"extreme marketing,\\" but offers few details beyond generalized, almost motivational-sounding exhortations. Stevens misses the opportunity to explore and analyze successful case studies, and his \\"detailed\\" case study at the end of the book is a lightweight, bulleted list of routine programs-- hardly the example of \\"extreme\\" marketing he has touted throughout the book. From cover to cover, Stevens continually confuses \\"marketing\\" with \\"marketing communications\\"-- a distinction the reader is left wondering whether Stevens himself understands."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make your ego bigger","review":"This \\"author\\" calls himself a \\"marketing guru?\\" I don't think so. The only thing he is a guru in is \\"how to make your ego bigger.\\" My advice to anyone considering calling him is to ask for real client results. The ones in this book are obviously fictional and created in the mind of one warped individual whose only \\"mission\\" in life is to compensate for no ability and satisfy his ego.Beware - \\"Author\\" (and I use this term lightly) Mark Stevens - Sucks! Pardon the pun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"The title alone should warn all potential buyers, Mark Stevens has been making money off the Your Marketing Sucks campaign for years and in the fast past marketing world he of all people should know that what was happened yesterday happened yesterday. Its time for a new catch pharse instead of profiting off the same stupid one liner which NEVER generated new business let alone assist in retaining exisiting business, or satisfying exisiting clients needs. When he discusse ROI it makes me physically sick because personally knowing the man I know ROI was never as much of a priority as $$$ was for Mark.Dont let me man fool you, his advise is as phony as his hair plugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Central theme is \\"His Thinking Sucks\\"","review":"Woo hoo... if Mark thinks people will fall for that comment from \\"Tampa\\" where they supposedly \\"saved\\" $250,000, he is really insulting readers intelligence. No \\"real\\" reader would make that comment- pure \\"Markster speak.\\" Nor would a real company know the results by now.Then the thank you notes to himself. Thank YOU, Mr. Stevens, get real!!Grow up Mark. Your book is speaking loudly and clearly, your marketing sucks.

Two cute kitty siblings enter a limbo between life and death, while trying to recover one's soul. There they experience numerous bizarre, occasionally gory, disconnected adventures. There is little dialogue other than word balloons, and most seemingly nonsensical. But this is not merely acid-induced weirdness; there's a story in this imagery that will stick in your mind long after watching it. For those who like Japanese animation and \\"Cat Soup\\" in particular, I recommend finding tol's \\"Tamala 2010: A Punk Cat in Space.\\" \\"Tamala\\" features another cutie cat-girl, with a penchant for four-letter words, and a propensity toward violence and freaky adventures.

It did not \\"sink in\\" no matter how much I tried to rub it in. It did not apply well on my kids faces either. So I gave that to my mom. I switched to Neutrogena Ultra Sheer dry touch SPF 70. It works very well with all of us and was recommended by my dermatologist.

Howevers, readers should note that it was written in 1961, when many typical Brazilian ingredients weren't available in the U.S. or elsewhere, and the author has made adaptations, without mentioning what the original ingredient was! Brazilian ingredients are more widely available now, and you can usually figure out what the proper authentic ingredient is, especially by comparing the recipes in this book to those in more recent cookbooks. One tip -- in most cases where the author calls for parsley, you should really use cilantro (coentro in Portuguese). It would be wonderful if the publisher would issue an updated version of the book with authentic ingredients substituted back into the recipes, but this is still VERY useful. In particular, the section on desserts is excellent, but there are many other wonderful recipes here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial explanation","review":"I was more than surprised to see the poor quality of this DVD, especially after reading the positive reviews.Very very superficial DVD, which seems more an exhibition than a didactical tape.No explanation of the moves, just the two persons \\"dancing\\" around, performing moves at very high speed.This is clearly not an \\"instruction\\" video, since the techniques are not explained, just performed.I normally prefer books as a way to learn something, but I have found some very serious and valuable DVD as well.

Otherwise, you will not catch much from these video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Wing Chun Kung Fu, Vol. 1","review":"I received this disc a couple of days ago, and did not have a chance to look at it until this morning. This is basically a very good instructional video. The only real problem I had with it was that the Sifu was going WAY too fast for someone to learn the techniques... this could be frustrating to a beginning student. Once I figured out how to make my machine play the disc a little bit slower (pause and then the fast forward key on my remote... might be different for yours), it was MUCH easier to follow along. You might want to watch each section through at full speed at least once, so you can hear the narration (on my machine, you cannot hear it in slow mode) and learn the names of the techniques. Then go back in slow mode and follow along so you can learn the techniques. I will definitely be getting the next disc in the series, when I finish with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"do yourself a favour","review":"for those of you who are yet to discover Tim Winton he is a legend here in Australia and you are in for a treat! Most of his novels are set in Western Australia - our country's largest,yet least poplutated state which is dreadfully hot in summer but full of magnificent surf beaches, stunning scenery and some of the best wineries in the world. I spent much of my childhood in Perth and Winton writes so well I spend weeks having flashbacks - I can smell the sand during our summer holidays.The book is a series of short stories that turn out to be linked in some (often very subtle) ways. I cant recommend it enough - or any of his books for that matter - see Dirt Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"I heard Tim Winton's interview on the Bob Edwards radio show and was impressed. I have fond memories of our year and a half in Australia, so I bought the book. It's the most powerful storytelling I've read in a long time. It often touched me on a very human level. Though I was raised in Huntington Beach, California during the 1960s, I felt a connection to his writing. The stories The Turning & Boner McPharlin's Moll were especially moving for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible German thrash metal","review":"Destruction was one of the best thrash metal bands to come out of the 80's and probably *the* best German thrash band. There is an incredible improvement in the musicianship between their first album, Sentence of Death, and their second, Infernal Overkill. Sentence of Death, while fun and good in parts, sounds like the band were kicked awake and given 20 minutes of studio time to do the recording. Infernal Overkill though, is incredible. The difference in quality is astounding, with the band showing its appreciation of classical music in some of the song structures. The best songs are probably Bestial Invasion and Black Death and the seriously impressive instrumental Thrash Attack (which sounds like it could have been written after channeling Beethoven during a seance).If you like thrash or even death metal, give these guys a try, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY, I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.","review":"I stuck it out and watched the entire movie.

If she were a druggie/crack whore, so highly strung out, I could understand her going to extremes not to mention a white toothpick woman like Tilda would stick out worse than a sore thumb in TJ, Mexico.

I love Rozsa's music, but this is so botched as to cause laughter.As I listened for the first time, I noticed coordination and intonation errors. The MT Choir never sounded worse.The real problem is this: The Orchestra and Chorus apparently were never in the same place at the same time. This is an assembled recording.The Orchestra recording took place months (and a continent away) from the Chorus recording. Look at the last page of the booklet.THIS DOES NOT WORK.For Telarc, who claimed fame with such prestine ideas of direct digital from decades ago, to sucumb to mixing and manipulating is shocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating!","review":"I love good film music. I admire Rozsa... In fact, I find the idea of this release a great one. What I find unacceptable is the sound. That TELARC, who used to record Kunzel (and film music) with blokcbuster sound, can fall into such dullness, is almost incredible. So, in spite of all the logos, microphones, speakers and cables listed, the sound is a muddle, blended, narrow and without punch. The consonants, by the Choir, are almost uninteligible.If you want real blockbuster sound (as scores such as these deserve) try those original Deccas, or Silva America, Varese-Sarabande, NAXOS... or old Telarc! They still know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak on grammatical notes","review":"I used this text alongside of Cerutti's Pro Archia (2nd ed.), and I found Frerich's edition of the First Catillinarian to be sorely lacking in comparison. First, the running vocabulary is presented alphabetically on each page, not by line number, extending the time it takes to find words. This may sound minor, but it makes a difference over the course of several hundred lines. But more significantly, the notes were too few and far between. After a while, I found myself forgetting to check the grammatical notes because most of the time, they didn't address the problem with which I was working. Cerutti's Pro Archia notes, on the other hand, were copious and much more detailed. So in summary Frerich's edition is useful in so far as it gives running vocabulary and a few grammatical notes, but I would choose many other annotated editions before his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Educational Tool","review":"This 60 page book provides aspiring latin scholars with the chance to understand and translate an important part of history.

From what I can tell, it is filled with inconsistencies, errors in geography and history and relies on bogus conspiracy theories to justify the war.However, the biggest reason I won't read or ever own this book is because of the title. Cindy Sheehan has been quoted as saying she'd like to go back in time to murder the president, which I guess in her deluded mind, would ensure her son would survive.

It gives grammar, shows the numbering systems. It's a very complete book.

I'm 15 and love playing the game, not for the actual gameplay itself (which is unique and interesting) but the music is so wonderful it just makes you wanna get up and dance. It blends hip hop, rap, some rock, and a whole lot of loveable goofiness. The only real downside to this CD is its hefty $25 tag. Ouch.

Obviously they're not up-to-date. But when it comes to explanations of grammar and usage, and especially the exercises and practice, I have never seen a better textbook than this, for *any* language! The building up of sentences one word at a time, the replacement drills, and so on, are perfect! And the pacing of the introduction of new words (and repetition of old ones) is excellent -- in the Reader as well.

Most historical fiction books contain too many dry facts that modern children can't seem to relate to in their own lives. This book is a wonderful story about a boy around my sons age (already something to spark his interest) and it combines the historical aspect through pirate activity and the witch trials of the time period, with more modern characters and ideas. The author uses the clever idea of time travel to make this possible. I feel children will be much more interested in a story like this one, and it helped my son stay focused and actually enjoy his historical fiction book report.

The short-novel format keeps James' winding, windy prose on story-telling task, without compromising his greatest novelistic qualities: his insights into his characters' motivations and his convincing renderings of the societies he describes. A really fantastic book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those sad, but she triumphs type of books","review":"This book is one of my favorite Henry James book. Although, I kind of wanted a happier ending for our heroine. She nevertheless perseveres and achieves her own happines. The characters are rich and reading about this time period is always interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Complex for a Novella","review":"This book by Henry James is as different as can be from his longer works, but it has its own charm. The charactization is quite complex for a novella. It's just unfortunate that Catherine is so unredeemably staid. I realize that quite a few women chose to live a life alone in those days, but she seemed quite plodding to me. She does develop into a spinster that seems to enjoy that state. And Morris is quite the cad, but we the readers are never in any doubt as to that. The doctor father is another story, He's so right-minded that it's difficult to imagine anyone could be that stubborn. And the widowed aunt is a treasure - silly, manipulative and oh so romantic. This novella is written like a play since there are only four main characters, and most of the action takes place in the house on Washington Square. I really think this book looks deceptively simple, but it is not as simple as it appears. I enjoyed the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry James at his most readable","review":"The novel is one of his briefest and most accessible. The story of a plain young woman with a comfortable income from her deceased mother, plus an inheritance that will grow substantially after her father's death, a doctor father who is ostensibly a fine man but a controlling \\"scientist,\\" and a handsome fortune hunter who doesn't want to settle for anything but the full fortune -- all of this contributes to a riveting plot. I was particularly eager to read it before seeing the new Broadway revival of \\"The Heiress,\\" which is based on Washington Square."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little book","review":"I had the pleasure of playing Morris Townsend in The Heiress, the play version of James' Washington Square at my local theatre. In preparation for the role I read the novel and was delighted. Unlike the play, which tries to make up the viewers mind about who is good and who is bad, James' original novel is all about gray area; one never really knows who is the antagonists are. Catherine, no doubt, is the protagonist, but its hard to gauge who the real villian is, Morris or Catherine's father. Either way, it doesn't matter as Catherine ultimately makes her own decision, which is what the book is really about: taking control of one's life. Like any James work, Washington Square is a thought-provoking read. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE","review":"Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!!

This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start, but worth it","review":"This is a classic series! Modesitt's world of good and evil (Chaos and Order) is intriguing and keeps you hooked.

The series really picks up and the books are deeply entwined with one another"},{"rating":"2","title":"....well...","review":"I didnt think the book was too bad. It was a little boring at points but it was also gripping and I found myself reading into the night. The sound fx were annoying at first (wheeee eeee especially) but I got used to them and actually enjoyed the book. I recommend it because its a fresh new look to the science of magic. Its a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Issues to consider...","review":"Boy I hate to be the only bad review! There were several aspects of this book that halted the \\"story living in my imagination\\" and made me realize I was reading words on a page. One - sounds are not described anywhere in the book. Passages that contain \\"whack...ching....thump\\" do not tell you what action is taking place, nor what the sounds were attributed to. You are forced to guess what is happening until the next paragraph, where more often than not the action isn't explained. Two - there is a timeflow problem. One minute a character is laying on the ground in an unknown state, and one sentence later is staggering towards the door. When did they get up? How? Slowly, weakly, spasmodically, what? These books will be great reads for some. Myself, I guess I'm just used to a different authorship style."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad, but not great","review":"This book is hard to describe. It's certainly not the worst fantasy I've ever read, but it's far from the best. The writing is uneven. The characters are extremely blase about events around them and don't bother questioning a lot of what happens. The main character, Lerris, just suddenly has magical powers that should be astonishing and he merely yawns as if he knew and goes about making a table. Having said all that, the story is interesting in parts and it moves along.The worst things about L.E. Modesitt's writing are the sounds. He gives sound effects to every tiny stupid thing in the book. Every time the horse whinnies, it has an imitation sound that no real horse would make. A door slams and there's the attempt to make the noise into words. It's very distracting and pointless. I became very frustrated with this style very quickly.On the whole, it wasn't a bad way to spend a few days. But I don't think I'll be reading anymore about Recluce in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst fantasy book i have ever read","review":"This has to be the worst fantasy book i have ever read. The first 100 pages of the book are so boring! Plus you've got all the stupid sentences that have sounds written out like a door going cree......creek.....cree or other stuff like that, things like that get annoying very fast. This book to me was just very boring nothing happened.The characters are incredibly boring too. I would never recomend this book to anyone its horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe any of you gave this a five or four star....","review":"Yuck is about all I have to say. True, Lerris was a great character and I enjoyed a few rare parts of the book, but the rest I could only skim. Trust me, if you like fantasy, seek out Raymond E. Feist, Terry Goodkind, Terry Brooks, or Robert Jordan. Tracy Hickman's Deathgate Cycle Books are also very good. Leave this series alone though. Trust me as one who has read plenty of fantasy. There are way better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this one.....","review":"I'd heard some good things about this series so I decided to read the first book. I couldn't have been more disappointed. It was so boring that I barely finished it. Come on now! There's only so much of this femenist stuff I can handle. I can't remember reading a book where women were any more superior and stronger than the men. Yes, women are strong and equal, but to make them so invincible and anti-man is very unbelievable and gave the entire book a sour taste. I like books that portray strong women but not superwomen. Come on now! Also, the magic system got boring after the first couple chapters. The only interesting characters that were slightly realistic were Lerris and his horse. At least they provided some entertainment. I give this book a lonely one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVER SO DULL....","review":"Looking for a nice meaty lengthy series to get into? Pick another. This is quite possibly the most boring book I have ever had the misfortune to read. Perhaps the other 10 or 11 books are better, but I was so turned off by the first I'll never know.

I am really at a loss to explain how anyone could give this novel a 5 star rating. I can only attribute the 5 star ratings to brand new readers, or just readers with a truly bizarre taste in prose.The author's use of sound effects in place of descriptive language is laughable. Why does Mr. Modesitt feel it necessary to describe the sound of doors opening and closing? Do we really need \\"weeee eee\\" every page to remind us of the horses. No, it only serves as a distraction, however I may consider buying the audio version of this novel for a good chuckle.It really saddens me that this book was published and promoted when there are real authors struggling just to find an agent.

I had to put it down after about four chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disruptive writing style","review":"I found this novel to have a fairly interesting plot line, even if the start was a hair slow. My biggest problem with this work was Modesitt's writing style. I often felt myself taken away from the flow of the story by the author's *very* frequent usage of nonsense letters to represent a sound or an action. Maybe it's a nitpicky complaint, but after reading this work, rather than remembering the depth of the characters, or the pull of the plotline, I came away remembering that I had to decifer what seemed like pages of \\"Wheee...eee...\\" and \\"Thrummmmm.....Thrummmm....\\" and \\"Splattttt....\\" I may check the next book of the series out from the library, but it was definitely too much of a disappointment for me to spend money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of promise, no delivery","review":"Very well written enticement on the back to buy the book. That's about the only well-written thing about it. All clothes appear to be 'faded' in the book, which is one example of a shallow, un-entertaining, and stretched write up on many pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I couldn't get past the first 70 pages of this book. It was incredibly boring. There are certain words that Modesitt used over and over and over again until I wanted to pull my hair out! Personally, I wouldn't waist my time on a book that offers nothing in the first 70 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"An killer novel with an (apparently) great magic system.","review":"I've read this book three times, and liked it every time. It's worth the money and the time it takes to read.This is the first novel (but not the first in the timeline) of a whole line of Recluce books. Don't bother with the rest of them because after this one the author completely hacks up the magic system to the point where it's obvious that anyone who uses it is an irresponsible moron who is literally endangering the safety of the world. This is because magic is divided into light and dark, and any use of either one causes the other to become stronger. Therefore over-using the good (dark/order) side of magic causes a huge buildup of the bad (light/chaos) side of magic, in turn causing wicked backlashes that can disrupt the tectonic strata of the world; followed by a massive long-term decline in the presence of magic (so much that people who depend on it for life extension up and die for its lack). Gee, like using this stuff is smart. Not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Library binding is not worth even the price of a paperback - which is what it is. They take a paperback, cut off the paper margin edges, and somehow bind it in a cheap cardboard binding.I'd give it 0 stars if I could.The book, by Modesitt, would be well worth the investiment in a regular paperback or a real hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better the second time","review":"The first time I read this book I thought it was OK. However, I read again and realized what a really wonderful story it was. The storyline is quite fresh compared to many fantasy novels. I enjoyed seeing Lerris' character evolve. The only thing that I didn't like was the author's \\"sound effects.\\" I found it distracting. (\\"Thunk\\", \\"Slap\\", \\"Plop\\"; I felt like I was watching the old \\"Batman\\" series!) But I would definitely recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the top five fantasy series ever written.","review":"In my three decades of reading fantasy novels this series is in my top five of all time. Other series in my top five are Jordans 'Wheel of Time', Eddings 'Belgariad' and 'Mallorean' series, among others.I recognize some will have differing opinions, but if you take me at my word you'll not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Started off a little slow but once it got moving it really pulled me in. Magic system is very interesting and seems pretty unique. Not a huge fan I the writing style (first person although not all of the rest of the series is). Likes it more than enough to continue the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull meets pointless","review":"If there's a point to this meandering, repetitive, and banal \\"epic\\" I certainly missed it. The author spends almost more time talking about what the main character eats than on what he feels or seeks. The moralism isn't even two dimensional and the characters in general fail to engage either the reader's interest or sympathy. The reveals come out of nowhere, as do the character's various triumphs; right after he gets done telling us how lost and hopeless he is, he goes out and decimates the fearsome enemy.I kept hoping it would get better, but this trudge never really picks up the pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull. Total waste of time.","review":"I really have no idea to whom this book might appeal. I can only assume that the people who think it is good have never read anything that is actually well-written. If they had, they would realize what a piece of garbage this is. I am 2/3 through it and I am just going to throw it out. I kept waiting for the plot to become clear, for the characters to develop, and for the main thrust of the book to present itself.My favorite character in the book is a horse who doesn't say anything.This book was a waste of my time. If you are widely-read, I would say don't bother. For younger, more inexperienced readers, go right ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS SO BORED","review":"I had picked up this book because I was looking for a new series to spend my time reading... trust me it definitly took up time.I Hated this book with a passion I have been reading fantasy books for 10 years and have a serious collection going. But until this moment I never had read a fantasy book this bad. The character Lerris was so bored and whinny that just wanted to shoot him with some chaos magic and get it over with. The bad guy Antoinne or something like that didn't have any character development...he was just some guy using chaos magic and commanding things from a distance. The noise effects came out of nowhere every couple of paragraph the stupid horse would whinny \\"wheee...\\". It was really dumb. By the end of the book I was skimming pargraphs rather then reading. The only intresting thing was Lerris's love intrests, not the character's themselves but the developing relationship. Unfortunately this wasn't really explored in depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellipses!!!!!!","review":"Why ... are ... there ... so ... many ... ellipses ... in ... this ... book????The concept could have been good and the magic system is novel, but it is very poorly written and does little to make you like the characters or want to read more about them. Also, the author has an annoying habit of not only using...too...many...ellipses, but also using archaic words and then using them way too much. There are a solid several pages in the beginning of the book where the word 'cubit' was used 5-10 times per page, and then he doesn't use it again for many many pages, even though he gives the measure of several things. It was annoying to use the word so much, and then...what? did he get hit on the head and forget it?Overall, I'm sure that this is for someone but I am not that person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit slow to warm up, then a good story","review":"This book wasn't easy to like for the first few chapters, as Lerris seemed too blah, and the writing was just a step off beat.

The book really steps into action when Lerris leaves Recluse and has to learn to fend for himself in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received this item.","review":"Never received this product.

He says he doesn't believe in miracles, revelation, faith, or anything related to the unknown, unseen, untried. I felt very sad after reading such a negative portrayal of what keeps many people going and trying to leave the world a little better than they found it. If you need to feel uplifted don't pick up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bellow at his best","review":"If you want to see this writer in full bloom, you will need go to his earlier works. This novel got respectful if unenthusiastic reviews in the press, and I would concur. The novel often seems more about the narrator than Ravelstein, and reads like thinly disguised memoir (and not particularly compelling memoir at that). Not an exciting read but if you are a Bellow fan (and I am), then something is better than none at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's only alive while Ravelstein is","review":"In this faux memoir, Bellow gives us Abe Ravelstein, a fascinating, infuriating and ultimately delightful character. This is the book's problem. Being so much larger than life, Ravelstein's presence overwhelms all the other characters so that they totally disappear into the background. When Ravelstein dies, the book for all intents and purposes ends as an interesting read. It limps along with Chick's own brush with death which just feels tacked on. I am aware that this book has a basis in reality, but it just doesn't hold together well. The character that Bellow has created in Ravelstein; regardless of his origin, deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramblings of an old man","review":"I would never have finished this book except my book club chose it and I felt obligated to finish. It was an utter waste of time. It portrayed academia at its worst - snobbish, cultish,name-dropping, using people, especially students, self-centered. It was disorganized and senile. What's the point of repeatedly putting in \\"the-ah, the-ah\\"? Just say he stammers. The professor's selfish, luxurious life was disgusting. Maybe it was supposed to be about old age and decripitude. Despite all the philosophical meandering, I saw nothing worth sharing. What a contrast to Tuesdays with Morrie! There someone shared a final journey and cared about people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YIN exploits YANG","review":"Imagine for a moment a world populated by Saul Bellow(Chick) clones with think alike wonderful brains. Now...Take a deep breath... We would all be motionless observers and super refined \\"Yin\\" type critics of anything and everything that moves, or tries to produce any amount of \\"Yang\\" energy. Unfortunately, how can we all make a living writing about nervous little barbed TV artists, powerful bald heads destroyed by excessive sex, overzealous, restless, overdevoted wives ...if they're all now inexistant !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me cold","review":"Perhaps because I thought I was reading a novel and not a thinly disguised biography of someone Bellow knew (and whom I do not), Ravelstein left me cold. Bellow has always been a favorite of mine, and I picked up this book with great anticipation, read it, and put it down with great disappointment. (Maybe I missed something, but what WAS all that rambling off at the end about Chick's fish poisoning?).I'll stick with Henderson the Rain King and Humboldt's Gift, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"luminous","review":"It's unfortunate that the content and true theme of this novel has been subsumed by unseemly literary gossip. This a luminous, beautiful, utterly devastating literary photograph of everything that matters: friendship, love, philosophy, food, sex, marriage, literature, work, basketball, and more. I think Saul Bellow must have loved his friend, very much, to write such a thing.Saul Bellow's ability to plumb the depths through his flawless evocation of the surface is unparalleled. I looked at the faces of those around me in a new light for weeks after finishing this book: to what extent is character revealed by appearance? The plot does 'unravel' at the end, as does our narrator. As we all do, I suspect. I think it's a mistake to assume anything Bellow does is unintentional - including the repetitions and the eventual disintegration of the plot. This is a wonderful, moving, thought-provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of a True Original","review":"This fictionalized portrait of Bellow's friend Allan Bloom captures a brilliant, eccentric, unpredictable \\"public intellectual\\" in his last days. Pundits on the right and the left tried to pigeonhole him, but Bloom remained his own person to the end, and inspired Bellow to write his best book in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ravelstein or Revelations?","review":"This an excruciatingly short review:If you rearrange the letters in RAVELSTEIN and add an O, you will have REVELATIONS. Does this encoded word refer to the treatment of Bloom? Or does it reflect the author's feeling that his work is somehow God-given?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine, but lacking in depth","review":"Saul Bellow's slim eulogy to the late Allen Bloom in novel form has its moments, but it is ultimately a superficial achievement. Banking on the colorful eccentricities of the late professor of philosophy, Bellow is content to retreat from anything resembling a story. I preferred the intricate weavings of philosophy, art, and life that Bellow was able to create and Herzog, whereas in Ravelstein he takes it for granted that the subject is supremely interesting to the reader. Still, I admit that Bellow is quite at home in the elite intellectual circles that Bloom liked to frequent at the University of Chicago, and his pedantic monologues about the ancient Greeks, Rousseau, and Machiavelli have a certain amount of resonance. But this is still a well-written puff piece at the end of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plotless Wonder","review":"It's the old \\"I'm a sidekick of this brilliant extrovert; let me tell you about him\\" plot. The narrator seemingly unconsciously repeats many facts about the extrovert's character, and that is more maddening than endearing. It's Bellow, of course, so there are many fine Kodak moments, but overall this book is a disappointment, with little plot to speak of, not as good as \\"The Actual,\\" or even \\"The Dean's December\\" (but still better than a ton of books out there). One of the stars I'm giving it is just for the final radiant pages. Would that the rest of the book were as striking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"A real disappointment. I loved Humboldt's Gift and the subject matter here intrigued me. But it felt like such an undisciplined meander. Frequent repetitions, very many surface descriptions. I never felt like I got to know Ravelstein/Bloom in any real depth. Or maybe his love of expensive things was what he was all about. But without a serious examination of his learning and beliefs (because after all, isn't that what this man was really about) he remains a 2 dimensional popinjay.Disappointed in Bellow's writing. At the end he goes in to that long passage about almost dying but never once relates it to what Ravelstein/Bloom must have been going through as he died. I thought there was such rich ground here for parallels/depth about dying and the human condition. But instead it all read very much like a \\"Dear Diary\\" rendition of his life. And I thought the book was supposed to be about so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamefully lazy writing","review":"Easily the worst Bellow I've read. There is no story, no structure, no sustained characterization except for Ravelstein, no gentle touches. No female is given flesh. The book reads like Bellow's notes from the last ten years. The writing, like most of Bellow, is intelligent, sometimes quite perceptive, cold-blooded, and attempts irony and false self-deprecation. At times he seems cagey, sly, contemptuous of readers. Virtually the entire \\"biography\\" is woven from pastiche and haphazard observations and self-ruminations. Add a star if you're a big Allen Bloom fan (that's where mine came from)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know","review":"Now I know why Saul Bellow is considerd one of the best writers of our time. Ravelstien was my first Bellow read and I loved it. Now I want to read all his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tedious Work of Ideas","review":"This is a solid novel of ideas, but is not one of Bellow's best books. In parts, one wonders why one should even care so much about Abe Ravelstein beyond what some would describe as his exacting intellect. Bellow's later work has not aged very well and this is a prime example of why it has not."},{"rating":"2","title":"First half delicious,second half so-so","review":"Saul Bellow promised Alan Bloom that he would write a memoir of him after his death .Ravelstein is a thinly disguised fictional account of his friend as he was dying of AIDS. Bellow plays Bozwell to the T as he paints a vivid picture of the colorful professor with his love of Cuban cigars, Hermes ties , shirts from Jermyn street & Plato .As long as Bellow sticks to his purported theme he makes for quite an enjoyable read as he recounts the quirks,eccentricities,wit and brilliance of Alan Bloom .However the second half of this novel is no more than morbid navel-gazing on the part of Bellow as he broods over his own mortality and brush with death . I don't particularly like Bellow's prose ,though he does compensate for the stylistic deficiency with his somewhat unique wit and idiosyncratic observation ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ravelstein","review":"While I appreciated the chance to spend time again with the unique voice and viewpoint that Saul Bellow brings to each of his works, I am sorry to say that I found the book to be a disappointment. Surprisingly for a Bellow novel, the portrayal of Ravelstein seemed very one-dimensional, and I felt that the decision to devote the last third of this very short book to the narrator's medical problems rather than to a final orchestration of Ravelstein's life and personality was misguided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, the only novel of Bellow which I've read. Some of it, such as the characterization of the life-loving, awkward Ravelstein/Bloom is quite good, but Bellow lets off too easy the male companion, who is nothing more than an expensive prostitute, by describing him as an \\"Asian prince\\". The waterfall of red orchids is an interesting image, but Bellow keeps needlessly repeating it. Likewise, it's not exactly a profundity to observe with wonder how the human heart beats on ceaselessly etc. - this has been said many times before and with greater elegance. Also, we keep hearing how very beautiful and intelligent the narrator's wife is etc.- enough already. It is readable and workmanlike, but hardly the novel one might expect from a Nobel prize winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow.....Dull......","review":"Can someone explain to me why this book has gotten glowing reviews and high praise? I've read half of the book and so far, nothing has happened. So OK, Ravelstein is supposed to be Allan Bloom and he's brilliant and witty and Bellow loved him. I am not charmed by Ravelstein/Bloom's charm and scintillating conversation, alas. Bellow also is taking the opportunity to trash his ex-wife in a very nasty and unpleasant way. (Do we really need to hear about her pubic hair? ) My recommendation: if you're curious and want to read it, DON'T pay big bucks for the hardcover. Get it from the library because you probably won't be able to finish it any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary","review":"A book that covers everything about Bloom, except for what made him interesting: his ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, but not functional puppet","review":"We bought this as a Christmas gift for my 10 month old son. The fur is soft and bright and he likes to look at the puppet, but nether I nor my husband can use this puppet as intended. It is very poorly designed and doesn't work for either large or small hands. There is no way to comfortably have fingers move (or even be inside) his mouth and arms at the same time. You have to pick which one you want to move and then switch your fingers around if you want to move the other. Plus, the mouth is so rigid, it is impossible to make him talk for more than 10 seconds without getting a hand cramp. Cute, but useless as a puppet. He is now just a an (un)stuffed animal laying limply around the house; VERY disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookie Monster, a favorite","review":"My little granddaughter will be thrilled with Cookie Monster.

However, I didn't know the eyes were fixed - huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"C is for Cookie","review":"Ok, our 3-month-old infant LOVES visits from Cookie Monster. In fact, we can play for 40-60 minutes. She loves to give Cookie hugs as he waxes on about how cookies are delicious with milk but are sometimes-food. Sure she doesn't understand what he's saying, but Cookie is smaller than her (and non-threatening), very animated (like I said-gives great hugs), and super soft. She laughs and speaks to him as if they were best friends.I have to agree with some of the reviews in that I can't actually articulate his mouth very well. Short of adding arm rod controls or sacrificing moving arms, I'm not sure you can. But it's all about attitude. You have to feel your inner Cookie Monster, make the monster voice, and talk up a storm. Kids I think will forgive the fact that his lips don't move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap looking pot_don't buy","review":"I just got the medium sized clay pot.

It has a lot of typoos which is bothering, but it is good enough to let the author still pass. The reference at the end of the book is particularly useful, because modules and their methods are presented in an order, so that one finds them, when one needs them. I think the book starts entry level and guides quite high up. Still it's not all encompassing: For instance one needs extra material for XML programming and so on. But there are further books, like \\"XML Processing with Python\\", \\"Python Programming on Win32\\" or the best Python reference ever: \\"Python essential Reference\\" published by New Rider, all to get on amazon dot com, of course. When I have to recommend a Python book to a newcommer, and I also want, that he will become good fast, then he'll get this quick Python book.

Would never recommend this to anyone!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My cats weren't interested in this at all.","review":"The gun is not very practical. The liquid easily leaks out and the gun is so loud it scares, rather than entices, the cats. Also, it doesn't make very many bubbles before it runs out of liquid, because the chamber is too small. Also, the liquid does not smell like catnip at all - it is virtually scent free. My cats had absolutely no interest in this toy at all, and they are both very friendly, playful cats.

The authors keep tossing up a squeaky-tog boogieman -- dog training by harsh methods -- methods that haven't been current in over twenty years. However, I would have rated the book at 3 stars if it weren't for the fact that the authors state that \\"there are many pet stores that guarantee the dogs they sell and are extremely responsible in choosing where their dogs come from.\\" This is on page 65, where they actually imply that a pet store is \\"responsible\\" if it gets its puppies from a USDA licensed dealer. This is appallingly bad advice. It is NEVER a good idea to buy a dog from a pet store, unless you don't mind supporting puppy mills."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Foxes","review":"The Little Foxes written by Lillian Hellman is an excellant read. Hellman's play shows the evils and innocence of the south that plauged it at the turn of the century. Hellman divides the characters of her book into the evil and innocent. The innocent not being able to stop the evil and only standing by and watching it happen. The Little Foxes shows that people brought up in bad times, surroundings and society can overcome these ills or fall prey to them. The Little Foxes is an excellant and captivating read with the good, the bad and the ugly of society. I liked The Little Foxes because it is a dramatic read with lively and spirited characters who keep you turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elmo Hand Puppet","review":"The Elmo hand puppet looks nothing like the character on Sesame Street.

With practice, it works, although it gets me tired after 5 min.The body of the puppet should be stuffed so Elmo would look more realistic when hands are in.It probably won't fit large hands.The 2nd unit we got has a more stuffed head and softer mouth structure plastic.Practice your Elmo voice and have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"the mouth of elmo is hard to open and the arm holes are difficult to put your fingers in, and it does look just like the picture"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Professional, But Kids Love It!!!","review":"Consider the price when purchasing this product.

So I figured this would be a perfect puppet to use with my daughter.Here's the thing. The opening into the head of this puppet is too small to get a grown ups hand into and still be able to operate the puppet with any ease. This puppet is easier to operate than the Ernie puppet, (which I also bought) but still pretty difficult.The overall look of the puppet is good, but it isn't very user friendly. Needless to say, I am pretty disappointed in this product and wish that I wouldn't have bought it.If you are looking for a puppet to entertain your infant, try checking out Toys R Us.

The book captures how it feels to be young and in love, to be young and misunderstood, to be experienced and bitter, to feel torn between two selves. The novel shows us both hard and loveable sides of each of three main characters--constantly challenging our desire to judge and fix each character's nature in one place. The book ends ambiguously as if we really had encountered these people in life and then suddenly lost touch. The two seductions of a 16-year-old boy--first by a 30-year-old woman and secondly by a 15-year-old girl--are presented without any vulgarity but in a way that makes clear the sordid nature of the sex which is close to rape.

Every stereotype and preconception of the gay lifestyle that's used by the right wing to attack us is thrown up onto the screen and sets us back another twenty years. Celebrity guest stars? I don't consider porn stars celebrities, and the few real celebrities there were, barely qualify. I was sad to see RuPaul lend her talents to this trainwreck.

The whole movie was a series of commercials for several gay themed products; literally looking into the camera to talk about the products and services. It was in character and campy, which is to be expected from the movie, but it was still WAY WAY WAY too much. All the jokes were way to much. There is a scene with violent vomiting that went on for too long, I actually had to fast forward through it. It was unnecessarily too long. The campiness prevents the movie from being anything other than a joke of film- you can't get into the characters or have an appreciation for them.

RuPaul is the highlight of the whole movie and Lady Bunny is good but I just didn't like her character.The main premise is our quartet is reuniting for Spring Break in Florida. They are competing for the title: Miss Gay Gone Wild by sleeping with as many people as possible. Unfortunately, the movie is neither clever nor funny, it just has lot's of humping and nudity.

The director only stays on one camera for about a second, then cuts to another angle. This happens for the entire Video and it drives me CRAZY! I'd rather have one angle of a far shot of the entire band for the whole concert than these constant one second shots.

Because I teach at a highly competitive University, the students tend to be intelligent and extremely diligent; they are, at the very least, capable of activitely applying themeselves to learning a language and using their rational faculties to understand grammatical patterns and apply them in the generation of original German sentences. The authors of Kontakte, however, seem to have little regard for this capacity of the brain. Instead, they think of learning a language as something purely passive; a process of osmosis, whereby, through the mere exposure to German utterances and their mindless repitition, students will magically gain a linguistic competence.

These stories offer parents and children interesting ways to deal with daily chores and struggles that can sometimes seem overwhelming. I enjoyed reading this book as a child and couldn't resist purchasing it for my girls 4 and 2 to enjoy. We have been working our way through various childrens' novels as part of our bedtime ritual. Books like this are good for holding the attention of children at various levels of reading and reading comprehension. These stories have also served as a springboard for discussion in our family about finding creative new ways to accomplish the many tasks that need to be done to keep the household running. Some of the material may seem dated, but it's definetely a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!","review":"Mrs. Piggle Wiggle is every child's friend--fictional and real. To the children in the books she offers magical cures for classic naughtiness and the friendship of a sympathetic adult outside the child's family. To her readers, she offers the pleasures of uncomplicated fun and amusement, plus a chance to gently mock the funny ways of parents and children alike. Her world, though dated, is surely one a child would enjoy, complete with Moms who are attentive and available to their children. Mrs. Piggle Wiggle doesn't deal in issues, causes, psychological or emotional problems--just laughter. In this world, don't our kids need more of that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love this book.

But all I can say is that I think and most people will agree with me that all Mrs. Piggle Wiggle books are the best!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate, Not Updated for Modern Times","review":"This was one of my favorite books from childhood, however, my memory did not serve me well. I bought this book for my 7YO son and was dismayed at the improper phrases to describe the mothers, fathers and children in the book (e.g., wife crying to get her way with her husband, describing a child as \\"fat girl\\"). The contents of this book should be modernized and re-edited. There also are several $3-words used, which are not appropriate for a young audience. Simple is best. Impudent? Really? Why not just use the word \\"rude?\\"In addition to those flaws, I did not enjoy reading the stories again as an adult. They didn't live up the magical, humorous memories that I had. Instead, the \\"cures\\" are quite boring and uninventive. Why I thought they were so clever as a girl...

She used to be married to a pirate, but he died. Now she lives in an upside down house.

I thought it was a stupid story.The stories are all too weird and so are the kids, like the boy who takes tiny bites and the unlikable twins who quarrel all the time. Then there are kids who aren't as weird like the ones who don't go to bed on time. Mrs. Piggle Wiggle comes up with weird ways to make them all obey, even those obnoxious quarreling twins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"I never liked the Mrs. Piggle Wiggle series and found the stories weird and the characters far from appealing. To this day I can't stand \\"The Radish Cure.\\" That had to be the most asinine story in creation. I found it repulsive. Who on earth would plant seeds in the dirt on their child's body? While most kids liked these stories, they didn't appeal to me at all. \\"The Selfishness Cure\\" was also ridiculous. I didn't like it when Dick was told he had to give half of his dessert to the dog before his possessions were no longer labeled. No, I was never an avid Mrs. Piggle Wiggle fan.

My favorite part of the book was when a boy named Hubert got stuck in his room because he kept thinking that his mom would clean up his room every time he messed it up.

The book is at least as much a corporate history of Stinson Aircraft as it is about the airplanes themselves. There was decent coverage of the early aircraft types, but the later Stinson Reliant and Voyager types were glossed over. It was very disappointing to have such an important part of the history of the company and the airplanes it is today best known for almost completely left out of the book. I don't think that two pages for the entire series of Gullwing Stinson Reliants was anywhere close to adequate. The book is worth it if for no other reason than it is the only book on Stinson Aircraft on the market, but if there were any other options I would not recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"IRS on Ice","review":"A full moon brings out the crazies, but an IRS auditor in the freezer of Conan Flag's favorite bar and restaurant is more than enough.

Since that I already own that video, there was little new for me on this one. I gave this a 2 star rating because of the poor quality of the British TV segment and the fact that most of the performances are duplicative of the other DVD.

I was very disappointed to find that it (and the previous book in the series) are chock full of typos.Judging by all the errors I'd say the process for creating the kindle edition is to scan the paperback edition and run those images through a third rate piece of OCR software. Here are but a few examples from the kindle edition: \\"hp\\" instead of \\"lip\\", \\"stem\\" instead of \\"stern\\", \\"Utter\\" instead of \\"Litter\\".It really is a shame because as I said, the book is great and an enjoyable read, but all the mistakes in the kindle edition really detract from it.Skip the kindle edition and buy the paperback"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book--","review":"I loved this book.

Has a huge nostalgia appeal as it offers a window into a far happier, livelier Paris before the first encroachments of multicultural devastation. The soundrack is phenomenal and Melville's film making artistry is unimpeachable and cannot be compared to some of the entusiastic epigones some reviewers mention. The entire opening sequence, to the point when Jeff Costello breaks into a parked Citroen, rankjs among the finest few in cinema history. Basically, \\"Le Samourai\\" is Melville's tribute to the American gangster cinema of the 40's and 50's and one in which, aesthetically and artistically, the student surpassed his idols.Jean-Pierre Melville (1917-1973) was at his peak in late 60's when besides Le Samourai, he made two amazing nail-baiting thrillers \\"L'Armee Des Ombres\\" (1969) and \\"Le Cercle Rouge\\" (1970)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Delon fans","review":"As I stated in my title, this dvd is ONLY FOR DELON FANS.

Also, I couldn't get, why, did Delon used gloves to hide his fingerprints, and at the same time kills his victim, at a Club filled with guests, where anybody could see him. His suits and shoes, are of an extreme fashion design, but at the same time, he lives in a horrible (dump), apartment. This is a film, with a very unsatisfying ending, where one finishes the story with a lot of why this or why that....I agree with one of the reviewers above, the best acting came from...yes you guessed it...the bird in the cage.

IF you are a fan of classic French Noir, then you have probably seen or at least heard of this film. The film is very quiet. There is little dialogue wasted, but this gives weight and seriousness to each line the characters speak. Every scene is shot with Melville's exacting direction. Simply amazing. Great acting, great directing, and a wonderful translation and subtitle job by Criterion.Bravo Criterion!Oh, and something interesting and sad... the studio burned down towards the end of (or after) filming and the little bird was lost to the blaze."},{"rating":"2","title":"genius noir--not for the impatient","review":"Melville creates a fantastically slow-paced and visually stunning neo-noir thriller about Jef Costello (played by Alain Delon), a brilliant but socially broken hired killer. Delon is as cool and slick as Steve McQueen at his best, but prettier and lonelier. Those who are looking for lots of running, fighting, and explosions should stay far away from this one, and Melville never includes dialogue if he can get by without it. The first line of the film comes more than ten minutes after the opening, but the story is about solitude, isolation, and disconnection. Delon's then-wife Nathalie plays the ethereally beautiful Jane Lagrange, Jef's part-time lover and alibi. If you love smart, patient cinema, and don't mind subtitles, you should definitely check this out.Also, the Criterion features, including a well-assembled booklet, are well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epitome of 'Cool'","review":"Delon at his coolest and best. The clothes, the hat, the cars. All scream '60's COOL'. This update(from the Japanese) of the lonely hitman, the outsider with few friends, has been a long time coming to DVD. Any fan of the French new wave, who has never caught this film, should see it immediately. There are many themes and influences that are later repeated in the American crime films of the 70's. The only reason that it does drop a star, is that is was a film very much of its time and place. As such, it should be viewed historically, and may disappoint fans of later, more violent, US and Japanese films in the same genre. Delon steals every scene by doing almost nothing. A masterclass in mimalism, and a good example for the later much wordier, and more character-driven pieces we are more used to. For the more mature movie buff, it's a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, cool, cool! Delon at his best. Melville at his best.","review":"This could be the best movie I've seen. If you enjoy noir, and dark movies (a la David Lynch), you'll definately like this one. The story's good, the acting is awesome- Alain Delon is perfect as the incredibly stylish recluse hitman, Jef Costello. Melville's shooting is beautifully dark and alluring. This movie makes you want to live in Costello's world even though he's the ultimate loner- and killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost a masterpiece","review":"Jef Costello is a hired assasin who makes somewhat of a blunder on one of his jobs. He allows a witness to clearly see him and later gets arrested. For some strange reason, the person who clearly saw him leaving the scene of the crime refuses to identify him in a police line up. Jef also makes up an elaborate alibi to \\"prove\\" that he wasn't at the crime scene when the murder occured. After the police release him, things get a bit complicated because Jef has a weakness for a woman piano player and the people who hired him turn on him.The main character makes this a very good film, but just doesn't come across as convincing as some of the other assasins I've seen on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"They just don't make them like this anymore","review":"There is actually little mystery and it's not exactly a thriller;however, it is a fantastic movie experience that has style. I am not sure how the director pulled it off - there is always a feeling of something is about to happen and it might or it might not - you just don't know and that is a great idea in this movie.

Melodic medium-weight guitar based rock with a few nice balads and the occasional political statement thrown in for good measure. The production is high quality which serves their material and musicianship well. You'd be hard pressed to find another band of their quality with such consistency - their last three albums haven't had a weak moment.A smart thing they've done is limit the CD to 11 songs, all of which are good. Too often the stuff at the end of a 15 track CD bring the whole thing down a peg.Now, if they really had tried taking a new direction - and succeeded in doing so - this might have received 5 stars.

By my opinion it is one of the most haunting movies ever, cause the real terror is not obvious to see, but caused by the main characters. There are many great shock-moments that will make your heart beat like a heavy-metal drum. The special-effects are also state-of-the-art. But I have to say, that the movie is pretty violent and so not very suited for people with not so strong stomachs. But if you have the gift of bringing a strong stomach with you, this movie is a \\"must-see\\" for you. The ending of the movie ist the most shocking scene, I ever encountered.

And the special effects looked like they were computer generated. What bothered me the most was that there was to explanation at the end.

The sets also offered pointlessly Gothic design (hallways that looked like abattoirs) inane set elements that were added just because they looked cool (headlights on a black hole generator?), all adding up to the set designer falling in love with his own sketches and the director letting him.Any crew spending any amount of time in that ship would have wigged out on their own, no Hell necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe I Paid for This","review":"After viewing this movie, I had a heated argument with my friend who said this movie was worth paying the rental fee.

It reminded me of \\"The Shining\\" transported into space with less actual mind-bending horror and more unnecessary gore.

It starts off as good science fiction. In fact, the modern physics I studied in school came in handy trying to understand how a ship could travel beyond what looked like the speed of light by bending space. However the film just falls apart as they seem to go beyond the universe. This is not even made clear. Sam Neill pulls out his eye balls and tells Laurence Fishburne something to the effect that where they are going is beyond hell and you don't need your eyes there. This is more horror than science fiction. This is NOT for CHILDREN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, Disturbing, and Blood-Filled.

The ship is evilly alive(???). No explanation other than *it* went to the other side and returned that way. The alternate Universe is pure chaotic evil? Pure chaotic evil couldn't last.

If Hollywood is going to do camp, it should use a camp budget and it will have a camp feel- others on my Money In / Junk Out list include: Waterworld (Mad Max on high budget low return), Titanic (you don't need 200 mill to do a love story), Godzilla (was there a story?), Armageddon / Deep Impact (the bane of capitalism is to have two studio pay big bucks to make the same movie at the same time and still not get one iota of inventiveness ) Money In / Junk Out 1999 Oceanic Multimedia"},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad, and not so-bad-it's-good","review":"This movie is excruciating to watch- it treats its ludicrous premise with unrelenting gravitas, and has nothing to offer other than some cool set design and occasionally impressive F/X.

Unfortunately, Hollywood couldn't carry the concept through and it degenerated into a sci-fi slasher flick, and not even an interesting one, at that.

We were laughing at the end - Neill on the barbie!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!

By that, I don't mean that it will make you jump; I mean that it will make you hide. The premise, of the starship \`Event Horizon' disappearing and resurfacing with unequaled horrors aboard is intense enough, but Sam Neill's twisted performance and the film's stellar use of technical aspects (the sound, the sets, the cinematography) help propel this film into top tier horror territory. Sure, parts of the film feel truly ripped from other films, films that are arguably better as a whole, but there is no denying the intensity presented here that is often unrivaled in other offerings. I will admit that this film heavily steals from \`Solaris', which is a far more intellectual and profound film (especially the 1972 original) but the horror implements help this film stand on its own, especially since \`Solaris' is not a horror film. It is well worth a watch it you are into sci-fi horror, of which this is one of the better available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trys too hard to be scary.","review":"The end result is a dull, uninteresting movie.

It's basically a member of the standard stranded-with-a-terrible-monster-on-the-loose horror movie genre, but with a plot and characters that don't make any sense at all.

What I saw was a dull, predictable film with little to comment it. Some of the scenes were good but the whole thing was boring. A few months later when I had the chance to rent it I watched it twice more to see if perhaps I had missed something, but no - it was still boring.I have heard rumours that nearly half an hour of footage was cut from the film and I expected the DVD to feature this extra footage, just to see if this changed the feel of the movie. No such luck. Until then, this must rank alongside films such as the Critters series and Titan Find as plain dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Flick","review":"The eye candy in this movie was phenominal. As was the story line and cinematography. Some said the acting was sub-par, but it's a Sci-Fi movie. If you want fine acting, watch The Godfather or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The most intriguing part of the movie is when you find out where this ship has been and what it has seen. Pretty nutty stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction or Horror?","review":"EVENT HORIZON is an engaging film. I think it is good science fiction but with explorations into multiple dimensions of time and space that are not exactly meant for the squeamish or faint of heart. I enjoyed the premise of the film and also felt the convincing performances from the strong cast deserve recognition. To tell too much of the plot would give to much away but it revolves around a small group of space explorers who encounter unusual and somewhat horrific findings from the breach of the fabric of our three dimensional world. No, not monsters but something more frightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and eerie.","review":"This movie draw you in with the dark settings, atmosphere and scientifical explanation of some events.

In fact, I often find myself laughing at the exact time that others are covering their faces or walking out of the room. However, there are two movies that I have seen in my life which have, quite frankly, scared the cr_p out of me, this being one of them. I first saw it at 13 or 14 years old with my best friend on a sleepover in my living room. Scary dreams followed that night. I watched it again just a month ago and, now being 19, thought perhaps it wouldn't have the same effect... but it did. This movie is well done with some amazing acting done by both Neil and Fishburn. I'm not a movie expert and I don't have anything \\"professional\\" to say, just that in my opinion, if you're looking for a scary movie... go for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice cast, shame about the movie","review":"Event Horizon starts promisingly enough but when it 'gets going' it certainly goes downhill.A strong cast is largely waisted with zero character development and a second half that trys to scare but just makes you feel sick.The performances are strong enough with Pertwee in particular rating a mention as the laconic Smith (this is actually a fine performance from a very talented actor with limited material), but little is done with them. Fishburne sets his impressive jaw, Quinlan runs around like a wet blanket, the pointless jive-talking black guy character (usually the first to cop it in such a flick) spends most of his time pissing around in outer space, and all the time the movie is turning into a gin show.Pertwee earns my star, whilst everyone and everything else about this movie just pissed me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My KInd of Sci-Fi","review":"Alternate realities aside, I don't consider vampires and horror stories the same thing as science fiction.

Anderson is a fan of Ridley Scott, the director of 'Alien'. In this movie he wanted to create literally a haunted house in deep space and I think he succeded.

It's basically a haunted mansion tale set in deep space. So, if you're looking for a lesson in astrophysics, you're out of luck. On the other hand, if you want to be scared and filled w/ that delightful sense of dread, then EH is your nightmare come true! Filled to bursting w/ bleak, suffocating atmosphere, this grabber is a nice, cold hand on the heart. It's also one of the few films by Paul Anderson that I will actually watch. He utilizes paranoia and unknown horrors to build this monster piece by grusome piece. Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix trilogy, \\"CSI\\") and Sam Neill (Omen 3: The Final Conflict, Jurassic Park, In The Mouth Of Madness) do most of the heavy lifting, w/ Joely Richardson, Sean Pertwee (Dog Soldiers), and Kathleen Quinlan (Twilight Zone: The Movie) filling in most of the gaps.

The gore in it was far more the was needed. I mean there where guys puking up their guts and getting eaten by what looked like magits.

I was deeply entertained and fell right into it. The atmosphere is very dark, creepy, and unwelcoming but it continues to build and it just gets badder and badder and badder until the ship unltimately turns on the rescue team.

I could barely get any sleep last night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story overidden by needless gore","review":"There's nothing wrong with taking the concepts from \\"Alien\\" and building on them in a different direction, after all if we really liked \\"Alien\\" we'd welcome more stuff like it, right? This movie had the potential to do that... but instead chose the low road of excessive blood and gore. The idea of coming up with a way to defeat the laws of physics and where it might get you is intriguing- but people being dissected alive and blowing up from a bad case of the bends (decompression) is overdone and boring... rent but don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good evening ruiner.","review":"I saw this film a year ago, and I STILL have trouble sleeping at night. This is the bleakest, darkest, most terrifying film I have ever seen. The Paramount logo at the beginning is basically the only positive moment in the movie. I still can't get past some of the images in the film, and I can't believe they didn't make additional edits to get an R rating. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed movies like ALIEN, Hellraiser and the Shining. But this film really hits you like a mental bullet to your psyche. After about the first hour, it stops becoming entertainment. Good cast, good concept, but a lack of emotional balance (i.e. little humor, too much gore) make the execution not so good. On the other hand, good soundtrack by Michael Kamen and Orbital, as well as cinematography by Adrian Biddle (who worked on ALIENS).

I felt really cheated by the cop-out explanation: the ship had been to hell. And, I'm afraid that with that sentence I've spoiled the entire of what constitutes a plot in this movie. I wanted suspense. I wanted people going crazy in the vacuum of space, with who-knows-what hiding just around the corner. Instead, I got screaming and splatter.

From the non-sensical plot to the atrocious dialogue to the strained special effects to the obligatory crew member rendered comatose by some unseen outer space force, Event Horizon is as close to unwatchable as any film you're likely to encounter in your life.

Scenes are only as connected as they need to be; the same can be said for characters' relationships to one another. The result is that the whole movie teeters a hair's breadth from nonsense at parts. It's saved primarily by its own insistence on its legitimacy and the convictions of its actors.

But the really sad thing is that there was a kernel of a good film here. That kernel was the classic Russian movie Solaris.

The spaceships look more like torture chambers than one would imagine a real space ship to look. The characters are flat and lifeless.Basically, it's Hellraiser somewhere near Uranus. But, if you're into these strange gorefest horror films, go watch Hellraiser. It's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst film ever made","review":"I think that \\"Event Horizon\\" could very well be the worst movie ever to be made in the history of film. I'd give it zero starts if possible. Now, I certainly haven't seen every movie ever made, but of the films I have seen, this is easily the movie that I hate the most. It starts off promisingly, and then just rapidly takes a nosedive into the sewage that it came from. I think the reason it is so bad is because it has the potential to be good. Scenes are set up tensely, and then just end up ......... Kathleen Quinlan's part with that dude in that air tent thing? It starts to get creepy, and then it ...... The ending? ....... An affront to movie watchers everywhere.

I'll keep this short. I love sci-fi. So that is not why I didn't like it. It started out with an interesting premise, but little by little you can see that the screen writer had no idea where he was going. I got the feeling that they were throwing in \\"scary parts\\" without connecting them in any viable way to any sort of plot. Just tacked on. The acting is decent so that's not the problem. It's mainly just that the story starts out good but then doesn't follow through. I didn't even care about the gore. It didn't scare me at all. Go watch ALIEN.

Well made, and certainly watchable, but equally missable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad.","review":"One of the worst Sci Fi movies ever made. How anyone could stuff something up this badly when they have such a decent cast and budget is beyond me. It starts well and up until about the halfway point is still relatively engaging, but after that it all falls in a screaming heap. I'm not sure what happened, perhaps they ran out of time or the original writer quit and they had to finish it quickly or something. Whatever the reason it changes for being a competent film with an intriguing if generic storyline and decent sets into a lame gorefest that is as predictable as most from that overpopulated genre. Even the gore is badly done, so if your into that then you'll be disappointed as well. I sadly went to see this at the cinema when it was first released and nearly walked out but thought that surely something would happen to tie it all together, alas I was wrong.

I guess opening up the gateway to Hell doesn't explain why things happened, eh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the 90's worst","review":"The only reason I give it one star is for the great special effects. The movie itself is awful. Does someone have to explode every time a movie takes place in outer space? It's just gore to have gore. The story makes no sense, the characters are cardboard, and sadly, Sam Neill's character makes no sense. Paul Anderson may have done wonders with the special effects of Mortal Kombat, but he has no clue on what a story is. Put it this way, he followed this debacle up with Soldier...

I do not watch horror movies but my boyfriend was wanting to see it. Convinced me that it was a space thriller and not in any means a horror movie because that is what he believed it to be. I watched the first 5 minutes of it and spent the rest of the movie with my head burried in his shoulder crying, since we had paid for it at the theatre we didn't leave. I didn't sleep for several nights and I didn't even watch any of it. It even scared him and he doesn't scare easily.

To me, the movie Sphere was everything I hoped this movie would be, and wasn't. If you want something sci-fi, suspenseful, and mysterious, see Sphere instead.Event Horizon has great special effects, but the premise is bad, the story is bad, and the whole film is just kind of nauseating, disturbing, and somehow, tedious at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood, gore, and human entrails.

But I rented it the second time and I actually got scared! The movie tricks you at the begining, making you think that its just another rip-off of The Abyss or Alien, but it slowly reveals the real story. The message in Latin at the start is scary enough, but when its revealed that the ship actually went to hell, its down right frightening.

I now understand why the proprietors liberally scattered beartraps throughout the gallery.Why don't I like it?It's pretentious, factually incorrect (you don't orbit a world *inside* its atmosphere), and ultimately very predictable. It also dredges up one of the oldest saws in the bad sci-fi toolchest, to wit \\"Mess not with things ye do not understand, lest ye limbs turneth blue and falleth to the ground\\".

Man through a pathetic contrivance becomes a vampire. 100 years later he finds the a woman who appears to be the reincarnation of the woman he loved, who again has a jealous and abusive husband, and an over-protective aunt.

I found it to be very good but I can only really give it 4 stars, why? 5 star rap albums are very rare, there are only a few of them. I didn't think 50 was that good but when a friend played some of this to me, I went and got it and now I listen to it nearly every day. If you like rap than I think there is a good chance you will like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"mainly for fans of the West Wing","review":"The idea of a new Battlestar series was a good one. It's too bad that what we got was more West Wing than the \\"reinvention\\" of the genre that we were promised. Real tragedy like September 11 mixed in with robots and soap opera makes for a mish-mash that just doesn't work for me. It gets worse as the series goes. Stick with Firefly."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PACE IS VERY SLOW!!!!","review":"The PACE of this series is VERY SLOW. As a result, it could get boring at times and fails to hold your attention into watching the next episodes.Unless you are a Battlestar Galactica fan, I wouldn't recommend buying these DVD set."},{"rating":"1","title":"help!","review":"I can't get this to play widescreen. I went through all the menu features but can't find how to change from full screen. Also, the volume is low and picture doesn't really look hd.

Is there something wrong with this item I purchased from Amazon or do I need to do something to activate to get the quality I expected? Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too much like West Wing","review":"I prefer Sci Fi that explores various alien cultures and worlds. Battlestar is so much like West Wing that it sacrifices any hope of such exploration. Olmos even said he'd quit if they added aliens. I like this slightly more than West Wing, but only slightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another remake","review":"I don't question Hollywood for taking a beloved cheesy children's show and turning it into a modern remake. Remakes are all the rage these days. Unfortunately this one is way too serious for it's own good. Will I really find the answers to life's great mysteries in a serious version of a cheesy kid's show? LOL!It's all far more bleak and serious than the original, but that doesn't make it profound. Some kind of fun remake on the old show might have been entertaining. This serious take on it is often just dull. What does it mean to be alive? It means that life is too short for heavy handed nonsense like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great show, very bad hd-dvd","review":"this series is super. However this HD-DVD is a joke. Two discs wouldn't play (already sent it back). The picture quality of the mini-series is very bad and takes me back to the early VHS-days. This needs to be remasterd! The picture quality for season 1 is better but not near reference quality for HD (but better than the dvd, I must admit)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not Perfect","review":"It's great that the studio has decided to release the Battlestar Galactica Saga from the correct point...the beginning that is. Including both the mini series and the 1st Series, you don't have to be a Sci-Fi fan to enjoy the intense action and heartfelt storytelling which makes this a great product for anyone.The only downside to this product is the packaging in which it comes in. Interesting to look at...at first, but struggling to understand who's idea it was to release a very expensive TV production on cheap cardboard fold-outs, with glued on polymer stalks to hold the discs in place...and when I say hold them in place, expect a struggle to get them off!Don't let the packaging put you off, This is a great show...And even greater in HD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter trash","review":"The people giving this box set 5 stars either reviewed it before it came out (check the review dates), are extremely naive, or are studio plants. This box set is worthless. If these reviews were supposed to be based solely on the merit of the show, then I would give this box set a solid 5 stars, but the point is to review the whole product and that's what I'm doing. The negatives far outweigh the positives and if you're smart, you'll avoid this set like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe The Best","review":"This might be the best televised series I've ever seen. The characters are great, the story is phenomenal, the special effects are almost perfect, the deep space camera views are awesome. The only downside is that it eventually ends. At least it went out with a bang instead of drifting off into dreadful soap opera land. This show is great for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only better than the origional, THE BEST SCI. FI. out there!","review":"This show is what I always imagined the show to be. Even as a kid watching the old one, I thought \\"How freakin cheesy\\" did I keep watching...well yes.But the new version (MADE FOR ADULTS) is very good, it engages you, makes you un-comfortable, rejoice, sad and just about every emotion God gave to us. The writers have done a wonderful job. And the cast brings it all to life.As I have told many non-sci fi people, after a while you dont even remember you are watching SCI FI, because you are so into what is happening to the people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HD?","review":"The package is junk, the disk have scratches, some episodes wont play and parts look worse than VHS. Save your money until they can fix this great show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT INCLUDE MINISERIES","review":"This low rating is not for the series itself, which is well done. I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewers as to the quality, writing, acting, etc of the show itself. However, this particular DVD set Does Not Include The Miniseries Even Though The Item Description Specifically States Otherwise. The first episode on disc one of this set starts after the miniseries. Do not buy this thinking you will get the entire BSG experience. Make sure you see the miniseries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and intense entertainment","review":"This has to be the most intense science fiction ever viewed, the music, the acting, the plots, the characters, and the communications style, all intense, all subtle and irreverent, yet deeply and emotionally reaching. However, it would be strongly recommended that this not be presented to children; the drama, the character interplay and the intimacies therein are highly charged, sometimes graphic, sometimes base, and sometimes beautific in nature, but all very mature, if not borderng on the sensually debauched. Although I believe this has to be one of the best choreographed science fiction series of all time, particularly the writing and character interaction, all said, this is one of the most intelligent representations for its Genre. However, buyer beware, this is definately not at all for children, or even for some adults, as it contains extremely sensual or sexually explicit scenes, and the label does not mention this, it just states \\"unrated\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"At first, I was resistant to watching this show -- I was a fan of the original BSG as a kid, and had fond memories of drawing large pictures of vipers and raiders in huge space battles. But I watched a few episodes and quickly warmed to it. Edward James Elmos as Adama? It works. And Tricia Helfer helped me adapt as well... Turning the Cylons into the creations of the humans, albeit religious extremist beings who believe they have an edict from the \\"one true God\\", brings to mind great fiction like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Bladerunner/Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, and past and current political and religious conflicts like the \\"war on terror\\". It is obvious the plot has been though out from the beginning, and it is paying off in spades now in the fourth season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Ultima","review":"The writers, actors, director, and entire crew put their creativity into overdrive for this show. Watching seasons 1 and 2 was like reading a Hugo-award winning novel. Not only are we treated to military tactics and espionage, various human issues and political/religious themes are explored. I think what makes this series a classic is its ability to make the audience relate to each of the characters, human and cylon. Every episode was top notch. The last series which made me watch back-to-back episodes in a short time span was Firefly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic series","review":"I love this new rendition of a great old sci-fi series. It is much more dark and dramatic and the effects are terrific. Great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Box set includes miniseries","review":"Awesome show! This box set includes the miniseries that started the remake, so don't buy it separately, like I did :("},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy","review":"The Season 1 box set INCLUDES the Mini-series. Do not select Amazon's 'Great Buy' option to get them both or you'll end up with two copies of the mini-series.There was a UK release of Season 1 without the Miniseries (also sold in North America by Best Buy only) which is why a separate mini-series only disk exists. You do not need to buy it though with the North American Season 1 Box set.Save youself and dont buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating","review":"I 'll keep it short. Simply put, I bought HD-DVD just for this. Words really can't describe how good this show is. Why? Everything. It's perfection in every way. Gripping story with superb acting complimented by a fantastic and emotional soundtrack from Bear McCreary. Please understand that I do not exaggerate when I say this is the greatest thing ever on TV. I'm not afraid to admit that this show has made me cry at times. Bravo to everyone involved with making this show. You have made something truly special that I will never forget. THANK YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smorgasbord of stolen ideas that is interesting","review":"The character development is weak in this series. I watched it based on a recommendation from a few people and it was a real letdown after all the hype.It is an interesting blend of Blade Runner, the Japanimation Bubblegum Crisis (boomers), and nice random silly lifts off of comic books like Lobo (frakkin!). BUT it doesn't come close to being as amazing as those stories because the characters are weak and development is weak. One of the only reasons I like certain characters are their costumes not the content of their character."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this rehashed program its nothing like Battlestar Galactica","review":"This show is awful and that is being kind. I tried to watch but could not get past more than a few episodes and that was forcing myself with the notion that this should get better, it cannot get worse, but sadly it does. They should have called this something else ie. Caprica, as it had only the names and a slight concept of the original Battlestar Galactica story line. If I had no idea of the original and knew nothing of that series, I could give this more than a single star maybe two for a couple of episodes but for the most part a single star would cover the whole show. I am just so surprised this show was kept on the air for more than a single season. The original story from the late 70's worked great why destroy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci Fi like it used to be; for adults","review":"Folks, this is the adult's version of Battlestar, with some great story lines, decent special effects, and decent character interaction. I really enjoy the story, even though it has \\"forced\\" political correctness. Come one, making the \\"Top Gun\\" pilot a girl! Hollywood and the crazy left wingers that live there can't go one inch without throwing all of there crazy ideas in. BUT, the story is still good to go and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sci fi combined with real life terror","review":"The previous reviewer insists that 911 isn't connected to Battlestar and uses this forum to bash Americans. Remarks like that should be removed because they are offensive and wrong.Instead of attacking Americans one needs only to watch the series and listen to what Ron Moore has said. Ron Moore has stated that his vision of Battlestar deals with Septenber 11, the War on Terror, and al-Quaeda. That's a fact. It's obvious. Moore has stated that many times in interviews. There is no reason to attack America because you don't want to accept the obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Battlestar 90210","review":"I will start with I AM a BIG fan of the original 1970s series.There was almost no continuity with the original. Turning Starbuck and Boomer in to Women!!!! What the Hell. If you wanted to use Female lead roles fine...but at least give them different names.The stories are nothing but lame drama very little action and almost no space action. The stores more resemble a soap opera than a sci fi show. It was like watching \\"As Galactica Turns\\".And once they had one of the actors fall in love with a cylon I quit watching.The sets are lame, very low budget.The cyclons do not even look like some alien race no kind of armor, fine they did not have to make them look shiny...but making them look like humans ... Huh! Bad guys should look like bad guys not some mentaly twisted version of humans.I can't believe Glen Larson could do something like this. If they were going to change this so much from the original they should of called it something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring melodrama","review":"Everyone on this show acts like a sulking adolescent. The show is second only to Oprah in its love of contrived \\"issues\\". My effeminate nerd son loves it but then he would."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best drama on television","review":"Don't be put off by the naysayers. They're fans of the old series, bitter about all the changes and struggling to find reasons to bash this superb show. Too slow? Yes, things on the show build up gradually but by the time of the season finale, it all comes together. Besides, if most TV fans don't mind the ultra-slow plot on Lost, then Battlestar Galactica's pacing should also not be a problem, because it definitely moves more briskly.The critics love Battlestar Galactica. The staff of 'Television Without Pity,' the most critical TV discussion site on the internet, declared it the best drama on television (along with Deadwood), the best new show, and best finale. This is definitely a show you should check out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good production!","review":"The show is great. But I don\`t recommend the HD-DVD set at all. Video quality is bad, especially concerning the mini series. Also the packing is terrible, wrapped in plastic with cut corners. Doesn\`t fit in nicely in my shelf at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another scratched disk victim","review":"I purchased the season 1 boxset and it arrived in good condition with no obvious dammage. However, all 6 disks have concentric scratches. Just called Amazon customer support, they are going to send another copy, but I am afraid it will have the same problem, as the scratches look like a manufacturing problem, not a package or shipping problem. Amazon support says if replacement set has problem, they will refund money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galatica Season 1","review":"This is a great series and does a much better job of storytelling than the original back in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The character development is very good and the storylines keep you on your toes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your fingers crossed for a recall...","review":"It truly hurts to give this a one-star rating. The last thing I want to do is turn someone off to a show as great as Battlestar Galactica, but the sad reality is that this box set should be considered a war crime. I won't get into the details of how disappointing the transfer is, the flimsy packaging, the stupid rubber nubs (hint: twist don't pull), the scratched discs, the audio-sync problems, the video skipping, or the lackluster extras; other reviewers here and elsewhere have done an adequate job of that. My real goal here is to add another voice to the growing chorus of people heartbroken by this travesty in the (likely deluded) hope that Universal issues a recall and maybe does it right next time. In the mean time, I'm returning this and sticking with my original DVD box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"Wow what a show, not just for the sci-fi fan. Good acting and not silly, great situations you can believe in."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is grown up?","review":"BSG has \\"grown up\\". The FUN and JOY of the original series has been replaced by PRETENSE and MISERY. It's like revisiting a childhood friend and discovering they've become a depressed drunk who insists they are more sophisticated. Many people will join that club, but I'd rather be a happy kid at heart. FUN and JOY are good things."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that exciting or interesting","review":"I have been trying to get into Battlestar Galactica and not having much luck. By the middle of the first season I'd grown weary of hearing about GOD GOD GOD GOD while the series crawled along at the pace of a snail. Some have compared Battlestar Galactica to Firefly. I recently learned that Sci Fi Channel was showing Firefly and gave it a try. It's good! Firefly is far better than Battlestar IMHO. I plan to buy Firefly on DVD through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my show","review":"I'll likely get slammed for not liking this but I agree with those who dislike the pace of galactica. I do not agree with those that say all naysayers are bitter fans of the original. Hardly. I tried to like it and I keep an eye on it. It's fine for some. Not what I like. I'd prefer something more upbeat that moves along.I'm not 'searching for a reason' to dislike this. I know exactly why it's not for me. I also don't watch 'lost' and don't just follow the critics. I keep an eye on glactica but it doesn't hold my attention. It doesn't make me want to tune in each week.I recently caught some of sg-1 for the first time. I like it a lot. It's more my type of quality program IMHO. I'd purchase those DVDs sometime.But Helo is hot!:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just revewing the commentary","review":"The show is fantastic, no need to re-review it. The only bother that I have with the entire season is the lack of bonus features. The podcast from Ron Moore is good and all, it is just that there is no other commentary. It his Ron sitting at home with his wife doing a pd cast. You hear her eating cereal next to him, the cats meowing, random background noises like phones ringing. Which is fine and all, but that is all that is offered. I just wish there were actor commentaries as well. Gag reels, behind the scenes stuff etc etc.I don't want to wait 10 years for an anniversary edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Bought this on HD-DVD without having seen any BSG before. It was a great purchase and I look forward to seeing the other seasons in Hi-def."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, with a few flaws.","review":"The new version of BG, airing on Sci-Fi, is an amazing show. It's plot is deep and addictive, and if you're even remotely interested in Sci-Fi, pick this one up. However, if you're a fan of the original, be wary of a few major changes. The Cylons now have a human look and feel to them, and Starbuck is now a woman. All in all, this is a good watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I'm a fan, too","review":"I bought this DVD set for my husband for Christmas and we've been watching it together. He follows the show religiously, and this way I was able to see what he's always raving about. It is a great show with a dark but interesting story line, but the real beauty is the high quality writing and amazing acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best tv show ever made.","review":"This is the best, most relevent, intelligent tv show ever made. Even if you don't like sci-fi, the characterization is deep, the issues and relationships are complex, and it is totally entertaining. Unlike The Wire, the fantasy part takes you into a slightly removed world and story that best communicates to our dreams and senses. Wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks","review":"I would like to ask Ron Moore,what was he thinking?The three hour episodes that aired on NBC,now I see why the ratings are low.I have the DVD to the original Galactica feature film and I get more sense out of it than what is in the new version.Sex,the space battles are not good like in the original,changing the Cylons including not hearing them talk,trash talikng and disrepecting in the Colonial warriors ranks,what's next?As I had mentioned in previous reviews,I am working on my own space war epic and I would like to give Mr Moore a big piece of advice,listen to the fans of the original version of Galactica."},{"rating":"1","title":"A break from what was cool about BSG","review":"I love sci-fi and really enjoyed BSG when I was a kid. I was really dissapointed with this series though. Especially when the only decent TV sci-fi series right now is Stargate. I found the CG Cylons looked terrible and their ships looked even worse; I couldn't believe the moving red eye was in their ships, it looked terible! The main bad character is a female human Cylon (trying to save money by using humans). I am not into phony tough female characters. In my opinion that formula never works for the overall finish except supplying some eye candy. The female Starbuck Character is another version of this. The Captain of the Galactica seems to fill his role well but that's where it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Excellent example of what's wrong with Television","review":"If the ratings scale went lower than one, I'd give Battlestar Galactica lower than one! Though I haven't seen the original series, I'm sure that even with it's 70's quality writing, and effects it would be much better than this sorry excuse for a sci fi show. The stories are slow and towards the end of the season have a creepy religious undertone. The shaky camera work, which is supposedly \\"edgy,\\" instead tends to make watching it even more nauseating. While the effects are above par, effects, as so often is the case nowadays, do not make a show. If you ever get the desire to watch this show, I suggest first that you slam your head in a door, instead. It would be a far more rewarding experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contrived mix of other people's SF cliches and snail's pace plotting","review":"One would think that the advances in technology and hindsight would improve any retelling of the classic Battlestar Galactica 1978-79, but Ronald D. Moore's characters are as cookie-cuuter as those on General Hospital leading the viewer to take more interest in the plot. Unfortunately, the plot moves likes molasses leaving one to spot what SF movie/TV show the writers have ripped off this week.It is no wonder that Spongebob Squarepants gets more viewers than this turgid melodrama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy had the goods","review":"See my comments to Erik and let me know what the deal is because everything he said would not be there is. I haven't opened it just in case I am missing the boat but the miniseries is there, the sketches are there, the commentary is there. It runs the same amount of time as listed here at Amazon: 756 minutes so what is missing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Sci-Fi at it's best, plot, special effects, good acting... This is a must for all the hard core techno space fans.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall of a diehard skeptic","review":"I was the type of geek who never missed a single episode of Battlestar back in the when. I bought the silver DVDs at full price the moment they hit the shelves and melted at just the opening score. \\"... there are those who believe...\\" *sigh*How can you top that?I won't say the new version has topped anything. It's not a remake but a totally new vision. And OMG they got it right. I remember so well the moment in the original when Baltar was delivered to Adama. It still gives me shivers. But James Callis... the man makes me want to take him home to my mother and go do vastly horrible deeds together all at the same time. What a performance. And he's only one of what may be the greatest ensemble since \\"Lost\\". or \\"Lord of the Rings\\".Finally, someone got television right. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I loved the original series as a kid (you had to be a kid to enjoy it). The current series is something I can enjoy as an adult just as much. This series puts an emphasis on plot and character development over special effects, which is why its successfull. Its not as sweeping as Babylon Five but its much more \\"real\\", it will be interesting to see how it plays out if it stays on the air for five seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Series","review":"This was originally a Sci-Fi series and was a great show.

From early on in basic training in the Army we learned to follow orders. That is to say without exception it was always also our duty when not to. That only exception being an \\"illegal order.\\" What happens next in result of Starbuck's \\"card game\\" at the beginning & the Colonel, I feel, fits the spirit here.

Proceed with caution if you are purchasing this set and check your discs before it's too late to return. Just ended up getting my money back. Will wait until Universal cleans up their act with these discs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Show Doesn't Dissapoint","review":"I waited for a while to get into this series, having been a big fan of the original series when I was a kid. I shouldn't have waited, this show is really good. The tone has changed with the times, but the miniseries pilot has several nice nods to the original series.Yes, Starbuck is a women this time, and while no one will ever replace Dirk Benedick; Katee Sackhoff makes the role her own and if you give her a chance, you'll really like her. All the actors do a fine job, Edward James Olmos and Mary McDowell always deliver, but a great standout in a smaller role is Aaron Douglas as Chief Tyrol.A Warning for parents, there is a pretty high level of sexuality and violence, which pretty much goes with the territory with Sci-Fi these days. Also this box set includes the mini-series pilot on the first disk, which is also sold separatly. I wound up accidentally buying them both.All in all it's a great show that I've enjoyed watching tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have scratches too","review":"I have scratches too on my disks (4 of them). So far no problem in playback, but I have not watched through them all yet...As for quality the Mini Series does look bad. It looks like a composite blow up of the SD original. The episodes look good, A great deal better that crappy Cable!!!!! and better than SD-DVD. The HD sound is great!!, and yes goes out of sync on Disk 2. There is a shot with SB is in her viper that is not even close, but then comes right back into Sync aboard the Galactica. So this is a production problem, i am surprised they did not QC this better!I hope I do not have any playback problems, and they should deliver in better packaging.I hope they fix this before Season 2 comes out and Where is RAZOR in HD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent show","review":"This show is one of the best on TV.

I ignored this series on the SCIFI channel (apparently). I'm not a follower of serialized television, totally skipped the XFILES and other weekly shows.So on a total whim I picked this up. I have just finished the last episode of season one. I ordered Season 2.0 once I was halfway through disc 2.This is not your parents \\"Galactica\\". The acting (across the board) is top notch, the characters have depth, the stories and plot lines are great, the effects are fabulous. This is top of the line drama (and science fiction).I can't wait till the new episodes begin in January.

I'm not a treky and can appreciate Star Wars, but wasn't really excited about watching some crazy sci-fi show.

The hardest part was listening to my daughter, in the back seat, enjoying the first episode on the drive home.Excellent quality, apart from flashbacks to the miniseries - they seem a bit washed out. The story lines and characterisations make this a treasured possession to be viewed again and again, perchance detecting a subtle nuance here and there.What the heck, save a month of one's life with 3 hours of driving - anytime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows on Television!!!","review":"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA has it all. Good Scripts, nice directing and above all superb acting. My whole family says that this show is a soap in space. Well, they're wrong. The story is that Baltar is seduced by a beautiful Cylon who tells him to give the Cylons something. So the Cylons end up killing most of the Humans and some of them escape trying to find earth. So, pretty much like the old series right? Wrong. The characters have way different personalities, and it's much darker and cerebral than the old series. All of the actors on this show really give their character depth so you fell sorry for them sometimes. Baltar and the \\"Old Man\\" really give the best performances in this epic series. You don't really meet Apollo until later, and Starbuck's a girl, but who cares? They didn't make this show to recreate the old one. Unfortunatly, this didn't get any emmy nominations for acting or for best show, but it still gets great reviews an rightfully so."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell","review":"You have a war going on with blue ray and you relise this ? i ordered it from this site and came like everyones all scrached up, i ordered another set and another , with 3 in my hands i picked and choose and got one that is mint, discs and box, I\\"m hurt.

I'm sad to say the set had the very \\"concentric scratches\\" another reviewer has cited, and the scratches also commenced with disk 3 with varying degree of severity across 4, 5, and 6. A major drag having waited so long for the HD release and given the seemingly well documented problem on web blogs and reviews (not just Amazon) a major drag that major retailers are continuing to offer the faulty goods in collusion with the manufacturer. Corporations showing their true colors. Anyhow, after previewing the 2 good disks it looks like even though the disk is putting out 1080P it was only ever shot in something like 480P."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give us all a break \\"sir lancelot\\" !","review":"What is the deal with all of this \\"Battlestar is like Iraq\\" CRAP?!

You really care for the characters.My wife talked me into watching the mini-series and I was hooked,I usually watch detective shows (I'm still keeping up with Columbo and Kojak).The conflict between the Cylons and humans appears to have meaning beyond the theme of science gone astray---there is an interesting religious undercurrent.Ultimately ,BSG delivers what movies should do---it entertains and sustains interest.

I haven't been into a TV show like this since I was a kid. If you like Sci Fi you have to like this. Not to mention they drink, smoke, fight and curse. It's just like my life except in space.

Not only were half of my discs scratched due to the ridiculously cheap packaging, but the audio on disc 2 (the second part of the mini-series) was massively out-of-sync and therefore unwatchable. This is perhaps my favorite show on tv, and to see a transfer that looked worse than my SDTV broadcast in some scenes along with the sync issues and scratching (and subsequent video skipping) is beyond inexcusable.

The \\"space combat\\" scenes are really good. I like the fact that the ships don't look computer-generated. They look like real, three-dimensional objects with weight and mass. It is like watching the Matrix and Star Wars at the same time. It is amazing. There are tons of sub-plots and things that come back around, so to speak. Tricia Helfer (Nr. 6) is worth the price of admission alone. I would pay to watch her read the phone book for an hour. But she also can act. There is \\"just enough\\" humor in the series to keep it from being too somber, too.

Forget what you've heard about Trekies being fanatics because rabid BSG fans are an even bigger bunch of mindless followers who will buy anything!

It's a very intriguing, thrilling tale of human survival. It has terrific continuity and the characters and plot develop in very interesting ways. Time Magazine named it one of the six best dramas on TV and Newsday named it \\"the best show on TV.\\"I recommend this show even if you're, like me, not a fan of sci-fi. Battlestar Galactica is very different from other sci-fi shows. There is minimal techno-babble and no lessons in alien culture (in fact there are NO aliens on this show). It is first and foremost a human drama and the writing is very intelligent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth your time and money","review":"Put simply, Battlestar Galactica is some of the best television being produced today. Monk, The 4400, and now Battlestar Galactica; the USA Network is producing quality shows that outstrip much of what the major networks are offering with the exception of shows like Lost and 24.Forget the original Battlestar Galactica created by Glen Larson. This show is nothing like it.If you are uncertain about whether or not to spend your hard earned money on this release, then head over to BSG's home page on SciFi dot com's website, where you can watch the season 1 finale episode in its entirety (assuming you don't mind being spoiled on the first season.)Better yet, see if your local library has the mini-series on DVD and see how the new series began.If you are a Sci-Fi fan and TV on DVD collector, then I rate this release as a \\"must have\\" for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worse transfer ever!","review":"Let me say up front that the show itself is fantastic.The transfer to HD is the worst I have ever encountered.VHS would look better then this as it is so grainy I don't know how they get away with calling it HD, IT ISN'T!I only paid [...] for is and I am sure it is because the seller had a warehouse full of them and [...] bucks is better then nothing.The packaging is also the worse I ever seen.The only consolation is that it still cost less then the SD but I am sure the SD looks far superior to this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"really enjoy the quality built into this series....Y","review":"You will repeatedly play the openeing theme song and crank up the true-blue sound.....great holiday show to play for visiting relatives or friends,get them hooked!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica Season One is Very, Very Good","review":"You don't have to be a fan of the original 70's Battlestar Galactica to enjoy this reimagining. I've never seen the original show, and don't really care to, but I love the new show. It's smart, well-written, well-acted, and very, very dark. The show starts with the destruction of civilization, and follows a small band of survivors on the run, so the dark tone comes naturally from the premise.Most of the characters on Battlestar Galactica are good people trying to do the right thing, but it's never clear just what the right thing to do is. Almost every episode includes a difficult ethical dilemma. The show is ambiguous and morally murky, with no easy answers. Which is not to say that it's boring. There are also plenty of exciting spaceship battles.On the whole, this is the best TV science fiction since Firefly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take It For What It Is.","review":"The new BSG series is a dark and serious show with little of the swashbuckling laughs of the old 1970's version. Never-the-less, it's well-made and has an intriguing take on the same events as the old show. My one problem is that, like any remake, the directors and producers seem bent on remaking everything. There are some things I'd have rather seen unchanged, but these directors have to be original (odd when they are \\"remaking\\" a show). Also, read into it what you will, but it's simply a TV show; parallels between it and today's world (9/11, etc) I believe are just a cinematic technique for drawing in the viewer. Nothing more significant than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Show Makes Me Feel Icky","review":"I can't explain why that is. I only want to make it known that I cannot get into this show or seemingly any of the others on. I know a lot of people are into it. I tried. It didn't happen. I'm not sure if I felt manipulated or that the show lacked a sophisticated realism. Maybe not. Something is just not right. There seemed to be a lack of emotional depth. A superficiality. A lack of...of...I'm at a loss. An ambitious, hollow, vapid endeavor, like Lost or Heroes or Stargate Atlantis or Firefly. Since X-Files and ST:TNG ended, I'm not sure there's been any sci-fi series that has touched me. I need something that will challenge me, perhaps, and none of this stuff is doing that. They all just seem, I don't know, dumbed down, or something. No offense. Maybe it's an overly fashionable, trendy, commercialized quality they all have. Icky vibes."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"When I first learned of the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA mini-series I was very excited. What I don't like is how padded it is. The pace of the first part of the mini-series is tedious but the second part is better. I wish it were just two hours long. I began watching the weekly series and found it promising, but also slow and padded. Along the way I stopped watching the series on a regular basis. I'm all for character development, I love drama, and I understand that this isn't an action series. I only wish it weren't so lethargic. I can't see owning these DVDs for that reason. Tune in and catch the series on Sci Fi if you haven't seen it. Make up your own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreary","review":"I started watching this and lost interest as season one went on.

You can't blame people for being put off by the major changes. Sadly one shouldn't expect anything close the the tone of the original. It's too bad the new Doctor Who isn't available in the U.S. instead. It's new yet faithful. That's the way you do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my brand of sci fi","review":"\\"Reality\\" TV is a fave with many people these days so I wasn't surprised by this \\"realistic\\" reworking of Battlestar Galactica. I was never a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica, but it was fun escapism. I'm more of a fan of original Trek, TNG, Star Gate, Farscape, and Firelfy. New Galactica is more of a sci fi series for those who don't like sci fi. It's more of a \\"realistic\\" drama. There will be no exploration of various different alien worlds and cultures. I don't find myself captivated by it. It's too much like the West Wing for me.

It is very bulky and large. The photo is decieving because the bottom and sides are very thick and hollow which makes this more bulky than it appears. The idea is great and although it can store around 20 flat frozen bags upright, it won't help you once it's full and I doubt many freezers can hold more than 1 of these organizers inside. I suggest that you lay your single milk bags down flat to freeze and then simply move it to gallon sized zip lock bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Organizer!","review":"This was a great organizer that helps to keep the breast milk uniform. It also makes using the bags easier. It's easy to know which bag should be used next and keeps your freezer nice & tidy without taking up much room.

And when he came home, trying to figure out which bag should be used first was a pain! One day, I found this organizer and thought \\"anything is better than stacking the milk in the fridge.\\" I bought 2 and found that it was such an efficient way for keeping track of my pumped milk. I would just put any new milk in the back of the organizer and the springed wedge in the back would compress the milk flat. And the next time I needed to make a bottle, I would take the one in front (the \\"oldest\\" milk) and either place it in the refridgerator for overnight thawing or put it in a warm glass of water to defrost it quicker. I couldn't be more happier with this product. It takes up about as much room as 4 stacked ice trays would. I never had any problems with my Medela or Lansinoh bags (I buy whatever is on sale). I have no regrets about buying this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this product!!","review":"I really love this item. It only takes up a small part of my freezer and it holds a lot.

The container is nice, but I receive the samples of the first year bags, and I do not like them, the lansinoh bags are so much nicer. I would be concerned that the first year bags would break easier.

It claims to \\"Maximizes space by freezing milk flat.\\". In my experience, putting the milk behind the spring loaded plate makes all the milk push to the top therefore freezing the bag in a very awkward way that takes more space. I prefer to lay the bag flat in the freezer then place it in the storage once it's frozen flat. It also claims \\"Works with most brands of milk storage bags.\\". When frozen flat the Lansinoh bags are too wide for the white base storage; however they do fit in the clear cover when turned upside down and used as additional storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears Lansinoh Bags","review":"This container is not quite wide enough to store Lansinoh bags. If you use it with Lansinoh bags (the best bags in my opinion) then you may tear the seams of your bags and lose the milk to freezer burn and/or leaking upon thawing. Other than that, this is a great product, just be sure that your bags will fit. I love the idea of this, but just be sure it's compatible with the bags you use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and does not fit Ameda or Lansinoh bags well","review":"I really liked this concept but find it to not be all that practical. I've actually sent the item back. The container is rather bulky and is tall with the lid on. I tried using this with both Ameda and Lansinoh bags. The Ameda bags do not fit well because of the pour spout on the side. I froze my Lansinoh bags flat outside of this container as it gets them flatter. Otherwise the container would only flatten the milk into the bottom portion of the bag. By freezing the Lansinoh bag separately, it is very thin but is marginally too wide to fit in the storage container. I ended up just batching frozen milk in gallon size Ziploc bags for extra protection at the recommendation of a friend. That seems to work better for me than the limited storage capacity of the container."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I am so glad that I purchased this. I didn't right away and found it was a much more efficient way to freeze and store milk. If you are trying to bank lots of milk, it doesn't hold much. When I fill it up, I remove the bags and them into plastic freezer bags and move them to a freezer that we are only using for milk. Works with any bags and is a much more compact and functional way of freezing milk rather than trying to place flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Saver!","review":"This is a great product, and the Lanisoh bags fit fine in here. I assume the Medela ones would fit too. I've got about 30 bags in mine right now, and it's just over half full.

So maby if you just like the blues, you'll like it,but if you like the motown sound, this is deffinitly not it.The only motown related song on hear is Marvin Gaye's\\"It hurt me too\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sweater, does run a bit small though","review":"I have to agree with a previous reviewer - this sweater is very nice, but does run a bit small. I wear a XS in most misses/womens clothing and so I was a little concerned that the size S would be a little big, but it fit well. It seems to run almost in Juniors sizes.It works well with a tank or shell underneath, also tees work nicely. The sweater is cut to be somewhat form fitting, so don't expect to wear this over anything thick unless you order up 1-2 sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could be better!!","review":"I liked how light the shoe was.

Enough said about the movie.On the other hand, the Extras make it all worth it if you are a big Julie Strain fan. All of the cut out nudity is included as well as a shower and bath segment that had nothing to do with the movie.

This is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeper","review":"The Wood is an amusing tale centered around last minute wedding jitters. However, what is also strongly emphasized is the bonds of friendship. Omar Epps and Taye Diggs headline this amusing tale. Oh what adventures these guys had while growing up in Inglewood. One can truly see the struggles that Mike had as a new kid fitting in.Its a little odd that the flashbacks were so much from the point of view of Mike rather than Rolland. The excessive cussing can drain on the nerves as well. However, the amusing adventures of the trio of Rolland, Mike, and Slim outweigh any drawbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for those with close childhood friends","review":"The Wood is a great movie for those who have childhood friends that you have been through a lot with.

We need these types of resources because singing and playing musical rhymes and stories with young children is becoming a lost art amid all the electronic toys that are handed to babies nowadays.

The voice is so flat, it's almost funny (almost, because I paid money for this).

He writes music and makes notations at lessons, etc. and doesn't want loose pencils rolling around next to his instrument. I saw this case and thought it looked nice. It does look nice in the hand but my husband could not get it open. He had to struggle with it for about 1/2 an hour and he didn't want to force anything. When he finally got it open, he waxed the edges of the sliding lid to make sure he can open it in the future. We thought we were home free until he went to put some pencils in it. It is too short to hold a standardized wood graphite pencil that has only been sharpened once. I know we should have checked the measurements but when you see an item labelled \\"pencil box\\" , you sort of expect that a pencil will fit in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couldn't Be Happier !","review":"I bought this box in April and it has become my faithful companion ever since. As a result I am doing 1000% more life drawings than I ever had before. All I need ever bring is the medium. It is very sturdy and yet quite attractive in its simplicity. I can take it out in public places w/o attracting undue attention. I like the idea of the rounded end. I can drop it into a jacket, vest or pants pocket w/o sharp corners doing any harm or poking me. It slides readily into a side pouch on a back pack or camera bag and can take a real beating wherever you toss it. I would not do any of that with a pouch ! \\"Too small\\" ? That one perplexes me. I carry a 1/2\\" x 1 1/2\\" WhiteStroke eraser, a 2\\" KUM eraser stick, an Faber-Castell fine point erasr pencil, a metal pencil sharpener, a full sized wooded HB & a 4B, a full sized woodless 6B & an 8B and oh yeah, a #4 stumpy.

I need not only an assortment of pencils in my box, I also like to bring along an eraser, a sharpener, a couple of stumps, etc. The box is a little too short and a little too shallow to be really practical, even for a brief sketching trip.

The visuals are VERY OUTDATED, and the background has a terrible white border. Caillou is boring and dosen't really have the right topics for it's target audience. 2 year olds won't understand what a Zamboni does! At one point Caillou spent an entire episode learning his street address, what fun. Now here is what made my head almost explode: my sister was watching one of the older episodes with the puppets (had to fast forward through that), and caillou's voice started to get an awful quality. His voice was really high pitched, missed syllables, and almost sounded British! They might have fixed that in this DVD, but I wouldn't take any chances.Overall, I would even recommend Little Bill over this, at least that show had a jazzy feel to it. DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves it!","review":"I believe there are 4 Caillou episodes on this DVD. I thought it was a box set but there is only one.

As someone who has suffered from depression for the past 4 years, the initial chapter allowed me to feel understood, and I was anxious to read the rest of the book. What I did find helpful was the advice to attend church in a liturgical way, that is, to read prayers rather than trying to pray your own. In the chapters that follow, though, Welch starts calling depressed patients out on their sin: their anger, their disappointments. I had to discontinue reading around 2/3 of the way through because I honestly felt beat up by those chapters and like I was being blamed for my depression. It seems \\"the church\\" is always blaming victims for what they are suffering from and this book ended up being no different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Drawer!!! Very challenging and encouraging.","review":"Ed Welch has been gifted by God to write in a humble yet powerful manner that grips the minds and consciences of those who read his works. His books including \\"Depression\\" challenge our thinking and actions with the authority of Scripture and at the same time he points out the great hope and encouragement that we have from the same Scriptures. He writes in a simple yet profound manner that does not draw attention to himself but directs the readers' attention where it should be: on God.This is an excellent resource not only for those who struggle with \\"depression\\" but all people who go through difficulty and suffering in life.

When it arrived though, the face was unfixably squished, which I think was an error in sewing, and it turned out the mouth is held together with a plastic frame that's just way too big for Bert's small head. And because of this frame it also makes it incredibly hard for an adult hand to use the puppet, let alone fit inside, and I imagine it would feel too bulky for a small child to use. Who exactly were they expecting to use this thing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bert Hand Puppet","review":"- Quality of materials and construction seem extremely good.- Mouth is very hard to move so it is difficult to actually function as a hand puppet, especially for a small child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anna upside down","review":"I love the continued self evaluation that Anna reveals in this story which is set in a brooding and dangerous setting. True the \\"mystery\\" is obvious if you are not always looking for alternative explanations to every ocurrence that allows you to fool yourself about the motives of those closest to you both personally and professionally as Anna does. But thats what I love about these books. In this case, the apparent hypocrisy of some of those closest to Anna parallels the same feeling one gets about most of the Southern folk who reside along the Natchez Trace. Anna's personal obsessions blind her to the danger around her and how she avoids death in at least 4 exciting confrontations points to her eventual realization at how blind you can be when you are in Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to par","review":"Of all the Anna Pigion books I have read, this is the worst.

As always, the author's knowledge of natural settings and creatures adds greatly to the enjoyment. The mystery is a good one, exploring more aspects of Anna's character, especially her vulnerability because of her small size and the fact that she is the \\"boss\\" and uneasy in her new position. The descriptions of the different reactions of other characters (co-workers, other law enforcers, townspeople and suspects) are excellent, exploring Mississippians using their present and past to explain their different reactions to situations.Anna's romance with Sheriff Paul Davidson, with its ups and downs, adds interest and humanity to Anna's character.

I sat and read this book in one afternoon-- everything around me stopped as I became engulfed into the lives of these women. I too am a military wife and just spent a year of my life with my husband deployed to Iraq. As an infantry company commander, we shared an emotional year apart. I may have been on a different post, in the U.S., but still the experiences and feelings that these women openly shared were experiences that I could relate too and at times it was like I was reading excerpts from my own journal.

To those military moms who think that the wives cant feel what they feel just because we didnt give birth to the soldiers, you are wrong. We are the ones who have to hear their complaints, frustrations, and have to come up with wise words when they are down. Your love for your child is different and so is their love for you.

Finding so many such books bogged down with their authors' collective angst about dire circumstances that \\"drove\\" them into the profession, it's a fresh breath of air to find a chronicler who is less concerned with the downers of the life-style than in merely enjoying it and taking advantage of whatever the opportunities offered.

Thus while striving to be new (modern), Dell is stuck in the old. This novel, a sequel to \\"Moon Calf,\\" is about restlessness: a marriage flounders and characters complain about life being too easy and meaningless. The world to them is a \\"pasteboard world.\\" This is a modern sentiment, but Dell can't make the transition into modernism to express it: his style and approach are still old-fashioned, closer to Edith Wharton, say, than to Hemingway.

The concept of how large objects can look small from far away, such as the big moon looking as small as a bowl of milk to kitten, is present in this work. The concept of reflection, as the moon is reflected into a pond is also present. Not only are these concepts highlighted, but a situation that readers can relate to is offered. Kitten is determined to reach the bowl of milk. Readers may also have things in their lives that they are determined to reach and can relate their own experience to the experience of the kitten.

Normally one would wonder how black and white illustrations would go over with small children but these are silvery and luminous and a joy to look at no matter what your age. The story is darling as well, and perfect for the 5 and under set. The spirit of a frisky and determined kitten is captured and the animal in this story at least behaves like a real kitten would. I don't know whether any kittens have mistaken the full moon for a bowl of milk but they certainly get themselves into trouble following their whims. All ends well in this delectable story so the little ones will breathe a sigh of relief.

My local store stopped carrying size small vinyl gloves and therefore, I made this purchase. I wish the quality of the gloves were as good as the shipping service and packaging. First the gloves fit smaller than the other brand that I usually used. The simi-clear material is not stretchy. The first pair I put on, I tore one of it apart when pulling it onto my right hand. As I wore them to rinse and prepare food, water started to dampen the gloves at the tips of each finger. That's not very protective, is it? I will try to return the unopened box and will not order this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical vinyl gloves","review":"These were great and did not break easily, the only trouble is, if you use them while you're sweating you may have to go up a size, as I worked in 80 degree heat and could barely get them on due to my sweaty hands.

Once done, he planned to return to his group of friends who still grieved over Quincey's death. But he was not sure they would accept him in his new state.

But then the type of vampire Quincey Morris becomes in this novel by P. N. Elrod is not the same sort of vampire as Dracula or any other \\"traditional\\" vampire. This is more the \\"good guy\\" vampire which appears in Elrod's other vampire novels. So the rest of the crew of vampire hunters have to contend not only with the fact their friend from Texas is now one of the walking undead, but, to recall a line from \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers,\\" he is not \\"that kind\\" of a vampire.

The original(Escape from New York) had the gritty feel of a world gone mad, of a country ravaged by crime and war, desperate enough to send all it's criminal element to one place.

The very mention of Halloween, The Thing, Escape from New York or even The Fog and Memoirs of an Invisible Man would send chills up my spine. Even when he would stumble a bit (Prince of Darkness, In the Mouth of Madness, They Live), it was still a little entertaining...until his latest losing streak involving Village of the Damned, Vampires, and this awful mess. Don't cut corners out of respect for him, this movie was an insult to the original. I wish Hollywood would declare a moratorium on lousy computer generated effects.

First of all, what is it with these people giving such great reviews?... this movie [was bad]. Next, the story line was nearly the same, so it was like watching the first all over again, though that would be a treat, but unfortunately, in this case, twice is not a good thing. Thirdly, to that time, special effects highly advanced, but this was still third rate SFX. Even kid films had better SFX. Next, that whole surfing on Sunset Boulevard was a bad and tasteless idea to get to younger audiences.

Same scenario: Snake captured, injected w/ life-threatening drug, forced to perform for the president, infiltrating former US metropolis that now houses the country's undesirables, escapes just in time, mission accomplished, gets last word, the end. The only thing that was different from its predecessor was the addition of cheesy special effects and campy scenes (Snake on a surfboard, anyone ? Gimme a break!)

They also state that all world series games were played between 1947 and 1956 in New York City. They fail to remember that the famous Philadelphia Phillies Whiz Kids were in the '50 series.

It has words from Jesus which are so much needed; not just encouragement, but gentle rebukes throughout, which stir me to look for more opportunities to win the lost, plus the excitement of living in the last days.

I contacted Amazon, and they sent a replacement. It too had a whole in the bag, which made the vacuum seal ineffective. I no longer wanted to try and find out whether the problem was with Amazon in the shipping, or the company who produced it. The coffee looked and felt like it has been sitting in a warehouse for a long time (few months) the beans had no nice oily texture, as you typically would expect from a fresh roast of Espresso beans, rather it had a dull look and did not feel very oily.I would strongly encourage people to find a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bulk Coffee","review":"I have to say I was apprehensive about purchasing a 5 lb bag of coffee for my DELONGHI MAGNIFICA.

I took it to Best Buy and the hooked it up to one of their TVs with no problem. I took it home and hooked it up before putting it back in the entertainment center and it worked. Inside the entertainment center it crapped out again. It maybe a heat issue. That would explain the DVD going out half way through a movie, just as it was heating up. I dunno. Now I'm stuck with $160 paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already broken!","review":"I've had this unit for just a couple of months, and now it seriously skips on almost every DVD I play.

I'm just throwing it away and will look for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"problematic DVD playback","review":"I ended up taking back three of these machines (which I regret, because I really wanted to save space with a two-in-one unit). Each one had the same problem, intermittent stuttering and pixilization. It didn't happen a great deal, but not one single DVD would play all the way through without errors. CD's played fine, the VHS unit was very nice -- but the DVD playback was an irritation. A service tech tried to play the \\"it's not a bug it's a feature\\" game, saying it had something to do with new Macrovision encoding to protect against piracy. Whether he was blowing smoke, or on to something, I do not know. All I know is that all three went back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major problems with this product","review":"I have a love-hate relationship with this product. I love the features and the style, but the quality of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired. The image stalls, freezes or flutters when playing a DVD. Very annoying and unwatchable. So figuring it was a defective unit I returned it and got another. Same problem. I tried connecting it through S-Video cable instead of RCA Cables. Same problem. Returned the unit, and after a lot of soul searching bought the same unit for the third time...After all, they couldn't all be bad. WRONG. Another bad unit. It's going back today, and I'll be buying another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper","review":"I returned the DVD-V2000 after a few days for the following reasons:1. Noisy disk drive.2. On DVD playback, part or all of the picture would occasionally break up; I have never seen this happen on my older standalone Samsung DVD player.3. Response to the remote control is delayed by at least a second, making the remote awkward to use. Also the rew/FF buttons do double duty as skip-to-scene buttons, and it requires precise timing (very difficult with the delayed response) to get the mode and speed you want. I found it almost impossible to rewind just a few seconds to catch something I missed; I generally ended up either holding the button down too long and going into quadruple speed, or releasing too soon and skipping back to the beginning of the scene.On the positive side, the remote is universal and worked fine with my Sony TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible product","review":"Do not buy this unless you enjoy grainy pictures from your video tapes and horrible sound quality from both videos and DVD's. I bought this product a couple months ago and have spent the entire time trying to make different adjustments, settings, connections to make the thing work properly. I have sat through too many movies trying to get the sound to come through without having to constantly adjust the volume up and down to hear parts of movies. In fact I have missed entire portions of movies because the sound was so horrible and tinny. I have given up my battle with this beast and bought an inexpensive Panasonic VCR player and an inexpensive JVC DVD player and am now able to watch both videos and DVD's with theater quality sound and picture. Unless you are hard of hearing and only watch subtitled/closed caption movies don't buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems","review":"In response to several other reviews.

(I've tried to rewind to right past the freeze/skip spot, but it's very difficult; if I go right before that spot and hit the Play button, it freezes again and skips to the next scene!) At first, I thought the problem was the DVDs. (I returned them for a rental fee refund.) Then I found out those same DVDs play fine in my other DVD player (a Pioneer model). (And I've cleaned the DVDs to ensure there's not a spot on them.) This is the third Samsung product I've bought that's been defective (the other two were cameras). Never again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, the VCR is noisy but . . .","review":"After reading all the complaints of this being a noisy unit, I did get gun shy but ultimately decided that I trusted Consumer Reports more than the customer editorials. Both are right. I found the unit easy to use and the remote self-explanatory. It's basically a plug and play unit. I've had the unit for about a month now and have watched 20 some DVD's with no noise problems. I watched my first VCR tape tonight and though I didn't notice any noise at the beginning, there was a noticeable whine after an hour of play; distracting when you're getting to the end of a serious drama. Rewind is fast and does overshoot. I'd recommend the unit mainly because of its ease of use and space saving feature but don't be surprised if you hear an audible whine when there is a quiet scene in the movie (VCR)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD NO GOOD","review":"Bought the machine because I wanted a combo.

My husband eventually wanted to get a surround sound system with all the best speakers and in a few years get a high def. tv. Turns out this model is not compatable to work well with either.

The very next day (and I'd only had it for about 12 hours), it started freezing and skipping dialogue, then it would skip to the next scene. Very annoying.Also, it was very loud. You could hear whizing and whiring from across the room, which was distracting from the movie.And I don't know whether this happens on all mp3 playing DVD models, but only a few seconds of each song would play and it would stop for two seconds and continue.

There is always a problem when playing dvd's. It constantly messes up. The vcr player is a little loud but not too bad. I bought an extended warranty which was a waste of money because they wouldn't exchange my unit for a new one and the repairs never helped. From my own personal experience I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone. If the company would like to do their job and exchange it for a new one and it works I would be happy to write a better review. In the meantime I'm in the process of looking for a new unit to buy, scared stiff at this point of another lemon bought from a company that doesn't stand behind their product.

The first unit I had performed well for a few days. Then, when a DVD disc was about halfway through, the picture would freeze for about 3-5 seconds and then continue. It would do this every 30 seconds or so! Very annoying. It was not the disc because the freezing would occur on any disc I tried. We exchanged the unit for another. After about a week, we had the same problem. I talked to Samsung and they admited that they have been getting a lot of calls about this problem and all but conceded that there may be a problem with the model. We exchanged the unit for the Panasonic 4762 which in my opinion is a better product anyway.

VCR, and working my way into DVD with one convenient unit. First disappointment: there is no LP setting on the VCR--something I consider basic, even with my ancient Hitachi unit (which works great, though the sound quality when tapes are played back on other units is bad). Second disappointment: even on the SP setting, the recordings were just horrible--grainy, worse than my old VCR recordings even on the lowest setting quality. I think this is a poor union of products--others have commented on the bad DVD playback. Samsung has work to do. I'm returning this today. The only positive thing--shopping at Amazon is great.

And I liked Lori Petty as TG too; it just went NOWHERE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"I like the movie, the product came new and fast and Lori Petty and Naomi Watts give a great performance"},{"rating":"2","title":"spare me the critique","review":"If you're looking for the next amazing work of cinema... keep looking.. Tank GIrl is a FUN movie, that's it. I love the comics, and if you do too i'll warn you now... don't expect the movie to match the comics at all... but it is a fun movie, with lots of quotables and if you want a giggle, this will do it... people who pan it have a certain problem... no sense of humor :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Tankie Fan","review":"Ok well I know this one isn't for everyone and yes it is dumb but I really loved this movie. I own it on DVD and VHS.Young girls will love it, although it is rated R. I think it can be shown to 12 or 13 year olds. Great for their self-esteem.Tank Girl rocks! Hurray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A big Hit in England, But Not Over here. Loved it any way.","review":"When I was living in England in 1995, this movie was out.... Oddly enough, I didn't get to see this movie over there in England, but I got to see it here, when I back into the States. This movie was HUGE in England, and strangely enough, not over here... I don't know what exactly happened when this movie crossed the pond, but evidently when this movie got over here from England, it took a nose dive right into our eastern sea shore. I really LOVED this movie, and it's a GREAT flick, if you want to watch Petty's character stomp, (oddly enough \\"Stomp\\" is a title of one of the songs in this movie) the fire out of McDonell's character, and then go on to save the world's water supply all at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD features, decent story","review":"....As for the movie, it's fun, she's a cool frisky chic, she looks like Gwen Stefani with a tank. The comic was better, but the movie was funny, albeit very similiar to being a Girl Mad Max. Malcom McDowell, Ice-T, and Lori Petty are in it.Two stars for the movie, could be higher if the DVD had more on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I enjoy sci-fi. I enjoy action/adventure. I enjoy dystopias. This film was garbage. Although I am GenerationX, maybe I'm too old for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH!","review":"Painfully unfunny film based on the comic strip adventures of the same name. Lori Petty puts in unconvincing and frequently irritating performance and the rest of the cast don't do much better either. The film served as a big disappointment to what was expected. The dialogue sounds dated and performances are rather disjointed making you care very little about the whole thing in the first place. Is lacking in any real sort of exciting adventure that you would expect in a film like this. The whole thing, to be quite frank, is pure trash. Forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL","review":"This is one nasty mess of a movie. There is no actress as annoying or as untalented as Lori Petty. Malcolm McDowell, get a new agent. Fast!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy? Yes! Fun? Definitely!","review":"A lot of people really don't like this movie. In fact it has made some of the lists of the worst movies ever made.I totally disagree!!! This is definitely a funky, campy, hilarious, silly, and predictable movie that is just plain fun! When I saw it in the theater we just about fell out of our chairs because we were laughing so hard. I believe the only reason we weren't thrown out of the theater is because everyone else was laughing and enjoying the movie just as much as we were.I do keep putting this one in the DVD player and watching it over and over. Defintely one to put in when you want to enjoy a funny movie and don't want to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great party movie!","review":"Lori Petty is perfect here, and every single frame in this film is artwork, the visual details just so cool.

That was disappointing. But so was the story line. At best, the ending was far-fetched and a disappointment. The characters seemed less well-developed than those in past books. I've read all of her books and this is the first I would not recommend. Let's hope the next is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"As other reviewers have already stated, I was disappointed with the editing and factual errors in the book. Worse, though, was the story line, particularly the ending. I won't spoil it, but I will say that I thought it a trick ending and far-fetched (although you could see at least part of it coming).I've read all of her books and enjoyed them...until this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good bear info but contrived chore of a mystery novel","review":"A good book to read if you are headed to Glacier National park and want practical tips on hiking in bear country. Anna Pigeon is the main character. She is a smart, self assured woman who can be manipulated by the stigmas of political correctness yet clever enough to fend off her adversaries. As a mystery novel the summation is contrived and the pace of the work makes a chore of the reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Point in Barr's Series","review":"I've enjoyed most of the Barr series as light mystery fare with a interesting, spunky protagonist. The character of Anna Pigeon has always spoken to me in these books. However, I borrowed this audiobook to entertain me on long driving trips and was disappointed. The story is not a taut as her others. Usually the storyline contains a window into the Pigeon's personality and psyche, which long-time readers expect, but this book just plods along without any personal focus on Pigeon and proceeds to the end of a pretty rote, predictable mystery plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lured Me In","review":"Nevada Barr writes mysteries that draw you in but don't bog you down. The clues are simple to follow. The characters are lovable (or unlovable) and easy to invest in. \\"Blood Lure\\" gives us a mystery to solve, the great outdoors to enjoy, and just enough info on bears to keep it interesting. I would consider it a easy read but one that is sure to relax and stimulate your mind all at once. Anna Pigeon is a great character and I hope to put all of Barr's books under my reading belt before too much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"This book was chosen for our book club read for December. When I read the first few pages, I said \\"oh no this is not for me!\\". But I read a few more pages. Once I got past the making of the lures and into hiking in Glacier Park, I had trouble putting in down!! It has so many twists and turns, you can't wait till the end to find out who did it!! I will pick up other books by Nevada Barr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ending a Bit Fanciful but Still a Fun Story","review":"First, I have not read the book, but I have heard the story (so I can't comment on the presence or absence of mistakes). Second, I liked the story, but I'm a big fan of happy endings. Third, science fiction and fantasy are my normal fare, so an ending that is a lot fanciful and convenient doesn't really throw me. Fourth, Barbara Rosenblat did a lovely job narrating the story.This is my first Anna Pigeon story, and I will definitely return for more. I found the descriptions to be adequate, and I appreciated the little bits of humor stuffed in. The last few sentences were very nicely put. Definitely a worthwhile story to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful and educational look at Glacier National Park","review":"Anna Pigeon returns in BLOOD LURE, as she take time away from her regular park duties to assist with bear DNA studies at Glacier National Park. Right at the beginning, we, along with Anna, learn the best (or worst, depending on your point of view) recipes to lure bears. (I must admit this isn't the first time Barr has presented me with more information than I care to learn about a particular subject.) Also, the description of the bear attack on Anna's research group is chilling and enough to make me forget any ideas I'd ever had about going camping!Barr unravels her clues carefully and fairly; the reader has ample opportunity to put everything together (along with Anna) to solve the mystery. Yet the clues weren't blatantly obvious. Barr did a terrific job with her plotting on this book, and she deserves a pat on the back. BLOOD LURE is well worth reading. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bearly a quality book","review":"I have read many of Anna Pigeon books. This is my least favorite. The mystery is not developed and thought about which Nevada Barr usually does well. This was more of a book on bear/human relationship and a mystery (small) thrown in. I did not enjoy it like and it was more of a chore to read it. I highly suggest Superior Death or Endagered Species. These two are Nevada Barr's best books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous book","review":"My first Nevada Barr read and I was highly disappointed. Perhaps her earlier books are better, but I doubt I will ever find out. The only reason I read this one is because I worked in Glacier National Park for a summer and was very familiar with the area as well as bears. Now, as for Anna Pigeon, I found her reaction to bears lacked credibility. Here is a seasoned ranger who simply doesn't respond properly during a bear encounter. PUH-lease! Don't waste time on this one. I also agree with another reviewer--I LIVED there and the map made virtually no sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was lame...","review":"This book had all the nuance and insight of a poorly scripted comic book. Written from the perspective of an extremly anal, painfully politcally correct and smug female forest ranger. The male characters are all weak charactered and pathetic stereo types and lack any soul what so ever and the female characters are all treated as if they (particularly the main character Anna) are somehow superior to all the males around them as a rule. Macho female characters and weak, spineless male characters and terribly hard to swallow coincedences make this barely believable book a big fat flop. This book book seems like it was was written to appeal to women who hate men, and at the same time want to be one. This book deserves zero stars but there's no choice for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very suspensful with unrealistic ending","review":"I am a huge fan of Nevada Barr and couldn't wait for this book to come out in paperback. Out of all books in this series, I found this one to be definitely lacking in suspense and found the ending to be laughably ridiculous. Hopefully her next installment will be better. Honestly though, Anna Pigeon is getting really old and maybe she should think about hanging up the towel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding!","review":"This is a great book. Could barely put it down. Loved the information given about the bear research projects and the areasthe researchers traveled to. Lots of twists and turns. Couldn't wait to get the next book by Nevada Barr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nevada Barr is one of the best","review":"If a person can they should read all the Anna Pigeon series (in order). If not they are great stand alones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Based in Glacier","review":"We chose this book because we were taking a train trip to Glacier National Park. It was great fun to listen to it together on the trip west. Once we got there we then tried to locate the areas that Nevada Barr wrote about in her story. We plan to coordinate other books written by Nevada Barr with our trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative? Yes. Helpful? No!","review":"The Prima guides for all of the previous Tomb Raider games have been spot on and extremely helpful for those times you when your in a tight spot and don't know how to get out of it. The guide for AOD however is plain misleading. I chucked mine aside and decided to wing it on my own. Apparently the guide was written way before the game was finished, so some things just don't add up, somethings don't even appear in the game and some things are completely missing. I hate to say this but don't waste your money. If you're really stuck, you're much better off hitting the various tomb raider BB's on the web. Much more helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!!!","review":"The shipping side perfect no complaints the book excellent condition so no complaints with seller.

Lots of time it'll tell you to kill the guard and collect his gun. Only there is no gun there. This is either a problem with the game or with the book. There are so many bugs with the game it is hard to tell. Anyway, both the game and the book are terrible.

Had to return it for replacement because it broke when I touched the fast forward buttons. The Muvo is a very fragile product. The second Muvo had other problems which I am dealing with currently. The rechargeable Ni-Metal Hydyride batteries only last 5 minutes with Muvo after the batteries are fully recharged. I bought a new charger and four new AAA Ni-Metal Hydride batteries and the problems continue. Bottomline: I am very unhappy with Muvo. I tend to think that Creative Labs has not tested its product properly before it brought Muvo to the market. I also read at the CNET site that people had similar problems with Muvo, so my problems do not seem unusual for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dies in 1 Month","review":"This is a very good WMA and mp3 player.

I changed the batteries, reformatted and ensured it wasn't corrupted MP3's but no such luck. Half of the pages on Creative's support web site were non-existant and since there was virtually no documentation with the product I was stuck. And very unhappy.When it was working the sound quality was pretty lousy, too, despite the programmable EQ. I was a bit surprised as I had once thought that Creative was the leader in portable digital audio.I would highly recommend the iRiver 1FP-380T, which is what I replaced this piece with. For LESS money you get way better quality, durability, stability, upgradability and overall product satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheh it works","review":"Worked great until the on/off button just stopped working.I find out on the net that I am not the only one with same problem.Crative has ignored all my emails.I recommend this item only if you want an MP3 player that will last about ninety days before you need another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS CHEAPER AT CIRCUIT CITY","review":"The thing is cheaper at the circuit city website. That's all I have to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery life","review":"2.5 stars really. Not a bad player but there are better ones out there. The 128Mb gives a reasonable no. of songs but recording at low res makes for disappointing playback. Using alkaline batteries this unit has no where near the 12 hours it claims.

I went to the store, thinking it was a default one, and exchanged it for a new one (thank god I didn't have to pay), and the pattern repeated.I kept using it with stuck volume buttons, but another two weeks later the playback button started to stick and stopped playing at all, in other words, these things have a lifespan of about 2 weeks, it's cheaper in the end to get a more expensive one."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the firmware!","review":"I've had my muvo for 3 months and 21 days.

The ones that come with it sound really tinny and there's no bass boost or adjustments on the player.The 1st problem I had was loud, screechy static. I thought it was just a corrupt file so I formattd it and copied new music to it. It worked fine for an hour or so then started w/the static again. trying to skip the song that wasn't playing caused it to shut down and I was never able to power it up completely.The 2nd unit worked fine through 2 uses and then shut itself off and would not allow me to restart it.I'm not willing to give it a 3rd try, since I did not even get a full week of use out of the 1st 2 units!

I was trying to figure out how to deal with my recently-non-functioning MuVo, which I bought on the recommendation of Men's Health magazine (grrrrr). Just like Orlando Gutierrez, mine worked for about 93 days -- just long enough for my warranty to wear out -- and then the on/off button just stopped working. It's now worthless.Before I bought the MuVo, I read reviews that preserving playing order and the flimsy construction were issues. I should have paid more attention. The lack of a belt clip was a problem, too, when it comes to working out. Also, I only got about 2-3 hours on the AAA battery at most.I'm off to buy the iAudio CW200. I'm willing to pay a bit more for sturdier construction, longer battery life and more features. Wish me luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"Like many of the reviews, mine is broken too. I received the player as a gift from my fiance and loved to use it when I was running. Unfortunately for me, the device mysteriously stopped working after about a month. Since I received it for Christmas and don't run much in the winter months, the warranty expired by the time I realized it was faulty.I wanted to see if there was anything I could do and decided to call the manufacturer. I could only find a long distance number for technical support, and when I called I was also told that it wasn't working properly because I did something wrong when installing the software - even though I had been using the device successfully for a month. Then, I was told I could send it back to them for repair for $50.00 - a brand new one doesn't cost much more than that.I would suggest that if you are considering buying this product, reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"a piece of junk and BAD customer service","review":"I bought 3 of these gizmos and 2 broke, yes BROKE within the first 4 months.

Save your money.Think IPOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early failure of function controls","review":"Well. I have had mine no more than two weeks. The \\"Forward\\" skip and volume \\"Down\\" controls went out. Device sounds great but it looks like they did'nt have good quality control in assembly. I suspect it is based in the circuit board as two totally seperate functions went down. I cannot imagine two of those little bubble switches going down at the same time so that rules that out. It definitly appears like a bad common conductor on the circuit board that both switches are connected to.

I have had my eye on one since they came out, but I've now gone through two of them and both were defective. It sure is small and easy to use when it works, but my first one had a propensity to shut off with no warning, and my second one blasts me with static every once in a while and the red light won't stop blinking when it should be green. I thought maybe my Windows Media files were corrupted, but they play just fine on my computer. I'm returning this thing and getting a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity itself","review":"It may have no lcd screen, it may lack decent play modes (random), and may come with very poor headphones but i love my little MuVo.

But after a few weeks of use, it stops playing mp3's. Still works as a usb hard drive, but stops playing mp3's. Not only that, but it also drains batteries that you put in, even if it's not being used after this problem occurs. My muvo, and my friends muvo had the same exact problem. Save your money, don't buy this just yet. If this problem was not present, I would defenitely give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refused to work after only a month","review":"I have had this player slightly more than a month and coincidentally just past the warranty period. It will still accept files as an auxilliary drive but will not play on its own. The light does not come on and the the only audible sound is a high buzzing noise. It is incredibly sensitive and not worthy of a name like nomad. I am incredibly disappointed with this product and will never buy anything from Creative Labs again. I would seriously investigate other alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unreliable","review":"Like a few other people here, I'm having the auto-lobotomization problem big time. I had to do the hard reformat every other day or so, and it's presently not working at all.Oddly enough, I got a 64 meg model as a gift after buying the 128 meg model. The 128 meg model worked fine when plugged into the 64 meg battery pack. Then they both stopped working at all.I think Creative is very close to having a winner here. Using the thing when it works is a dream -- no goofy programs to load the device (which always seem to break or refuse to see the target). The fact that some people love it while others hate it make me suspect that they've got a really nasty QC problem in the assembly line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted","review":"I guess I should consider myself lucky as I got a good year out of my muvo. As I read the reviews of this player I realize I am SOL because, like many of the other reviewers, mine won't power up anymore. Save your money folks.

And when you stop the player, it starts back up at the first track - the batteries never seemed to last nearly as long as advertized either. Just spend some more money and get something that won't break on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Creative Labs!","review":"This MP3 player broke after four months of light use; Creative Labs customer support consumed a great deal of time and energy and finally failed to stand behind their product.

Before I puchased my player, I read every single review that was written. Majority of them said that dropping it will cause damages so I was EXTREMLY careful about not dropping and I never did. But right after the damn warrenty runs out, it stopped working all together and I tried reformatting 100x. Not to mention within the time that I did use it, it would turn on at the slightest touch and at other times, i would have to crunch the buttons to play. The bottom line. DONT BUY THIS.

You must go through a special hard format procedure that restores the Muvo firmware and hard formats the flash memory.Finally there is a major misfeature in the Muvo. When powered off the Muvo always returns to the first song. With no random play function this means that you will listen to the first 30 min to 1 hour of music over and over again unless you do a lot of button pressing.I think the Muvo is a great idea, but the execution and quality should rule it out for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"They tend to die early","review":"Got my Nomad Muvoabout 5 months ago and now its dead and out of warranty.

Since I have had the machine I have had to completely reformat it over a half dozen times (within 2 months). Currently it is not working at all. This machine has been extremely unreliable. Often I would go on a trip and it would simple not work- one then needs the CD and a computer to reformat the device before it can work again. and , after you reformat it, you have to re-install all the songs you had on there before. When it does work every time you shut it off and restart it you have to go from the beginning to get back to where you were. I thought small size and lack of features would mean hassle free use.

But that's where the good stuff ends.I ignored all the amazon comments about this player's poor reliability. I bought one. It stopped working after THREE DAYS. Support from creative has been horrible. It just gives up the ghost, and no amount of reformatting or cursing will help.Oddly, it keeps files just fine... so I now have a fine method for transfering files between machines. Alas, I could have bought a 128MB smartcard (or other media) for much cheaper.But no matter the idea that it transfers files, my muvo won't play music.

I was listening to a song, and paused the player midway through the song. It never came back on. I bought my unit from Dell, and they were great in sending out a replacement, but after reading these reviews, I am not so sure I want to deal with this again.Creative really did come up with a great idea, they just need to follow up and make it not only cute, but dependable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just stopped working","review":"This is the most compact and convenient MP3 player.

You can even use it as an removable drive to transport any type of files (media, documents, etc).Having said all these positive things, here comes the BUT. I loved this little guy, but it broke after only 2 weeks. I bought it 1 1/2 years ago for about $120. I didn't drop it or drown it. It just stopped working. I guess I shouldn't have disregarded all the other reviewers' caveats. I traded it in for the 128MB RipFlash MP3 player/voice recorder.

I tried again and same thing.I contacted Creative and they had me try some things to no avail. Creative Labs wants me to cover shipping and a minimum of $20 in \\"assessment\\" costs + whatever costs to repair it.Please do your research - this is a product known to have major issues yet Creative tries to pin the costs on the consumer.I will never buy a Creative Labs product ever again based on their horrible customer service, let alone their terrible products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does its job, but sure is flimsy...","review":"I bought this thing used. Thus far, it's working fine.But, be warned that every thing about this Muvo is flimsy from the buttons, the casing, and even the battery cover. So if you're likely to drop things, DON'T GET IT. There is no 'lock button' and the pause button easily gets set off by slight pressure - even by the wrinkle of your jeans. I find this to be the most annoying thing.Also annoying is the fact that once the player is shut off and then on again, the playlist resets to the first song.I would not buy thing this at the retail cost. There aren't enough options and it can hardly be called a quality piece of equipment.

I emailed technical assistance and they guided me through the recovery process. It worked for another 3 months, and then - after pushing the pause button - wouldn't play again. We tried the same recovery exercise, emailed tech help again, and their final suggestion was that it must be defective & to send it back with $$$ to put towards 'repair or replacement'. I don't know about you, but when I've already spent $$$ only 6 months before, I'd rather not sink more money into a defective product, or a company that won't do the right thing.

I formatted it again but \\"Format Failed\\" and the Muvo red LED when out. That was the end. Nothing I tried worked.

A low budget film, but it was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just don't know.","review":"Seems like I'm one of the few people alive who actually liked this mvie. Sure, it's a little goofy sometimes (the dream sequence is Exhibit A), but all in all, I think this movie is definitely worth the money. Eddie Murphy fans will love the humor, and when you get right down to it, it's a great yarn. Charles Dance does a great job as Sardum Numspa, but that's not surprising; his approach to playing bad guys is such that, no matter how sophisticated his characters may be, the viewer still instinctively knows that this isn't a guy you want to run into at night in a dark alley. (If you're having trouble placing him, watch \\"Last Action hero\\" and \\"Alien 3.\\") At any rate, give it a shot; it's definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Child","review":"Having seen this movie several times I wanted it for my DVD collection.

I owned it on video and when I saw that it was availible on DVD I just had to pick it up! The comedy in the Golden Child is purely in the style of Eddie Murphy. He displays that same sarcastic style that you first fell for in Beverly Hills Cop. My friends and co-workers all rave about this movie and laugh hysterically with every viewing. It gets better every time. Our favorite scene is by far the \\"I-I-I-I-I-I want the knife!\\" I don't understand why someone would call this a failed megahit. I work with about 30 people, my Corps outfit consists of 90 people, and I have many friends. I would say that close to 65% of all of us own this movie. It great!

There's simply no way you can watch this movie and find not only hilarious but easy to follow because the plot was very well crafted.

Perhaps it was not explaining who the real bad guy was(i'm sorry, Forces Of Evil is not enough for me). Maybe it was the low low grade action. Maybe it was just the Forces of Evil surrounding me, but the truth is, i just couldn't bring myself to be able to like this film.It is however not all bad, This is Eddie Murphy on vintage \\"Trading Places\\" style form, which is always worth the laugh, and there is one dream sequence which is so surreal its...well, surreal.Despite this however, my suggestion would be to watch it on TV rather than buy it. it just aint worth the nuggets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good comedy entertainment","review":"Raymond Charrell(Murphy) must rescue the Golden Child in order to save the world from the Devil(Dance).He is helped by a girl(Lewis) who told him that he is the chosen one.So he goes to Nepal to find the sacred Adjanti dagger the only can destroy the devil and save the child.As always Murphy fast speech and comic gestures are well welcome as he says Gimme the knife,please! the best in all the movie.A worth view of an expensive Dvd with no extras only the trailer.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"made a lot of money","review":"whats up with all the bad comments i was reading some of my, old, magazines and this movie was all over it grossed over 80 million thats a lot of money so i cant see why people dont like it also meli'sa morgan song deeper love is in the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I HATE THIS DVD ...

Prior to reading \\"The Blue Hammer\\" I had read some negative reviews of the book. Maybe compared to MacDonald's other \\"Archer\\" novels \\"TBH\\" is weaker, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought this was a solid mystery and enjoy the \\"Archer\\" character very much. The only negative remark I can make about \\"TBH\\" is that there are so many characters in it that sometimes it gets confusing keeping up with them all.

Emergence is one of my all time favorite books. I still have the copy I bought in high school the year after it first came out. I have reread it many times over the years.A few people complain about the start and stop nature of the writing. Being written in the short hand of someones personal journal may seem distracting at first...but like watching a moview with subtitles, you soon forget the distraction and are absorbed into the story.I always loved feeling like I was inside Candy's head. I have never found another book written the same way with the same perspective. It combination of young pre-teen girl thoughts, mixed with the vast knowledge of a genius child prodigy...I'm shocked to find out there is a sequel. I never knew! Now I must find a way to procure a copy! I recommend the book to anyone and can't wait for my own daughter to be old enough to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My much battered copy...","review":"I actually own four copies of Emergence. I've read the first two until they started to fall apart at the binding!I would love to contact David Palmer and BEG him to write again.For those of you looking for another excellent book, I'd like to recommend Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card.If you know how to reach David Palmer, let me know! Read ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice post-holocaust novel","review":"---First published in *Analog*, EMERGENCE is one of the overlooked gems of science fiction. Palmer even had the patience to respond to my letter of comment (LoC) in the magazine, and when it went to paperback publication he modified an element in the plot involving the surgical repair of a femoral arterial laceration.The story is told from the perpective of a brilliant and resourceful young girl in a ghodawful situation, and I intend to get my mitts on a copy to gift my 11-year-old granddaughter. There aren't too many decent stories SF stories with respectable female central characters in 'em, and EMERGENCE is one of the few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenally good!","review":"If you like science fiction, or even if you don't like science fiction, you should read this book.

I just found out about them today, and don't know how I can get hold of them!And how about publishing an email address so we can write to you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Author from the Heinlein School...","review":"The fact that this man hasn't written any other S-F is a crime. Apparently he normally writes non-fiction, but this book is from the same look and feel as John Varley and Spider Robinson -- id est; people who owe everything to Robert A. Heinlein. Is is /not/ a Heinlein clone the way Great White was a Zeppelin clone...it is simply a book written with the same sense of exploration of ideas...the original idea behind Speculative Fiction. Actually, the writing style, from a technical standpoint, is unlike any other S-F author I know.What it boils down to is that this book is a must-read for any intelligent, thoughtful person who has ever enjoyed Speculative Fiction (the more intelligent, non star-trek/wars science fiction). Since I've compared it to Robinson and Varley, I should point out that it's better than anything Robinson ever wrote, and at the top of Varley's potential range. I can only think of a few other books I'd rate with a 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very few flaws, but they warn of writer's weaknesses","review":"Emergence is an inspiring and often touching book about a very intelligent girl, who must deal with a post Nuclear/Biological war world. As others have noted, there are similarities in feel to Heinlein's juveniles. However, I feel there are too many deus ex machina points that provide cracks in an otherwise excellent story to give it a full five stars. Palmer's attraction to the superhuman proved a dooming weakness in his second novel with an adult protagonist, but here it's still workable. I believe it was John W. Campbell who observed that it's all but impossible for human authors to write about the superhumans, save at the beginning of their rise in childhood, or during their final faltering decline during old age. Emergence handles a gifted child well.Generally hard to find, but a very good gift for a bright pre-teen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best stories I've ever read","review":"I read this book as a kid and adored it.

Ever single one dies after a week of the car sitting. The shop says there is no slow drain. An ammeter show no draw. Disconnect the battery and let it sit for a sit for a week and it still dies. There is an issue with their batteries. To top it off, Optima changed their product number so it cannot be exchanged at the reseller for another redtop or upgrade to a yellow top.. . an extra crappy point to make is that I had a 3 year old riding lawn mower battery sitting on the shelf.

I think the 'Melissa' mentioned was Melissa Chapman,I wonder how she got into the Animorphs? Well, anyway this book had a great start and some good scenes at the Battle of Agincourt, I liked the bit with Tobias in the church. But then the book sort of went downhill with battle after battle. It seemed to just be the same old thing, and a lot of the information was hard to take in all at once for example where all the Animorphs were. The ending improves this book which I thought was a clever solution to the problem, so Jake didn't 'come back to life', he was never dead. It was pretty enjoyable, fast-moving with plenty of action. Still, it wasn't the best Megamorphs. I prefer #1 or #2. Its got a nice cover, though Tobias looks wrong. Get this if you're an Animorphs fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Boring!

Still, I can't figure out why the plot can't be continued instead of thrown into contrived ways to try to get/keep fans. At least the Animorph flavor is going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"K A, what the hell?","review":"I'm sorry to admit that this book is seriously bodgy. Travel back in time, trying to prevent an evil megalomaniac from changing the course of history? Never heard that one before. Plus nothing of note really happens (except for major characters dying, which doesn't count because Applegate always follows the rules and brings them back to life). Tobias and Rachel have their second kiss, if that counts...although in this context I would suspect it is emotional manipulation on the part of the author, trying to keep us with her.Oh, and Cassie? 'Sorcieres' is not a word most people learn in their first term of French (especially if they get a B).Honestly, if you've got an absolute dearth of activities for an hour and a half, and there is only one Animorphs around, and this is it, this is the only situation in which I would recommend this book.

During the early years of Christianity, women were and still are important."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor construction","review":"The item is described as having 1012 pieces. I am assuming the 25 trays, the 45 bins and the box are 71 items out of the 1012 total. What was shipped to me was only the 71 storage items; the actual connectors etc were missing. This then is just a review of 71 items I received. When I pulled the plastic box out of cardboard box I was careful that I held the front of the box up so that the trays would not slip out. One tray did slip out the backside because the holes on the back are big enough for the tray to fit through. The tray fell three feet and broke. I have seen some poorly made storage containers before but this one takes the 1st place as the worst by far. Thin brittle plastic, holes on the back of the box and the drawers do not slide well. I wish I could have checked out the actual parts but they were missing. I sent the box back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent kit","review":"This is a good kit for the money. You would spend a lot more then 25$ getting all of these connectors individually.I didn't expect anything high quality with this, and it did not disappoint. Very cheap plastic bins and holder. It serves its purpose quite well though - I do not need a high quality box/bin setup, it's just meant for storage an organization. As I run out of some of the specific connectors - I am refilling the bins and continuing to use this as a good organizer.All the connectors come individually bagged - and all were included in the package. Actually I had doubles of a few kinds, so that's a plus, but obviously denotes poor manufacturing/packaging techniques. I could find no indication these were UL certified.All in all I was fairly satisfied with the kit, great price, contained plenty of connectors to refill my collection, and the storage bins will be used for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"At first glance, this DVD Player was a plus. It even had Duel Laser pickup, which virtually eliminates that stupid pause between layers on Duel Layer DVDs.However, I found the picture and playability of the disc to be unsatisfactory. I hooked it up using the component video outputs, and I would occasionally get a highly noticable blue line at the top of the screen, and an occassional red wiggly afterglow on some text that appeared during certain films. And the picture would be a little jumpy - occasionally.Also, sometimes the player wouldn't play a disc. I'd have to take the disc out of the player, and put it back in for it to play. It was a perfectly fine disc that played on my previous DVD player.Overall, this player had potential, but failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for Money","review":"I bought this DVD because I wanted a DVD player with out all the gimmicks, that is easy to use and was value for money.This model lived up to my expectations.

You can play the same DVD more than once and at first it'll be fine and then it skips whole scenes at a whim. I've not played too many CD's on it so I can't vouch for that. I ordered this player because I have a Samsung burner/DVD combo player in my Dell computer and it works great. I cannot believe my computer DVD player outperforms a standalone player.

For me, religious practice was always black and white, right or wrong. How narrow-minded is that, I quickly realized.Although the book gives many examples of \\"mixed marriage\\" couples that are actively working through their differences, it is clear that matters of religion are a constant source of tension in all those marriages.

It's the player. It's UNRELIABLE.I'm not going to go spend 15 dollars on a new adapter when I paid 100 dollars for the DVD unit.I have since replaced it with a 79 dollar Toshiba console unit that works FINE.It's nice that this Koss plays all regions and all formats save for avi/rpg/mov/mpeg.But it's not worth the high price tag.

The next day we watched another movie and it did the same thing. Each time - I unplugged the power from the unit after turning it off. It's my own fault for only reading a few reviews about the Koss DVP2161 and I thinking, \\"Who knows, maybe I'll get a good player\\".

I was lured by the price, discounted further by an Amazon special a year ago.But the DVD player skipped and then froze halfway through the first movie, and it has rejected other discs all together.Furthermore, the unit does not hook directly to a tv; you'll need a conversion set from Radio Shack, which completely undermines the enticing value.

It didn't do much to change my perceptions.As someone who is often discussed as inheritor of the mantle of people like David Halberstam, Feinstein leaves a lot to be desired. Like a lot of his work, this book is redundant, reductive, melodramatic and shallow. Tough to criticize someone's habits blindly; but, Feinstein's work - as noted in a lot of other reviews - manifests a laziness. It comes through in both the editing and the apparent lack of any critical research.The book also suffers from Feinstein's habit of habitually overselling the dramatic value of sports and sports interactions and happenings. I can't recommend the book at all - and I think I have finally cut ties with this author once and for all.JAW"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja View all over again","review":"Like so many other reviewers, I concur with their repeated assaults on the repetitiveness of this book.

I often thought there were printing errors in my copy because I was reading similar passages over and over. But no, I suppose Feinstein needed to get a decent sized book so he did what he had to do.But at least I have a better overall view of Kermit Washington. He's a really great guy in many ways, very charitable and caring. The problem is he's handled just about everything relating to \\"the punch\\" poorly. He blames another player, tells Rudy how much he's suffered in a rare meeting, sues the NBA, etc. etc. I think it was John Lucas who advised him to take responsibility and move on, not say \\"I'm sorry, but...\\". Unfortunately, Washington hasn't taken this advice.

John Fenistein is a fine writer, but this book struck me as very repetitive in places....he's trying to give us the story of \\"the punch\\" from the angles of several of the participants, but the effect just doesn't come off.

It is about two gangs, the Sharks and the Jets. The Jets are Americans and the Sharks are Puerto Ricans. This novel takes place in New York City. Both of the gangs attend a commuity dance to plan a fight, and Tony, an American that used to lead the Jets, falls in love with Maria, a Puerto Rican. Maria's brother is Bernardo, who is the head of the Sharks and despises Tony. How will they solve this? This book is basically a modern version of Romeo and Juliet with changes in characters, and it is definitely something that you should read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jason's Review","review":"I really liked West Side Story because I love books about gangs. Also most books you can tell what's going to happen in the end but this book was a huge surprise for me. Actually when I was in the middle of this book I went out and bought a copy of the movie.West Side Story is about a gang called the Jets who really hates a gang called the Sharks because they are Puerto Rican. The Jets feel that the PRs invaded America and they don't like it so they try and give the PR's a good kicking whenever they get the chance. But what happens when the ex-leader of the Jets falls in love with a PR? Then they have an all-out rumble to see who's the toughest one and too see whom gets to own the street. Will any one be able to stop the rumble before it goes to far?I think readers who would like this book is someone who likes books about gangs like The Outsiders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The book follows the events of the movie but has a lot more detail and it's a little longer.

I was going to exchange it for another, but these reviews have changed my mind and I am getting a full refund instead.

It's like having a night light that you can't turn off. The alarm is awful. The alarm volume starts out low (level 1) and increases every few seconds up to the max level of 12, unless you roll over and turn it off. Say good bye to listening to the weather and traffic reports in the morning while in bed because you have to race to turn this thing off before the volume reaches FULL BLAST!

Usually 5 to 10 memory presets for each band. Not this one! You have to manually find your station each time if you want to switch stations. A real drag. I thought the people at Memorex would have figured this out, or maybe they just wanted to save money by deleting this rudimentary feature. So much for station surfing.

It would have been nice to have been told this up front by the manufacturer. Even though it will work with my newer iPod, the controls are inadequate for a dock. The remote allows the user to pause, play, and skip to the next song, but there is no way to scroll through the iPod's menu to select playlists. To change playlists one must remove the iPod from the dock, make a selection, then reinsert in the dock. The large, well lit display does not show any of the iPod information one would expect such as playlist, current song, or battery charge level.As mentioned by previous reviews, the alarm function is annoying to the point of being useless.An attractive product, but overall a very poor design functionally. I'm returning this device the same day it was received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly poor","review":"I was happy with this unit until I too gave it a shock.

I've read and re-read the instructions and I don't see anything about how to specifically set your ipod except to make sure it is on.Other than that, I'm in agreement with all the other negative reviews I've read on here. When I looked up articles that listed the best ipod alarm clocks, the iHome, about $20 more, was the one most highly recommended on every site I went to. I chose this instead of the ihome b/c cause it was $20 cheaper. Learned my lesson. I'm taking it back to Target tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy! it worked for only 3 days","review":"This product appears to have some serious design flaws. I only used the radio function, and for three (3) days it worked just fine. Then the next day I turned it on and no sound came out of the FM radio. When I tried the AM band, I heard only static, as if no stations existed within range. Since I never moved or jostled the unit in a way that could damage it, the best explanation I can come up with is that a connection broke (spontaneously?) on the circuit board somewhere, probably involving the digital tuner. Needless to say, I returned it and purchased a basic portable stereo for ~$30. You should definitely avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 5 months","review":"Don't buy this!

Since we bought it, when I would go to set the alarm or turn off the radio,etc, there would be an electric shock. This would set the clock to 12:00 each time. This happened off and on for a while. Then last night, the alarm 2 set button wasn't working. And this morning, none of the buttons worked! I had to unplug it, and after plugging it back in, only half of the buttons are working.

The irony is that the only good features (the two alarms) are rendered useless by the fact that I have to reset the clock every single day.-WORTHLESS customer support. They just recomended that I return the item to the store where it was purchased--which is 220 miles away from where I live--and refused to provide assistance with a poorly-designed, defective product.There are plenty of other competitive products out there...

Engage with this CD as the next effort AFTER the monumental, epically-proportioned Lex Rex.For the uninitiated, this Glass Hammer CD is a good start. Although loosely framed as a conceptual work, this prog CD rivals some of the best efforts by Genesis and Yes.While Glass Hammer is certainly experiencing a rising star, the band falters a couple of times on this CD, but not enough to warrant a panning of the work. Just brief spells of redundancy.Nevertheless, every song redounds with sensibility and luxurious harmonies.The last cut leaves you wishing the CD was a double.Well-executed, well-performed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, yet flawed","review":"This is a marvelous, yet flawed, follow-up to the fantastic \\"Lex Rex.\\" Like \\"Lex Rex,\\" the disc is notable for its soaring, multi-layered keyboards; well-placed, satisfying guitar licks; hypnotic, rich vocals; and complex, varied song structures. (The second track, \\"Run Lisette,\\" will take you into the stratosphere.) But, also like on its predecessor, the rhythm section is weak: the drumming is stilted and robotic, and the bass guitar is often almost completely lacking in the mix. And the decision to cover Dan Fogelberg's \\"Longer\\" -- a shallow, hokey song on which this recording does not creatively embellish -- was ill-advised; the song will likely be programmed out by most listeners. In the end, though, most of this disc is immensely satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for GH fans","review":"Shadowlands is an excellent cd.

The book is basically composed of paragraphs with very little use figures, tables, exhibits, etc. It's just paragraph after paragraph. My biggest issue with this book, however, was the fact that I had to constantly skip the inline citations that were everywhere! One example: a 4 sentence paragraph with 3 citations.

I found it very interesting right from the beginning, very easy to read and always looked forward to picking it up again after I'd had a (well-deserved) break.Very scary, and you will never look in any mirror the same again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"This was the first Graham Masterton book that I ever read and it is fantastic. The thin line between the innocent Alice adventures and the gothic horror which Masterton instills is without a doubt some of the most powerful writing ever published. The gore as always is only used to enhance the horror not overtake it, but it is the story which just makes this book the best out of all he has written. Fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterton doesn't hold back","review":"Mirror is a novel about a man fascinated with a deceased child star named Boofuls, who was brutally murdered. He purchases a mirror that once belonged to this star. Soon after buying it, he noticed strange things happening. He investigates and soon learns macabre details about Boofuls--details that have him realizing that the horror behind Boofuls' death is far from over.Masterton is not a writer who is gentle. He does not let up on details and he does not gloss them over. The Mirror is delightfully creepy, particularly when crossing over into that mirror world. Ever since I read this story, I have read Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland with a more analytical eye, looking for the details Mirror references here.This is one of Masterton's better stories. If you like being creeped out, check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you never want to look in a Mirror again.....","review":"This was truly a horrific book and i loved it except for the ending and the way the sacrifice took place. I know Masterton could have come up with a better way to end it, but all in all this is a book the DEMANDS attention as it is truly an awesome book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cold weather test","review":"We had our clock for six months now and it has worked accordingly. We're in the middle of January and the transmitter did register a -21 degree reading, but the next day it didn't register a -22 but the letter L.

I'm pleased with this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Wall Clock","review":"I bought one at Costco and took it back. I found this on line and it has worked very well. I like the big numbers and the fact that when I tell it to dispay seconds instead of barometric pressure it stays that way. Outside temperature works great so far after having it a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"we bought three clocks, and two of them did not work","review":"We bought three of these clocks, since the price and features seemed attractive from the description on Amazon. When the clocks arrived at our home and we set them up, two of the three failed. One clock did not function at all when we put in the batteries, and the second clock stopped working after two days. We tried changing batteries and we re-read the instructions, but, alas, the two clocks were not happy campers. We also found that the temperature readings were different by between three and five degrees, even when the clocks were physically right next to each other. My conclusion is that these clocks are very low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"This unit worked great for 10 months, then the outdoor temperature quit reading. I changed batteries, still would not not read. Ordered a new sensor for about $30.00: still did not work. Contacted Lacrosse for support and they gave me the run around about batteries (which I had already changed three times) until the warranty ran out. I did not contact Amazon which I probably should have. Point is, do not count on Lacrosse for anything,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Probably only of interest to three groups of people:1: Historians2: Writers3: NerdsIt will give you a good idea of how much language has shifted in the last couple centuries.

Anyone who like me struggles through their 3-6 miles will be inspired by how the author conquered 62 miles at better than 6:30 miles by considerable talent and extraordinary courage. The other animals are interesting too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book......Makes Me Want To Run","review":"Great Book. Ties together biology and running. Easy to read. Made me want to get out and run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect book, misleading title!!!","review":"Don't get me wrong I like the book, I give it a solid 4 star, it's about endurance, our genetic past, sports nutrition with a good story of endurance by author. Designed as a chapter of a story fallowed by chapter of science and knowledge, which is a perfect combo. The science part is easy to read and understand. What I am pissed is how they change the title of the book in order to manipulate the runners community, with a recent hype of running books the aim was the get their share. This is not a running book, the title is irrelevant. So if you are looking for a book that explain to you the human athlete go and get it( I think you should ) , if you're looking for a book about running ( tips, stories etc.) try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bea","review":"Not sure what I expected but this certainly wasn't it. I didn't even finish the book, it just didn't hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having trouble finishing this book","review":"Reading the other reviews, I must be the only reader who did not appreciate this book. While the book may be very interesting, it's not what Amazon advertised it to be nor is it what I expected from the title. Maybe I just haven't gotten far enough along in the book. But I didn't expect an autobiography, especially one about an author whose young life sounded very difficult. What I expected was a book more along anthropological or historical explanations for the reasons humans run. I expected a continuation of the explanations that were described in Born to Run. In fact, Born to Run was the reason I purchased this book. Maybe I'll give it another try in the future but for now I'm going to continue my search for a book I can't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read that combines running and science","review":"This really is a remarkable book about not only the science of running but the science of endurance and survival. Bernd Heinrich combines an autobiographical journal-type approach to launch off into a fascinating scientific inquiry. By studying birds, antelope, camels, bumblebees and frogs (to name a few) he basically comes to the conclusion that all animals rely on endurance in some way or another to survive. The book will possibly be appreciated by runners and athletes more than not but it's full of so much interesting information that it should hold the interest of anyone willing to learn new things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied, waste of time","review":"The author or the Ghost is very articulate in presenting the \\"biography\\" and it was interesting read to start with. A few chapters into the book the author claims how he and the guys on his track team idolized the running greats of the 70s such as Prefontaine, Shorter,... This didn't make much sense as the author already had mentioned about his childhood just after the WWII and being youngster in Maine growing up and taking up to running. Then he mentions about going to graduate school in 1966!!! Obviously he was a grown up in 60s yet mentions about idolizing the running greats of 70s as a youngster. That was it for me, didn't want to waste any more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for runners, scientists, historians, or anyone else!","review":"This is a great book, a wonderful biography of a fascinating man. I have had the chance of sitting in on a talk by Dr. Heinrich about his running, and he is truely remarkable. All of that talk is captured in this book. It is by far the best running book I have read- and I've read a lot. I love his style, and enjoy his take on life.I have read 6 of his books, and look forward to reading his newest, as well as catching up on some I have missed.5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre biography","review":"I bought this book expecting a book mostly about how humans evolved to run from a scientist's view, but instead got mostly a personal biography in an uninteresting writing style"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments of an epidemiologist.","review":"This is a valuable text for the Public Health officer trying to decide what a GIS expert can add to his or her program. It is easy to follow without being simplistic but at the same time reliable. It is a valuable bridging text that introduces GIS to Public Health professionals or those thinking of entering that field and similarly aspects of public heath to the GIS expert or the student learning GIS. And for those of us utilising confidential medical records this book contains a very valuable discussion on confidentiality of records and how to utilize these data productively and safely displaying results without breaching that confidentiality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I can't believe that so many of Gordon Korman's books are out of print!

I also liked that the website included the words of the songs as well as ideas for parents and teachers."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost money","review":"I recently purchased \\"Vietnam War Stories\\". The price was right ($3+) and being a Vietnam veteran I collect Vietnam dvds and movies. This product was \\"used\\" but indicated \\"Like New\\". It consisted of 2 discs. Disc 1 would not go past the Main menu. Whether I selected \\"Play all\\" or tried to play it by episodes, it would not go past main menu. Yesterday I sent an email identifying my delima. I got a response back in Spanish. I've purchased several used dvds thru amazon and Hastings. Ninety nine percent of the time there was no problem. But this disc just won't play. Disc 2 plays fine. I guess I am just out the money. It would cost me another $2.98 to return it, to get a refund for the $3.98 I spent on it.

It reminds me vaguely of other disco-abroad-Bollies such as Salam Namasté or Hum Tum (both also with Saif Ali Khan who is too old for such fluff and performed so much better in Omkara, for instance). Stupid plot. Bland disco music by Pritam who delivered much better tunes (easy rock) for the Anurag Basu movies Barfi! and Life in a Metro.Master lenser Anil Mehta did a great job, again. The leading ladies look gorgeous (too bad that after Om Shanti Om, Deepika Padukone seems to choose only bad roles in bad movies).

Helen, the mother seemed very unloving to her daughter Jo. The only thing that they really did was argue. Peter who marries Helen is even more repulsive in this story. And what is it with the story of the daughter imitating her mother's life by getting pregnant, despite her life situation. It seems that the arguments between the mother and daughter play for the most irritating part of the story. Only parts where Jo is having her first love affair with a black sailor, and the friendship she has with Geof made this story seem not as angry as it would really seem. In all, the story is all banter. If you can handle a lot of arguing, this play might be readable for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Story that never gets going","review":"Having read and studied this book at school. i can say that i did not like this book. some aspects are totally unclear, for example Geof's dubiuos sexuality. The open ending leaves the reader feeling disatisfied, and annoyed, it left me thinking, is that it? i don't recommend reading the book. The storyline is basic, and the most irratating feature of the book is the arguementative relationship between Helen and Jo. The best bit though is definetely the relationship between Jo and Geof"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable treasure Spanish Film!","review":"The legitimate pride of Huelva -Carlos Saura- reached a cosmic height with this unbeatable artwork in a theatrical stage around the last days of Goya in Bordeaux. The picture elapses in two well definite times and spaces: the young Goya and his love affair with La Duquesa de Alba, his beloved and unforgettable love Cayetana.The cast is incredible. Francisco Rabal that monumental actor got perhaps his most admirable feature through his memorable career. Jose Coronado as the young Goya is impressive, and the sensual Maribel Verdú ignites the screen every time she appears.An introspective portrait in which the memories are the invisible fellow partners, despite he is surrounded and supported by her family until his last breath.All the Prizes for this film were deservedly won.

Tonight our 14 year old son finished an unpleasant good habit card and declared he was NEVER going to get that one again.

It's a great size and can be viewed easily from our pool. It keeps perfect time and it's so great how it adjusts itself between daylight savings time and standard time. The only negative for me is the fact that the temperature reading is almost never accurate!

It is well-written, engaging and entertaining, as Landay looks at the existence and role of the female trickster. Like more traditional tricksters of folklore (Brer Rabbit, Anansi) and pop culture (Bugs Bunny), the female trickster in American culture plays with convention, uses disguise to cross boundaries and walks the line between accepted values and subversive behavior. Lucille Ball was such a woman; so were \\"It\\" girl Clara Bow, Mae West and Marlene Dietrich, and their existence enriched and to some extent changed society. Well-researched and highly illuminating, this is a great book for anyone looking for a different take on the \\"women-in-pop-culture\\" issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Waters meets Tobe Hooper","review":"Do not miss this entry into the \\"inbred hillbilly cannibal family\\" subgenre of Horror films.

It would only be a matter of time before this ball and others completly break apart. I am taking this back to the store and am going to try a different set.

For well over a year I have been anticipating this book. It is just too bad that it held my intrest for all of 5 minutes. I love the other books, and I still think that she is a fantastic writer; but this latest installation is hardly necessary to the series--except for the one fact that Arithon manages to escape from Lirenda. The next novel will hopefully be much better. If you read the Mistwraith series, buy this book (if only to assure yourself that you wouldn't have missed much).

Although of the best characters (Arithon) does not appear until a little later in the book (around page 80), the rest of the book more than makes up for his lack of presence early on. The book also features one of Ms. Wurts' best endings, leaving the reader wanting for more. Fortunately, the sequel is just as enjoyable.

To quote the opening of one of the songs in \\"My Fair Lady\\", \\"Words, words, words...\\". If you like long, long, long descriptive passages, then you might enjoy this book.

The assembly took about an hour and it was very sturdy. I really liked the fact that it was stained already to protect the wood.There is about 8 inches of growing room and the working height is perfect. I would buy another one and recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Outdoor Speakers","review":"We were in the market for some quality outdoor speakers and after reviewing my options we chose JBL for price and quality.

The speakers are less expensive than Bose and really deliver a quality sound. I would buy the S36AWII again."},{"rating":"1","title":"i just tried to read this too...","review":"but, i gave up about half way through and just skimmed. The attempt at old-fashioned language used by Charlotte and Emily Bronte sounds ridiculous. It would have been better written straightforwardly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy, too short, chain rusts","review":"The hammock stand sections are loosely connected and pull apart when I try to move the stand in my backyard--- It takes two people even to drag the stand to a new position in my lawn. The stand is not long enough for our hammocks, so we have to tie knots in the string section to shorten them up, which reduces their comfort level. Even with this modification to my hammock, I sit about 6\\" off the ground because the stand does not hold the hammock high enough off the ground. The chain that connects the hammock to the stand started to rust after a week so we also do not have high hopes for durability. There is no way anyone paid $199 list price for this stand--- I rate it below quality of other stands I've bought. It's barely effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made item - Great price","review":"I was a little skeptical from reading some of the reviews, but went ahead and bought the stand and hammock combo. Both the stand and the hammock are very well made. This set has no problem supporting 3 people, roughly 200 lbs. More than that I think the hammock will touch the ground. This is an issue with all hammocks, because most are made to stretch. So far I am very happy with the purchase. The price at Amazon is very hard to beat, [$$$] delivered for both stand & hammock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Delivery was delayed twice, received it a month after it was ordered. It showed up in a ragged cardboard box completely wrapped in packing tape (no exaggeration) as the box would have fallen appart otherwise. Parts of the stand were sticking thru the box. The hooks and chains required to hang the hammock were not in the box, although the description on the box clearly states that they are included. The stand was scratched up and two of the rubber caps to cover the ends of the tubing were punched through as well.Went to Home Depot and picked up some chain and hooks, hung the hammock and works fine. I was bothered enough that I thought about returning it, but decided it wasn't worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiped twice and still no hooks and chains!","review":"I ordered this item May 26th as a gift. The stand was shipped to my house twice with no hooks and chains - nice. Not to mention that the box it came in looked like it was packed by a child. The stand it self looks good - but I still haven't gotten to use it. I have a hammock, the metal stand, but nothing to hang the hammock on. Amazon has not yet resolved this issue. I'm hopeing they send me the hooks and chains - but I haven't seen them yet. Bottom line - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Fit","review":"I bought the hammock with accompanying stand. The rope hammock is way too long for the stand. My teenager weighs about 100lbsand when he gets in the hammock,it stretches so much that he is virtually on the ground. Bought as Christmas present and what a disappointment this summer. Looks pretty, thus one star. I suggest you buy only the hammock and make sure you have two big trees to tie it tautly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omni/Swings 'N Things 586 Hammock Stand - Green Finish","review":"This hammock stand is a piece of junk! I put the stand together and attached the hammock. When I sat in it the bottom support bar broke. Now I am not a small person (6'4\\" 250lbs), but the data says it will hold 500 lbs, this dosen't even hold 250lbs. My recommendation is save your money and attach your hammock to two trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you weight more than 240 lbs., do not buy this!!!","review":"I have experienced the exact same thing as the March 31, 2002 post. After placing my double sized hammock on the stand at the highest notche, the support bars bent at where they angle up. And I only used the hammock stand for not even 2 hours. I think 6'2\\" (240 lbs.) is under the 500 lbs. maximum. Unless the manufacturer forgot to move the decimal place to the left one position (i.e., 50 lbs. maximum)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good hammock stand","review":"I like this hammock stand. It's not stupendous, but it's quite good. It's sturdy and easy to assemble.The only thing that isn't quite right (but is still functional) is that, due to the \\"V-bars\\" (the ones that project up from the ground) not fitting very tightly into their supports, the V-bars move a little when I sit in my hammock. It's not a big deal, but I feel that I should sit down carefully; I'd prefer if I didn't have to sit down carefully. That's the only reason that I give it 4 stars intsead of 5.I'd recommend this hammock stand to a friend (it's good for the price), but I'd mention the bit above too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulitzer Prize winner","review":"This work won the 1967 Pulitzer prize for general non-fiction. Since other winners of that prize, e.g., The Guns of August(in 1963), The Making of the President, 1960,(in 1962--the first Pulitzer in this category) The Rising Sun (in 1971), and The Making of the Atomic Bomb (in 1988) have been very enjoyable reads, I decided to read this work. The topic is of interest,, but the author grubs in pre-1776 writing a lot, and I did not find I was caught up in the subject, important tho it is. The treatment is deep in theory, and intellectual history, and while at times this has interested me, I could not find myself enamored by the book--which is a reflection on me, not on the very erudite author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea for the SkyScout","review":"The Scoutcase is a good idea for anyone that has the SkyScout. I wouldn't call it perfect, but it's a good case. It fits fairly well, offers some protection from drops etc., and seems pretty well made. You won't mistake the vinyl construction for leather though. There have been reports on the internet that the clear plastic on the case that is supposed to protect the display and lens, actually scuffs them up. I have not seen this yet, but it has been reported. To remove the batteries, or use a tri-pod, you have to remove the SkyScout from the case. I feel much safer using my SkyScout with the Scoutcase on. All in all, it's a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great invention","review":"If you have ever wondered what are you seeing, when u gaze into a sky full of stars, then this is the product.

To our surprise, this \\"quality\\" product is a very loose fit, the Skyscout lenses are exposed all the time.

I think he sounds a bit like Ludacris every now and then, jeezy's voice is just more raspier and has no talent at all.This, tony yayo's, mike jones's, fifty's albums are definitely top four worst rap albums of the year 2005.

This isn't music, but a form of advertising to sell overpriced products that have no intrinsic value. This is rap at its worst, glorifying drugs, violence and decadence, while exploiting the plights of many of the nations poor, by acting as though these are the only concerns they have. Stop rehashing NWA and Tupac, its time for so-called Gangsta Rap to retire. Pull up your pants while your at it. And tuck in your T-Skirts.

This guy has some really good flows and the beats are amazing on pretty much every track. Jeezy has that laid back gangsta style, not so much in your face which i like alot, alot of guys seem to want to play the hard role a bit too hard but guys like this really make you lean back while listening to his rhymes.

I'm not even on some hater type ish but if he can go platinum just by ad-libbing and album, I know I can go 2x platinum and I don't even rap. Yeah, I bought the album but I regret it now. The Gangsta Grillz mixtape was better than this trash. He repeatedly talks about the same things he did as he did on the mixtape, just over a different beat. I'm glad he did leave BNDH.

Dude is just another dime a dozen rapper with a barely average flow and tired production. His lyrical content is pretty weak, rap about something more productive than how much of a street hustler you WERE. You're on one of the biggest rap labels in the industry, and you're a product of it. I'm sick of seeing those stupid snow man t-shirts, that's setting a good example for the young & impressionable.

Everything was hooked up correctly, but the remote didn't work (even tried new batteries), nor did any button on the machine (excluding the power button). I was so ticked that my new toy didn't work. I managed to put in a cd (A Christmas Story)and got it to play by hitting the power button a few times but i couldn't stop or eject or do anything else.

I'm not an M.D., Psychologist or even a very smart person, but the lessons in this book about self-evaluation and rational observation are crucial for all people. True it's geared to teach the very basics of Cognitive Therapy in a Clinical setting; I must say its applications are nearly endless. Take me for example. With this book under my belt I feel as if I've been given years of therapy in only a few hundred pages. I'm not kidding you. Not only that but I can usually always put my friends' fears, anxieties and whining to rest simply by mimicking the scenarios found within this wonderful text. Beck is a genius, his daughter is his disciple. Are you all about observing your life in a more rational fashion thereby alleviating your negative reactions to what you believe to be \\"not the end of the world\\" problems?

Buy it, read it, pass it on, and then read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first and best","review":"This was a great book when it came out, I don't care that we've since learned there is embellishment and even some fiction in these pages. Jones still did an amazing journey, or set of journeys here, and in his lifetime. The crossing of South America was real. Even stripped of embellishment, he accomplished more than most sailors have, or ever will. This is a book about determination and individuality. Part fact, part fiction, in its essential and imperfect humanness, fundamentally truthful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I concur with several of the other reviewers that while his stories reflect a remarkable adventure, they are conveyed with a tone of negativity that is off-putting. The reader is left with a sense that Mr. Jones approached his journey from the perspective that he was the only person on earth who understands it. Rather than a personal odyssey, during which one would presume to learn about the world and make discoveries about life, this journey felt more like a personal war against it. We are to believe that during his amazing journey, Mr. Jones personally conquered bureaucracy, the ocean, militant people, racists, and everything else that is wrong with the world. His attitudes toward nearly everyone he encountered were consistently negative -- as though he was running some gauntlet of ignorance that only he could survive.

We were slightly disappointed with the lack of actual wood used, that may have affected the durability. The back pops out rather quickly but it is not too difficult to put back. The toy tends to be fun anyway since there is a magnet positioned on the back of the passenger seat. Thus making Max and Monty great transporters for smaller engines and trucks like Thomas and Percy. The back loader is very easy to move back and forth but it does not last too long so eventually we just took it out and are 3 year old had just as much fun without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I usually don't think twice about ordering Thomas products since they are known to be high quality, but this one is a doozy.

Visually it's somewhat better -- the detail on costumes, props, and sets is fascinating. But poor Patrick Stewart, poor Glenn Close (who I normally adore!), poor cast -- abysmal. The three princes are awful, and Jonathan Rys-Myers -- well, he should have passed on this one. He's very talented, but it doesn't show here.I have to confess I didn't even finish watching it. It just doesn't work.

Is it a good adaptation? and 2. Is it a good movie, in and of itself?The answer to both questions, in this case, is no. The original movie's dialogue was delivered with such impecible timing and sarcastic, sharp wit that you could actually believe these folks WERE Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The onscreen chemistry between Peter O'Toole and Catharine Hepburn was off the charts, and the supporting cast, including a very young Anthony Hopkins, was superb.In this remake, Patrick Stewart (who I always regarded as a great actor) and Glen Close (who I never did) seem to have about as much interest in their dialogue as a toddler in a calculus class. They sound so scripted and deadpan that it's hard to believe they weren't actually reading off of cue cards (perhaps they were). They barely, as far as I could tell, even make eye contact with one another.Disappointing all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disfunctional family in royalty...for sure!","review":"Superb acting Glen Close and Patrick Stewart!

A remake of THE LION IN WINTER, the 1968 masterpiece starring Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn, is such time. Nothing in this movie comes remotely close to the original. In taking the role as Henry II, Patrick Stewart continues a line of miscasting messes that have included his trying and failing to best Gregory Peck's Ahab in a remake of MOBY DICK, and trying and failing to make a credible Ebenezer Scrooge while falling well short of George C. Scott's masterful portrayal in A CHRISTMAS CAROL.Glen Close is just awful! When compared to Katherine Hepburn, Close is like having a tuna sandwich when lobster is on the menu!The rest of the cast is equally abysmal. How do you replace Anthony Hopkins, Timothy Dalton, John Castle and Jane Merrow? You don't as evidenced by this film. How can you think that you can? That remains the mystery!THE HORSEMAN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell asleep while watching","review":"I was excited to receive this DVD as the main characters were portrayed by two of my favorite award-winning actors: Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart.

We meet the Du Champ girls, Lita, and Adele who make up 2 parts of a family filled with deep secrets and much drama.For the spirited and young Lita Du Champ, New Orleans is a place subjugated by her diligent mother, Helen who basically holds the family up. Devoted to her mother -- and sisters - she works very hard to keep the family together while making an effort to institute a life of her own.When her beautiful, restive and MARRIED sister Adele falls in love with their mother's enemy, Lucien Faure -- a smooth operator with \\"the devil's good looks\\", Lita divulges her mother's mystifying past... With this new information, Lita finds that she has one last, frantic chance to save the destiny of the ones she loves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ball of Confusion","review":"How does a young woman keep her family together when secrets threaten to blow it apart? This is the dilemma of Lita Duchamp. Lita's family life wasn't exactly the American dream. Her father was a drunken loser who thought much too highly of himself. Her mother Helen was the breadwinner, a woman who knew how to earn, and ran the family business. Her sister Adele was a glamour girl with hot pants married to a sailor who thought the world of her. Then there were the young twins a last ditch effort by Helen to brighten her already dim marriage. This \\"idyllic\\" life was threatened by one Lucien Faure' who has one the heart of Adele and has a score to settle with Helen.Tervalon weaves a great story into a confusing ball of a book without the benefit of division by chapters. The reader knows that Lita is charged with keeping the family together, yet it seems that Helen is the actual heroine in this story. This reader isn't so sure that this was Tervalon's intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"I almost liked this one as much as Tervalon's Understand this. This is the story of a mother who's devasted when her daughther Adele start dating this guy Lucien, because of a secret she knows about him, from a earlier time in her life.

It's interesting to note that Manoel de Oliveira was 90 year old when shot the film and that he is still active as a director, as film maker. Very beautiful and poetic movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a hard DVD to review","review":"Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira was 89 years old with a resume that would let him make any damn film he wanted. So what did he do? He went autobiographical. A fine cast of four, headlined by Marcello Mastroianni, drive from France to Portugal in search of one man's past. Introspective and subdued in both style and scenery.It can be difficult to read subtitles in a dialogue-heavy film. But once we reach Portugal, most lines are between a French speaker and a Portuguese speaker, with a translator, and the luxury (for me) of seeing the same thing in English subtitles twice. Even so, with an awareness that these films are a bit expensive in the US, I can't really recommend it.So what is it about? Beginnings and endings. What we remember, what we forget. Family relationships gone bad. Atonement. Unflinching realism. In that, it is brilliant. But hell, it might bore somebody, I don't know. So I respect it but I don't recommend it.

Recording him live was a good move, too.Even anachronistic numbers like \\"Mandela (Bring Him Back Home),\\" with its hopelessly sentimental lyrics celebrating Nelson Mandela walking the streets of Soweto with his soon-to-be divorced wife, Winnie, seem somehow right: the musical truth is larger than shopworn politics, no matter how just the cause.Township jazz, performed at some kind of musical Nirvana, is the order of day here, and never has it sounded better.

It's written from the point of view of Jesus, as if he's writing you a long and VERY personal letter. He tells us what kind of relationship we should have with him, and why. Hearing all this from the perspective of Jesus is quite jolting. You have to stop and reflect every few sentences, and the book becomes almost a dialog, even a prayer. There's no new theology in the book; I'm not even sure there are any new ideas. But the manner in which the ideas are expressed makes them hit home, really hit home.

If There Is Such A Thing","review":"This book is by far the worst Redwall book ever written. Unlike Mattimeo or The Pearls of Lutra, it lacked action or excitement. It seems that as Jacques writes more books, the worse they get. Triss, book 15, also was awful. I personally think Jacques should stop the series, even though they are excellent books.

I am currently enrolled in this class, and thought I had an interest in history untill I started struggling through each monotonous chapter.This book effectively serves to remove any interest and/or enjoyment from learning history. What especially bothers me is, this book starts out at chapter 14 (with the first 13 chapters comprising volume 1), and quite often, especially in the first few chapters, asks you to reference, for example, chapter 6, or some other chapter not even included in this textbook. My class (thankfully) said nothing in the syllabus or course materials requiring the purchase of the first book. However, how am i supposed to reference something i dont even own, and have no intention (or money) to purchase? I kept feeling more and more ripped off and cheated with each volume one reference that was made."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mystic (scientist?)","review":"I have always wanted an interesting teacher that electrifies the science area. I despised the traditional old books that said nothing about the subject and added only dryness, just dryness. So, I looked at Feynman as a good excuse and tried it, why not? It's a very, very primitive basic review on the subject. Feynman segways more than he teaches, he drums more than he teaches. Saying very little of substance. More like a casual hang-out that has coffee and friends and drumming, sadly, I'm not a fan of any of that.

I bought these crowns because I was specifically looking for two year old crowns of the Jersey Supreme variety. Sadly, these crowns seem rather spindly, and are probably only one year old crowns, and small ones at that. Also, the order arrived in four days, but the crowns seemed to be unceremoniously stuffed in a plain paper bag, then boxed up in a USPS box. I'm hoping they all survive, because there was no moisture retaining material and the roots were dry when I received them. It will take some time before I know how well these crowns turn out, and unfortunately the crown size means I'll have to wait an additional year. Maybe I'll come back and revise my review if they turn out spectacularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the first time....","review":"This is not the last Killers CD....It's better.

Yes, weve heard the popular songs on radio...but I'm interested in the lost treasures not picked up on the radio. My cd arrived slightly cracked, my bottle of mint Teisseire was in worse condition.

A fun ride through Sam's Town ... all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I wasn't expecting another version of Hot Fuss but certainly not what I heard when I put the Cd in. I thought okay, give it a few more listens but I found myself asking does this end? It sounds like Brandon Flowers was trying for new sound but it's sounds more like a whine to me than anything else.The change ups are terrible and the songs down right depressing.If you're a fan of Hot Fuss and want something anything even remotely close to that, this isn't the Cd for you. The song, \\"When you were young\\" is so so at best and even with that, I think I'm being too kind.I was so looking forward to this new Cd but it's going back in the cd case and joining the rest of the Bands that I had so much hope to continue to get better with their next cd but failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the haters...this album is good!","review":"So it's not another Hot Fuss...ok everyone get over it. Let's quit comparing the album and judge it for what it really is - a pretty good second effort. I would have to agree with the many other reviews that say you must to listen to it more than once. I wasn't sure about it myself when I first played it but it has really grown on me and continues to get better, as I listen to it more. It has a lot of catchy tunes and a lot of what we came to love the Killers for; which is a different sound, a throwback to the 80s, Flower's unique style, etc. For all of you who are on the fence about buying it, just do it - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait!","review":"Wow! What a terrific follow-up to Hot Fuss! The strength of both albums is that every song is different and has their unique hooks. Hot Fuss was a fusion of several different 80's genres, but still came out sounding fresh. Likewise for Sam's Town(a plug for an off the strip casino where they first got gigs), a bit more guitar and different genres thrown in, with the usual synthesizers and Brandon Flowers great lyrics thrown in too. Sadly, Rolling Stone magazine did a hatchet job on the album,...2 stars???? Please!! That's why you should get your reviews from Spin and other music mags, that don't knuckle under the corporate dime! Easily one of the most entertaining CDs of the year!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song better than the next","review":"On first listen of 'Sam's Town', I didn't much like it and bought the album thinking it was going to be a twin to 'Hot Fuss'. However, with every listen, this album just improved. 'Sam's Town' is more polished than The Killers freshman album and the songwriting is fantastic, not repetitive like some songs from 'Hot Fuss'. Although 'Hot Fuss' will always be one of my favorites, 'Sam's Town' has won my heart. It has more of a rock sound than 'Hot Fuss' ever could and the influence of U2 and Bruce Springsteen are apparent. This album probably will be looked back upon as one of the great albums of the last 20 years. Yes, I said it. 4+++ stars for this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Sam's Town","review":"All the songs on the album, except for When You Were Young, are a drag. It sounds like the songs were written on the fly. What happened to the melodies and retro synth sounds from Hot Fuss?! (I really liked that album.) I am not sure what direction The Killers were/are headed---I think they got lost in Sam's Town. To answer \\"we hope you enjoyed your stay\\" in track 12.... Not really. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"one good song","review":"I am a big Killers fan and found this to me a most dissapointing album.

My hopes are now dashed. The only elaboration I can offer is that it's intensely boring and the lead singer's voice is somehow far more irritating on this album than it was on hot fuss.In the interest of full disclosure, I probably wouldn't have bothered to write this review if it weren't for their inane comments about green day's \\"american idiot.\\" I had already concluded this new album is bad before then, but probably would have kept it to myself. I award it two stars instead of one because I feel guilty about the conflict of interest.[after giving it one more try, i came back to try to take back the second star (but amazon won't let me). this album is just too awful for words. i guess if you like/can stand it, more power to you.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"It's hard to even describe just how disappointed I am in this CD. I honestly wish I could give it no stars. There are tons of new CDs out this fall and this is the one that I had been anticipating the most. It's been the most disappointing of the lot. The style of the CD is nothing like Hot Fuss, and I have no problem letting my favorite bands try new things so they can grow in different directions, but this is too different for me. Entetainment Weekly gave it a C, so did Rolling Stone. It's more reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen than the up-tempo, danceable hits I've come to expect from this band. Maudlin is an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary","review":"I bought this album the day it came out, and is still being played today.

I don't think you can go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad But True.","review":"Let me start out by saying im not the type to give negative reviews because i hate reading the typical slamming of new cds which is all to common on here.However since Hot Fuss was such a classic' my expectations were pretty high.With that being said this cd is just plain awful.Other than the Lead off Single which took quite a few listens i really dont hear another single on this cd.Its just missing great songs and Brandon's vocals are pretty poor on this release.Play Hot Fuss again and listen to all the Killer...Pardon the Pun.. Songs on that cd.Where on Sam's Town are the great songs like.SOMEBODY TOLD ME... MR BRIGHTSIDE ALL THE THINGS IVE DONE and many many more.I just dont understand the road they have gone down.As most of the Mag reviews i have read confirm' this cd is just a big mess.As for his claim its the best cd in the past 20 years.. Its not even the best cd out this week.I really wanted to like this cd but im afraid after 5 plays i cannot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"Honestly, the reason why I even checked out The Killers was because I heard they are from Vegas, and there aren't that many decent bands from my home state. Then I saw the video for \\"Bones\\" on MTV and loved the song, went to I-tunes and sampled the rest of Sam's Town's songs, and got the cd. It's my favorite cd since Eminem's \\"The Eminem Show\\" (yes, I have very weird musical tastes). I grew up on 80's new wave and rock, and The Killers remind me of a time when music was about something other than bling or how miserable the world is. And I can actually listen to the whole cd with my 10 year old niece in the car, since there is no foul language or graphic lyrics about drugs and sex... maybe I'm getting old but it's a refreshing change. All in all, it's fun, catchy, straight-up rock-n-roll. I'm very proud of my home-state representation in current pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than HOTT FUSS","review":"This is their best production yet...READ MY MINE, WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, BONES, are just a few of the great songs on this CD.

Fewer songs stick out individually to me, but the album as a whole flows better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huston, we have a major songwriting problem...","review":"I was a huge fan of the Killers' first disc, HOT FUSS. It has a good vibe to it, and a new brand of New Wave. However, I was MAJOR dissapointed with the new disc Sam's Town. Instead of original songwriting, this album sounds like they took the song \\"Smile like you mean it\\" and decided to make an entire album out of it. There are only two listenable songs on the disc, \\"Bones\\" and the last song. Otherwise, AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good . . . .","review":"I really liked Hot Fuss. I have no idea what happened to the Killers from the time they released Hot Fuss until now but they need to fire who ever is advising them on their career. There are at most two stand out songs on this album and the rest are very disappointing (even the \\"standouts\\" are disappointing). I do hear the Bruce Springsteen and U2 influences. But the Killers will never EVER make an album as good as U2's best (arguably Achtung Baby). And I agree with one of the other posters when he/she said they didn't even make the best album released on the same day . . . that was The Information by Beck (if you haven't already gotten it, put down this horrendous album and go get it now)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sucks!!!!!","review":"My brother bought this album because he liked the song \\"When You Were Young\\" and wanted to see what else the killer's had to offer.

If this was a new band just coming out with their debut album it would sell about 20-30 copies and it would be bought by family members and close friends. Seriously...that's how bad this album is. I'm not saying this because I have something against the Killers, their first album is amazing. I have absolutely no idea what happened. Brandon Flowers' ego got completely out of control and they have made one of the most pompous, overblown, utterly ridiculous albums in the history of rock music. I really have no idea how anyone in the world can give this album 4 stars, there isn't a single good song on the entire album. The songs are terrible, the vocals are nasally and messy, the lyrics are stupid and unoriginal, and the arrangements are cheesy. Please don't waste your time or money on this album. Sorry Killers fans, I'm just as disappointed as you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wants glam Springsteen? Refund please...","review":"I would much rather hear this band do a great Smith's/Psych Furs impression (as on Hot Fuss) than a godawful one of Springsteen/U2. Unfortunately, Sam's town is the later. The Killers are no longer a guilty pleasure. The sophomore jinx lives...and the only listeners giving their latest disc a decent review are those who don't want to admit that they just blew $15. Denial is a powerful thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened? Who is this band?","review":"What happened to the band that recorded \\"Hot Fuss\\"? What happened to the electro-dance charged, hi-energy rock-poppy group that recorded \\"Somebody told me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\"? I remember in the press this band was hailed as the best British rock band to come from America. This is definitely not the same band. This group sounds like the E-Street band fronted by Robert Smith. If you liked their last album, pass on this one. If you dig more \\"adult-contempory\\" stuff, this may be right up your alley. Not the worst album I've ever heard, but thank god for P2P (limewire/Kazaa/Bittorrent) else I may have been sukered into buying this one. If you like the electro-dance punk sound go check out a band called \\"The Faint\\". They'll pick up where this once-great band left off.As a side note, Mr. Flowers has a fantastic voice on the last album.. Theres some real studio magic going on there.. I saw them live and that guy sounds terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Killers need to go back to Vegas","review":"I had to listen to this one several times before making up my mind. The Killers have shown a new face, which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't connect with their old face at all. In Hot Fuss, the songs were great and the melodies easy to pick out and sing along with. In Sam's Town, Flowers can't seem to find his own melody. His pitches are all over the map and they don't seem to blend with what the rest of the band is doing. It is a unique style that might be okay for one or two tracks, but a whole CD? The Killers have indeed lost their 'Killers' edge, and I hope it comes back for round three. Definitely preview it before you buy it, or you'll be upset at throwing away 15 bucks. I'm just glad I got away only paying $10. Whew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Dissapointing","review":"After arguing with my friends endlessly and listening to the album about 10 times...i realize that its not as bad as I thought it was. While not completely horrible...its just not the Killers. The music lacks energy and the styling of the last album. Not worth the buy, unless you can pick it up for less that $10. I'm completely dissapointed in them.

The Killers are poster children for a less than stellar sophomore album. While I wasn't expecting \\"Hot Fuss v. 2.0\\", I was expecting the same level of awesome, if you will. Unlike Hot Fuss which was refreshing and memorable, this is rather dull and forgettable. One word that keeps coming mind to describe this album is \\"themed\\". All the tracks seem to related somehow; they all sound the same. They seem to just blend together. It's so boring that with as many times as I've listened to it, none of the songs really stick out to me. I'm honestly surprised I can even sing along to any of the songs. You're much better off just sticking with \\"Hot Fuss\\" and \\"Sawdust\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up album","review":"I dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to The Killers new sound and look, I for one love it! By the 3rd time i heard the album, i knew there was no way i'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time, just like Hot Fuss. The songs are great, the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak effort","review":"The only two good tracks on this record are the radio hit \\"When You Were Young\\" and \\"Uncle Jonny.\\" Other than that, I think the album was a pretty weak effort.

Hot Fuss is a great album, and I was expecting the same out of Sam's Town. I have to say I'm terribly disappointed..... I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about. I find this album annoying, and thats mostly due to the voclas. Apparently, someone thought it was a good idea for Flowers to kick it up an octave or five, as he spends most of Sam's Town in a shaky, blood-curdling falsetto that makes me want to gouge my own eyes out with rusty utensils. They also seem to have dropped whatever vocal effect they had on Flowers in Hot Fuss, which is far from an improvement, given his choice of vocal style in this album. Every warble and break is crystal clear. And the \\"harmonies\\" are questionable at best (For Reasons Unknown comes to mind). What happened to the good old Smile-Like-You-Mean-It Killers? Their sound has changed completely...... and not for the better. I only hope the third time's a charm for these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down The Drain","review":"Killers were to save the world, until this bomb dropped. Great first 2 songs, only for this album to dissolve into a pukey panic attack. Flat production, overly wordy nervous singer dooms \\"Sams Town\\" into the used bin. Surprisingly utterly forgettable, some tracks deserving the skip button. Higher expectations drive this down to 2 stars maybe less. Unfortunate, we must look for new saviors"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment of the year","review":"The anticipation for this album was nothing more than just wasted energy. Although the reasons to hate Sam's Town are too numerous to mention, the primary reasons include horrible lyrics and a train wreck of sounds on par with that of a high school age DJ.My first two trips through Sam's Town had me cringing in embarrassment for Brandon and his crew, however, When You Were Young is pretty good - buy the single and hold on to the memories of Hot Fuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Dull, Dull","review":"I was relatively optimistic about this album but after suffering through 4 listens it has taken up permanent residence in my garbage can. The space in my house is too valuable to devote to this drivel. The first two tracks (not considering the pretentious interlude officially deemed as track two) are decent, but the rest of the album is bloody horrible. I had to put in Hot Fuss again and listen to \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" a couple of times just to convince me that this was the same band. The awful EP that they include with it isn't worth [...] at a garage sale. Self-important, glorified crap. Oh yeah, the album title is completely retarded as well. Say goodbye to a band that once had a lot of promise. An utter waste of [...] that I wished I could recoup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Follow-up to Hot Fuss","review":"I saw the Killers a couple of years ago in Tampa in what I still think is one of the best shows I've ever seen. To this day I'm still surprised, because I really wasn't expecting anything fantastic. Now it's two years later and the band's new album Sam's Town is finally out. Like the debut Sam's Town is a front loaded album. All the immediately accessible songs are on the first half of the album and things fade out after Uncle Johnny. The Enterlude and Exitlude are basically one track opening and closing the album. My favorite track is the irresistible \\"For Reasons Unknown.\\" It will likely be the biggest hit of the album. The weakest track is \\"Bones,\\" I just can't get into this song. Overall it's a satisfying follow up to Hot Fuss. This tour should be amazing with all the good tracks available from both albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam's Town","review":"Sam's TownI loved the previous album but this one was disappointing; a self-indulgent sophomoric snooze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"This album sounds very 80ish which I love.I saw them live and believe me when I say all their music is played exactly like it is on the album.Brandon Flowers is a incredible musician playing piano guitar,he could probably play a harp if you gave him one.There is so much energy and passion in his voice like on the song Bling(Confession of a King)He says \\"higher and higher\\" and you just want to jump up and start dancing.It took me a while to really feel this album.For any killers fan this album should live up to your expectations!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"In the begining I didn't like this album, but after listening to it it grew on me. It is so different from the Killers first album that it takes a little getting used to it. Once your beyond their first album you'll start to realize what a great album it is. It does sound a lot like Bruce Springsteen though."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's not hot fuss but.....","review":"it is far better than any music out there, this band set a very high standard w/ \\"hot fuss\\", and now this album although not as great, it is very solid, the first 3 songs, excluding enterlude are classics especially \\"bling\\", this is the killers at their best, the song is simply genius, the rest of the album is very good and it is a classic, this band is as original as they come"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Killers are Dead","review":"Trust me.... I was really pulling for Brandon Flowers to rock this album as he did the first, but I was sadly disappointed. There are a couple of reasons for this. 1- His voice is all over the place. No matter how good of a voice you have, if it is all over the place, and erratic, it still just sounds like noise. 2- The songs just plain suck. I have listened to this album all the way through at least 5 times, and I'm just not seeing it. I don't know how someone could possibly compare this album to the first. The quality, sound and overall experience are not even close to that of Hot Fuss. For everyone contemplating purchasing this album, keep your money in your pocket, and wait to see what comes next. Hopefully you have better luck next time boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing...","review":"After the dust has settled from the hype of Sam's Town's innitial release, it is unfortunately dissapointing. After such a brilliant debut cd, the killers appear to hit a sophmore slump. The first single When You Were Young sounds like reminance of Hot Fuss and similiar to Mr. Brightside. Definitely the stand out track on the album, Bones and Bling are decent songs but the depth drops off after that. Not only are the riffs and rythems dismal, the vocals and lyrics are not up to par to Hot Fuss. It feels as though they rushed this album by trying to ride the wave of their debut. The Killers need to put some more time into their next album, rather than produce such dribble every two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sam's Town\\" Stinks","review":"This record is a hopelessly flawed sophmore effort. It starts out reasonably well with \\"Sam's Town\\", an OK rock number. \\"When You We're Young\\" is the only real single and the album's sole bright spot. Beyond that, it's a waste of plastic. They've even gone to the point of remixing tracks like \\"Read My Mind\\" into synth-dance numbers to make them more palatable to radio. Probably what they should have done in the first place. Synths, sizzling guitars, screaming vocals and the posh disco polish from \\"Hot Fuss\\" have been replaced by banal lyrics, over-production, and Brandon Flowers' overdone tremolo vocal style. He's well on his way to becoming the Dennis DeYoung (Styx) of his generation, a shameless ham with no clue how bad he is. Fix it boys, and soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is nothing but self-indulgent emptiness","review":"I wish I had read more about it before I went out and bought this. Other than the first single \\"When You Were Young\\" the album is very thin on likeable songs. The lyrics are embarassingly cheesy, particularly on \\"Bling (Confessions of a King)\\". I understand that bands have to switch styles and try something different, but this attempt at originality results in a stale, forced, unimaginative disaster of an album.And after reading that the lead singer said this album is better than \\"OK Computer\\" I seriously think he is as delusional as he is bankrupt of talent.Buy and enjoy \\"Hot Fuss\\" but skip this album. It's simply garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam's Town","review":"I find it quite unfortunate that with every release, The Killers sound worse and worse. This was a pretty big letdown after their highly successful debut, Hot Fuss. I've never really been a huge Killers fan, but I figured I'd give this album a listen after enjoying most of their first one. It was evident from the first five seconds that they'd over do it with the keyboards. For me, keyboards are definately hit-or-miss, and The Killers missed on their sophomore album. Aside from the album being drenched in unnecessary keyboards, it wasn't to incredibly awful. After a few listens, most of the tracks weren't half bad, and I started to focus on the positives. I liked that the album recieved less mainstream attention than their debut and that the album only included one \\"Mr. Brightside\\" that was constantly on the radio and everywhere else. Also, I've always really like Brandon Flowers' voice. It's incredibly unique and in a strange way, very soothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sophomore Album","review":"It is quite undeniable that these guys deserve all the raves they are getting. When I listened to this album, I heard shades of Supertramp, Queen and the Who. Don't ask me why, I probably could have gone on with other examples of what I heard but succinctly put this is an excellent album every song flowed seamlessly into the other. This CD should really be made into some type of epic video because the songs tell a story. It conjured up many images in my head. Brandon Flowers has an unique voice and the band is tight. Definitely worth the ride into Sam's Town."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO HOT FUSS","review":"Wait, before you give into all these fake 5 star reviews. I bought this album the day it came out, got home, listened to it and it is NO hot fuss. In fact the their sound has totally changed, it is really disappointing. I feel ripped off. Listen to the album before you waste your money. I'm just looking out for the other fans. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Sam's Town!","review":"Welcome to Sam's Town! To me this album plays a lot like a film or even a Broadway show. It is such an imaginative way to make a album and you have to give this band credit for that. They took a chance and it worked out. The album is like a view into the world of the people living in Vegas not the nightlife like Hot Fuss. Now don't get me wrong Hot Fuss is just amazing. Sam's Town is one of those albums that has to grow a bit on you before you can compare. And its just addictive in that way. You just want to keep on listening to the songs and that's what makes it amazing. In the long run this is a great album to own, and if you liked Hot Fuss I don't see why you wont like this. 5 stars all the way! Welcome to Sam's Town everyone hope you enjoy your stay!Key Tracks:\\"Bling (Confessions of a King)\\"\\"When you where Young\\"\\"Uncle Jonny\\"\\"Bones\\"\\"This River Is Wild\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What the Heck!","review":"I'm not sure why so many people seem to hate or be disappointed in this album.

I read it very fastly and I thought it amazing. Not so good as The Mists of Avalon, but still a great doing of Mrs. Bradley. I gladly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the below review","review":"Please ignore the previous review.It may not be the Authors best work, but was written BY the Author in 1987."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read Mists of Avalon","review":"Having enjoyed Mists of Avalon as a girl and then actually teaching it, it is easy to see that I am a big fan of the Mists of Avalon. I have also read other Bradley books, therefore I knew what to expect when I read this novel. Having read this novel right after Margaret George's Helen of Troy: A Novel, I was sadly disappointed. I must agree with other reviewers in that this particular novel is fiercely similar to Mists of Avalon, specifically in premise and characters, i.e. a young maiden of royal blood is placed with an aunt who schools her in the ways of earth and the goddess. She falls in love but that cannot be. She has a brother that is known to her but not to him until much later. The similarities just got to be too much for me and that simply ruined the book for me. As I stated before, in George's \\"Helen of Troy,\\" Kassandra is a very minor character, but I just felt more involved in that novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't match up to others by this author.","review":"Having read all of Marion Zimmer Bradley books, I have learned to love her style of writing. However, I felt that this book fell short. I think the only reason I made it through the whole book was because it was by this author and I kept expecting the ending to make up for the rest of it. This did not happen and the ending was a let down. I kept wondering, what is the point of this story? There was much rambling on about different gods which took away from the characters. Everything the main charcter, Kassandra, set out to do was in vain. I felt very disappointed when finished with this book. While I have treasured and even re-read previous Bradley books in the past, I will not open this one again. I do recommend The Mists of Avalon or The Priestess of Avalon instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Bradley's 'Firebrand'","review":"MZB presents a lively retelling of the Trojan cycle through the eyes of one of its lesser characters--Cassandra. Bradley freely fills the unknown eras of Cassandra's life with episodes of Amazon battles and feminine power. It was fun to see Bradley playing with tradition to recreate Cassandra, although I found it odd that she tries to justify her changes at the end of the book. These were some fast-paced 600 pages, although 400 would certainly have been sufficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Firebrand","review":"This book was amazing. I miss Marion Zimmer Bradley books. She is one of my favs! I thought I read everything she wrote, then I saw this on Amazon and I had to have it. If you like her books you will love this one. Kassandra is such a strong women."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mists of Avalon is still my favorite","review":"I definitely, definitely like this book, no question about it. It's well-written, meticulously looked into by Marion Zimmer Bradley to give it an authentic feel, and an easy read.But if, like me, you're looking for lots of magic, then Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon will probably be a bit better suited to your taste. (It also portrayed more three-dimensional characters, in my opinion.)The Firebrand has more of a historical feel in the way it's told as compared to the Otherworldliness of Mists. But it's certainly good, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"Mists of Avalon is one of my favorite books and I waited a while before I treated myself to Firebrand. Unfortunately it does not compare and was very disappointing. The storytelling is reasonably well done but the characters are one dimensional and over-used stereotypes. I also agree with other reviews that the portrayl, more like idealization, of women throughout the book is based on 20th century feminist ideals and further weakens the impact of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Trojan Epic","review":"Fans of Bradley's masterwork, THE MISTS OF AVALON, will find little to recommend this retelling of another famous legend. FIREBRAND tells the story of the Trojan war from the viewpoint of Kassandra the shunned prophetess, who is nothing like the deep and resonant characters of King Arthur's realm. Bradley's interpretations of some of the supernatural events of the tale (either more divine or more prosaic than in the legend) are interesting, but hardly worth reading the whole long, at times very boring, tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cease the madness","review":"Marion Zimmer Bradley was a great author - when she lived. Now, however, 3 1/2 years after her funeral, her \\"estate\\" continues to publish \\"new works\\" with the real author barely identified. Please stop writing about the woman as if she just wrote what is really only as mediocre book. Might as well have \\"her\\" and \\"Frank Herbert\\" collaborate with all the fidelity shown to her works while she lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new and improved Troy","review":"I really enjoyed this book because, true to the author's style, it followed the strong female character. But not only that, the vivid imagery brought these well-known characters to life -- with different, far more detailed aspects, and I enjoyed adding these facets to characters I already knew from the Iliad. About 3/4 into the book, I realized that several of the characters are remniscent of Bradley's Mists of Avalon characters. Kassandra is in some ways very like Morgaine, Hecuba like Igraine, Penthesilea like Viviane. This, for me, wasn't at all a drawback to the story. If anything, it made me more comfortable with the characters. While not quite as good as Mists of Avalon, it remains by itself a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryonny on 'The Firebrand'","review":"Having read numerous books on the fall of Troy and The Mists Of Avalon and the other Avalon books, I was overjoyed when I found this book. It was rich, enthralling rendition of ancient Troy, although it was a bit heavy on the feminist themes. I read it over and over again, as my battered copy will testify. I would strongly recommend this beautifully woven novel to most readers. Marion Zimmer Jones is an inspiring author whose books I will always enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great retelling of the Trojan War","review":"This was the first MZB book I ever read, and it is still one of my favorites. With better characterization than most of her works, I found myself empathizing with Kassandra and others. It also wasn't as slow as The Mists of Avalon, and since I've read Virgil's Aeneid, which includes the Fall of Troy, it was interesting to see how close she came to the original text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good.","review":"Item looks good.

Maybe it's the simple fact, he tells it the way it is.I just love his work, he and maybe Uncle Cracker are the ONLY 2 Rappers' I'll listen to.In my true opinion, \\"Nothing beats the original\\"!!Nice work, keep 'em comin'!! Lea Ann"},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad about the lyrics","review":"I like Kid Rock, but his music has terrible language. Songs like \\"Only God Knows Why and Picture are my two favorite songs with good lyrics and I personnally would like to hear more of these songs. I am a country bumpkin if ya know what I mean.Otherwise best wishes in the music industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poseur","review":"Kid \\"Rock\\" is to rock-and-roll what Twinkies are to gourmet cooking. He's a poseur and a pretender, who tries to mimick the attitude and style of those who went before him -- Bob Seeger, Rolling Stones -- while hoping that no one will notice that he has none of their talent. Why listen to a pale imitation when the music of the true greats is still available?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ROCK IS BACK!!!!","review":"I bought this album yesterday and have to say that I am really impressed with Kid Rocks 2nd CD \\"Cocky.\\" Not only is it an all around better album than his 1st CD, but it also has better song writing and just flows smoother than the 1st CD. This CD def has a southern rock feel to it, more so than anything he has ever put out, but he still manages to sound all original in only a way Kid Rock could. All in all a really good album...if you liked the 1st album buy I highly suggest you give this one a listen."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],O={key:0},x={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-2af5023d"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/12.md","filePath":"guide/12.md"}'),R={name:"guide/12.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
