I found the plot to be shallow and every charachter a stereotype. What does the long digression into \\"blues history and theory\\" have to do with the plot? Why do the antagonists wait for a civil war reanactment to have their battle, why not just have a shoot-out in the bar? The main character, Dennis, is strangely passive and loved by all, for no apparent reason.Southernors are dumb, blacks are hip and mexicans street smart.Read some of Leonard's early works not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Deep South","review":"Civil war re-enactments are still as popular as ever especially in the south, which is a major theme in Leonard's novel. Greed and power come into play and the bullets of the re-enactment become real and people become dead.Diving from an eighty foot platform into a nine foot deep pool, dare devil, Dennis Lenahan witnesses one of the Dixieland mob killings and finds himself in the middle of a power struggle. This was a unique approach to an old theme with an authentic flavor of the deep south. Enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"good characters","review":"As usual, Leonard comes through with a colorful cast of characters and a host of double crosses.

Thumb's up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Leonard characters","review":"The array of tasty characters Elmore Leonard creates in book after book is truly astounding, and he outdoes himself in TISHOMINGO BLUES. The use of a stunt diver, Civil War reenactors, and Dixie Mafiosi keeps the twists coming. My only criticism is the meandering plot. I've heard that his method of writing is to create the characters and let them loose to see how they interact, but this time I think they got away from him a bit. The unfolding of the story isn't as crisp as it is in most of his other books, but don't let that stop you from reading TISHOMINGO. Even lesser Leonard is a whole lot better than most other writers' best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointing Leonard Novel","review":"Humorous mysteries and fantasies can provide wonderful laugh-aloud reading, and I especially like the ones with a serious undertone (Elizabeth Peters' \\"Amelia Peabody\\" adventures, Terry Pratchett's Discworld, and so on). I keep hearing that Elmore Leonard writes them, but he doesn't. This novel hasn't a single saving grace. I often donate my used mysteries to church for resale--but not this one. If you enjoy a cast of entirely conscienceless, immoral characters, a stultifying plot, and an easy-to-spot solution, be my guest. But if you enjoy a good mystery (and there are plenty of good ones out there), you shouldn't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring.","review":"Yawn. Snore.

If this writer is good at anything to do with writing then it must be in creating believable and sympathetic characters.But the story was utter boring rubbish, with a long and tedious build up to a pathetic little shoot out.

Why they didn't just take a gun to the offending parties, I can't say. It would have saved at least 100 pages. About half way through I lost track of who was doing what to whom.

Another truly great novel from Elmore Leonard. The author takes an unusual assortment of people and collects them into a fast reading, attention holding tale of love, betrayal, murder and raw nerve. The author seems to effortlessly have captured the dialect and provincial patterns of speech for each character giving the story an authentic flavor and a touch of grittiness that brings the novel into a life of it's own. Elmore Leonard is a terrific artist of the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the Plunge","review":"This is a wild ride! Elmore Leonard introduces some of the quirkiest characters that you'll ever come across. The book would have earned a fifth star from me if he would have delved even more into the backgrounds of these crazy folks. A traveling high dive artist gets hooked up with a yankee con man in the South and lands smack dab in the middle of a Civil War reenactment that pits a northern godfather wannabe against the Dixie Mafia.

I decided recently to get the cd version so I could experience the story in my car one more time. The story is great - 5+ stars, however the narrator on the multi cd set leaves something to be desired. He certainly can read well, and had good pacing, except, he does a bunch of imitations! Instead of creating unique characters he does Bernie Mac, Billy Bob Thorton, and more - even though those voices do not fit the characters being talked about. Like the ultimate fantasy castint by the reader. Sure, he does a good Bernie Mac, but c'mon it doesn't lend itself to the character and just because a Casino guy is named Billy - does that mean you have to make him speak in a bad \\"Sling Blade\\" parody.

If it's not talking about her career and depression over losing her job -- it's about her taking drugs with her roommater. There is a whole section on law, her education, and all the million jobs she has every had. The book is also not very funny...and definitely not cutesy. Not the fun \\"chick lit\\" I had expected this book to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can one movie be????","review":"I cannot say enough about how awful this movie was. Nothing like the original. The acting was bad, the special effects were obviously computer generated and did not look real at all, I cared about no one on the ship and in fact hoped that they all would drown. Awful, awful waste of rental money. If you want to see Poseidon then please see the original which has a great cast, realistic wreckage, and people you can care for and hope that they live."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoyed the original Poseidon Adventure...","review":"You may want to skip this version. Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Roddy MacDowell, the recently departed Red Buttons and the incredible Gene Hackman made the original disaster film memorable, fun and exciting. Special effects have come a long way since then but I was very disappointed with the new film. I adore Richard Dreyfuss but I thought his skills were wasted in this film. The originial story line was much more exciting and I remember being on the edge of my seat watching it in the theater.I wasn't able to see the latest in a theater and I'll admit that may have jaded my opinion some. It's definitely the kind of movie best viewed on the big screen. Whether you enjoyed this film or not, I'd still suggest that you rent the original. It's a classic in the disaster genre of that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Posiden","review":"I love this new version, unlike the other new version, this one sticks to the original script, not a terrorist plot. Great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Effects Capsize a Laughably Simple Plot","review":"As you might expect, a blockbuster disaster movie usually lives or dies by the quality of its special effects. \\"Poseidon,\\" perhaps embracing this sensibility, storms right out of the gates with its money shot, a flyby tour of the doomed ship's exterior from all angles that might be half as impressive as it sounds. The CG looks like a student reel, amateurish and fake with goofy footage of soon-to-be hero Josh Lucas jogging the upper decks awkwardly crammed in. It's a downhill slide from there as a thin plot yields to the power of impressive post-production effects to bail it out, and the cavalry never manages to arrive. A surprisingly star-studded cast struggles with one dimensional characters, banal \\"here's what I'm looking at\\" dialog and plot twists so by-the-book I was able to accurately predict each on-screen death. It's a bland, generic, cash-in of a remake that isn't even afforded the buoy of good eye candy. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"swallow","review":"The expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today's technology.Alas- the movie was disappointing. The characters were not developed and the were quite flat. The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop. The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development.Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period.It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't bring myself to say more","review":"I love a good action movie. Love them. So what weent wrong? Well, the effects were there, but it all seemed so detached. We may have seen most of the action sequences you can do on a ship previously, or we may not. Bottom line is this: if you are going to have an action sequence, make it exciting. Watching the DVD of this, I wasn't able to be drawn in sufficiently to keep me from checking my email. At less than 100 minutes in length.A boring action movie is just plain wrong, and that's what Poseidon is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, Just Don't Expect That Song The Morning After Playing Anywhere In The Background","review":"I didn't mind this modern take on The Poseidon Adventure, I found it quite an entertaining film that although really adds nothing new except for jazzier special effects, it does entertain none the less, Josh Lucas is fun to watch at heroics too.Give this film a float, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good remake","review":"Poseidon is a very good remake of the early 70s Poseidon Adventure. When I viewed the film, it helped to have recently seen a program on the History Channel about rogue waves. The acting, action, and special effects are all superlative.My favorite line from the movie: \\"everyone stay calm.\\" Yeah, right. The movie is shorter than the original. There are 10 minutes of overkill ending credits making the actual film about 90 minutes. It is a bit more frantic than the original. Some of the computer animation (especially the opening ship scene) still does not look as good as good old fashioned models. But, overall, I enjoyed the film.Richard Dreyfuss again gives us another reason to stay off the water, even when he finally got a bigger boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOUR STARS FOR WHAT IT SETS OUT TO DO","review":"This energetic, fast paced remake does not waste any time with tedious character development. It cuts to the action and never lets up.Here's state of the art filmmakling by a pro director who know exactly what he's doing. Great sets and claustrophobic sequences with flooding and fire and falling objects look real.Yes, it's all over the top stuff but this is what popcorn movies are all about. I liked this one a lot better than the ridiculous M:I:III. No one going into this movie should be surprised at the premise or plot, that's not the point. The idea is seeing a high tech remake of something with which we are already familiar. And on that basis, this movie delivers. This is not an art film. So the bashing by other reviewers is uncalled for."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's bored!!!","review":"I SAW THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS BORED. I THOUGHT IT WAS MAGNIFICENT BUT IT'S NOT.

Solid performances by Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas are wasted with a poor supporting cast and little to no suspense. The special effects are good, but the script is so weak that it can't save this movie. You are much better served watching the original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Original but I Liked It Anyway","review":"Okay. I LIKED Poseidon. No, it does not come near to the excitement of the original, but if the original had never been made, this would have seemed like a perfectly good movie. I liked the way the characters worked together, with sometimes one character taking the lead and sometimes another character taking the lead. it was a pleasant change from the pissing contests that so often occur in these disaster flicks. Although there were undercurrents of tension between Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas, those pretty much disappear when the action hits. And yes, Russell's overprotectiveness of his daughter, Emmy Rossum, does get to be a little annoying, but when all is said and done, it really doesn't matter. If anything, I think the movie could stand to have been a bit longer, but I enjoyed it as it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought they did a great job remaking this!!","review":"I think they did a great job remaking this movie and that because of the new CG's used in the film it was much more realistic than the original. It's definitely a movie that I'll watch again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least Kurt still has Goldie","review":"This is a great flick for people who are irritated by sub-plots because there are none. There is nothing resembling reality found anywhere in this movie, so it makes for excellent escapism, which we all need now and then. Since all the characters stay together, it is easy to follow along, so you can turn your brain off, it won't be needed. Since it's all about the ship, acting wasn't necessary. You can bet that movies like this toll the bell for the careers of Russell and Dreyfus. I felt pity for them as actors, and hope they can rebound. The movie is shorter than most, so there will be minimum impact on your life. You will remember nothing about it soon after exposure."},{"rating":"1","title":"They tried, but...","review":"it just didn't live up to the original made in 1972. The special effects were better, but you had no real feel for the characters. They were one-dimensional and quite predictable.In the original, each character had a 'sub-plot' that added to the richness and enjoyment of the movie. In this one, you just get the special effects and not much else.Some things are better left alone.

Where to begin. The perfectly even, precision like blade of a slow-moving rogue wave, the large square rapidly-filling-with-water rooms, the intense human drama? Man! This is bad ...really bad.I appreciate the attempt at updating the action, but too much CGI and it looks like an overblown video game to me. We get, like 4 or 5 minutes of exposition to get to know the charicatures, oops characters, before the big perfectly even ...Anywho - who cares about these people? All the girls look alike - especially under water. All the guys have that tortured fart-smell face. Really this is a stinker.The orginal may be no state of the art production - but compared to this it's The Godfather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly worth a viewing","review":"With less plot than a video game, and not much acting to be had, this movie's only saving grace are the special effects, but even those wouldn't warrant a second viewing. Yawn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...wakes in the wave...","review":"sadly, there is nothing worth saving from this flick...having seen the original one in the theatres years ago, i still remember how breath-taking it was to traverse thru the bowels of the ship with gene hackman and ernest borgnine...but, then again, they were awake thru the whole picture...i must stress that i love kurt russell and richard dreyfuss...they are two of my all-time favorites, and yet, they seem to be sleep-walking through this whole thing...but i can't blame them...if they actually had a script to involve them, maybe it would have involved us more as well...i understand that today's generation has a 'limited attention span', and, unless you blow up something every 30 seconds, they get bored and go home...but, a film like this depends on character development, and without that, you get something like this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Purchase","review":"I'm a traditionalist and a purist so I liked the original better. But this movie is worth the purchase and the viewing time. I expected a rehash of the \\"Poseidon Adventure\\", but while the premise is the same, this is a different adventure story. So as far as remakes goes, this is quite original, entertaining and will keep you on the edge of your seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poseidon","review":"Great movie! Specail effects were great.

This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent.

I feel so bad, as to how bad, that i don't want to say any more bad things about this film. It's just poor. Get the original and rent it. Check out the actors of yesterday against these want-to-be's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poseidon Conjecture","review":"It is difficult to believe that such copious amounts of money and state-of-the-art technology could produce a film even more boring and flatulent than the original. Somehow Wolfgang Petersen has managed. This movie isn't just incompentently directed, poorly acted, and deadly dull. It is badly written, stupid, and ridiculous.

You will have rid the world of a minor evil and expunged 98 minutes of unmitigated crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piss poor.","review":"No amount of special effects or star power could save this disaster of a movie and it's horrifically underdeveloped characters. Drowning would be much more preferable to watching this schlock again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Beyond The Poseidon Adventure...","review":"If you saw the sequel to the grand-daddy disaster classic of all time you know what I'm talking about. Enough said!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I will never understand why Hollywood decides to re-make classic movies, only for them to fail miserably in the box office, and then flop again when released on DVD.What I will never understand even more, is when Hollywood remakes a movie that was horrible THE FIRST TIME, and then they make it even worse the second time around.If you are having trouble sleeping, get this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Seen Better Film On Teeth","review":"It's a herculean task to tell this story in only 98 minutes, and the filmakers didn't even come close. It starts out exactly like a cheesy Love Boat episode. I was expecting to see Julie, the cruise director, with clipboard in hand chatting with the lame passengers while Gopher, Dr. Bricker and Isaac chase the bikini clad babes.The acting was so God awful as were the hokey CGI effects. I was surprised that Wolfgang Petersen would have his hand in this bag of crap after doing a great job with The Perfect Storm. The characters were all losers I couldn't really relate to nor care about. The story jumped around too much to keep my attention.... making me keep checking the clock to see when this cruise will finally end.The whole plot was completely predictable and un-imaginative. I am so happy I rented this sloppy mess instead of buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POSEIDON 2006","review":"Given that diesel generators do not normally produce electricity while suspended upside down, where did the lighting come from? Pretty ordinary compared to the original where special effects were virtually non-existant."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY poor remake","review":"This movie was a very poor attempt at remaking the original. There was absolutely NO character development before the wave struck. I really cared about the characters in the original Poseidon Adventure and knew NOTHING about them in this remake, and therefore didn't care about them at all. Don't waste your money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I love C. Anderson's books. She has a way of grabbing you, and making you feel for the main characters. This one, unfortunately, didn;t do as well as her other ones. It was slow paced, and kind of dull. It had a lot of potential to be a great book, but I lost interest. The ending was lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"keegan's lady","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I agree with the reader who said that the characters were never developed. Unfortunately, I found this book very boring and was glad that I got it from the library. I have not been able to find in a long time a romance novel that I truly enjoyed such as the classics like Judith McNaught, Lisa Kleypas (her older writings) and Samantha James. Does anyone have an author along these lines that would like to share. I'm desperate for a good read and thought this would be it. I also took out Phantom Waltz but I am skeptical. I'm ready to give up romance reading altogether unless I can find a new author."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion","review":"Keegan's Lady wasn't the first of Catherine Anderson's books that I'd read, but it was most certainly my favorite. Ace Keegan, his brothers, and Caitlin's cat amused me to no end. It was great fun to read a book that actually made me laugh aloud - even if it did draw strange looks from my co-workers! I hope that someday Ms. Anderson will revisit these characters and tell us more hilarious love stories about the brothers! I read this book again every few months and I still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book !","review":"I've read and re-read it and it never stops thrilling me. And there is a modern day connection; the Keegan's and the Paxton's are the ancestors to the Coulter's!(\\"Baby Love\\" all the way thru to \\"My Sunshine\\")I love the way her characters are all flawed, usually one more than the other, and together, through love, healing happens. The Catherine Anderson reading experience is a satisfying one. I heartily recommend just about every one of her books!Great news, a sequel to Keegan's Lady: \\"Summer Breezes\\" will be available in January of 2006. December of 2005 there will be a book of short stories, one of which is written by Miss Anderson called \\"Beautiful Gifts\\", in a book called \\"The True Love Wedding Dress\\". Both are sequels to Keegan's Lady. I know what MY holiday gifts to myself will be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Usual Crime Fiction","review":"Didbin writes in a very dreamily descriptive way, a style uncommon to most detective novels. After reading this book, I want to hop on a plane for Sicily (Mafia apprehensions and all), just to see first hand what the author writes about. The pace is tense, and, as should be the case with all good novels, is impossible to put down until the very end. The end, by the way, is the most dramatic aspect. The twist ending is not of the usual far fetched detective fare, where you find out so and so is still alive, or the best friend is the real killer, etc.. but of eerie realism-- (and reading through some of the other reviews, I don't think I'm spoiling this for anyone) the hero of six previous novels, Detective Aurelio Zen, is killed. The somewhat somber ending in no part takes away, (if anything it enhances) the power and valueness of the story. Brilliant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I tried to like this book, but didn't have much luck. It is hard to follow, and the characters are confusing. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring to me","review":"I have read the books in order and liked them all. However this one I did not like. I couldn't find enough plot. Too much filler with Sicely etc. I skimmed much of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"This is the second time I did not enjoy a book partially because I do not like aspects of Italian culture. It doesn't interest me at all. The story (about the mafia, Sicily, getting even...) was not sufficiently compelling to compensate. The writing got a bit wonky here and there, to the point that at times I found my attention drifting through meandering verbiage. It wasn't for me. Not terribly imaginative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it!","review":"The DVD as a gift for my great-grandson and he loves it!Anything to keep the little ones happy! thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bat-Mite","review":"I remember this show and really got a kick out of Bat-Mite.

I dont understand why the first filmation Batman isnt out on dvd yet,it was alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"When superheroes couldn't hit, the bad guys won.","review":"The amazingly hideous cover art is indicative of the ineptitude on display in this sad '77 sequel series to Filmation's cool \`60s Batman cartoon. By 1977, superheroes could only teach, not hit, and these cheap, cheezy stories are rife with lazy storytelling, limp villains and weak animation. If you love to see five minute stories padded to twenty, with endless repetition of stock shots, music, unfunny gags and really awful voice acting, then this cartoon is for you! In other words, for kids only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Respect, But I Can't Bear This...","review":"A whole lot of 60's Batman fans are gonna hate me for this one, but I'm sorry...while I couldn't get enough of the hokey Batman & Robin fashion of the 60's as a little kid, I grew to love the original Dark Knight persona of Batman from the 80's to the present, no exceptions. This collection is good for historical value but not for nutritional. Felt like I was watching Suiperfriends with only Batman & Robin. BOOOOOOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When I heard...........","review":"that this collection was being released to DVD I was deeply saddened. I recall with great enthusiasm, how much I despised this series even as a child. Lou Scheimer is without a doubt the worst thing to happen to animation ....EVER!!! His \\"work\\" makes the worst output from Hanna-Barbera look like great art. If this talentless hack didn't have his rotoscope he'd have nothing. It never occurred to him that whatever deficiencies there were in the animation could be easily overlooked by a good script. This production was for the paycheck and nothing more. This collection is a vast waste of time and money.I didn't think that anything could make the already great \\"Animated Series' look better, but this collection does exactly that.

After reading all the glowing recommendations above I was sure to receive just what I needed. Although I found some great tips on cross-training and how to increase my speed, I didn't find enough specifics on precisely how to create the right training program for me as I did in several other books. The author's writing style is awkward. Narrative sentences are almost non-existent. Instead, most sentences are short commands making the text read like a Dr. Bronner's bottle. This is an author-published book and the formatting is awful! Body text is huge and headings are sometimes underlined and sometimes italicized (and sometimes not). Spelling and grammar are atrocious making reading a scavenger hunt. Overall a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lame","review":"I was very disappointed with this movie. The summary of the movie on the cover indicates David Caruso as the main star, his picture is on the front. Except he is only in the movie for about a minute. The movie is supposed to be a comedy. There may be one scene that is humorous, but for the most part it's a drama and a very poor one. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Middle School Theatre Teacher's Critique","review":"I teach theatre to middle schoolers and bought this book as a quick fix monologue book. There are some very cute monologues, and they're easy to memorize for the most inexperienced thespian. The book is well organized, and the subject matter covered isn't heavy (which I found a relief with how much negative stimuli kids have these days), and the pages are easy to copy. However, if you're looking for really AWESOME monologues you might be disappointed. It's not Tennyson or Shakespeare (none of my students would have wanted Tennyson or Shakespeare). Overall, I would say the book serves it's purpose. Oh, and my students enjoyed their monologues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topics include alcohol theme - not good for litte kids","review":"My daughter memorized one of the monologues and it discussed a child who was going to \\"spike the punch\\" at a party.

Thomas does and excellent job of describing the life of Jim Morrison, AKA the lizard king, it was one of turmoil and confusion. But Morrison was quite an intellect and poet. Many of the Doors songs spawned from books Morrison had read and he had an unquenched love for the beat generation works, mythology and philosophers. On stage he was an amazing showman and gave the fans what they wanted. But all too many times he would become unruly and downright deplorable. Yet he still was a tremendous thinker, and was the perfect image of a rock and roll star. He truly was a remarkable poet and writer, it is too bad he left the Earth so soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could we suck up to the \\"Widow Kennealy\\" any more?","review":"This book is gorgeous. If you love the young, pouty lion-god, you will love the photos in this book. If you're interested in the rest of the Doors...look elsewhere. This book is largely a paraphrase of Patricia Kennealy-Morrison's _Strange Days_. Yeah, yeah, we already read that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I thought this title would prove ideal for me -- one with very little knowledge on the subject. Instead, I found the text long-winded, very repetitive, and filled with common-sense wisdom; e.g. \\"remind your customers to always lock their doors\\". I had hopes for detailed tips, do's/don't's, etc. for installation of security systems. However, I found mostly useless (to me) details on some internal workings of mechanisms and then countless, repeated anecdotes as similarly described. About the only value I believe I could obtain from this book is some troubleshooting tips. I now will have to spend more money on another book on the subject, *sigh*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises a lot, delivers almost nothing","review":"The publisher's comments the back of the book promise the world. In reality it delivers virtually nothing. I hoped for a detailed discussion on the pros and cons of various sensor types, recomendations on designing and installing an alarm and suggestions as to how thieves by-pass alarms and ways in which this can be minimized through design.Instead the book delivered the most cursory description of sensors, devoting pages to magnetic reed switches and almost nothing to PIR's, which are probably the most common sensors used today. Most false alarms are caused by the incorrect placement of PIRs (facing them at drapes or heaters for instance) and this is not discussed. Instead the book's idea of fault finding is a few pages on tacing a broken wire.I should have taken more note of other reviews recommending against this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and cheap","review":"I was very disappointed with this product. It is very loud when it is on and makes an annoying noise (almost like an ice cream maker) as it turns. It does not cast a lot of light and is almost pointless. I gave it 5 stars for durability because it held up to my very curious boys picking it up and dropping it wondering why it was so boring. Think of it as a dimly lit picture of Lighning McQueen spinning around inside of a ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and tepid","review":"This 60-minute documentary was, to be frank, extremely dull.

If you saw the fabulous PBS special, \\"DOOWOP 50\\", you saw them vocally backing Gene Chandler and Jerry Butler and the band played for all the acts.

I also love the way Christianity is portrayed in this novel...it is a living, breathing way of life, not a dead religion.

Covers his early career and shows how lessons learned from the past led to the most impressive military victory in history. Now........if we can just win the peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Star General with a two star rating","review":"For the first third of the book I thought I was going to enjoy a first rate autobiography of a top military figure. But, beyond the first 200 pages the book start to languish. Suddenly you realize that this book is more about propaganda supporting the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq than it is about a military career. Over and over again General Tommy tells the reader that George and Don can do no wrong. He also informs us of his battle strategy using small forces that move quickly to win the war. But, lo and behold, the general up and retires before the war is won. No explanation why he decides to retire when he hasn't even yet reached 60 years old. This book just left me empty. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Behind the Scenes View","review":"Overall, I really enjoyed General Franks' book. I was intimidated by it's large size, but I found the reading intriguing and pages flying by faster than I thought they would. I was thoroughly engaged by this book.The first part of the book gives us Franks' background. Franks pulls no punches and shares the good and the bad. It is in the events and people of his early life that the Franks we know today was formed.In the second part of the book, dedicated to Franks' military career, we can see the evolution of the American military and the conflict between the old guard generals and Franks' new way of doing business. Franks pulls no punches here, either. Franks opens our eyes to the realities of war in the 21st century.The main reason to read this book is not Franks, however. American Soldier provides a behind the scenes glimpse of the strategy, planning and tough decisions that are required for security in today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Hero we should be proud of.","review":"It takes a special man to live the life the military requires. Not only is his a sacrifice but his family must pay the price along with him. America's pride is in men like Tommy Franks. When the cards are down they are the one's that stand up. The love of country and family is shown throughout the book. Never once was their a complaint of duty. His love for his troops was clearly explained. He is a hero, as elders we can only hope America will continue to produce men that feel as he, in my heart I beleive we will. God Bless America."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I've always enjoyed watching interviews with Gen. Franks. He seems like a guy who is at one time the most laid back country boy in the world and at the same time someone who won't put up with BS from anyone for a moment.This book is written in a straightforward manner that doesn't get into exhaustive explanations of history or the military. You get snippets of history as Franks rises from a private all the way to one of the highest posts in the military. But he does go out of his way to explain a lot of his thinking during the current campaign against terror. There are some fantastic moments in the book as Franks explains the highly political world at the tops of the different branches of the military and how hard it can be to reign them in when fighting a common enemy.Highly recommended for anyone interested in a true military perspective on current world events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I liked it very much. It is a little heavy on the military jargon and acronyms, you may want to bookmark the glossery in the back. The story starts when he was a little boy in Oklahoma with the lessons and values he learned from his father and followed his life through his military career and went into great depth for the Afgan and Iraqi wars.

The overwhelming assumption that Saddamn had WMDs and would use them. 2. Speed and flexibility would be necessary to counter this threat by taking initiative from the enemy. 3. The potential problem of \\"catastrophic success\\" when a power vaccuum was created in one of the worlds most corrupt regions.Franks' interactions with Bush, Rumsfeld, and other leaders foreign and domestic are memorable, and it was intersting how little the news media was told about the wars, especially when the press started to panic just a few weeks into both Afganistan and Iraq.

The authors of this book had great potential to create something extraordianry, but wasted space by including too much text for a coffee table book and devoting entire pages to average photographs. Despite its many flaws, I do have to admit that their selections were truly fresh and original. The authors use several palaces that I had never heard of and avoid using cliches like Versailles, Schonbrun, or the Catherine Palace. If you are looking for a different lineup of palaces you might want to give this book a second thought. If you do decide to but it, DO NOT, under any circumstances, pay retail for this book.

In fact, I listened to it off and on for a couple months to see if any of its songs would grow in appeal, but it became unappealing.

Unfortunately, it didn't come CLOSE to what I had hoped. Most of the production is quite mediocre and uninspiring, to say the least. With the exception of \\"In My Mind\\" (which dominates the album, solely), \\"Am I Worth It\\", \\"Back When It Was\\" \\"What's Not Being Said\\" and \\"Me Time\\", there's NOT MUCH, here.

This is only emphasized when compared to her first album which offered well written tightly produced ditties that resonated on so many levels. The single In My Mind is quite good, but even better performed live. The only other song of remote interest is the gospel tinged last track, Change.

Jared Leto is Basil and I liked him, while I did not like Christian Slater at all. I wasn't supposed to, as he's a villain, but then, I've never liked him. I repeat. Read the book.

It has a thoughtful explanation of the writing process, and pages of ideas for story starters, top ten lists, and statements to which to respond. Although I haven't yet found them useful, it has sections of rhyming words, common words and their juicy synonyms, and commonly misspelled words. They could be useful for generating posters around the room, for example. I have been teaching for a few years, and this book has saved me a handful of times when I needed to come up with a writing prompt or activity in a hurry. Because this book is mostly unknown (I know one other teacher that has it; she loves it too), it's probably a good choice for a gift idea, too. I also have the Science Yellow Pages, but feel pretty neutral about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most interesting folktale on Video!!!!!","review":"If you are looking for a video that has a good sense of humor and extremely unique characters, then this is the video for you!!!

The hose simply does not have the rigidity to prevent a sideways collapse under a powerful vacuum as claimed. It may hold up if you kept it fully stretched all the time, but that defeats the point.What you can't tell from the photograph is that this is the same sort of flexible hose one might use on a clothing drier exhaust, and the full 50' length comes packed in a 5' box.I sent mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"There is a reason this hose is inexpensive - it's cheaply made and not very good dust collection hose.

I use short lengths of this to run from my blast gates to the tool inlets simply because I have a new shop and have found that I need to adjust placement of my tools fairly often. If I had used inflexible or expensive hose, I would be reluctant to move them and just made do, but since I bought a box of this, I can leave some extra on each gate and reposition my tools with ease. I roll out my planer and don't have to connect and disconnect the hose since it simply expands and contracts as needed. I also have found it works well when you have to run it across the floor (no other way to get it to my table saw) and accidentally step on it.

Highly recommend for anyone interested in empathizing or understanding issues faced by lesbians. Great shipper, arrived quickly and in time for my special event. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Landmark Film","review":"This film should be considered an important milestone in not only film history, but women's history as well. Each story is such a powerful message! The tender care that was given to each piece is very obvious. Sharon Stone, Vanessa Redgrave and Chlo Sevigny were fantastic. I was awestruck by the window on each relationship portrayed, and happily left feeling a sense of hope and compassion for each character and the many women each represent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good collection","review":"This collection of stories looking at the lives of lesbians in different times periods is interesting and well worth watching. The best of the three, in my opinion, is the first story which is absolutely heartbreaking. Vanessa Redgrave was brilliant in the first short and should have won an Emmy. I really didn't care for the second, which had Chloe Sevigny of \\"Boys Don't Cry\\". This story takes place in the 70s and just didn't draw me in. The third starred Ellen DeGeneres (who is always lovely) and Sharon Stone in a relevant storyline for today's gay women but it never packed the emotional punch of the first story. Overall, however, the set of stories is an intriguing and important revelation about the lives of lesbians in the U. S. and deserves to be told."},{"rating":"2","title":"how it was?","review":"Personally i thought all three stories were relevent to their time period, the 3rd is still not legal in some places(countries).

Quality acting and touching stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"HBO Rocks Part 2","review":"This was an HBO original movie broadcast in 2000. This movie follows three lesbian stories in three different time periods. Vanessa Redgrave stars as a lesbian widow in 1961. Chloe Sevigny and Michelle Williams star as feminists in 1971. Sharon Stone and Ellen DeGeneres star as a modern day lesbian couple trying to have a baby. I found the story of Vanessa Redgrave to be the most touching. It speaks to the need for legal rights for same sex couples and a need for understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right DVD, Wrong region!","review":"I was looking forward to getting the DVD for Christmas, but was very disappointed to find it was for region 1, rather than for region 4, as I live in Australia.I can't play it and did send an email of complaint, but have received no answer. I think it is only fair that I am sent one for the right region. Otherwise, I would never consider using AMAZON.COM again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Great","review":"I've already expressed my mind towards this film. The thing I really want to make sure of, whether the song, that sounds in the third story belongs to Melissa Etheridge (I mean the love scene of Hellen DeGenre and Sharon Stone)and whether it is from her new album \\"Skin\\". It seems to me, it was used in the song of EMINEM \\"Stan\\", but perhaps I' mistaken.If someone happens to know the title of the song and the singer, please, let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational yet scary?","review":"If These Walls Could Talk 2 made me cry made me think and made me laugh out loud.

It concerns 2 older women in the 60's who were together many years and had to be in the closet due to society. One partner dies and the other has the brutal aftermath to face, including having to pretend to her partner's family that they were just friends. All gay couples--please have a durable power of attorney, so your partner has a voice in what happens to you!...the second story, the 70's--very [explicit] scene between two lovely women!the third story--two women trying to conceive. Although enjoyable, Sharon Stone and Ellen Degeneres, lack sufficient chemistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen, Sharon or Chloe??","review":"Could not believe that we had not heard of this film before, blew us away! Watched it, (or certain bits - guess which ones?!) at least half a dozen times in one sitting. The most refreshing film seen in a long time - at last, something positive for lesbians that was well acted and well scripted...and sexy. Music was fantastic, but can't believe the remixed version of Dido's 'Thank You' is not available on the cd. The final scene with Sharon and Ellen dancing is so uplifting and just makes you want to get up and dance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Three generations and all three stories are compelling, intriguing, emotional and beautifully acted and directed. If you like \\"If These Walls Could Talk\\" you will absolutely LOVE \\"If These Walls Could Talk 2\\".

It looks like it's a bargain because it's two albums on one cd. It looks like a bargain becauase it's a little cheaper than some of his other cd's. DO NOT BUY IT ! What's wrong with this one. First of all the sound quality is awful. What we have here is a Cd that hisses and sounds low. Second the music, The music is awful.

The narrower front combined with the stiff buttons that are located too far forward cause the mouse the push backward. There is too little room for the thumb on the side to allow one to hold the mouse still with the thumb without pressing the side buttons too.

They are light, waterproof and perfect for the beach or lake and the strap between the toes is really comfortable compared to some of the other Crocs or plastic type flip flops out there. The massaging \\"nubs\\" on the sole of the flop really do a good job of keeping your feet from getting tired and the cushioning is just right giving a little bounce in your step.

I LOVE the comfort of this sandal & the look of the black/red combo is my favorite. Just remember to go up one size from what you wear in the Athens (also as in the BAJA, gotta go up one size). I wear a 39N in a Birkenstock, a Men's 6/Ladies 8 in a Crocs Athens, BUT I wear a Men's 7/Ladies 9 in the BAJA and in the MODI.

The Modi style, however, run small. I found them at my local shoe department, and tried on size 11, instantly painful. I kept going up in size until I reached 13, then it was perfect. That's quite a huge leap from 11 to 13.I was originally going to order a size 11 from here, but am so glad I found a store to try them on instead.

HOWEVER, the new pair of Modi flip-flops that arrived directly from Crocs last week have seriously cutup both of my feet between the 2 large toes, similar to the consequence of wearing $2.99 flip-flops. Further, my calls to Crocs to discuss the matter have gone ignored - i.e., I have called twice and each time was told that only 1 individual within Crocs could deal with this, 2 messages have been left for such person, and still no response.

The \\"thong\\" that goes between you toes is connected to the strap with glue as opposed to molded.

While there are other better first-hand accounts of the movement of prisoners from Kut to Anatolia, they are all unique based on the author's experiences.The majority of this book plods from day to day, but an interesting twist develops later in the book which does make for an interesting read (but I will let you determine that yourself.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy Rock but difficult Language","review":"As an English speaker I came upon BAP by chance. They were for years Germany's most popular home-grown act. But they do not sing in Standard German nor English for that matter but Koelsch, the dialect of Cologne. Of their recordings I've heard this is their best. Whilst most of their material on this CD is straight forward guitar based rock, and catchy at that, they are supremely versatile and there are slower acoustic based songs, which are hauntingly beautiful. Many English speakers will have difficulty with the harsh sound of the Koelsch vocals, but adventurous types will enjoy this great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychopathology of Type","review":"This book should be better known among those interested in Psychological Type (MBTI).

He will touch your soul. Demonimational differences are moot. You do not have to be suffering from personal anguish to relate to Nouwen's words. His hunger for relationship with others and God are part of the common human experience. This book is a gift of \\"words\\". Words we have, at one time or another, tried so inadequately to find to explain our hunger to ourselves. Read it piece by precious piece and keep going back to it.

I applaud his courage!!","review":"I have read several of Henri Nouwen's books, and find him to be a compelling, compassionate, spiritual, and thought-provoking writer. \\"The Inner Voice of Love\\" is an autobiography of one period in the life of an exceptional priest! Nouwen's willingness to be completely vulnerable and honest is absolutely refreshing. His courage to speak about his \\"dark night of the soul\\" helps us to realize that what seems most personal truly is universal. His lessons can help others transform their lives! This book is an absolute gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Answer to the dark night...","review":"There are few that understand the devastaion of the dark place that Nouwen describes in the intro. There are far less that have words that act as wisdom as well as a soothing balm to this raw wounded inner place. I am convinced God himself communicates through Henris' pen.This book is especially a must for anyone that has suffered deep loss, any kind of abuse or trauma. You will feel understood, less alone, and hear a guiding wisdom gently calling you back into the Divine embrace of wholeness and Love.This book is a beautiful gift. It is a deep, profound sacred gem with life changing qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nouwen's Seeking Heart","review":"Of Nouwen's books, this one has a deeper vulnerability than the others. I have always appreciated his organic spiritual depth and relational intimacy with God, but this book is different. It's raw, personal and vulnerable - and therefore very helpful. Not many men (males) would come out and say the things he says, and that's part of what makes it refreshing. His search for love and affirmation is more honest than I've read from any other writer and his gift to readers is his willingness to put these expressions in print. The book speaks most powerfully to the inner struggles of doubt and emotional need. If you've never been in that place I doubt the book will mean much, but if you have, you might find it to be water for your desert place."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inner Voice of Love","review":"Excellent short meditations for those who have experienced a loss in life or need spiritual growth stimulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"For over 15 years this has been one of my favorite reads.

Nouwen, the much talked about, often quoted spiritual advisor to millions is worth his weight in gold. Nouwen is beautifully honest, and deep in this book on the journey from \\"Anguish to Freedom.\\" Nouwen writes in stark contrast to other writers such as Willard, or Foster. Nouwen takes you on a process that allows you to figure out the end of the story. His comments on humility and generosity are poignant and dead on. Where will you go?

During a breakdown of sorts, he takes off for six months (Can't we all?) and is led through the darkness by two caregivers who meet with him daily. (Can't we all?)

By the time the author meandered around to a second death, mysterious bones found buried on the estate grounds, I could have been the corpse involved - cause of death: boredom.While impeccably written with good dialogue, I did not find myself enjoying this particular novel. It took everything I had in me to finish the read in order to provide a thorough review. And to get my money's worth.

While the technical aspects were interesting, the plot was rather transparent and the overall scene was hackneyed. How many mysteries need to take place at a family gathering in an old country estate while key characters are getting bumped off or threatened?

Without the quality and many options this software provides, I wouldn't be producing what other people call beautiful MIDI tracks.

His book A Love Worth Giving touched that area in me that had never been opened before. We really need to let God love us!!! His love is there if we would just receive it. Do yourself a favor and get this book, especially if you have not yet let God's love in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comments from the spiritual reviewer","review":"This book would appeal to readers who want reinforcement of traditional Christian thinking and who don't mind hearing a new version of the same old message. Otherwise, Lucado's inability to probe even slightly below the surface of cliches and the established party line results in a shallow and unsatisfying reading experience. Additionally, Lucado's ideas about love and attack are co-mingled. Ultimately, this confuses the reader about the meaning of love.A Love Worth Giving received a score of 3.875 on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) from the spiritual reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Worth Giving","review":"This was purchased as a gift and the person loves it.

I liked it so much that I suggested it for a Ladies' Bible Study at our church (it has a discussion guide in the back of the book) and now more than 25 women in our church are enjoying the book as well!

I loved this concert edition featuring great actors from several casts. I wish we could actually buy the true show on VHS casette. This video is a great teaser for those who have not yet seen the show and it is a great collection piece for those who love the music and the memories of Les Miserables. The show is uplifting and inspiring and Victor Hugo has given the world a great role model in Jean Val-Jean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Les Mis fanatics!!!","review":"You can't beat live stage performance, but this is a must have for a fan. The musical, of course, is a beautiful adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel, and I think Les Mis is far more inspiring and awsome than any Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. This movie, unfortunately, is not a live recording of a stage performance, but it does show some clips from the real thing. Nevertheless, it's a treat. And seeing Colm Wilkinson sing with 16 or some other international Valjeans almost brings tears to my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, except for quality","review":"This was an excellent performance of the wonderful Les Miserables.

If you aren't into quality and love this musical, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Combination of All the Greatest Performers","review":"This Les Miserables DVD is excellent. If you enjoy the broadway show, you should definitely get it. All the performers are excellent.

I didn't like Les Miserables at all before I saw this, but now I'm in love with the musical. Colm Wilkonsin was...well I don't like his singing style sometimes but overall he is the best Valjean. Michael Ball is great!! I can't say enough about this man! He is a wonderous singer, actor, and a very handsome man as well. His performance was awsome and I'd love to see him perform it over and over agin. Lea Solonga (did I spell that correctly) is wonderful as well. Phillip Quast....what can I say about this god? He is one of my favorite singers and so I was excited to see him as a villain. He is great! He brings a charm and elegance to his character and just brings him to life. Overall, this is a great musical and I'd recomend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible production!","review":"I purchased the DVD version since my wife and I had worn out the tape.

However, the visuals that are used add to the performance, so I will choose to play the DVD over the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I thought it would be strange to just have the people sing and not really do the whole musical, but just seeing their faces and costumes adds so much that you never get just fanatically listening to the cds and waiting for the show to come to town again. I'd never seen Philip Quast or heard him do Javert, and I used to prefer Allam of the London cast, but now I am completely infatuated with Quast's portrayal. Javert is the best character ever invented and Quast is amazing in it. The Javert always makes or breaks the show, in my opinion. Quast is emotional in the role, but not overly. Just perfect. And naturally, Wilkinson is great. Loved his Phantom as well. If you are a Phantom fan as well - check out the original Canadian cast. You know, on this DVD, even the guy who accuses Fantine of outright attacking him is good. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complaint over wrong merchandise.

I am so glad I did. If you have seen Les Miz, and love it (as I do), this DVD is worth it. But it is a CONCERT VERSION, not the actual staged version. Instead of acting, there is subtitles telling you what should be happening. Of course, great music. All of the singers were great, though I liked the Eponine I saw the first time the best. And the singers all did as much acting as they could standing at a microphone with no props or scenery (but they were in costume). The one scene that I thought was very close to the staged version was \\"A Little Fall Of Rain\\", Eponine's final scene. Very touching.If you buy this, buy it for the music and extras. You won't see much acting. The cd is just as good. But except for an actual taped version of the play, this is the best you can get without leaving home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacular viewing and listening experience!","review":"In a word - breathtaking.

It is simply marvelous and will serve as an apt intro to those who haven't seen the Broadway show and a pleasant reminder to those who have. Technically, Mr. Macintosh (sic) used to be more demanding of his technical people. The audio is so-so and not up to DVD standards. Stereo yes, multiple digital stereo.....NO! The picture quality leaves much, much, too much to be desired. Grainy parallel columns (much like interference patterns)are evident in many of the dark background scenes. DVD is notable for its truly black, blacks and \\"no snow\\" backgrounds and dark scenes. In many scenes a ghost image appears to the right of the singer. Come on gentelmen!

It is instead a video of people standing in front of microphones singing the (almost entire) soundtrack to the musical. If you're looking for incredible scenery, you'd probably have better luck seeing the show. Now that that's taken care of, this video is one of the most incredible things that I have ever seen. Instead of taking the cast members of a single city or tour, this is a 'best of the best' selection, so every part is simply incredible.

The case comes with one disc holder that is extended longer and all four discs go on the same holder. Not only will it scratch your discs if you are not careful, but switching these to get the ones you want to watch later is an extreme pain. What idiot thought of this?

I can really imagine this book being discussed and debated heavily in the year to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, unrealistic","review":"I was disappointed to read this book. Nye basically argues that the world has become very complex due to the global information age and that even though the US will remain as the world superpower in the coming decades, it is in its best interest to pursue multilateralism instead of unilateralism (altough he recognizes that \\"at times we will have to go it alone\\").It's really hard to argue with Nye's argument, because on paper it sounds very true. Unfortunately, this book does not address the practical matters of foreign policy in the first decade of the XXI century.I bought this book expecting to find a practical, matter-of-factly counterpoint to the one spoused by the neoconservatives. I had previously read \\"Of Paradise and Power\\" (R.Kagan) and \\"The Threatening Storm\\" (K.Pollack). I wanted a counter-argument but I did not find it. I am still looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Power is Only Influence","review":"Joseph Nye is brilliant, but completely off with his theory that there is any such thing as \\"soft power\\" beyond mere influence. He makes a case that so-called soft power, which comes from cultural exports and good will, are comparable to hard power (as expressed in terms of the capacity for military or economic coercion) in terms of accomplishing a nation's (specifically, America's) objectives on the world stage. What he's done, though, is merely to elevate influence based on popularity to the level of actionable power, which is totally wrong. Look at the entire history of bilateral relations between any two friendly nations, and you will see that over and over again, accomodation was made when it was in the interest of both states, or when one had the hard power to coerce the other to go along. No nation ever acts in the interest of another just because they like that other country's pop music and blue jeans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid book","review":"This is a stupid book.

The sides and bottom is of MDF board with rather crude joints -- one of the corner joints came apart during shipment. I had to glue it back together. The top is just a piece of peg board that sits on rabbets of the side panels. You have to put a piece of non-slip material (very wrinkled from the shipment) on top of the peg board. The peg board falls out everytime I move the table (heavy because of the MDF boards) since the peg board is not fastened to the base in anyway. The dust collector connector just pushes into a hole in the base. The whole table costs about $12 in material to make. To charge so much for such low quality in both material and workmanship is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book for...","review":"This well written tome is good for the intermediate readers/students of the occult.

Waite or Crowley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm","review":"Cavendish's book is interesting insofar as it comes from an unusual perspective for those writing about the so-called Black Arts. His Christian bias is obvious, and nearly all examples he gives are shown through a Christian filter, but--unlike so many others--he isn't preachy. He doesn't condemn or support any of the practices within the book--this isn't a how-to guide or a religious tract, after all--despite his constant returns to the subejct of devil- or demon-worship. The quality of writing is fair and stays reasonably engaging throughout. The chief failing of this book--aside from the bias and emphasis on demon-worship--is his attempt to cover so much material in so little space. The chapter on the Kabbalah is particularly confused and rushed. He brushes past a great number of important details and doesn't always elaborate on his own discussions enough for the reader to pick up on the key details necessary for understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for all who wish to pursue the Left Hand Path!","review":"This book is one of the most useful and facinating reads I've experienced. Well worth the full cover price; this book explores numerology, the origins of Satan, traditional devil-worship as envisioned by frightened christians, necromancy, and curses by the dozen!Also includes love spells, charms, and stories of 18th & 19th century Black Mass ceremonies.

In the one story, the only real link to stars was the main character's name Estelle. The stories were good. The writing excellent--which you'd expect from these \\"stars.\\" (See... I can do it too.)

In the end, it was excellent for clipping my nails and sorting through junk mail. Most of the movie was made up from deleted scenes from House on Haunted Hill and Orphan. I got the message loud and clear though; \\"Abandon your autistic daughter in the parking lot of a mental institution to make the demons stop.\\" This is the kind of movie that encourages the Susan Smiths of the world.

It had some interesting scenes and an eerie sort of vibe. However, it runs out of steam after while.. and the story made no sense whatsoever in the end. They left you guessing what it was all about and never explained a single thing. One of the ending scenes looked like it was written by a fifth grader who loved Disney.. I guess the big pay off for some with this movie was some heavy metal band dressed as the monsters. But for the rest of us it just made you want to give the DVD away as soon as the end credits began to roll. The only scary thing about this movie was the writters inability to maintain a good story as the script progressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This movie is very Silent Hill - like, as the hospital has a \\"good\\" version and \\"bad\\" version.Nothing is explained in the movie at all, nothing. you'll have to make up your own explanations for why they say things they do, what the plot is, and what the ending meant.

The look of the movie is pretty spooky, the FX are pretty cool, the score is what you would expect, and the acting isn't all that bad. Now the bad stuff. The rest of the movie! There is not much of a story to speak of, no character development, the writing is just awful, there isn't even that much gore. It seems that this is a vehicle to promote a Heavy Metal band from Finland called Lordi. Remember Gwar? Same thing. A group of self proclaimed rock stars in stupid monster costumes. The plot has something to do with a little girl living in a nightmare, or just having one, you really can't tell which one.

Sad to say, Dr. D'Adamo's books and website are full of stories about how people lost weight or became healthier after undergoing his dietary recommendations. I did not find any shred of scientific evidence that the system as a whole works. Where is the double-blind randomized controlled trial that proves this system works? Where are the follow up studies?

Stupidly, I ordered this book without doing any research of my own. That was a mistake I caution others not to make. Don't be confused, the author is a \\"Doctor,\\" but not an M.D. He is some sort of new age quasi-doc. I thoroughly read through the section on my blood type--other sections don't apply, just your own. What a joke! After reading through my section and then belatedly googling the book and this \\"doctor\\" I made the wise decision to donate it to my local library.

There are so many other proteins on a red blood cell besides just the one that determines type. Basing a diet off of your blood type is just ridiculous. Here's an idea, talk to your doctor, check out the food pyramid and get some exercise once in a while and stop eatting fast food. Moderation, moderation, moderation.

I've been on this diet for a week now and i'm not sluggish when I get up, I've had no heartburn since I started this diet and I lost 7 lbs. My girlfriend started this diet the same time I did and in a week she has lost 7 lbs too.

We each liked the types of food that were \\"good\\" for us, and my husband had had a very rare disease that people with his blood type were prone to. My health problems, too, were those my blood type was prone to, and I too loved the foods I was \\"supposed\\" to eat. My husband stuck religiously to the Type A diet for 9 months (he'd been typed A in the army), felt great. Then he was typed by the Red Cross, only to find out he's really Type O (son of 2 Type O's). So now what do we believe? That the doctor hasn't done enough research. Also, if you read ALL his books, the information is sometimes contradictory: things listed as Good for you in one book as listed as Neutral in others. So what to believe???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contradictory information","review":"I have read both the hard cover for all blood types, and the soft cover for just my blood type. There were so many contradictions that I began to write them all down in every catagory of information. For example, in one book it said that I should avoid Pinto beans, and in another it said that they were highly beneficial. I attempted to contact Dr. d'Adamo to clear all this up, however, wasn't able to reach him, so I just sold the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique theory","review":"John Robbins, in his book \\"The Food Revolution\\" makes no bones about his dislike of some recent \\"diet\\" books, including the Atkins diet; the Zone, and Dr. D'Adamo's book. I agree with Mr. Robbins on a couple of points:There is a lack of documentation for the facts Dr. D'Adamo lists.I find it hard to believe that meat or dairy is good for anyone!However, I found this book to be very informative. The foods that he says type A's should keep away from are foods that indeed have caused me trouble in the past. How could he have just made that up? And as a type A, I have become a vegetarian & seen my health improve as a result.Read this book. Take what feels right for you and leave the rest. There is much food for thought here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource","review":"I liked this book, but I expected more lists of foods and some of the foods listed are a little crazy (like horse - I know why they listed it, but it seemed weird). It's a very easy read and I've shared it with friends already. We are trying to incoorperate some of the stuff that's supposed to be really good for us and eliminate some of the really bad things.

Overall, I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has changed the way I eat and think forever!","review":"This book taught me that SO many of our ailments come from the food we put in our bodies, and likewise, can be healed or prevented by eating right. Even if you're skeptic initially about foods being compatible/incompatible with blood types, you'll see proof if you follow this way of life. Your system immediately begins flushing out toxins, and you find renewed energy, immunity, and health. This book is easy to understand and lovingly written, by a naturopathic physician with a wholistic approach to health. If you're serious about improving your health or are fighting disease, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good diet book with lots of resources available","review":"I have read this book and have given it as a gift at least 5 times. I have learned a great deal about myself and how I respond to different food and often refer to it as resource guide. I am an A blood type and my husband is an O - it has been interesting to find food combinations that are good for both of us and help us both to manage our weight. I think the most valuable take away from this book are cues you can recognize from your body as you respond to different things you eat.

When I requested to find out at my doctor's office, I discovered that I needed a reason to do the lab work just for typing.

I am not saying that eating more leafy greens, apples, and lean proteins are bad, in fact it's (obviously) a wonderful adjustment to your nutritional intake and will lead to a healthier life. But this book is promising weight loss by eating certain things and not others based on your blood type, and that the right combinations of food with your blood type will prevent cancer and diseases...

This is a fact. As such, this book recommends that I eat red meat, and plenty of it. Yet I hate red meat, have never eaten it (since infancy!), and find that many of his recommendations for Type O's are not the least bit appetizing or appealing. I do, however, enjoy all the foods recommended for Type A's, and have eaten that way for 30 years- vegetables, lentils, fruits, and grains. I believe that your body will tell you what it needs- do you crave milk? You need Calcium. Are you shaking and weak? You need protein and less sugar! Listen to your BODY, not this doctor trying to make a buck, exercise regularly and sleep enough each night, and and you will be as healthy as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"questionable claims should be a red flag to readers","review":"This book is well written as a quick read. However, I disagree (and believe archaeleogical studies will back me up) that primitive man (type O) was primarily a meat eater. Humans were gatherers before they were hunters and hunting only supplemented the gatherers, and eventual farmers. Therefore, the diet emphasis of high protein for type O's just doesn't hold water. Because of this discrepancy I question everything else in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABO Blood groups have NOTHING to do with diet!","review":"Despite the popularity of this book, it's core premises are wrong.

I was highly skeptical about this but still my curiosity got the better of it and I read though some of the book.One thing I found highly suspect is that the author apparently tested various foods in different types of blood types to see their reaction. Any sophmore science student should realize that digestion doesn't take place in the bloodstream.I also wonder if the \\"miraculous\\" results in many cases were people eating a balanced diet for the first time.If this diet were subjected to rigorous scientific method testing and proven to be beneficial then I would consider changing my view that this is just another fad diet.Advising people to exercise, eat a balanced diet and walk more frequently doesn't sell many books though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diet book","review":"This is a four in one book that covers the four blood types.

(Type O) In only two weeks my blood pressure was elevated and my blood sugar was out of control. Although it sounds good, the idea of historical origins is faulty. We (humans) have continued to evolve and so has our food sources. Worse, look at what food is available today. Take beef that has been raised eating specific grains, plants etc. Then add in the harmones and other drugs present in the beef available today. It scarecly resembles the meat that my ancestors ate thousands of years ago. Plants have evolved also. Take tomatos. I grow them because the commercial varieties we get in the stores are terrible. They have been hybridized to suit picking, packing and shipping. In the store all that counts is how they look, not how they taste.

Before I took a blood test, I was SURE I was type 'O' (due to my natural cravings, what I like to eat and different eating programs that had worked in the past) - Boy, was I surprised to find I was type 'A' That means VERY little protein and very high carbs - oh, but not just ANY carbohydrates - only NON-WHEAT based ones. Try and eat like THAT for any amount of time!!! I did, and didn't like my choices at all. I quickly decided that while this diet / eating plan might have some merit, it wouldn't work at all if I couldn't stand the food. So I gave it up for something more moderate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book can help everyone.","review":"After reading the book in May, I started the \\"diet\\" immediately.

As a blood type A I do not possess the characteristics which the author attributes to all persons of blood type A. I therefore need to make no further effort to dismiss the conclusions that are presented. As proof of his ridiculous suppositions, the author offers the evidence that Presidents Johnson, Nixon and Carter as well as Adolf Hitler were of blood type A and all possessed similar flaws.

Then there's a sort of personality test, followed by a motivation test. At the end of each test, the book provides a sample of careers which matches to your results.

The solder wire diameter/size/gauge at .031 inches works well for both SMD components and soldering different sized wire to switches, potentiometers, etc. It also works well with the cheaper variable wattage Stahl Tools(Parts Express) soldering station.There is only 1 complaint - there seems to be too much flux/rosin in this solder. After soldering for a few minutes my iron-chrome plated tip starts turning brown from flux/rosin residue.

The film is not out to show the idealrelationship. Instead, it highlights the many different ways thatmothers and daughters transform throughout the years in order tomaintain their relationships with one another.The stories told within this film are truly beautiful and while somethings that relationships encounter can be trying, the stories show thateverything can be worked through.

This is FICTION-and a misleading use of Chang & Eng."},{"rating":"1","title":"unconvincing","review":"Unconvincing fictional account of the lives of Chang and Eng, told in the first person. First person fictional novels about real people are usually unconvincing - this is a long narrative of Eng's thoughts, about which the author could know nothing. Therefore, it seems to me to be an account of how the author thinks he would feel if he were Eng - which is rather self-indulgent of the author. Add to that the fact that the author's point of view is 20th/21st century while the events he discusses occurred in the 19th century and you see why the book is so unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I found myself falling asleep everytime I picked up the book.

Told from the viewpoint of Eng, it folows the brothers from their beginnings on the Mekong River to the sideshows, and later the salons and drawing rooms of Europe. The brothers later would marry sisters and settle in North Carolina. At its heart, this is a story of brothers, their love, their differences, their competition and the unbreakable bond.

Nonetheless, it's definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An evocative story","review":"Mr Strauss's story about the two Siamese twins Chang and Eng Bunker, linked at the chest, did actually live between 1811 and 1874. They were born in Siam, they met the King of Siam, they came to America and became celebrities, they married two sisters and were fathers of 21 children and lead a life as farmers in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Mr Strauss's novel is not ruled by historical facts and thus most of its characters and situations are the product of his imagination, making \\"Chang and Eng\\" a true work of fiction. The author thoughtfully explores the questions of union and separation, of individual identity and of the means one has to share and protect one's identity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This book started out strongly - the opening paragraph was powerful but after a while, I grew tired of the tedious dialogue.

I was totally creeped-out by the bedroom scene. You have to wonder, though, how they managed to have all those children. I would like to have had more perspective on their wives point of view.

The left click button for the mouse pad broke (whenever I click on it, it would get stuck and cause it to double click or not click at all). The most annoying thing about it is how loud it is!

While the mechanism that turns the wheels runs smooth, the large wheel needed to be dresses up. It is very soft, so much wheel is lost during sharpening if you are not careful. The drain plug for the water basin is far too small. The tool rest for the dry grinder is cheap stamped steel, what you would expect from a cheap import. The tool rest for the wet wheel was is cast aluminum (no rust) but instead of using a milling machine to surface it, they used a belt sander, so it is not very smooth, which causes tools being sharpend and the cheap sliding miter to catch while sliding back and forth. If you are looking to sharpen hand planer blades, or wood chisels it is difficult to get a straight edge with this \\"grinder\\", but it puts a nice edge on an ax (so does a good whetstone for far less $$)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job","review":"I got no more than I expected. I would have loved the Tormek instead, but I was not prepared to pay that price. This Delta is a good compromise -- i.e., it beats having no slow-speed, wet grinder at all. Some problems: Out of the box, the 10\\" wheel needed truing and the aluminum tabletop needed to be sanded smooth. On the other hand, after taking care of those problems, it does the job it was intended to do, which is put a straight edge and a clean bevel on my woodworking chisels and plane irons. I am not convinced you can do any better for the same price, so from a value standpoint, I rate it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad, Not Great","review":"I've had the Delta for over a year now and am a little disapointed w/ the grinder. As in the other reviews, the wet wheel is very soft, and in the year of avg to light use, the 10\\" wheel is now probably around 7\\" (or less). You MUST dress the wet wheel frequently or else end up with a pretty severe oval (trust me on this one!). The dry wheel wasn't bad but I did need to add the Veritas Grinder Tool Rest to make it really useful. Plus, you will need a good set of stones (I prefer water) to truely hone your edge.In hind site, I would rather have bought a regular Bench Grinder (i.e. Baldor). You have much more flexability in the type of wheels that you can get for grinding (shaped, silicon carbide, felt, leather, ...) unlike the 2 stones here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from Delta","review":"I loosing faith in delta slowly but it is happening. this grinder looked and sounded OK for my purposes.

I am disappointed in delta For this design"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected much better from Delta","review":"I havd owned this grinder for about six months and I am ready to throw it in the trash. To start with, the wheel is too soft and requires frequent trueing.This is particually a problem when you have to stop and true while working on a blade because it changes the grinding angle. The rpm's are too slow. With soft wheel and the low rmp's it can take over a hour to grind a blade. Cleaning up is also a problem. You have to take the wheel well off to clean out the residue of the wheel, which is considerable because the wheel is so soft.I can turly say I can find nothing redeeming about this tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couscous leaks from boxes","review":"The boxes were not properly sealed.

Kittel was very anti-semitic and was tapped by Hitler to help make the Nazi's diabolical plans against the Jews theological palatable to German Christians. After the war, Kittel was convicted and imprisoned for his service to der Fuhrer and the Nazis.

Though Kittel gives his all - around views of certain words, that method turned out to be his biggest problem.

I flipped the stone to put the finish on with the 6000 grit. The result was a perfect edge with a mirror finish!This stone is quite a bit cheaper than Arkansas stones and easier to use. It is a bit softer also - don't try to use the corners. I tried to sharpen a Spyderco \\"spyder\\" ground edge, lots of serations, and concluded this is not the stone for that task, I went back to my ceramic stick for it.

This record has the right balance between speed and heaviness. Music is of course great as well, but early Bathory albums have lots of good music too, but their production is not so good. For example, musically I really like UNDER THE SIGN OF THE BLACK MARK but I find it really difficult to listen due to its raw production (which is sounds as an ultimate compliment to the real black metal).

The jaw-dropping 'A Fine Day to Die' (which references the Robert Chambers short story 'Cassilda's Song') attacks like a gauntlet, as does the title track, an epic in itself, clocking in at 10 min of raw nihilism.

Probably one of the finest Tele players in the business right now and yet even his guitar playing has a sense of humor to it. He's good medicine.

He doesn't go for the easy cliche' very often, which is something that bothers me about other country music.My favorite track on this album is \\"Rainin' You' - he delivers it with such a personal, understated approach that I can really feel the bittersweet misery of the \\"narrator.\\" I could do without \\"Cornography,\\" though!

After buying (and wearing a hole in) his last effort, which included \\"Mud on the Tires\\" and a spot-on rendition of Vern Gosdin's \\"Is It Raining at Your House?\\", I pre-ordered this one. Money NOT wasted! Paisley once again shows himself to be an old-school country artist at heart with a modern talent for playing guitar. The album spans a man's love for his wife, especially poignant in \\"Waiting on a Woman\\", to humor, to gospel, to in-your-face-kiss-my-butt with \\"I'll Take You Back\\". While a little more grown-up fare is present on \\"Cornology\\", it's still refreshing to see young country remember who paved the gravel road before him. Overall, a great album that is worth your hard-earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"Like his fellow country artists Alan Jackson and George Strait, Paisley has yet to put out a bad album.

There's a tendency to tell more than show, and there are some POV issues as well. A professional editor would have helped the read move along a little easier.My hat is off to any author who believes in their work and takes action to bring it to life.

You get full length versions of Tunnel of Love, Telegraph Road & Money For Nothing. Also included one new song All The Roadrunning with Emmylou Harris. I think the track listing Amazon has is a little off, because the copy I bought has Skateaway which is finally on a Dire Straits best off.

I gave up midway through this one!","review":"Behind the Pine Curtain's plot moved at a snail's pace, which wouldn't have been so bad had the romantic tension been built up along the way. Unfortunately, not only was there no \\"slow burn\\", there were no discernible romantic sparks between the two protagonists (at least in the first half of the book). Gerri Hill did a nice job of fleshing out the deep friendship between the two and they certainly had a ton of chemistry; it just wasn't sexual chemistry (at least in my opinion). The secondary characters and the overall \\"small-town\\" feel of the book were also well-developed.I much preferred Gerri Hill's romantic suspense efforts, such asThe TargetandThe Killing Room. Unlike BTPC, they were fast-paced and the romantic attraction between the leads was undeniable... a simple and winning formula for romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"I just loved the book.

Really, it is a pity I read so fast because the joy of reading it last just a pair of days.I really recommend this book if you are searching for lesbian romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and predictable","review":"It took me a while to finish this because of how boring it was. The characters were fleshed out, but the romance between the two leads was a bit too cheesy at times. I was so tired of reading about \\"blue eyes,\\" and the phrase \\"making love\\" was used so much towards the end that I wanted to gag. It's not a good thing that I was more interested in the business aspect of the book than the romance, and I'm not even fond of the subject of business. If you want a light read where you can guess the ending within the first few chapters, then go for it. If not, definitely avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerri Hill just keeps getting better","review":"I have read every one of Gerri Hill's books, and I must say this is the best yet.

Even if you haven't tried Gerri Hill before, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I enjoyed this book. Great characters that I genuinely liked. Interesting conflict that really broke my heart. Happy endings are my thing but the angst and lead up WAS a little annoying. Really slow but I mostly like this pace. I can get impatient and demand an instant hook up but that's not reality for most of us is it? :)Good read. I'd recommend it. Very hot too.

I also admire her books because, while they could be written according to a single formula, as so many authors so tiresomely do, hers are all remarkably different. Holy Fools is darker than some of Harris' earlier work, and her treatment of the psychology of group dynamics here is intriguing and realistic. I can often guess the outcome of books involving mysterious death, but there are so many holy fools in this story that it had me guessing to the end, brought about with the help of a miracle. Is it a genuine miracle? You must decide for yourself. I still haven't made up my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Tradition?","review":"Why do these so-called \\"Catholics\\" want to satisfy the Jews and Protestants so much?

That would be only slightly annoying if it wasn't sold out whenever I call to order one. Each time I'm told they will be in stock in two weeks. I wait two weeks, call, and get told \\"two weeks\\". And forget about taking it in for repairs. That will cost you about what you paid for the whole shebang. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pounds","review":"I do alot of searching for reviews before buying a product, and this product has alot of great reviews.

They went up very easily and provide very good high fidelity sound.The only slightly negative thing I have to say is that the speaker wires that came with the unit were not all long enough to get where I needed them and that if you have very thick speaker wire it will not fit through the wall mounting assembly. This is an exceptionally minor issue, especially since I was not really expecting it to come with the wiring and the wires it came with were of very good quality if a bit short.Definitely worth the very reasonable price Amazon has them for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speakers good, Mounting hardware not so much","review":"The speakers have a nice sound and are quite powerful for their size.

The best is Previn's RCA recording with the LSO and no other attempt before or since has captured the seething tension of the 1st mov., the ferocity of the 2nd., repose and exaltation of the 3rd. & 4th. anything like as vividly. At least in Britain the Previn RCA version is available almost as cheaply as the Naxos, which therefore has no price advantage. Other versions it is also well worth having is the first ever under Hamilton Harty (originally released as 3 movements before the finale was composed) and the excellent Malcolm Sargent EMI version. The old Adrian Boult and more recent Leonard Slatkin versions are also very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was by far the sweetest book ever!","review":"This book was very sweet.

Unfortunately, the black rubber from the edges melts in the dishwasher and stains not only the dishwasher, but other plastic dishes. This didn't happen right away, but I noticed that the inside of the dishwasher, the oxo cutting board, and other plastic dishes had black spots on them. I couldn't even get rid of the black spots.

The size of the board is good, but the surface is slick and I find that when I am chopping vegetables, especially ones I have just washed, they move around on the board. There is no grippiness to the board, it is smooth. I would prefer a board with more traction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not level","review":"Ive purchased this same board from stores, and always loved it. But this one came uneven.

It is a great size for my kitchen and has the grooves around the edge to collect juices or liquid coming from food. It is very easy to wash and has yet to stain after a two months of heavy use. I would recommend this product to anyone. The only downside is that it shows knife marks but they are negligible in size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sturdy","review":"I have had this cutting board for 8 months and it still works great (use 2-3 times a week).

It provides the students of Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia with a concise chronology and a comprehensive list of key issues and concepts. The book demonstrates that Rafis Abazov has done a great deal of research on this neglected region. In addition to being a resource for the history of the region, the dictionary teaches the reader about cultural, social, political and economic facts about Kyrgzystan.I highly recommend this dictionary as an extensive and well-written reference book of Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia. It would make an excellent reference book for libraries, schools and universities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Laptop","review":"As the first reviewer said - it is a blazingly fast and fairly attractive laptop. It outperforms a 3.2Ghz P4 laptop with same RAM. If you run a 64bit OS like a decent Linux Distro - Gentoo or XP X64 edition (drivers for all devices in this laptop are available for X64 edition) - you get absolutely terrific performance for a laptop.It also operates very cool - Fan comes on only when you do continuous compiles, or other similar CPU intensive work.The 15.4' wide screen also makes it a pleasure to use.I recommend you get XP Professional instead of Home - reason being you can upgrade to XP-Pro 64bit for free.I didn't give it 5 star rating because of the outdated Nvidia GeForce Go440 graphics card on it. Not that it is a problem - it works good - I get decent performance while playing games, but still it's an outdated card.Compaq doesn't seem to be selling this exact model anymore but you can go for any Mobile Athlon64 laptop they sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocks","review":"I'm a freshman at my school and my best friend and I are trying out for our school play.

Uncool."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got Getting It","review":"This book uses simple explanations and clear examples to explain new ways of looking at art, especially art that you really didn't like at first glance. Short enough to be read in an hour or two, the book in its first section explains ways of looking at art and thinking about it. Part Two briefly reviews art history from Greek Classicism to postmodernism. Getting It discusses ways of seeing; the vocabulary of art; and trends and styles -- all in a conversational way that is understandable and memorable. The tone is NOT textbook; it's as if a really good teacher were talking just to you. Getting It could serve as a good introduction to art appreciation and art history -- or a quick review -- or an update to help you enjoy today's art that can be complex and confounding (or -- even worse -- can seem like a joke on you)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rats!

Expensiveonce you add up the jigs you'll need; and you can get the same results on most things with patience and jigs like the Veritas angle jig. But who has patience?

And then I get back to work!Indispensable (along with the $expensive$ jigs) for my turning tools.F."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a wise choice...","review":"I have found this sharpener and system to produce a rapid, accurate and beautiful edge on knives and woodworking equipment. Once you read the book for each jig you plan on using (I recommend highly), it is very likely you will produce professional results on the first or second try. The consistent angle of grind, slow water cooled stone and honing wheel produce an edge that quite often blows away the \\"new out of box\\" edge I've found on many of my new knives and especially chisels.The video was more of a marketing tool than educational device so don't worry if you are unable to get to a VCR right away. The honing compound is pretty messy and you will wind up with water on your work surface if you sharpen long items such as chef knives or planer blades.Compared to other systems, I rate this one as tops!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Price","review":"This is a simple electric motor, a low speed grinding wheel and a water bath. It costs $390! Sure it works well. If you are a rich nut I suppose it is THE machine. Otherwise, this is just crazy. Why someone hasn't built a similar tool for $120 is a big question I have. There is nothing in the engineering of this simple tool or its jigs which justifies the very high costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific - but buy the optional stuff","review":"The Tormek system really does what it says. It is setup quickly and puts a razor sharp edge on almost anything. There are a couple of options that it SHOULD come with. The horizontal clamp and the grading stone are not really optional unless you only sharpen scissors. The leather wheel can be used in a hand-held fashion but works radically better with a jig in the horizontal position. I sharpen knifes, turning gouges, cabinet scrapers, plane blades, scissors, and carving tools (even vee tools) on mine. If you can afford it, buy this tool (and options)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Themed Sampler","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned, sometimes the playing is a touch ragged...but that is not necessarily bad. Ancient music, like ancient stories, tends to suffer from either too much respect or a lack thereof.

Upon examination it was clear that the design did not protect the wires from the bending and rotating allowed by the lasrs. The gage wire that was used is so thin it breaks very easily. It was broken in one place and the other wire was already set to break showing open copper to two other places. In addition, the motion sensor is fairly limited making placement difficult.

I used it for a while with batteries only but the batteries only last about a week.I ordered the newer version and right out of the box it worked great except that the laser pointers did not have enough range of motion. Even though I have a 12 foot ceiling in my garage, I could not aim the pointers at both cars. I was able to modify the laser pointers by cutting away the plastic around the base of the laser pointers with a Dremel tool. Now I have had the item for about ten days and the motion detector is not working very well. Half the time I drive into the garage the lasers do not go on. I have to back out and try it again and hope to activate the lasers.This is quite a simple item, makes me wonder why they cannot spend another $2 or $3 in manufacturing and make one that works dependably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price. Easy Install. Works Great!","review":"Easy to install. Comes with a 6ft AC power cord and adapter (I would not recommend using the battery unless you like replacing batteries). I really like the dual laser, even for a single vehicle. Allows me to position the lasers on 2 different points on my dashboard. I located mine farther forward than normal because I have an Ford F-350 crewcab. I needed a small extension cord to reach the power outlet. Otherwise my truck cab would have obstructed the laser.

My garage has a high ceiling and, thus, I had to secure the laser system to the underside of the existing garage door opener. I plugged the AC adapter of the laser system into the electrical outlet on the ceiling right above the garage door opener - it certainly helped that the length of the connecting wire was over four feet long! Then I parked and positioned both my vehicles exactly where I wanted them and adjusted the laser arms to set the light beams to show up on the dashboard where I desired. The system, including the motion detector, works fine and it undeniably looks cool - my only gripe is that I wish the laser light stayed on a bit longer (I timed it a few times and sometimes it would switch off within 15 seconds and sometimes within 30 seconds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laser Parking does NOT do the job !","review":"Disappointed , although it Might work for one car, you can not spread the two beams wide enough for two vehicles. For the price, and not wanting the bother to send it back, I grabbed my handy Dremel tool and trimmed away some of the plastic. OK that problem solved, I can now point the beam to hit the dashboard of both cars.However, I found that the motion sensor does not reliably pick up a car as it comes into the garage. I'm an electronic technician and opened it up to take a look. It uses an infrared sensor not an ultrasonic or optic. It needs heat to trigger the laser on. Your cold car won't do it. So, after you drive you cold car into the garage wall, the sensor will come on when you (at 98 degrees) get out. Junk, go back to the tennis ball on a string, I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total piece of junk","review":"This thing is a total piece of junk. One laser was way out of focus.

Sad, sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see for Callas and Pasolini fans","review":"Callas is great as Medea; that was one of her most riveting roles on the opera stage. Here one can sense what a unique artist she was, as she is incredible in this dramatic role. Other than Callas's participation, it's a beautiful piece of cinema, it's shot similarly to Oedipus Rex by Pasolini, so you wil enjoy it if you like Rex. Writing this review, I am thinking again of why films like that are not made anymore...It is for a serious movie buff, so give it a miss if you like Hollywood mass production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hose makes a great air duct","review":"Needed an outside air duct for a pellet stove I needed more length then came with the stove kit so I used this hose and it worked well and it saved me a lot of money"},{"rating":"2","title":"District and Circle","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this collection and as many of the other reviewers have already stated it harks back to his earlier pieces \\"Death of a Naturalist\\" in particularThis is the Heaney that I enjoy most - the image evoking sounds of his words, the ordinariness of the scenes, and for an Irish farmers daughter who now lives in the States the words bring back a ton of memories.

This is by far the smallest camera that is a real video camera. No other camera comes close.The pros of this camera versus others are:- smallest size / coolness factor (smaller than my still picture digital camera)- can transfer to computer and burn to DVD faster than you would be able to do with tape based camera- SD is more durable than tape, and after you burn to DVD, DVD is definitely more durable than tape (I've learned this the hard way with my honeymoon video tapes being damaged)- saves to SD cards (they are pretty inexpensive now). To use non-panasonic SD cards you need to upgrade the firmware. See far below for the link on how to do so.- fits in my wife's purse- we video tape alot more, because we actually carry this camera aroundCons- Video quality is same as a mid range video camera- Doesn't handle dark environments well (this is the same as most cameras)[....]"},{"rating":"2","title":"great camcorder, but no audio when plugged into tv...","review":"I found no flaws with the d-spap av100, except for the fact that whenever I plug it into the TV, there is no audio.

It's trivial to change the extension from .MOD to .MPG. I had no problem playing this files in Windows Media Player, Roxio DVD Max, etc. As for editing, I had no problem reading in these files and making movies using Pinnacle Studio 8.The camera is SMALL and very easy to use. Although I later read the instructions, I was able to perform all the basic functions beforehand.I anticipate that this camera will serve me well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Here's a nice piece of hardware that was sabotaged by Panasonic's software division. It's hard to believe that,in this era of video file type proliferation, Panasonic could have produced MPEG2 files that are incompatable with practically all video editing software on the market. Panasonic provides a conversion and editing program called \\"MediaStage\\". It's practically worthless. It's simultaneously elementary and obscure. If you are comfortable with MS Windows and then open MediaStage to run the program, you'll be stunned at how disconnected software developers can be with users. The only conversion available for MPEG2 files (in .MOD and .MOI format, no less) is to MPEG4 or to WMV. What a pity.Maybe one of these days some software developer will produce some decent software that can edit these strange d-snap files.I asked Panasonic, but they couldn't recommend any software to me. The joke's on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"The camera would be as advertised if it was not for the MPEG2 file fomat and they use and lack of software control over your files. Sure you can copy and rename the files off the SD card, but don't save them to your computer first using the supplied software, it uses some compression method to create one huge file from all your little ones. And they will be little, 10 minutes record time in high quality for $900.00 + cost of 512 MB SD card, please.Lastly you cannot edit the panasonic MPEG2 formats like others using Adobe or Ulead, you can burn them straight to DVD but splitting tracks, adding effects, and doing the things that make a video look slick don't work well if at all.

The pain and anguish of this kind of mistake are made tangible in this well crafted work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"This novel beautifully captures the innocent optimism and heartbreaking disappointment of adolescence written in Berg's trademark breathtaking turns of phrase.

I feel like I'm right there with Katie, I cried with her and laughed with her. All of us who have been through those tough teen age years can relate to this story! Cheers to Elizabeth Berg!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming coming-of-age story!","review":"Elizabeth Berg's True to Form is a heartwarming coming-of-age story about Katie Nash -- a precocious thirteen-year-old -- and the important lessons that she learns on the summer of 1961. Katie feels like a loser. Not only does she have a job looking after three brats, she also has to care for her elderly neighbor Mrs. Randolph. In order to get reacquainted with the past, she wins a trip to her hometown to see her best friend Cherylanne. However, Katie is about to face some harsh realities. She also learns the true value of friendship...This novel is funny, heartwarming and memorable. Katie made me laugh on various occasions; she also touched me in so many levels. Having loved Never Change and Open House, I knew I'd love this offering. Ms. Berg hasn't disappointed me. I couldn't put this novel down. Berg penned to other books about Katie and I look forward to reading them. In the meantime, I strongly recommend this wonderful gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Back!!!","review":"Elizabeth Berg has found her voice once again! In the three books after Oprah, Ms. Berg seemed to have rushed the works to press. But with True to Form, the voice of thirteen-year-old Katie resonates with Berg's talent. She is so on-target with the female perpective that readers can't help but be touched by her characters. I read this book in one afternoon! Welcome back, Elizabeth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless waste of time and money","review":"Having read some of Berg's other books, I bought this one expecting something similar.

Skip this one and go for an early work by Berg."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Weak","review":"I was disappointed with this novel - I eagerly bought it thinking it would have something to offer beyond what we've seen in Berg's previous novels featuring the same character, Katie Nash. Instead, we get a re-cap of the other two books peppered with some extra prepubescent teen angst - more suitable for a young adult reader. This should have been displayed and promoted as such.I hope this is the last we see of the boring Katie Nash (God help us all if we follow her though adulthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to form","review":"I'm a fan of Berg, but this book was disappointing. Nothing new happens to Katie Nash (worthwhile) from where she left off in Durable Goods. It seems Berg didn't have her heart into this book, lost interest and just wanted to get it done to meet the publisher's deadline. It was chock full of Berg's typical descriptive analogies, but to use another analogy...that's all she wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth Berg is in true form!","review":"Elizabeth Berg is a genius in putting into words the beloved thoughts and feelings I remember from being a kid. She hits the nail on the head on every page. Her main character, Katie Nash, is a delightful young girl who you root for all the way. She is the same character that was in Elizabeth's first novel, Durable Goods, and she was also in Joy School. True to Form is a wonderful novel with many life lessons learned all in a moving, yet lighthearted way. This is a book not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"In True to Form Elizabeth Berg continues the story of Katie Nash, a thirteen-and-a-half year old girl.

For the first few years I thought it was good as well. Now I feel this album is really, really bad and dumb all over. Albums like this sink or swim based on the quality of the vocals and the songs. \\"Schizophonic\\" fails on both of these counts. For starters, it was apparent to me that Halliwell can't sing. In addition, the songs are just plain bad (except for \\"Look at me\\", \\"Lift Me Up\\", and \\"Walkaway\\", which are barely worth listening to). The worst songs here are \\"Mi Chico Latino\\", \\"You're in a Bubble\\", and \\"Let Me Love You\\". Now this album is in the library where it belongs, and since then I take album recommendations with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!","review":"DO NOT buy this album. Every song is weak and just, well, let's face it: stupid. Halliwell, if she does have talent, does not display it in the least and every song is an embarrassment. The other post-Spice Girls should be ashamed to say they let Halliwell into their once-successfull group. I tried to sell this album for one dollar at a tag sale last month and it didn't go. It's a waste of a nickel, and Halliwell better quit her day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geri's voice is almost unbearable","review":"Sometimes you wonder why some people are pop S.T.A.R.S.. Geri Halliwell is surely one of them. When I saw her in her interviews I felt she is a very sympathetic and down-to-earth lady and she might be a good actress for some soap opera, but that's it. Her singing voice is utterly awful and unpleasant (even on CD). She has to sing every song in a low tone so that people think she has a strong voice. I mean a voice does not need to be strong but Halliwell's voice has an awful sound besides. Every single song on \\"Schizophonic\\" becomes annoying and a pain in the neck due to Halliwell's weird tones. Hope sympathetic Ms. Halliwell changes her career to TV presenter or TV actress cuz she is not a bad entertainer and that's why I have to give her 2 stars, really only for being sympathetic surely not for her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLY BORING!!!","review":"I loved the Spice Girls, and I was hoping for some great music to come out of Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice). Unfortunately, the album is a horrible failure. The music is boring, dull, and lacking any musical creativity. This CD is a product of bad music writing.

Songs like \\"walk away\\" sound like her years in the Spice Girls, and \\"Someone's watching over me\\" sounds like her feelings of her father's death. I love how she made a lot of the songs intimate with herself. I think she IS a great song writer. I think everyone should get an opportunity to listen to this C.D. my favorite song is \\"Bag it Up\\" I love the beat!

If you don't like Look at Me, don't worry, I didn't like it to much, but the other songs blew me away. Whoever thinks she sucks, should look in the mirror. You'd probably break the speakers with your crap voice and break the mirror with your ugly face. Geri definately knows how to sing and write, especially in a short time (less than a year).

As an avid Ginger fan, I was sad to see her go, but I'm welcoming Geri with open arms. This album is awesome, her first single, Look At Me, is one of the worst songs on the album, but it's actually really good, so don't let that fool you. The CD travels from sultry in \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" from funky Disco Dive in \\"Bag it Up\\" to Latin soul in \\"Mi Chico Latino.\\" This CD is a must in all CD collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Come Back Album!","review":"This album is truly a pop master piece. The tracks really do capture the ups and downs of being a young woman. She gives you a soft, feeling side in songs like \\"Lift Me Up\\" and \\"Let Me Love You\\" and . She gives you her latin roots in \\"Mi Chico Latino\\". \\"Walk Away\\" seems to be HER side of the Spice break(the other Girls voiced theirs in \\"Goodbye\\"). \\"Look At Me\\", \\"Goodnight Kiss\\", \\"Bag It Up\\", and \\"You're In A Bubble\\" on the other hand are more vampy, with that Girl Power vibe from her Spicey past. Overall an excellent album, sure to keep the Spice formerly known as Ginger at the top of the pops and take her beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geri the copycat!","review":"Melanie C's new album is great. She has soul, voice and messages in the lyrics. And she makes her own kind of music. Geri's new album is awful because she has ugly voice and she is copying Spice Girls. Listen to her music.

She's probably too stupid to do something own...This album had few good tracks and they were \\"Look at Me\\" and \\"Mi Chico Latino\\" but others are boring and you can hear the Spice Girls music in the back.I don't like Geri because she doesn't take singing seriously. Her lyrics doesn't have meaning!

There are distinct influences in here from Madonna and Disco diva's to Blues queens, with choral harmonies and Latino rythms all adding texture to this truely remarkable album. \\"Lift me up\\" makes you want to cry and hug someone; \\"Bag it up\\" just makes you want to get up and groove, whilst somehow building your confidence, empowering you to achieve anything you want. Geri shows the listener snippets of her true self, in this very intimate and personal recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vamp, Sister, !@#$, Virgin #1!!","review":"It was the best. The music video is even better, go geri!! Mi Chico Latino is the best track ever- and so is your in a bubble.. except that the CD has brief language like a few 'B' words, and some others- but otherwise, its the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Schizophonic is a success!","review":"Schizophonic was a smash hit album...which featured Geri's first ever solo, Look At Me. Geri Halliwell wrote all of her songs...unlike the songs on the Spice Girls newest album, Four.Geri quit the Spice Girls because she wastired of it. She wanted to see what it was like not being famous,not because of differences between them. THe Spice Girls new album has alot of cover tracks, and some songs that are not good at all. Geri Halliwell's newest hit, Bag It Up was a great success which features two b-sides. The lyrics for Look At Me are not the full lyrics like the lyrics on the single...it gets up to HAH and stops. I reccomend this CD (...)END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on Geri","review":"Ive always been a fan of Geri and totally supported her descision to leave the Spice Girls, so when I heard she was releasing her own stuff I knew I had to buy it.I love the album. It has a very autobiographical feel off it, especially Youre in a Bubble and Someones Watching Over Me. Bag it up is my favourite track, but Goodnight Kiss is pretty cool too.Geri has got the talent and she not afraid to show it and thats what we love about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at her!","review":"Thank goodness Geri left the Spice Girls! Now she's making better,more grownup music. This album has so much variety. No wonder it's called \\"Schizophonic\\". \\"Look at Me\\" is awesome! I'm listening to it right now! \\"Lift me Up\\" is inspirational. One time I was going through hard times with love,so I sang \\"Walkaway\\" and that helped me feel better. I couldn't understand all of \\"Mi Chico Latino\\",but I love it anyway. The second half of the CD is alright,although not as good as the first. \\"Let me Love You\\" and \\"You're in a Bubble\\" are silly,a bit confusing,and somewhat vulgar. Otherwise,though,it was a good first solo effort by Geri."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Spice is dead....and back and better than ever!","review":"This album has many emotions.Some Geri has probably lived through.It is a great song.If you are in a \\"letting-go\\" mood,listen to \\"mi chico latino\\",and if you are in a \\"lovey\\" mood,listen to \\"lift me up\\".This album is a mixture of:dance,pop,spanish,and pure emotion filles Lyrics,that aresure to fit any mood are in.Live on Geri!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lift Her Up!","review":"When Geri left Spice Girls I guessed that we hear soon about Geri something...a solo album was one choice...and now I have it in my hands. The single tracks are good choices...\\"Look at Me\\", \\"Mi Chico Latino\\", \\"Bag It Up\\", and \\"Lift Me Up\\" which is a peaceful ballad. Geri was the best vocalist in Spice Girls because he can use her voice in various ways. I really like the song \\"Goodnight Kiss\\". It is nice and peaceful and Geri sings beauitifully. Geri's solo album is the best among Spice Girls solo albums. Geri can also sing in a very sexy way...\\"Let Me Love\\" for example. \\"You're in a Bubble\\" is a funny track...it is great to see this or hear...this kind of side in Geri.Stars: Mi Chico Latino, Look at Me, Lift Me Up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geri has set the bar high.","review":"Geri is the first to go solo and she really outdone herself. Listening to this album you will become aware that Geri will never bore you unlike Posh and dreadful scary. The reason why I gave this four stars is because of tracks 7 and 8. Those tracks are too bland for Geri,but the rest of the album is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing return to the world of pop","review":"I rushed to pickup the Geri Halliwell CD, because I am a Spice Girl's fan, an unsual trait in someone who would normally be caught buying something by Hole, Garbage, or Tori Amos. I really liked the first single \\"Look at Me\\" and \\"Bag it Up\\", but I found the rest of the CD to be very bland with no emotion in the lyrics or in Halliwell's voice. It also occured to me that the songs had so much backup singing that it nearly overpowered her. And her pathetic attempt at rapping in \\"You're in a Bubble\\" was too depressing for words. Not to mention the horrific \\"Sometime\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful,Geri is really back!","review":"I like this CD very much.Geri has a wonderful voice.I think Lift me up is the best song.I wish for Geri that very much people will buy this CD. She is really fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Glass Is Half Full","review":"Schizo is how to describe this album. The ballads (except for Goodnight Kiss) are the usual generic ballad softly softly sound. Not great. The upbeat tracks though....FANTASTIC! She has delved into 30's Cabaret, Latin Sound, Trad Indian music and ended up with an absolute cracker of an album. Gerri, stick to the Pop Schizo and less of the Phonic ballads, and I will be back for more! Top effort. You are a truly talented chick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geri Halliwell is a totally different artist.","review":"I love the new album I bought it for \\"Look at Me\\" but I fell in love with all the songs. She should have started out on her own from the begining. I hope to see more singles and another album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geri can sing!","review":"Geri Halliwell is an excellent singer with talent. She has a lot of courage and she puts her all into every song. She seems like a very nice person and I wish her the best of luck! Great CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THINK TWICE","review":"as a spice girls fan, i have to say i am very disappointed in this cd from Geri. She has the potential but her songs are all mistakes. This Cd is one I would recomend to no one. If only her other 9 tracks were as hot as \\"look at me\\"! Geri, get some new writers QUICK! your voice is great but the music is dull. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING WORTHWHILE THAT WONT BE LOST UNDER YOUR BED OR THROWN IN THE TRASH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's got big things happening with this album!!!","review":"I think it's great that this CD is out there!!! I'm really glad this CD is selling so good, because she deserves a reward for leaving the spice girls. The music is really different from track to track (which makes it interesting to listen to), and the lyrics are deep (especially compared to SOME of the pop music today). She has really prooved herself as a musician, by writing her songs about what has happened in her life. It's a great CD from a great musician, I promise!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Album But.......","review":"When I first looked at this album in the shops, I thought 10 tracks wasn't very much- but when I listened to the latter tracks on the album I was almost glad that there were no more. The majority of the album is good, but as like most albums there is a few rubbishy songs. The problem is that these rubbishy songs are just far too rubbishy. For Example- You're in A Bubble is the worst song I've heard in my life. But, Geri has also conjoured up some excellent tracks indeed. This would have got 5 stars had it not been for the rubbish on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few highs, mostly lows in this uncreative pop moneyspinner","review":"Geri Halliwell has no musical talent whatsoever, and her foray into a solo career is grasping at straws. This is not the kiddie-music that Spice and Spiceworld was, but I can't see exactly who it appeals to. Probably collective bad taste. Much is ego-centric small-minded pop that lacks the upbeatness of the spice girls, but there are actually some good songs here, such as 'Bag It Up' and Look at Me. Overall however it is a waste of money with strange forays into several languages, and her severe lack of vocal ability permeates the album as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD IS Girl Power!","review":"Geri Halliwell has recorded a fantastic CD. Packed with Girl Power, these songs will surely stick in your head and you'll find yourself humming them all day! I definitely recommend this CD for anyone who likes \\"a taste of every flavor\\" of music. She has some Latin Pop, Bubblegum Pop, Dance Pop, Rock, Classical, and just about everything else. Geri gets cheeky with \\"You're In A Bubble\\", \\"Bag It Up\\", and \\"Look At Me\\", then she gets sweet with \\"Someone's Watching Over Me\\" and \\"Lift Me Up\\", gets weird but fun with \\"Let Me Love You\\" and \\"Sometime\\", then gets emotional with \\"Walkaway\\", gets a 50's private investigator feel with \\"Goodnight Kiss\\", and finally Spices it up with a Latin flavour in \\"MI Chico Latino\\". I admit when I heard a clip of \\"Look At Me\\" from the internet, I had my doubts. Then when I heard the full-length song a few times, and heard Geri talk about the message behind the song, well I loved the song and it's one of my favourites now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an all around Great album!","review":"I bought Schizophonic last tuesday. The first time I heard it, it was the best album I've heard. I think she is better off as a solo artist. Schizophonic is a CD that everyone would enjoy. It is perfect for Spice Girl fans and those who absolutely hated Spice Girls. It has songs that are somewhat like Spice Girls songs and others that are completely different. This album has shown that Geri has matured vocally and musically since leaving the Spice Girls. All of the songs on the album are fantastic, and they're all unique in their own little way. I like hearing songs that aren't the same as the last one! I think Geri is going to be very successful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.","review":"Ok. The best songs on this album are \\"Goodnight Kiss,\\" \\"Bag it Up,\\" \\"Mi Chico Latino,\\" and \\"You're in a Bubble.\\" these songs definitely make the album worth buying. This is a must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm turning schizophonic","review":"this is the greatest album ever, geri has prooving how great a singer she is. spice girls are still great if you like there song goodbye about geri leaving, u will love geri's 'walkaway' her song about leaving the spice girls. let's face it geri rules, it's time 2 move on, mel.g and posh it's all your fault so i thank u cause with out your rudness 2 geri i wouldn't be hearing her great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geri Halliwell. Now a one hit wonder","review":"The album is terrible except for the song \\"Look at Me\\" which is the only good song. I listened to the entire album before i bought and it was a huge dissapointment to me so i didn't buy. i thought that all the songs would be as good as look at me, but i guess not.Unless you are a die hard fan don't get this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst.....utterly awful","review":"i borrowed this CD from a friend just to satisfy my curiousity. And boy, was it awful. No wonder Geri didnt get many solos in the Spice Girls songs. Even worse, Miss Geri fancies herself a songwriter and the lyrics sound like cliched ridden diary entries. Do us all a favor Geri and crawl back to the Spice Girls or go back to making pornos, a singer-songwriter you are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Pure Coolness All The Way!!","review":"This is a wonderful album. It shows that Geri DOES have talent that the Spice Girls didn't let her show. Now instead of being based on her looks/dance moves,she can show her true musical talent. This is a fun cd but has its share of mellow songs,too. I really urge you to buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"i really like this cd and i think the song \\"bag it up\\" represents true girl power. she can do sooooooo much better without the spice girls. go geri!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bye, Bye Ginger and hello Sexy Geri!","review":"I have to admit - at first listen I was concerned Look at Me was going to be slated by the critics, but it very quickly grew on me.

PS Doesn't she look absolutley fantastic on the cover!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GINGER'S NEW ALBUM STINKS!!!!!!!!","review":"I just bought Schizophonic yesterday and it sucks.The so called hit single \\"Look At Me\\" had a commonplace rhythm and didn't impress me at all.Don't waste your money on this album, like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geri is back with the fantastic album \\"Schizophonic\\".","review":"After I heard the song(Look at me),i think the album gonna be great and after I bought the album I found out that she can sing!!Before she left the world most biggest band I never think that she can sing without the band.But after I listen to her album,I think she did a pretty job.I love Bag it up,look at me,someone watching over me and Mi chico latino.However some of the song she didn't do well e.g someone watching over me,if she try her best in this song in will sound greatfull.I think her album was still in spice girls stuff but she did a damn good by herself.Well done!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very touching!!!!!!!","review":"Geri Halliwell, writes the prettest songs. She is a wonderfull singer!! If you like Geri, this is a must have cd! I'm so glad I bought it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Masterpiece","review":"Geri is much better on her own, the album has been a huge success around the world selling more than 3 million. She's had 3 number 1's and 1 number 2 in the UK. The spice girls are nothing without her - she had the energy and talent that was the spice girls. And with the spice girls new album which has had poor sales and its a complete disaster i think they will want her back. There is such a wide range of music on the album from the hyperactive Bag it up, the mellow Lift me up and the latin Mi chico latino. Her voice is pritty good considering that she hardly ever sung in the group, but a little bit of work i'm sure it will improve with an increase of live performances and tours. Roll on album number 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but no spice","review":"The album's standouts are Look at me, Bag it up and Goodnight kiss. Geri might not be the most talented person but she does have some catchy songs. I've found Someone's watching over me to be my favorite because she actually puts her heart into this one and also in Walkaway. On Goodnight Kiss her low husky voice sounds good because it just suits her voice for these kind of songs. The good songs are Look at me, Bag it up, Walkaway, Mi chico latino, Goodnight kiss and Someone's watching over me. The rest kinds of fall flat to the ground. The song Let me love you gets really annoying with her voice and the beat but the worst song on the album has to be Your in a bubble. The melody is really slow and boring and Geri's attempt to rap just doesn't sound good. I definitly prefer her second solo album over this one because this album is only good but no spice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"When I found out that Geri was going to have a solo album, I was looking forward to it. I bought it three days after it was released and I listened to the first song and I loved it. At first I liked only these songs(\\"Look At Me\\", \\"Bag It Up\\", \\"Mi Chico Latino\\", \\"You're In a Bubble\\"), but after a while I warmed up to the others.At first, \\"Let Me Love You\\", was a song that I bypassed because I thought it would be a boring song(I didn't like the first minute of the song) but after I got past that part, it became a song that I liked as well.Also, I didn't think that she was a very good ballad singer, but those songs grew on me after a while(I had to get used to it because most of the Spice Girls hits weren't ballads). But this is NOTHING like the Spice Girls!Hopefully, her next album will be just as good(but I hope it's not like Kylie Minogue's where the ones after her debut album weren't released in this country). I'll be looking forward to that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Geri is way better since she has left the spice girls!!!!!!!

YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-):-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction That Feels Real","review":"This second novel in the 'Day of Evil' series, was as wonderfully crafted as its predecessor was, and maintained the same refreshingly unique style of Melanie Wells. If you loved the cheeky heroine, Dylan Foster, in the first novel, you will find her even more charming in this story. She has a wonderful sense of humor, even in the face of evil.Each novel in this series has its own proper conclusion; however, I still recommend starting with \\"When the Day of Evil Comes,\\" to prevent any minor spoilers that may be gleaned from this novel.Although the cover art depicts the nefarious Peter Terry--a corporeal demon--do not misinterpret this to be a horror story. This is superbly written fiction, which remains stimulating without gimmick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"I found a Melanie Wells book at the library a few months ago and since then have read several of her books. I enjoyed reading this book, although I found it a bit unbelievable at times. A major pro: the main character, Dylan Foster, is very likable. She has a keen sense of humor. She's bigger than life in that you want to see what she does next, but she's normal in that you can imagine her shopping in the next grocery-store aisle down from you. Another pro: Ms. Wells has stepped outside the box of Christian fiction. A con: do you really want this cover creeping out your guests from the bookshelf? :) Better hide the book somewhere in the middle!Her writing didn't grip me like Dekker's or Francine Rivers', but it is very promising. I look forward to see what she'll come up with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot keep it on my bookshelf","review":"As a teacher of reluctant readers, I cannot keep copies of this book on my shelves.

I cannot complain about the books disappearing; they are reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to expand cultural understanding","review":"This is a Cinderella type story that takes place in the middle east.

Within the book a miner 'blows his brains out' and among other things a crude amputation is performed 'in detail' after which the child is left by his relatives to die in their mad rush for wealth.This is not my idea of an appropriate book for an 11 year old. To me there is no glory, only an immense waste of human life in this book. It is depressing and moreover I was angered that the public school system chose to present it as part of the ciriculum without some sort of warning to parents and students about violent content.I'm not sure what everyone believes appropriate anymore, however if you made a movie with the same detail as this book I can guarantee that the rating would be R and no child would be watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for kid ages 10-adults","review":"This book is about a boy that findes out about a gold rush in Klondike, Canada.

I didn't understand why Jason would leave his home in search of gold. It was dangerous and he could have got hurt or killed. There was one part when bears attacked Jason and his dog. Jason's dog protected him and scared the bears away. It was a lot of action and I did like that part. I would try another book by this author, but with a little more action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not appropriate for everyone","review":"As an adult I really enjoyed this book. When I read it outloud to my 4th grader I had a much different response. She was deeply disturbed by the graphic and violent story line. If your child is ready to tackle issues such as suicide, animal cruelty, dismemberment, starvation and other types of dying then this book is for them.

Schleisinger must have been a mature 20-year old to move in the circles of the eccentric and rich of the time. Many of his subjects were older, more experienced and much more famous than he, but his photos portray thier level of comfort with him. It's interesting to see so many photos of the young, beautiful Paloma Picasso and the different looks of Manolo Blahnik over the years. David Hockney is such a striking looking person, that it was fun to see him in all sorts of situations...and that wardrobe! You may be surprised at the odd collection of rich and famous that pop up throughout this book. The photos capture them in a gorgeous, relaxed way that is pleasantly somewhere in between the snapshot and the photo session. Compelling work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Past","review":"I must say this book was disappointing. Although there are some nice photos I find a lot of the book is filled with poor photos of celebrities that could be surpassed in quality by the paparazzi. Poor editing hurt the content, the poorer photos should have been left out and the better ones enlarged. More photos of David Hockney and his friends and more information about the author's relationship with Hockney would have made the book more valuable. If someone one is looking for an insight into David Hockney and the author's relationship they will find very little material. Unfortunately it appears that being around great artists and beautiful people doesn't necessarily make a good book. Like the movie, A Bigger Splash, this book is a rejection of the artistic and creative ideas that Hockney espoused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't leave this one on the coffee table","review":"I ordered this thinking it was a fun coffee table book about fashion from the 60s and 70s, as the cover would have you believe. The photos were boring & mostly of unrecognizable people. Plus, it contained a full frontal male nude shot, which made it too X-rated for me to leave out on the coffee table. I can't have my mother looking at this book! Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Pieces of Coal - Horrible!","review":"The other reviewer, Annie, has said it all... unbelievably bad stories! I love anthologies, especially at Christmas, but I'll think twice before buying them from Zebra again... I just can't believe they had the nerve to publish these... a total waste of time and money. I haven't written a review in a while, and I prefer to write positive reviews, but almost feel an obligation to warn my fellow romance readers not to bother with this disaster. Truly, Zebra should be ashamed... I'm sure there are better stories out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"I've had jump drives previously and was always losing the covers.

I'm a grad student and I work with a lot of data between different computers. My own laptop is Windows 98 1st edition but I downloaded the 98 SE drive and the flashdisk works fine. I also work on Mac OS X as well as OS 9 and the Cruzer Titanium works fine on all of them so far. So I'm pretty satisfied with its flexibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality product, poor quality customer service.","review":"I bought this in December of '05 and it died in February of '06. It also cost me $700.00 to get all the information I stored on it retrieved.

I kept it clipped to my key chain and used it for work. However after 6 months it stopped working. Scandisk agreed to replace the item if the original was returned in one piece. Unfortunately the original contains confidential work files. I offered to send it back in several pieces so the information could not be accessed. Scandisk said it had to be in one piece even though they said they were just going to destroy it. Scandisk offered to allow me use of rescue software for a price to remove the files. It will probably be cheaper and less hassle to just buy another USB flashdrive from another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it just because it looks pretty","review":"Don't let the so called titanium case and the sliding feature suckered you into buying one of these. They're guaranteed to break within 6 months of purchase. I didn't believe the reviews and bought one 5 months ago. And as guaranteed, it broke yesterday with no apparent reason. The files stopped transferring, the light stopped lighting up, and if you tired to format it, it would go completely dead. Save your money, go buy some other flash drive, there are actually other hard drives out there which stores twice as much at half the price. Don't let the sliding feature lure you, it's a moving part, after you sliding it in and out so many times, it'll eventually stop working just like everyone else's flash disk here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Construction is terrible","review":"From the second day I got this, I had a problem where if I slid the port thing all the way into the case (as you're supposed to be able to do to protect it), it got stuck. I had to jam something into the end while sliding the button to make it come back out. Then the end bent and the case cracked open under the tiniest strain (after I'd owned it for ~1 month). It was ridiculous. I have had Sandisk products before and have been happy. In terms of speed, storage, etc., this one has been great, but since it is basically destroyed after 2 months, it isn't much good to me. Titanium is a total misnomer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the light go?","review":"I don't normally write reviews but this is important because I bought this item because of the reviews I saw about it.

The blue light went out and it stopped working.The tech support guy seemed to know that this might have been the problem as soon as I started talking to him.Buy at your own risk. Back up your data often."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, fast little drive","review":"Really easy to use and very quick with data transfer. Nice looking, and it's helpful that there's a slider, rather than a cap. It was also top-rated recently on cnet, where they have a video of it being run over by a car (it cracked, but still worked). It's also helpful to have the easy-to-use, included password/encryption software available for personal info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a turtle.","review":"Make no mistake, this product is tough on the outside. Like a turtle, its hard shell protects it from the elements. You could drive a tank over this thing. The inside is a different story. The actuall usb drive that slides out is very flimsy-- like the body of a turtle without his shell. The locking mechanism that keeps the slide extended is hit or miss. There should be a cover or door on the USB connector side as the connector is exposed and prone to dirt, etc.My drive quit working after 2 months of use. My theory is: the weight of the case itself puts too much strain on the fragile USB drive causing it to fail. I opened a ticket with Sandisk which was closed without my knowledge. I opened another one and am waiting for resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great promise - then the lights went out","review":"We bought 5 of these in November. First one went bad after a week. Today the second one also went bad on another PC altogether - same problem, the blue light won't come on anymore!!

I got a replacement the first time, now I just want to send them all back. I don't have the time to waste to putz around with poorly manufactured gear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off with the newer model","review":"This drive is good for 2 months or so. Then the rubber glue that holds the case gets worn out and the case pops open. I sent mine to sandisk at least 4 times. Good thing they pay for the shipping to and from your house.

I got one and tried it in 6 ports on two computers and could only get it to work in one (port). Tech support is near-worthless as the person told me to return it and get another. I tried two: exact same results. I've read elsewhere that the product is sensitive to the amount of power supplied to the USB port. Of course, SanDisk wouldn't acknowledge any problem with the design.

I took a chance because I loved the design. Bad mistake.I needed the piece of junk at a customer site and it let me down after less than six months of owning it and light use. It just stopped working. There was no possibility of recovery. It never went near a magnetic field -- I was very careful.Edit: I have to give SanDisk credit.

Oddly enough it actually plays when I plug it into a WinMe copmuter, every time.I wouldn't wish one of these on anyone.

After about a month of use, the USB plug-in part got stuck in the Titanium casing, and when I finally managed to get the plug-in part out, the two halves of the casing came apart.

Unfortunately, the case popped open after a month, and the drive stopped working after a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased four, have broken three.","review":"The whole idea of this design is ingenious. The sad part is the drive is not as tough as SanDisk markets it. If you buy one of these...be sure to have your data backed-up. I've broken three. The funny thing is I have four all plastic drives that just keep holding up. SanDisk refused to replace the last one saying I broke it. Understandable. It would have appeared that I could have broken it. It looks as if I had snapped it of in the computer. However, If that had been the case, the 4 copper conductor would have been bent at that point. Fact of the matter is the drive just came apart, just as the other have. I won't buy another SanDisk product for the simple reason that their Tech Support has you jumping through hoops way before they decide whether or not they are going to replace their defective drive. I can get less aggravated for less money just about anyplace. It's a cool drive. If you decide to buy, just back up your data. It will break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool-Looking Piece of Crap","review":"Yes, the drive looks cool, and the titanium casing is virtually indestructible, but the actual durability of the flash drive itself is laughable. If you are considering this drive, please look at the reviews. While many praise it, there are quite a few people who have indicated that the drive has failed them. I have had mine for less than 6 months, and I have babied it. I typically carry it in my shirt pocket for goodness sakes! Despite my careful treatment, the drive has stopped working. I personally suggest that the would-be buyer look into Lexar. I have had a 128mb lexar drive for several years, and it is now what I am using."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and reliable (so far...)","review":"As the first reviewer indicated, this is a very speedy USB flash drive. It easily gets 12MB/s write and 15MB/s read in real world conditions when connected to a USB 2.0 host. Only when reading/writing many very small files does it drop significantly below these values.The metal contruction and retractable design make it one of the more physically robust USB flash drives around. I've used it regularly for a couple months under Linux 2.4 and 2.6, Mac OS X, and a variety of Windows versions without any trouble. It comes with a five year manufacturer warranty.If you're looking for a top-of-the-line flash drive, this might be for you. Do remember that like most consumer electronics, the next generation of flash drives will probably be out in 6-9 months and will no doubt make this one look slow. However, until capacities go up significantly, more speed isn't really necessary since 512MB can be filled in less than a minute at 12MB/s..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandisk Cruzer Malfunction!","review":"I've bought this sleak looking Titanium Cruzer in January'06 and it stopped working after 5 month from purchase; I only used it a few times.I contacted Sandisk immediately and I was impressed to see that they responded pretty quickly to my complaint and request for replacement.

This shows poor organization and editing on the part of those who put this book together.

For one thing, the pages are all front and back, even the ones that aren't part of a particular week, even the ones that have cut and paste activities on the other side. That is my main gripe. Also, this book is laid out to follow the public school calendar (start in fall, end in early summer). We started school in January and are planning to end in September, so I've had to juggle a few of the activities and lessons around so that we're not studying Autumn in Winter, and so on.

That being where you are putting two SMOOTH surfaces together, like a garden hose or radiator hose. But with a DC application of a ribbed hose, the steel band clamp is NOT the preferred choice, use the wire clamp.The steel band clamp will only strip and never be fully seated trying to compress and secure the wire rib to the smooth DC fitting. The steel banding and worm screw is not designed to do that task and provide the needed pressure to fully seat the ribbed hose. Whereas, the wire clamp will actually strattle the rib on both sides and create a perfect clamping fit.I tried to save the twenty cents over the wire clamp, and wound up stripping the clamp thread on about 50% of the applications with the steel band clamps. I antied up and spent the extra cash and got the right product, the wire clamps for the ribbed DC hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Justified By The Contents","review":"I purchased this somewhat expensive book with much anticipation, since I already owned The Spirit of Tibet, by Ricard. Buddhist Himalayas left me unsatisfied, chiefly for the reason that it's size and title suggest a more expansive survey than is offered by the experiences of the authors. Several of the photographs by the Follmis consist of plain and uninspired subjects. Numerous short essays, however, provide a more satisfying description of the world of Tibetan Buddhism. With the image of the re-incarnate Khyentse Rinpoche on the book cover, I come to the conclusion that this is one more book about the remarkable man the authors were privileged to know, but hardly justified by the contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smiley","review":"Elvis had a good ear as he picked up on one of the best.Smiley Lewis's music has eluded my collection for years but now I have a great collection of his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with product!","review":"I was very happy with the prompt delivery of the book purchased as well as the condition of the pages.

Where do you go from these titanic, Beethovenian consciousness dramas?Well, Bohuslav Martinu originated in the same West-Slavic region as Mahler. He was prolific in numbers of compositions, not in their length -- more Haydn than Beethoven. And his external connection is Paris 1920-30s not Weimar-Vienna 1890-1910. So his six symphonies, given during and right after WW II, are both nothing like Mahler symphonies -- and an illuminating companion to them. Schumann compared to Beethoven? Yet they are filled with the terrible drama of the time, even as the first business is always making music. I like them better and better. Performances well conceived and played."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark is right","review":"If you've never heard any Martinu before, this set might pass for current. I can't think of any other way it would. It's a hideous performance. If you love Martinu's music, or even if you just mildly like it, avoid this recording. Bad performances can often be revelatory. I heard a live performance of Mahler's seventh once that stumbled over every transition. But I learned more about that symphony's structure from that gawky concert than I ever had from Bernstein's near perfect recording. I'm afraid, however, that the only thing this Martinu disc reveals is how badly Mr. Fagen conducts, in this performance at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looser and more dangerous that its predecessors","review":"If you're new to Fila Brazillia, I suggest \\"Maim That Tune\\" instead as a starting place, but if you already know what you're getting into, this is the place to be. All Fila releases take a little time to \\"grok\\" and this one took me longer than most -- but the musical reward is in direct proportion to the effort.The fifth installment of the Fila-B World Domination Tour finds them really stretching out and enjoying their art. The boys are experimenting more with the textures of \\"live\\" sounds and instrumentation, and playing faster and looser with their funk-jazz-soul signature sound. The Fila M.O. is still there -- rump-shaking simplicity disguising jazzy complexity -- but instead of bringing it to you on a platter, this time they're asking you to meet them half way.

If you're looking for something incredibly sleazy, offensive, and violent you have just hit a goldmine!

I think this one crosses the shakey line of depravity all the way into nauseating. I gave it four stars for what it is, which is an exploitation film taken to new depths. If you can't take a lot of blood, stay away from this one. I was expecting lots of trashy scenes. But I was not expecting the depths to which this movie sank. I was horrifed, revolted, sickened, and fascinated all at the same time. This is extreme gore. There is a level of torture I have only seen on one other vile film. This is a prison film/gore fest combination film. I like bad movies. I like bad sexpoitation movies. This one set out to take torture and violence to a new low, and it does. Be warned. This is not for those with squeamish stomachs. I think it would appeal to certain fetishists. I gave it four stars for it's no holds barred sadism, the likes of which is rare in a film. This crosses the line to a new level of indecency."},{"rating":"2","title":"A UNIQUE EXPLOITATION FILM.","review":"Ilsa is a film that will never be made again in our present time or never again ever.The film is shocking, funny, and bad. But what do you expect when that was really the intention of the filmmakers. I was very shocked and entertained when I watched this for the first time on DVD. Dyanne Thorne is undeniably very sexy with her SS uniform. She fit the German blonde goddess stereotype exactly. The rest of the stereotyped SS blonde women in this film are also hot.Watch this film but do not take it seriously. Enjoy it for its efforts. It was shot in only 9 days according to the commentary included on the DVD--that alone is an amazing achievement by the filmmakers and the actors involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't for everyone, and it wasn't for me","review":"I thought that this would be right up my alley because I'm a fan of the super-weird. My hopes were that the film would be corny and darkly funny, like a cross between \\"Hogan's Heroes\\" and a sexy cheesy women's prison flick. However, it made me very uncomfortable, mostly because it deals with something that was in fact very real - torture in the concentration camps of the Nazis - and in a very gory and graphic way. I actually had a nightmare after watching it. I'm no prude, and I don't condemn anyone who does like this film. But ask yourself if you can find humor or enjoyment in the Holocaust and torture...if the answer is yes, then perhaps you'll like this movie. If the answer is no, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't beat Ilsa!","review":"Released in 1974, Ilsa Shewolf of the SS is one of the very first true gore films, and still one of the most infamous. Much like Bloodsucking Freaks and I Spit On Your Grave, this movie is probably more controversial today then it was when it was released.One thing is for sure though, unlike those films, this movie is still truly shocking, thanks to better than usual effects and an even greater lack of good taste. To say Ilsa is in bad taste is a great understatement. If you're not offended by this one, you probably won't be offended by anything.Probably the nastiest bit is the woman who is boiled alive in hot water.If you have a strong stomach, and you love these over-the-top gore/exploitation films, then give this first in the Ilsa series a rent! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Althougth the transfer of this movie is really quite good, I cannot say the same for the content. It is not as gross or sick as some of the reviews make it out to be. The acting is awful and you will be bored after about half hour in. I purchased this movie based on the strength of some of these reviews listed here.If you are looking for a truly good movie with better special effects and decent acting try Re-animator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, not shocking","review":"Poorly made drivel. The only thing that shocked me was how often I looked at my watch after 20 minutes of running time.The plot for what its worth, is about the planning for, and eventual activation of, escape from the camp, ignoring totally the need for suspenseful build up, or character development.The film appears to have been made by someone who has previously been informed what a movie is, but has never actually seen one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!","review":"I got this movie on a recommendation by Rob Zombie, and apart from being a little brutal, it was softcore porn rubbish. I would only recommend this to horny pre-teens that can't get their hands on real porn. And \\"Saw\\" fans wouldn't be to into this either, as it's not near as brutal as those films."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is entertainment?","review":"That's the horrible part of it, there's no doubt that the producers hoped to entertain certain types of people here. Since this exploitation film has become quite famous I guess they succeeded.Well, if you want to see nude women tortured (though most of those scenes are mercifully short and choppy), I suppose this is right up your alley.I saw this and another Ilsa picture out of curiosity. The other one was just as sick, but had some skillful production values. This one doesn't even have that to justify its existance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast forward review","review":"For all the Ilsa hype, this one doesn't really make it for sex sleaze fans. I mean, do you really find maggots sexy? Brrr. Skip directly to the \\"face of death\\" stuff on p2p.There is one decent naked asphyx girl on ice scene that can be cobbled up by editing out the silly Nazi officer (keep the volume down, you don't even want to accidentally hear him say \\"remarkable\\"). And sure, we got some Ilsa bosoms and even a brief scene where Ushi coughs up some fake blood on her Swedish krumkaka's, but that's about it. The rest is for gore fans. One star is about right, better to try \\"Wicked Warden\\" for the pin cushion scene and much more nubile pneumatic nudity (npn)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I ever saw","review":"Well, that was the worst movie I saw in my life... It was not interesting, entertaining, hot, sexy, etc. - it was just ugly... I expected it to be unconventional and funky but at least I expected it to have some taste - it was the most tasteless work I ever saw... Do not by it - it is complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"My biggest porn mistake","review":"Something important happened in this film: the depictions of Nazi sadism are realistic; the use of prisoners for usually fatal experiments is credible and actually happened; the starvation and horror shows in every scene. A clear picture of evil at its worst. Then there's nudity, rape, slow torture and death. Perhaps the film is useful to get some idea of the horror of the Holocaust. Anti-semites will find a thrill here. But there is nothing in the least bit erotic or even less than horrifying in this film. I saw this fifteen years ago, and the images can still unsettle me. View if you must, but if this excites you, consider therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Who had the idea for this junk? It's sad to hear the actors trying to be Germans, there's few female nudity, the girls are very ugly. Blood? That's red painting and strawberry jelly made at home. And the tortures they have are nothing. Tickles are more cruel than the tortures in this film. And the hero, he's blonde with a white smile, he's clean and just shaved, while the other prisoners are dirty and gross. Save your money for a movie with perfect chicks and a lot of female nudity, not for this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap warmed up","review":"i have never seen such rubbish in my life when i bought this there would be full on sex and graphic violence its like watching an old hammer movie with a few naked women in it with pubic hair like a thstched roof of a cottage. do not believe the hype i also watched i spit on your grave and even though that wasnt as bloody it was better acted and more shocking ilsa is just a joke of a real historical moment from world war two no wonder the director took his name off it cause he knew he would be hated by any war veterans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw this film when it released in '55-still great now!","review":"It has a certain sentimental value to be but it sure earns that five stars. This is a film with a socially commenting relative plot which along the way had many small moments. When Dadier told Miller to stop calling him chief-he did it anyway, Dadier exposing his own racism when he called Miller,\\"you black....\\" and then did not finish the sentence. Miller did not seem to hold that against him because he saw Dadier as flawed like everyone else. It was a realy good commentary on our process of socialization in the US and I think is still relative today. Today instead of knives and baseballs thrown against the blackboard-kids use guns and bombs. In many ways it seems like nothing has changed since 1955. Anyway I liked the ending-it was hopeful-maybe not what audiences would like today-but suggested that kids can change with trust and commitment from those who matter in their lives-parents, teachers etc. Joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"a clasic","review":"this movie began rock and roll in movies.with 1st rate actors the story is strong and played well.if over 50 i recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down with authority","review":"It opens with Bill Haley's \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" and we know we're in for something dangerous, even nasty. Glenn Ford plays a novice English teacher in a ghetto trade high school, and most of the kids he runs up against are one step from the jailhouse. They are a nasty bunch - they beat him up, torment his wife, and almost send him packing, but he sticks it out and wins them over.Sidney Poitier and Vic Morrow are standouts as the hoods, and in the most harrowing scene (for me), they smash another teacher's prized jazz record collection. It's a no-holds barred look at an inner-city school (circa 1955), and it doesn't succumb to the typical (for movies like this) \\"saved in the nick of time\\" conclusion. The movie is honest and unsentimental. Worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackboard Jungle","review":"This is a great collectors item. Very exciting but not in it's original format.

The movie was'nt bad and it was'nt good, its one of those movies that you might watch and after the movie was done, you cant remember what it was about. I gave it two stars only because of the girl thats in the movie, (the one on the cover) she was'nt funny but she was the eye candy for the movie and she did her job. Waste your time if you want, but I advise otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Comedy that was advertised...thats a good thing","review":"They advertised this move as another over the top Soul Plane type comedy (God knows why)but its not that kind of comedy. In fact this was a dark comedy with sharp humor with a bit of pulp fiction (the genre not the movie) in it. Whoever developed the marketing strategy for this movie should have given the urban community a little more credit for having an ability to digest a multilayerd storyline instead of promoting this as something that it wasn't . Those expecting a slap stick comedy were disappointed and those (like myself) who would have appeciated something different from an all black cast probably never gave it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally","review":"FUNNY. just to see how and why it all goes down and the great ending.

I just might throw it away that's how stupid it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a comedy...or a good movie","review":"The previews and Amazon description of this movie suggest that this is a comedy, and that the stars are Donald Faison and Mos Def. Nope. Although Faison's character is responsible for setting the sequence of events in motion, he's definitely not a main character. This is really a Mike Epps movie. As for Mos Def, it seems like the director wanted him in the movie but didn't have a part for him to play. So although Def is featured prominently in the previews, his character is inconsequential and he's on screen for less than 10 minutes.As for the movie itself, while there are some jokes, there aren't enough to make it a comedy. And as a crime drama, the plot is obvious, boring, and predictable. In fact, if you saw the extended preview, that actually is the entire movie--including the best jokes and the climax.Take a pass on this movie that couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a crime drama and ended up doing nothing well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly good.","review":"Saw these guys live at Molly Malone's in LA.

I came across the Tran Duy Ly books shortly after this and purchased one, the one for Ingraham clocks and watches. I used this book constantly and have since purchased three more, (for Ansonia, Seth Thomas and New Haven). I pull them out every time I am interested in a clock. They are extremely thorough and accurate.

I spoke with Terrye- who is not even a plastic surgeon , rather the wife of the plastic surgeon- who was very rude and snide.I think there are probably better books out there on the subject that will speak to you on an INTELLIGENT level and not assume that because you desire implants that you are some uneducated person who can't read and comprehend some medical terminology."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Biased","review":"I have been to two consultations with two different doctors fora breast augmentation and both doctors had nothing positive to sayabout this author or this book.

There I learned that Dr. Tebbets was one of the designers of the anatomical implant. I also found out that he gets paid (the equivalent of a royality) each time a doctor uses an anatomical implant.

The second pair broke just like the first. I was able to glue them back together but they just broke again. I'm now on my third pair, but this time I've glued some thick neoprene foam on the inside of the headband just above the earpieces so that it, not those thin plastic pieces, take the strain of the headband pushing inward. We'll see how long they last -- I don't hold out much hope.If they'd fix this flaw, it would be a reasonably nice product.

I understand that romance novels are supposed to be fairy tales, but come now, this is rediculous. There is the same cheesy humor on ever page that is annoying as hell. Why can't they talk normally, why do they have to talk like they give a performance? That makes the characters so superficial and pretentious that i couldn't help but dislike most of them.Clearly, SEP needs to come up with new ideas, all of her books are the same. Her best book, IMO, is Nobody's Baby but Mine. That was hillarious and smart. This book is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"This has been by far the most boring book I have ever read, it doesn't really talk about anything but sex.The author finds the way to talk about it in every way, if you are looking for an erotic novel this is the one, if not save your time for real literature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SEP does a great job!","review":"I love all of Susan Elizabeth Phillips books and when I read the preview for this book, I wasn't too sure I was going to like it. SEP did a beautiful job with the character of Sugar Beth. You really wanted to hate her, but you just couldn't. I would feel the \\"pang\\" of discomfort as some parts, then I would laugh out loud. I dont like \\"?itchy\\" characters, but the story was done in such a way that you felt the hurt, but the pain was eased with love and laughter. She did a really great job! It's a don't miss. Makes you think back to how you were and where you want to be today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Georgette Heyer...","review":"Wow! This was a wonderful book. I genuinely cared about all of the characters and the dialogue was great. It's nice to read a romance that's not been \\"dumbed down\\" to the usual level. This was considerably more intelligent than the most of the romances I've been reading lately.Loved the Georgette Heyer quotes! (Yes, she was a master.)Looking forward to reading more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful. Nice, fun story.","review":"I usually don't like books if I don't like the heroine. However, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed reading about this awful, bad, bad girl Sugar Beth. She did terrible things to others when she was young. She tortured Winnie with humiliation and dumped her boyfriend Ryan. She then ruined her own life with poor choices. But things changed later. She had a fighting, bickering relationship with Colin which was fun to see. Later in the book, there were a couple of surprises revealed about Winnie and Ryan.DATA:Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: five. Setting: current day small town in Mississippi. Copyright: 2004.

It was so cute, funny, sweet, romantic, and I loved the heroine! It's a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Disgusted","review":"I read this book when it was first released. I love SEP and read everything she writes. This book was so horrible that I still turn away whenever I see it. I found all of the females in this story so petty and shallow. I wanted to say . . . seriously? Get over it. What does it say about a grown woman that she has shaped her life around revenge for something that was done to her in High School? Let's not look at the situation as adults. Let's still reach like the children we once where. To take things that belonged to someone's deceased parent because you are mad. And no one in this town thought it wrong. I am still horrified by the disgusting people in this book. No one had redeeming characteristics. HORRIBLE! JUST HORRIBLE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"But They're All So Mean!","review":"There are no likeable characters in this book. Even the dog is a meanie! If you can deal with that, go for it. This is the same story line as Fancy Pants, but in this case, the characters do not come across as sympathetic.Sugar Beth sinned as a child - and now her 'friends' make her pay and pay and pay.I found this a very frustrating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but sort of hard to read.","review":"This is a very good book, but it's sometimes very hard to read. Everybody gets their revenge on this woman and it quickly becomes too much. She is seriously degraded and takes away from the forgiveness and redemption that's supposed to be going on. I mean, we are talking high school, and she didn't kill anyone, and her life DOES suck now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't She Sappy...","review":"The first and last SEP book I will read. The humor was cliche, the ending was an unrealistic fairy tale and the novel was one step above a Harlequin romance novel. I am sure I winced a few times reading this book. I just kept hoping it would get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big surprise!","review":"I wasn't going to read this book. I like SEP, but sometimes she gets a little too quirky for me, and I was sure that was going to be the case with Ain't She Sweet. I got it used for a couple of dollars and immediately groaned at the description of the hero. The initial description of Colin as a skinny schoolteacher with a huge nose and an affinity for poetry sounded totally opposite of what we've come to expect from our heroes. Still, the storyline drew me in immediately, and I was already laughing reading the first page. I actually ended up LOVING this story. I laughed so hard and even fell a little in love with Colin, even though he's English, which doesn't appeal to me. This one is definitely a keeper, just quirky enough to make you laugh, but heartbreakingly sweet at the same time. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty Sweet...","review":"I'll keep this \\"short and sweet\\", pardon the pun. While the book is different for SEP, that's what makes it interesting.In addition to the main characters, there's a great supporting cast. I found the Southern charm and humor both bittersweet and heartwarming, and the shared history of \\"girlfriends\\" to be something to relate to.I've read this several times, and like a fine wine, it only gets better with time. Enjoy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ain't This Book the Best!!!","review":"I've read quite a few of Phillip's books. They're all wonderful, and she's one of my favorite authors.

I give this book my highestrating of 5 stars:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What other SEP books do you recommend?","review":"I loved this book so much that I read it twice in the space of a few months, something I almost never do. And in between, I kept picking it up and reading over the \\"good parts\\" again - which in this case was not always the sex scenes, but also the great repartee between Sugar Beth and pretty much the rest of the world, and the relationshiops between the women. I took away one star because the ending was so syrupy-sweet that it spoiled it a little bit for me, but since I read it twice, that's still 8 stars, right?Here's my question: any other SEP's out there like this? I looked at the brief synopsis of some of her other books at the back of this one and they didn't grab me like this one did. Any recommendations?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding.... one of her best yet","review":"Sugar Beth is sassy and sarcastic and determined not to let her hometown former friends see her down. She is broke and looking for a job and determined to get her life under control again. She has been away for 15 year, had 3 husbands and has learned life the hard way. After being the town princess thru high school, people are looking for the spoiled teenager with the poison tongue and bit by bit find the true person she has become. Colin Byrne the guy she did wrong so many years ago tries to humiliate and humble her but this steel magnolia is stronger than he thinks. A very well written and wonderful read"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good time","review":"I enjoyed this book. I liked the two twists Ms. Phillips inserted early in the story: Who Winnie was married to, and then Winnie's relationship to Sugar Beth. The dialogue was wonderfully witty.But the story wasn't without its flaws. I simply didn't feel Sugar Beth's devotion to her elderly deceased husband, or to his mentally impaired daughter. Maybe because this happened in the past and the author didn't paint a visual picture. It was the one hole in an otherwise extremely well developed character. Nor could I understand the Seawillows. I don't see where Sugar Beth did anything for them to hate her so much, other than leave town and lose touch. Winnie was the only one who had a right to hold a grudge.But flaws aside, this was a great story of loss and redemption."},{"rating":"1","title":"High school all over again....","review":"This book was dumb. Basically messed-up people have to get over their high-school issues 15 odd years later.

I recall Breathing Room and a few of her others being so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standards","review":"Last SEP book I'll buy, they just keep getting worse. Her earlier books were much better, now she is just recycling parts of other stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her others","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. Sugar Beth wasn't very likable and I didn't really care for Colin, either. Their romance fell flat. I was more interested in Winnie and Ryan's love life then the main characters! I will say the dialogue was very good though. Nice and snappy at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once won't be enough!","review":"You'll be longing to read this book more than once because you'll be reluctant to give the characters up. I think that's because you'll find yourself within it's pages. It could be written about any-small-town USA. It's a great read, funny, vibrant and alive. Well worth your time and thought.

His first work lies somewhere between reappropriated traditions and sharp composed structure.

I assumed incorrectly that because Angela Knight's story was futuristic that all the others would be too. I would not have purchased it had I known two were historicals and one a contemporary with nothing in common.I was disappointed with this collection. Angela Knight's story, Roarke's Prisoner, stood out and was worth a second read--and almost made the cost worthwhile by itself. I was disappointed with the rest. They all needed more development to make me believe in the sudden relationships between strangers, especially the historicals.I often keep books for a second read before trading them in. Not so for this one--right into my trade-in pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very listenable Elvis-like sounding CD from the 60s - Ral Donner","review":"Ral Donner was a singer who sounded very much like Elvis in the 60s.

In another case an error in both the VB.NET and C# listing resulted in a form that had bogus data displayed and this form was shown in the book! This book is not for the beginner.

And immediately knew this pianist and the mushy sound she prefers was never going to compete with other Prokofiev CD's I already own. The best by far in terms of both staccato and sensitive finger work being a Melodiya 1970 ADD recording (reissued by BMG on CD) played by a young Russian virtuoso Yekaterina Novitskaya. Boris Berman also has Prokofiev running in his veins. The only problem being Chandos used absolutely no thematic logic when putting together his 9-album complete Prokofiev piano music set.

Of course, everybody knows Taylor wrote Wild Thing(which was covered both by The Troggs and also by a Bobby Kennedy impersonator) and Angel of The Morning, which moved Seattle's Merilee Rush out of Parker's and The Spanish Castle and onto the Top-40 charts, but he's less well known for being the brother of actor Jon Voight(Catch-22 & Deliverance). Taylor's a gifted songwriter, and I'm ordering this collection to go with my scratchy old LPs. Unfortunately, 101 In Cashbox isn't on this disc, which is about Taylor's experiences when Angel became a hit, and why I only gave 3 stars. Any Way You Want Me was covered by Bread, before David Gates joined the group, and consigned them to the limbo of elevators and easy listening stations. Joe Bob says check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing my religion.....","review":"As a DT-fan from the start, I think the new album disappoints. When you scan the intro's it's quite promesing, but in some tracks it evolves in an incomprhensible mess of sounds. Craftsmanship of the individual players is undoubted. But it takes more than that to make a unity. I adore most of their albums, but this one I dislike. Music is supposed to be a bearer of a message. Well, this message is too far hidden and the music just as vague. Sorry guys, please order \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" or \\"Octavarium\\" but not this one.....I wish DT got back on writing real theme-albums, or at least songs with the deep and uplifting lyrics as they usually did. Do not try to copy Metallica, nor any other band... which in some instances can be heard on Systematic Chaos.Greetz from a disappointed Dutchman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Excellent album.

John Petrucci continues to raise the bar on all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for DREAM THEATER listeners","review":"I'm not going to write some irrelevent dissection of this cd or the band. Everyone seems to have thier own criteria for how Dream Theater should sound. This cd has a lot of great music on it. If you liked Scenes of a Memory, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, Train of Thought, or Octavarium, then you will like this cd. If you are stuck on Images and Words, which was LAME, then you probably won't like it as much. Systematic Chaos is really cool! You won't regret picking this one up for your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Basically you can sum up DT's career in 2 phases., pre and post Scenes From a Memory... It seemed like right after Metropolis 2 DT became heavier and heavier and seemed to lose their happiness.. Every album since this has less and less 'pep' and 'bounciness'... yet I keep buying their albums hoping that they will reinvent themselves again... gone are the days of the DT tight guitars (listen to this album compared to LTE 2 and Awake and you will know what I mean), great hooks, and even any recognizable song structure....I have listened to this album about 4x since I purchased it, and it just doesn't get me feeling as I did way back in the day.. I actually figured it out., somehow it sounds like Lamb of God w/ keyboards and someone that sings...I'm sorry DT, I had such high hopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop writing lryics... please!","review":"I simply don't have the ears for these lyrics. I would have been happy if this was just an instrumental album. I really respect the band, musicianship and all the hard work. I've got absolutely no memorable moments listening to this album. Nothing stands out or grabs my attention other then how sick I am of listening to religious lyrical content. Instead of Parental Warnings there should be one for explicit use of religious undertones (whether you're singing about your own, or someone else's). I started having flash backs of the \\"Take away my pain\\" song ... stop writing cry-baby lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I love DT. Even my least favorite songs of previous albums have been at the top of my list to listen to when compared to other music.This album is so choppy that I can't stand it. It's like everyone was playing their own instrument in their own room and then they just threw it together and placed vocals over it. It's not even music. I've tried and tried to listen to see if I would get it or if I was missing something, but it is seriously the worst cd in my collection. I wouldn't even sell it used, because I wouldn't want anyone to think that this is what DT is like.Who ever produced this album, should never produce another as long as they live. You know who you are. Stick to what you're great at."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to admit it, but I don't like it.","review":"I have been a loyal DT fan; but ever since Train of thought they have been making heavier and more angry sounding records. I can't relate to that stuff, and I don't like it much. The older I get, the less I dig it. Unfortunately, this album doesn't have 1 song on it that I enjoy. I think that metal enthusiasts will enjoy it, but if you're like me and like the early stuff, this may not be a winner for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible album with absolutely chilling moments","review":"WOW! Absolutely an incredible album.I enjoyed \\"Octavarium\\", but it somewhat dissapointed me. Thus, I was expecting a better album this time around, but not *this* much better. Absolutely amazing.Heavy, dark, murky, mellow, and chilling all describe this album. Though there are mellow moments on this album, there is not a *dull* mellow moment.This album proves there is a ton of creative and musical genius that has yet to be tapped in the collective brain power of Dream Theater. DREAM THEATER ARE NOT DEAD AND WASHED UP! There are many years left of Dream Theater music.Systematic Chaos is going to go down as DT's best album since Six Degrees and/or Scenes from A Memory and will end up in the ranks right near the top of DT's best albums: Images and Words, Awake, and Scenes.BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Dream theater is good and they ARE BETTER than this material that they made. It seems a little too much and as if they're trying to hard to make music still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DT in years.","review":"This album is great, every song is played with alot of emotion and the instrumental is out of this world....Catchy and Melodic but Progressive and Technical at the same time....This is Dream Theater's best album since Scenes from a Memory IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dispair Theater??? What happened to the Dream?","review":"DT's musicianship is solid as ever, but their lyrics are becoming so dark and depressing that I want to find a knife and slash my wrists after my first listening. I used to be excited and inspired after listening to a DT CD, but ever since Octavarium, they have taken a downward trip to the depths of dispair...it is really sad. John Petrucci is probably the biggest offender here. With his lyrics for \\"In the Presence of Enemies Parts 1 and 2, and especially \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" and \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\". He (They) have got to lighten up a bit. I am sad to say that this will be the first of all the DT CDs that I have that I will be selling to the Used CD store. I hope they \\"dream\\" of something more positive next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls on its face","review":"I am by no stretch a Dream Theater fan, in fact, I only appreciate them for the talent they possess. Often I feel underwhelmed when I hear their music. They do have many albums, and I feel it necessary to clarify that this one is not good for a couple reasons. One, I have noticed Dream Theater die-hard fans will praise every album they have done without a critical eye. Two, a new buyer would be better served starting somewhere else. You may be wondering where else to start, the answer is simple, anywhere else! This album fails in comparison to everything else I have heard by them. You could literally blind choose any other album and be better off. I gave it two stars because I found \\"Ministry of Lost Souls\\" and \\"In the Presence of Enemies part 1\\" to be fairly engaging. If you still feel unconvinced go and buy \\"Images and Words\\" at the same time you pick this up and tell me that this isn't horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is easily Dream Theater's worst work to date. Most of these songs are boring and uninspired, and mainstream sounding. Not in a good way like Falling Into Infinity, but in a \\"Metallica meets Rush and absolutely overshadows Rush\\" kind of way. The only great on this album was \\"In Presence of Enemies\\", a 23 minute epic which is probably one of their best newer songs. Dream Theater has now completely thrown away their old styles from long ago, and stepped into the territory of mainstream metal. I can only hope their future albums are much better than the creative disaster Systematic Chaos was."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always, Amazing","review":"this album does indeed bridge the gap between octovarium and train of thought. what everyone has got to remember is, even though \\"Images\\" was phenomenal, its not 1992 anymore. the scene has changed and so has the music. Poison isnt just \\"unskinny bop\\" now is it? anyway, this album has alot of great time changes and melodies. forsaken is the end all for me!if jordan left, the only possible replacements would be kevin moore(again) or rick wakeman(from yes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown nonsence","review":"As my first introduction to Dream Theater I have to say I was pretty pissed after I bought this cd. I bought it on the strengh of Ministry of lost souls which is why I gave the cd 2 stars and not 1. I finally realise why I hate Prog Rock (with the exception of anything John Oliva does) It is so over blown over polished all of its soul has been ripped out. Were is the rawness this stuff is so sanitised who in this band has such a fragile ego that they dare not leave any sparkle left in this music they have to make sure every lick is perfect every chord played to a T every drum hit just exactly right uhg!The singer is good I do like him and have heard he has done some solo stuff maybe that will be better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an amazing cd. The solo's are great, the music quality is stupendous, and it seems like its only an extra buck for the special edition, which is worth it because everybody likes a dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Amazing Album from Dream Theater","review":"What can I say? It's Dream Theater! These guys are the most amazing musicians on the planet and the songs are incredible. I own all the Dream Theater CDs and this is another great one to add to their discography. My favorite song on the CD is \\"Forsaken\\". But I love the whole CD. If you're a Dream Theater fan (and if you're not, you should be), then you'll really like this CD. I bought the one that has the version included that is recorded in 5.1 surround sound. Cool!Buy it! It's great stuff! John Petrucci is \\"da' man!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Moore have to be Back to save DT !","review":"I am a long lisner of Dream Theater from WDADU. but the day has come when kevin leave the band. that time everymember of DT feel lost. but it's not important thing. but after that time DT's music start lost groove feel and as a status of technician. Speedy soloing is not being today in DT. also the power of song materials. so why have to changed their music ? the core is Kevin Moore keyboardist. Kevin always write song as a dynamic rythm and lyrics like poet. this main power lead DT to commercial success. If there are no Kevin Moore, DT will dead meat band also. so becoming more Awake or Images And Words, The Kevin Moore have to be back!and this album is like 8varium, it's not progressive metal. just a underrated grade B band. so now Jordan is going to fired from DT.I hope this change will save DT. I just say directly because I love DT."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG DO SOMETHING NEW!","review":"Once again, Dream Theater sought out to make a heavy metal sound, and ruin it by letting James Lebrie near a microphone. Dream Theater \\"was\\" my favorite band, but not really since Train of Thought, and then dropped them altogether when Octavarium came out and they still thought they were god's greatest gift to music. They need a new vocalist on each an every album, in my opinion, to pull off what they want to do. I've heard metal done better by.. hmm.. metal bands? I've heard Dream Theater done better by.. well you get the point. They need a new singer, and they need to tighten their sound. Better than Octavarium and Train? certainly. Is it any good? NO WAY! don't bother purchasing this album, DT doesn't deserve your money for this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, no, no","review":"after a label change , you would have thought DT would try new, creative ways to define their sound. not on this album. i got this when it leaked, and i'm glad i didn't wait to buy it. only one good song, if even. i'm so tired of james labrie's whiney, whispy voice ruining great moments in the songs. he just isn't diverse enough for the band. while they may have moved way ahead in terms of ability and sound, james is just the same, album after album. they keep using the same slow song sound, and i'm just tired of the meaningless noodling. i used to love them for their instrumental prowess, but now its just old, tired and bland. i feel bad writing this, but i am no longer a fan. there is a large enough back catalog to enjoy, so i'll just pretend they broke up after Scenes.they must pass on the prog title to the new kings, SYMPHONY X."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't even need to hear the album to give it a bad review","review":"How weird that the departure of a keyboardist can lead to the demise of a band's quality, but there has NOT been a great album from this band since \\"Awake\\". The opening tracks on \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" and a couple songs I found on Limewire that don't even appear on \\"Train of Thought\\" even though they came out at the same time are the ONLY comparable tunes this band has come up with since \\"Awake\\". Everything else has been so boring and pointless that it doesn't even matter these guys are so talented... the music has no rock 'n' roll soul whatsoever, and the lyrics are either a ripoff of \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" or some boring diatribe that doesn't contain the grabbing horror and imaginative images that the albums with Moore contained. Thus, I'm 99.9% sure this new album is as disappointing as everything they've done this millenium, and I will not be giving it the time of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise!","review":"Having eventually given up on this band, mainly due to Labrie's annoying and tiny vocals (in my opinion) and the occasional exccess of indulgence, I was taken out of guard by this new release!At first listen I enjoyed all the songs, the overall sound of the album, the production values, the atmosphere. I could even stand Labrie's vocals.This is the best album by Dream Theater, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"Being a long time fan, and after not really liking Octavarium very much, I wasn't sure what to expect. After the first couple of minutes I thought this album would be reaaly cool. After that they lost me. The songs just didn't grab me. Don't get me wrong, there is nobody better when it comes to musicianship, but the songs just aren't that good. Here and there I would here something really cool and after a couple of bars it was gone, never to be heard again. Hope I like the next offering. I used to just buy Dream Theater albums because I knew they would be great. After the last two I will be listening to the samples first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Theater is BACK!","review":"This is their best album since Six Degrees (If not their best album to date.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"10% Good, 90% Bad","review":"Let me say first that I have been a huge fan starting with Day and Dream Unite all the way through Octavarium loyally. And I am not going to do a song by song analysis of this album. Also, this is not a knee jerk reaction but an opinion based on many listens. I simply want to say that I feel this project is just uninteresting from the start. Most of Portnoys parts sound like a higher priority was given to something else. Myong is steady as usual and of course the overall musicianship is there but as a band it just wasn't happening for me. Also, I don't need to hear Dream Theater doing Metallica based melodies or their attepmt at Death Metal. They just need to be Dream Theater. The whole band mailed this one in and I hope to hear a better effort on the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did DT become Pantera","review":"DT has been on a change of course since SDOIT. They have become Pantera. While this album mellows out a little, still not classic DT like I and W, and M2, or Awake.I have been a fan since the beginning,and have seen them in concert over a dozen times, but I think they have jumped the shark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"One of the most diverse albums to date for them. I think it was a great combination of heavy metal and relaxing ballads. Once again they prove they've still got those progressive roots they're steming from with songs like Ministry of Lost Souls & In The Presence of Enemies (altough part 1 is stronger for me). The heavy side is brought out bigger and better than even in The Dark Eternal Night, while the ballad was revealed in Repentance. The weakest track on the album in my opinion was Prophets of War, which is probably one of DT's worst tracks. Overall this is probably their 2nd/3rd best album, with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence being #1 and Scenes From a Memory being ties at 2 or 3. GREAT STUFF!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"thumbs up\\"","review":"This DT album shows that they still alive!! FORSAKEN ( 5 / 5 ) THE DARK ETERNAL NIGHT ( 5 / 5 ) IN PRESENCE OF ENEMIES I & II ( 5 / 5 ) the best song of this album. Who said that this CD doesn't have nothing new to offer..... what about PROPHETS OF WAR, FORSAKEN and THE DARK ETERNAL NIGHT \\"thumbs up\\" these songs are musical proofs that DT is capable to go in other directions with out loosing the essence like other bands. I can hardly wait for the next DT albums, I'm pretty sure that they will give us a total new experience if they keep in the same track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Theater does what they do best.","review":"Dream Theater has done it again - an amazing album that showcases the immense technical abilities of the members as musicians without taking away from the poetry that is their music. The DVD is also very entertaining and goes into a lot of fun detail on how the album were recorded and what kind of stories are behind the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Systematically brilliant","review":"Thanks goodness DT are back! On listening to Octavarium, I was worried that they had lost the plot somewhat but SC sees them re-establish their credentials as the world's finest prog-rock band. I highly recommend getting the special edition which has the bonus DVD on the making of the album because it's chock-a-block with little bits of trivia (and clips of incredible playing) that will delight all DT fans. This is heavy rock album, probably dark even, but filled with enough light within the shade to keep everyone happy. If like me you thought Awake, Train of Thought and Six Degrees were their finest offerings, then you'll love SC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to grow by","review":"Dream theater is the kind of band that throws so much talent and change at you that you really have to grow in your musical esthetics in order to continue liking them. This album pushes their sound in new directions, mixed with some classic DT progessive elements. I saw their concert tour after this album came out with a giant screen of strange animation where the band members fight off a big wolf beast using their musical talents as weapons. The animation style was similar to the animated intro to the TV show \\"TapouT\\". It was very odd, but somehow fitting for this album's direction.'In the Presence Of Enemies' and 'Constant Motion' are my favorite titles (To me, these are also the most classic DT)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Family of Women","review":"I loved this book. The dialogue is so believable, right on target. Each woman was someone I wanted to meet, and each, through her own narrative, made me laugh, cry, and sympathize. Plus it was a real hoot when the author poked fun at \\"bodice ripper\\" historical romances with \\"Penelope's Passion\\", the book she read to her mother's senior reading group. It's also nice to see older adults portrayed as sexually active, when too often they are stereotyped as doddering and passionless. No matter where you are in your life story, pick this one up.

I am somewhat amazed that the other reviewers gave this CD 5 stars. Also, contrary to the assertion made by another reviewer, there are plenty of other single-CD recordings with all the sonatas - at least 6 currently available. ... I wanted to get a recording of Mendelssohn's organ sonatas after hearing them played at church. I did buy this Naxos recording and was very disappointed in the performance, which to me sounded rushed and superficial, missing the depth and subtlety of the music. ... I would very much recommend the Jozef Sluys (which is also available at budget price) recording over this one. ... Naxos has some very good CDs in its organ music series, but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"87% organic..","review":"First off. I dont like this product so much. Its about 4 oz for ten bucks. It claims its organic but not fully, 87%. When I used it, after my normal wash, it left my skin feeling oily. Maybe this is for people with dry skin, it did not specify. I usually use a scrub on my face and have no issues. This felt very sticky like. Didn't feel like it was scrubbing my face, and was watery.

If I can find another book on the same subject but written better, then I'd love to read it. But I had to skim past the inane quizzes, the arrogant examples, and the oversimplified explanations.

I must admit the later part of the book was rather common-sensical and the author's views were rather opinionated.

The rubber coating is useful as I've already dropped it a couple of times but there is no damage to the monocular or the image! The only negative is the soft case you get.

It was held on by two very small dabs of glue which did not adhere to the rubber at all. The rubber piece was very loose fitting and would not stay on without adhesive. The body under the rubber is metal (aluminum?), but somewhat thin-walled. The eyepiece adjustment ring also loosened with initial use and appears to be made of cheap plastic materials. The unit is definitely not waterproof, and likely not splash resistant. The eyecup folds down for use with eyeglasses, but it makes little difference because it has such short eye relief making it uncomfortable to use.

I expected it, to some degree, but it is more limited than I thought it would be.

I had to own it.

I have followed Leo and his solo performances over 1/2 of the US, and still am messmerized at each performance, I will listen a few more times to this release, reluctantly just in case I failed to get it.

You have to approach this disc without any preconceptions of what Leo should sound like (this isn't a solo disc) or of Mike from his Phish days. This is two artists trying something a little different. It doesn't always work (\\"The Grid\\", \\"Over the Dam\\") but at other times, it's pure magic (\\"Living in the Country\\", \\"Rings\\", \\"Balloon\\").If you're not a fan of Mike's vocals, there's nothing I can do to convince you, but the cover of \\"Sweet Emotion\\", even with the dead pan, bland vocals, works for me.If you're coming at this as a fan of Phish, think of the \\"Ya Mar\\" (a nice fun version here) and that's the sound you can expect from this disc.Overall this is an enjoyable ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have bought it if not for the copy protection","review":"I saw Kottke and Gordon play at the ACL Festival last year, and really liked what I heard.

The playing on both is excellent, especially Kottke's always brilliant guitar, but I thought the song choices on this album were much better. The covers of \\"Oh Well\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\" are especially inspired ones.

As recent press indicates in part because they want Apple to raise the price they charge for online songs from .99 to $1.49 (in order to make more money as a music vendor) so they limit ability to load to apple products). Now they want to make it so once you buy a cd you can't make a backup to carry on the road (for example to protect the original).

First, the size is NOT longer than the old long size (though Kotex's description would lead you to believe so). Same length, and a bit wider thus making them too big. Second, the edges are not comfortable at all. The edges are not soft or smooth like they used to be. After wearing them for an hour or so they irritate me. So not only do I have to trim them to FIT so they don't dig into me (sharper edges making it even worse) I also have to so all of the edges don't irritate me.

Cheap in every sense of the word! Mr. Turtledove didn't know the 1st thing about Conan or Cimmerians and their ways. One glaring character flaw, among many, was Conan hunting with a bow. As I recall Conan didn't learn archery until later in his life. Another thing, Conan was far from shy about anything, especially women.

I've been a HUGE fan of Robert E Howard since the late '60's and will read anything about Conan (Robert Jordan wrote the only Conan stories even close to REH).

The only \\"good\\" part of the book was when Conan magically found a lost city. Other than that I was bored and really glad it was a short novel. Mr. Turtledove is an accomplished writer and has some very interesting takes on alternate histories, but he needs to leave Conan to those who understand him and what makes the stories vivid and unreal at the same time.Don't waste your time on this book while there are now collected volumes of Robert E. Howard's work along with some new artists. Reread the good stuff instead of swallowing the poorly written tale of Conan's early years.

The pennant ought to have shown a dragon which any one who has read a Conan story in which Aquilonia is mentioned, even in passing, would know.There are at least 13 more inconsistencies (some of them glaring) in the remainder of the work.

Cashmere had a strong woman on his side and he still couldn't let the street life go. The character \\"Slim\\" was definetely a \\"mack from way back\\" who was trying to \\"school\\" Cashmere on keeping a cool head when in the drug game.

The Overture (actually played during the end credits), and the music to the first and fourth stories were my favorites. Nothing particularly wrong with the other two tracks; I just found them less interesting. The album seems short, but it was originally produced as an LP, I guess; so the music for each segment is presented in specific (and somewhat reduced) blocks. Sound quality is very good, though. The \\"Terror at 40,000 Feet\\" music appropriately features some of the 'gremlin' themes used in his soundtracks to the (Spielburg produced) two Gremlin movies--a real bonus, which I hadn't remembered before buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry Goldsmith's The Twilight Zone: The Movie","review":"Only purpose to buy this soundtrack is because I'm a Goldsmith fan and collector. Not his greatest work, the movie was a flop! Worth having if you're like me, just put this special and limited edition with the rest of his great collection. Jerry Goldsmith still remains as the best film scorer of all time in my opinion. But this CD does not reflect that, too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FILM MUSIC MASTERCLASS FROM MAESTRO GOLDSMITH","review":"Jerry Goldsmith is one of the greatest artists to score a film, and Twilight Zone is one of his very best scores. The schizophrenic nature of this anthology movie means Goldsmith can fully display the diversity of his talent. Sweet, scary, gentle, violent, wacky, bombastic, understated: the four different stories in the movie collectively allow Goldsmith's score to touch every emotional level. Only a weak and dated 80's song is a stumbling point but - hey! - that's why they invented the skip button. Otherwise: breathtaking! inspired! majestic! And much better than the film deserves (but anyone who follows Goldmith's work will know that is nothing new)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldsmith's music elevates an average film!","review":"The producers of the trouble-plagued \\"Twilight Zone-the Movie\\" can be satisfied with one of their decisions: the hiring of legendary Jerry Goldsmith as leader of the baton. He, like fellow composers John Williams and Elmer Bernstein, belongs in a class by himself, with few even meeting him (or them) halfway....the album is short (45:20), but a little bit of Goldsmith goes a long way. The highlights are the scores from the segments \\"Kick the Can\\" and \\"It's A Good Life\\". There are some recognizable Goldsmith touches but that does not lessen their impact or beauty.It just shows that one has a trained \\"Goldsmith ear\\". Any fan worth his/her weight in gold would be able to discern Goldsmith's style from another's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think.","review":"This book is written from the viewpoint that you already have a perfectly fitting bodice pattern, which you created from a store bought pattern.

I've been making patterns for 6 years, and I remember starting out totally confused about the whole moving darts issue. It took me an entire school semester to figure it out. This book is confused.

As most of MacArthur's books, there is a detailed explanation of several verses of Scripture. In fact, most of the book focuses on Ephesians 6:11-22.I was very interested in reading the book. However, I couldn't really get into it. As mentioned, most of the book was just explaining Ephesians chapter 6. In fact, I remember reading in another book by MacArthur almost the same stuff.At the end of the book is a study guide for each chapter that contains thought provoling questions and prayers.Overall, this was a good book, especially if you are wanting to learn more about Ephesians chapter 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teens Review","review":"WOW!

But, This CD does not come close in comparison to hearing him live. Both CD's have a slow electro feel that tend to go nowhere. Leaving me feeling anxious for something more. I listened to this CD a number of times hoping it would grow on me, but it never did. Please do not judge Oscar G. as a Dj based off of this mixed CD. He is a great DJ and a very talented artist. This just happens to be a very bad release. My suggestion is that if you don't own Oscar G. Live @ Space already, then definitley go out and get it.

Not even one meager person wants to be my friend. I'm fat, and I stink. I play computer games so I never have to leave the house (It's not even my house really... my grandma let's me live here).Here are the problems with board games (listed in order of importance):1) They take up too much room in my den, where are my spare computer parts going to go?2) They require people to congregate in real life.

Also, there is no guide for targeting, except for the direction in which the little--almost too fuzzy to see--players are pointed. Game play is virtually by rote reaction. Given the overall quality and speed of the graphics, I question whether anyone would REALLY WANT to spend the amount of time that it takes to get used to the control of the game.

The fact that the seat itself has a locking clip attatched makes me feel more secure when others (like my husband and mother) install the seat when I'm not around. It is larger, but that is so you don't have to switch your child into a convertable seat as soon. My daughter was very long for her age and had to be placed in a convertable seat when she was about 8months old. She hated it.As for the other review saying that you can't take the seat without the base. DUH!! You're not supposed to be able to strap the seat into a car without the base. That's just a Huge safety issue. Anyone knows that.

This one is comfortable and also has the the EPS foam for extra protection. The reviewers who said it was heavy are right but honestly, Do you want a light carseat for your baby? Have you ever carried a \\"light\\" infant carrier? I buy britax convertible car seats because I feel they are the safest. I'd rather spend more and know my kids are safe.

He was a big baby, so I thought this would be a great seat, more roomy, etc. It is more roomy, but also considerably bigger in the car. The base seems huge compared to the graco base. Also can't take the car seat without the base -- there is no way to hook just the car seat in a car, no seat belt clips. This also means you can't take it on an airplane.

Anecdotes about Nevada's neverending cast of characters spice up the pages, which is more than can be said for the state's consistently bland road food that bores the weary traveller in search of a decent bite to eat.

We regularly use it with our now 8 month old son and have since he was born. We use it primarily for rectal temperatures and it has always been accurate and quick! It has a flexible tip and a raised rim to prevent overinsertion when taking rectal temps. Overall, well worth the low price!! Also, for the reviewer who hadn't even purchased the product, the temperature measured at different parts of the body (rectal, ear, underarm etc) varies from core body temperature, so it is entirely valid to add to a temp taken from underarm, for example, to obtain the true core temperature. This is done routinely - even at my pediatrician's office. It doesn't mean the thermometer doesn't work.

At the doctors, only 15 minutes later, the doctor's thermometer read 103.5 degrees. There was a big difference.

Oh, since we were nervous we'd then get out another one and do the same thing and it would then say right around hte 98.4. Unfortuantely, this was not the first time it had done this to us. Save your money! We invested in the ear thermometer scan hospital grade from braun. holy goodness. piece of mind. it's worth the 50!! you figure you'll need one thermometer per kid with this type, the ear one is for hte whole family.

I then bought the Braun Thermoscan ear thermometer which I like for myself but find unreliable for my young son. It doesn't hurt to try and save time, but for my household, I've found that a simple, B-D digital thermometer with disposable covers used rectally is the most accurate method (and therefore easiest in my opinion) for infants.

I had looked at a bunch of forehead scanning thermometers but between the reviews and the price they didn't seem accurate or worth the cost. So I thought to give this 8 sec thermometer a try and have truly been thrilled. By the time my 9 month old son realizes I'm holding down his arm the thermometer's already beeping. and it has always been accurate on me under the arm so I trust it is the same for him.

It looked handy, considering how it folds up in itself to make it more compact, but it turned out to be a dud. For one thing, it took longer than ten seconds to get a rectal reading. Plus, it stopped working correctly after just a few uses. I'm not sure why this happened, because we always used and cleaned it exactly according to the instructions. Perhaps it was just a design flaw, or perhaps I got a \\"lemon.\\" At any rate, I found a much better 10-second rectal thermometer that actually works like it should, and I'm very pleased with it: the Vick's Baby Rectal Thermometer.

Crane radios and reading reviews, I thought I would give the Sonido a try.I am a UPS driver, and need a portable radio for my package car. This model definitely meets most of my needs. For it's size, it kicks out an adequate amount of volume. It uses 4 D size batteries and a week into it (10 hours a day) it still has 2 of 3 battery indicators remaining.The only knock on it is that there are a couple of AM channels that should be coming in somewhat better than they do. Other than that, I would highly recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for a smaller, attractive, and great sounding radio.**UPDATE**I finally had to change the batteries. At about 80% volume, roughly 10 hours a day, they lasted 14 days...so approximately 130-150 hours.

I also appreciate the NOAA weather alert feature, batteries that seem to never die, and highly intuitive controls.One minor con: there is no natural place to pickup and carry the radio - my finger invariably finds a button to press everytime I attempt to pick it up.

But the Sangean PR-D5 offers similar performance (I prefer the Sonido's single 3-inch speaker to the PR-D5's dual 2.5-inch speakers), but overall the $70 PR-D5 is better because its 200mm (8-inch) ferrite antenna, produces vastly superior AM reception.Twenty dollars less with better AM, the PR-D5 is a better buy.

It is a nice compact size and you don't have to pull out the antenna to get any station you want. A broken off antenna was the reason we replaced the last stereo.

The month are laid out by the dates such as Sept 16 - Oct 16 would be one month instead of September which is confusing . I am throughly dissappointed with this calendar and wished I had been able to see more of it before purchasing it. I am considering throwing it out and starting over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I regret buying this product. If I had had a chance to really look at the calendar first I would not have bought it.The biggest problem that I have with this problem is a major problem- I can not write on it with ball point pen reliably and I worry that other kids of pens would smear. I don't want to have to use a special pen for it.The other big problem is that the squares are too small.I am not a fan of the way it is dated. I am somewhat disappointed by the lack of cute graphics. I don't really mind that the questionnaire portion is the same every month because it is neat to see how things change as baby gets older.I am on amazon tonight so that I can buy the same calendar I had when my oldest was a baby because it was much better (Baby's First Year by Russ)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"item was as discribed, I do wish there were more stickers, item arrived as promised, smooth transaction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's First Year calendar","review":"This calendar is nice quality, however I am disappointed that there is no spot for a picture monthly... only 'my first picture' in the beginning. It does have lots of space for monthly information which is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try her nonfiction works","review":"Nancy Hale wrote for magazines such as the New Yorker, and her memoir work is fine sophisticated writing. As a fiction writer she was less sucessful. Skip the fiction, but if you see Life in the Studio or A New England Girlhood at this point probably only available used grab them. Hale was the daughter of painter parents and a descendant of Nathan Hale. She was born around 1900. Her memories of Boston and New York as a child and a young deb are to be savoured."},{"rating":"1","title":"a romance novel, make no mistake","review":"I think that reviving Hale is something of an injustice to other writers who have been perhaps overlooked in the past. This book, at least, is no discovery, but a humid, goofily 'romantic' story, with prose that one could presumably discover in a Harnlequin romance. At least it isn't being foisted upon students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy romance novel disguised as literature.","review":"What a disappointment this book is. It starts out promising, the premise is interesting, but it soon deteriorates into something on the level of Jackie Collins. Even if you can ignore the numerous grammatical errors, as the plot develops it becomes increasingly implausible and unbelievable, and the Soprano herself is not even a likable character. But ultimately, what really destroyed the book for me was the incredibly *ridiculous* Epilogue.I have read Ann Patchett's other books, and I do admire her writing style. And somehow, even in my disappointment I felt compelled to finish the story. I suppose if one goes into the book liking and expecting nothing more than a cheesy romantic fantasy, this book would be fine. It just did not meet my expectations in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow story","review":"I read many books on my own and with a book club. This was a book club choice.

I'm a big opera fan, and thought it sounded interesting. It could have been, but in the hands of another writer, I think. The story dragged, and as much as I liked the idea of an opera diva being one of the main characters, Roxanne Coss never seemed like a real person, and the adulation of her by almost everyone in the book got old real fast. I was bothered, also, but the audio version's mispronunciation of several operatic terms.The ending was unsatisfying, as if the author had decided who would end up where, and couldn't figure out a way to make that happen, so snip, snap, a couple of quick, unlikely deaths and we are on our way!Overall, the book seemed to me to be a book that was trying really hard to be important and great, but never achieved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a stunning novel","review":"Ann Patchett's Bel Canto is wonderful.

The friendships formed and new roles that others learned to take on while be held captive was interesting initially, but at the same time, the same things continued day after day after day of being held hostage. I thought about not finishing this book as I had been reading it for about a month, but thought that may be there would be a great ending...I was very disappointed with the ending as it sounds like other reviewers were. This book is not going to be a keeper on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential.","review":"I read the first 160 pages, which took forever, and the last chapter, and I got pretty much the whole story. At first I thought the book was sophisticated and intriguing, but it took so long to get to the point that it turned me off. The end was out of nowhere and left many questions.

I found the characters uninteresting and bland. The \\"terrorists\\" were a joke - sitting around playing chess, watching their Soap Operas and letting a bout of the Shingles take over their face! Everyone falling in love with the Diva, all the hidden talent -- one a concert pianist -- another a closet-Opera-singer!!! Please!The Mel Brooks connection below is right-on -- I also thought of A Weekend at Bernies! The story-line was ludicrous - the ending Absolutely Implausible!

I doubt I will finish it. I'm so sick of hearing how everyone is in love with the opera diva, Roxanne Coss, over and over. Just the sound of her voice mesmerizes everyone, brings people to tears, makes them want to leave their families, etc.etc. Ok, she's pretty, she can sing, does she also have magical powers?? The descriptions of her voice and the effect it has on the listener are so ridiculous and heavy handed. I don't get it. The hostage situation just goes on FOREVER and nothing ever happens. This book just d-r-a-g-s. I don't get the rave reviews for this boring, boring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"I loved this book! It is the first book I've read by Ann Patchett - it was recommended to me by my 11th grade English teacher. I loved all the characters and how the terrorists befriended the hostages. Although I found Roxane Coss conceited, she was still a nice person. I'm not sure if I liked the idea of Gen and Roxane getting married...but the book was still good. The ending was extremely sad and I had not expected it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"A friend chose this for our book club selection and although I really wanted to just abandon it, I did end up finishing it. I didn't find the story line to be super interesting or compelling and I didn't care much about the characters who were, at times, difficult to keep straight. There is a lot of detail left vague and the ending is somewhat predictable.

Theonly reason that Mr. Hosokawa has agreed to cometo this party in his honour is that Roxanne Coss, aworld famous soprano, is there to sing for theguests. Unfortunately, the party turns sour quickly whena band of revolutionaries breaks into the house andholds the guests hostage.It is much more a tale about how we build relationshipswith others by stopping all of our normal activities andpaying attention to one another as human beings.People even under extreme stress will search outcomfort with each other no matter what the situation.Add the illustrious voice of an angel, the music flowsthrough them everytime she sings for everyone.The bonds grow between captive and captor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me want to go and listen to Opera!","review":"I have been coming across Bel Canto for several years, either here at Amazon or through my local bookstore - and i always passed it because the story didn't appeal to me, i didn't want to read about terrorists taking over hostages in a house, but finally i caved in and bought the book. I read it in a few days. I loved it. It's about love and beauty and music - oh the music in this book makes you want to listen to Opera and classical music, just so you can capture the essence of what the writer is describing. If you are looking for something different to read, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring","review":"I found this book very boring. It is extremely slow paced and none of the characters -- Roxane Coss, Mr Hosokawa, Gen, Carmen, etc are impressive. At some places, it becomes too descriptive and it is not that I don't like the descriptive books but this one just starts getting even shallower with the description. I found it hard to finish it but as I knew that there was suspense in the end I waited until I got to the end. However, the ending wasn't exciting at all. I wonder why this book has gotten such good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had not read the epilogue","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely up until the epilogue. It was an afterthought of writing that tied up too neatly a book that is beautiful because of its transient fragility.The character development, the descriptions and the use of music as a continual underlying theme is a joy to experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Would You Do","review":"I would have given the book 5 stars, except for the epilogue. It made me mad.What I loved most about this book was the ideas it made me ponder. I am now questioning what right and wrong in my life is subjective. I would NEVER cheat on my husband. But, can I judge Roxann and Mr H for their actions when Mr H didn't think he'd ever see his wife again (and he didn't see her, at that). If we were snatched from our lives and placed in a whole other society, we would make our own way, correct? What would that way look like?I like books that give me meat for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singing prose","review":"I found Bel Canto to be un-put-downable. As a trained opera singer, I've often wondered how to make writing about music compelling; Ms. Patchett's work is the answer. The prose is exquiste, and she doesn't skimp on plot; I was in suspense until the last delicious page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"This is the kind of book that, for me, lets your mind wander. I would read a page and then find that I couldn't remember what I had just read. I got about halfway through it and then stopped. I just didn't care what happened to the characters. I usually look forward to reading but I actually dreaded sitting down with this book. And no matter how boring, no matter how poor the writing, I can almost always find something to pique my interest and get me through to the end. Not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An entire book in which nothing happens.","review":"Lyrically written, as one might expect in a book infused with opera. In spite of the lovely prose and strong character development, nothing happens that is not described inside the book's front cover! Many dignitaries and one world reknowned soprano are taken hostage by terrorists. Dignitaries and terrorists alike find love and happiness in spite of their circumstances. The hostage situation ends. Such an ending could have been climactic and chaotic, but the author showed no talent for suspense. It seemed that Ms. Patchett had finished developing all of the characters to her satisfaction; and now that the reader could understand the deep implications of the conclusion, she briefly described the story's end and summed up with a disappointing and even more cursory epilogue. Lovely, but boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful read, a troubling ending","review":"This is a spectacular book that questions how we learn to communicate with one another when the only common language is music. It's extremely well-developed. My only problem with this book was the epilogue. I was so moved by the entire book, but found myself shouting \\"WHAT?\\" on the very last page. Still, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of literature or music."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding","review":"I found this book spellbinding, entirely enjoyable, impossible to put down. I too wondered briefly how Roxanne could enamour everyone in the room so completely, but found the description of the music, the strange new sense of community so alluring that I chose to believe it all, hook line and sinker. I can't wait to discuss all the psychological components with my reading group, the character twists and changing roles, the notion of loving your captors, and now more than ever, I want to explore opera. I am inspired. How fun. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre Situation Breeds Mixed Results","review":"A group of strangers form intense and unique relationships when a terrorists take them hostage at a political fund raiser somewhere in South America. At the heart of the story are two central figures, Roxanne Coss, the beautiful American lyric soprano, and Mr Hosokawa, a Japanese businessman who has come to hear her sing. What starts out as what would seem a fast negotiation winds out into months, and soon the captors and their captives find themselves creating a whole new world beyond the locked doors of the home they're in.Quite artfully Patchett weaves her story much like the operas Roxanne sings,chock full of romance and ultmately tragedy. I found myself straining a slight bit with the credibility of the situation, but enjoyed the various characters so much that overall found it to be a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An allegory for our time","review":"When a hostage taking situation develops at a party held in the vice president's home in an unnamed South American country (based on a real life event in 1996 in Peru), and featuring a world famous opera singer, the hostages and those being held are forced to re-evaluate the meaning of life, as each side meets the unknown element in the other, including the fact that there are people from multiple cultures speaking several different languages. Love and music, the bel canto, become the primary life sustaining forces, the common denominators. Although lighthearted in tone, there is an undercurrent which tells you that this unexpectedly idyllic cocoon cannot last. A clever and original work of magical realism that will also make the reader take stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"After this one? I bought all her books","review":"Oh - this book! This wonderful, amazing, lyrical, gut and heart-wrenching book. This was the first book I read by the incredibly talented Ms. Patchett - and upon finishing it - I promptly went about buying everything else she's written. The characters are so beautifully drawn, the language is so evocative, the feelings behind the words are so intense... I just loved this book and was so sad that I eventually had to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, tragic book","review":"Patchett's novel Bel Canto is the sort of book that inspires me to read more. The words, like the musical themes resonating throughout the work, are truly lyrical. The story of a kidnapping gone awry is fascinating and engrossing. You feel for both the kidnappers and the victims, which is no small feat. As both sides remain trapped in the presidential estate in an unnamed South American country, you can imagine them living the rest of their lives there, together. But you know this is not meant to be. And while the book does not give its readers a neat and tidy ending, Patchett is clearly no wimp, and the story ends with a return to \\"normalcy,\\" as hard as that might be to accept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patchett's Characters are amazingly real and passionate","review":"Ann Patchett lights up many diverse characters from all over the world to bring them together in an odd situation in Bel Canto. Each person has their own history, own background, and own personal story to be told. The way Patchett weaves the different perspectives into the story makes the novel an easy page-turner. You too will fall in love with Roxane and her beautiful voice after reading this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"different interpretation of epilogue","review":"Many reviewers complained that the epilogue was a lame attempt at tying everything together or creating a bit of a happy ending. I saw it differently.For one thing I saw it as the characters' attempt to hold on to their memories and their true loves so it didn't seem that unlikely to me.Secondly it was the stark contrast of the epilogue that allowed me to feel the sorrow of the regular ending. The hostage situation ended so abruptly and I felt a bit numb while reading it. Then the epilogue showed life as it truly unfolded (the characters trying to cope) which was a huge contrast to how I desperately wanted it to unfold (even though I knew it wouldn't). It was that contrast which really brought home the loss of the fantasy world that the characters had created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and Poorly Researched","review":"I'm still stumped as to how this novel won a Pen/Faulkner award. The plot is completely unbelievable, the writing is overly dramatic, the characters are two dimensional, and it appears that the author completed little or no research on Latin America, international politics, hostage crises, translation/interpretation, opera or any of the the subjects she touches on. Add to this the weak ending, and the book is simply a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Waiting a whole month after paying for this purchase and finally was informed that they could not honor it. I was refunded but very poor customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Held hostage by bad book","review":"The premise of this book is a good one: a group of strangers taken hostage by terrorists. Unfortunately, reading this book is like biting into a beautifully decorated cake, only to find that it is dry and stale. There is minimum chracter development, and as a result I found myself not caring about any of the chracters. (Everyone in the book seems to be obessed with the opera singer, but it is hard to understand why.) In the beginning of the book there is tension between the hostages and terrorists, but the author lets the flame die out rather quickly, and in the end it seem as though she is writing about people being at \\"summer camp\\". The book never explores how the situation is affecting the hostages psychologically. The ending of the book is unexpected, and somewhat unbelievable. Very disappointed in this book, a slow read that never lives up to its potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Meaning","review":"The message woven throughout Bel Canto could easily change ones life. Beautiful writing coupled with vivid characterization draw the reader into appreciating the meaning of life. This story moved me and made me care deeply for the characters. I was extremely disappointed when the story ended yet the timing was perfect. The writing is smart and straight forward. No gimics used - just superb storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I felt I was being held hostage by this plodding book.

Our book club was about 1/3 like, 1/3 hate and 1/3 couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious language, worth every moment.","review":"Patchett's use of language is a joy and I'll hold this wonderful story close to my heart for a long time. This gifted writer created a sense of time and place in the lives of these unlikely bedfellows that transcended my expectations, surprised me and moved me. What a delight. I'll be wrapping this book in beautiful paper and giving it to those who appreciate beautiful things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, mis-directed and a realy snoozer","review":"I've read thousands of wonderful fiction books in my life and this has to be one of the worst ever! The book just drags on and on -- I kept reading, hoping that I would come upon a good part, but never did. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Credible!","review":"There was an opera singer who enchants a rag-tag collection of terrorists and captives, the stereotypyped Japanese linguist who speaks just about every language he has ever heard of, with Japanese efficiency, native peoples (practically children) with a purity and innocence of purpose that has a comic-book quality to it. After a few pages, it was predictable and boring. The ending was too pat, and not at all credible. Too bad. It was a major news story a number of years ago in Peru, and something more should have been done with it. The book seemed to serve no real purpose, illuminating the reasons neither of the captors nor of the captives."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped and boring","review":"I can't believe the great hoopla and reviews this book recieved. I was very dissapointed in it and found it rather boring and a ridiculous story with a more ridiculous and unsatisfying ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a cop out!","review":"I have loved all of Ann Patchett's books so I was ecstatic when I saw this one at the bookstore last year. I settled myself in for a weekend of delicate prose full of bittersweet images and unbreakable characters. And that's exactly what I got until the last ten pages. Then it turned into a manure pit.Do yourself a favor when reading this one...don't read the last scene. It's unnecessary and reads like a completely different author's work. I wasn't expecting a Cinderella style ending but I did expect more somehow.If you want to read a really great book by Ms. Patchett get yourself a copy of Taft. Those characters have stayed with me to this day. It's brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh......","review":"Someone I know raved about this book, so I opened the covers expecting an captivating story, and it was, for maybe the first 10 pages. But the more I read, the less interested I got in finishing the book. Slow pacing, uninteresting characters (for example, there's an opera singer that all the men fall in love with -- why? no clue. Roxanne Coss is a cipher of a character.) So I read about 90 pages, skipped ahead to the epilogue, then went back and read a paragraph or two every 40 pages or so until the end. That told me all I needed to know about the story. As engaging as People magazine and deserving of about as much of my reading time. Just not my cup o' tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking read","review":"Intense read, filled with emotion. So many times while reading I'd stop to think how much we take for granted, or how we see people as one thing and that person could be a wealth of so much more.A must read. I advise everyone to pick up a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get why this is so highly acclaimed . . .","review":"I bought this book years ago and attempted to read it several times. I finally forced myself to read it during the holidays. I love opera and I love books, but the words that come to mind regarding Bel Canto are \\"tedious\\" and \\"disappointing\\". The Epilogue seems like something that the author threw together to meet a deadline. If I enjoy a book, I'll usually read everything the author has written. This book definitely did NOT make me a big Ann Patchett fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored......","review":"OK, I heard soo many good things about this book. I thought, I must be missing something!! I got to page 175 and thought I would go read some of the reviews. I found that I agreed with half of the readers. For a while I kept thinking \\"what is so great about this book\\"? I made myself continue to keep picking it back up. It was boring,the plot was very unrealistic and just did not think that the author could possibly keep the average reader interested. I do not like Opera, and I did not \\"identify\\" with any of the terrorists. It is obvious that a lot of readers loved this book, so maybe, yes, I did miss something, but I can only say that it felt like a text book I was made to read in High School."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I've never read Patchett before, but her writing style greatly impressed me. She proves very successful at telling a story through the eyes of everyone at the party. Accepting the challenge of not having a single character narrate the story, the reader is gifted with multiple eyes, looking into each of those eye's lifes. Contrary to other reviews, one aspect that I loved about this book was her character development. Even the characters who, when first introduced, I dispised, or at least met with indifference, by the end of the novel I had grown attached. Patchett is also very successful at the flow of her story telling. Her transitions are very smoooth. I felt she was telling a story that she experienced herself and has retold thousands of times. Very flued. I will admit, the beginning is a little slow, but by the end I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this novel, very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable novel","review":"A character study of the highest level, this unforgettable novel traces the developing relationships between an international group of hostages and their captors in an unnamed South American country. You'll find it intriguing that the author based this on a true incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and intriguing","review":"There is a flair in this work that compels the reader to look into the minds and hearts of the best and worst of us. We are shocked at how everyone in the book is so deeply human. A touching but remarkably light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, poetic","review":"Beautiful, poetic language, likable and sympathetic characters (even the terrorists), and an interesting ending I had to go back and re-read to ensure I got it right! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you begin, tear out the epilogue","review":"Bel Canto is kind of schizophrenic: The story can be a a beautiful version of life transformed by the power of music; characters discovering the rewarding gifts possessed that they had previously not known. To play devil's advocate, it can also be perceived as a concocted Utopia, where everyone is delighted to be taken hostage by terrorists who, of course, are not what they seem to be. Not to go any further, Bel Canto is a very enjoyable read, exploring areas that were unknown to me, namely opera. The epilogue may have been the author's way to tie things up neatly, but it makes absolutely no sense in terms of the character development in the previous chapters. It detracts from the book rather than sums thing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has to be one of the worst......!!!!","review":"I started a book club with a group of friends. Bel Canto was recommended. It sounded great... exciting,profound,complex.. nothing could have been further from the dream. The reality found me FORCING myself to pick up the book and get to the end... hoping I could find one thing that would sing its praises at our book club review. It reads worse than a Mills and Boon romance (the mass produced love stories in the UK). I couldn't find a character I was drawn to, a piece of writing that sang to my soul, an event that had me on the edge of my seat... and to top it all off, the plot appeared oh so familiar. The terrorist group Tupac Amaru took a group of hostages in Lima, Peru, back in the the late 90's and all of them blown to bits at the end. Not an original story, needed strong coffee to stop me falling asleep and I would NEVER recommend this book to anyone, least of all a book club!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Struggle","review":"I was expecting more from this book after hearing glowing reviews from trusted sources. It dragged for me. While I loved the language and imagery that Patchett used, I had no emotional attachment to the characters. I found most of them to be quite shallow and unsympathetic. While I believe that the pace was intentionally slow, so as to add the proper setting for the story, it never regained what momentum it had in the beginning. I was lost in the monotony, and it was a struggle for me to get through. Probably closer to 1.5 stars for me, as, like I said, I did enjoy the prose, just not the story or characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost spectacular","review":"For me this was one of those books where the story did not match the brilliance of the writing. That opinion, however, may have been influenced by the fact that, just as I began reading, someone gave me a very good idea what to expect at the end. It's hard to know how I would have felt about the story without that unwelcome advance knowledge (Spoilers should have their mouths taped shut!!).The writing was indeed beautiful, and the story was compelling, but there were a few parts that seemed just a bit too preposterous and the ending was too abrupt for my taste (no spoilers here!). For one thing, I think she would have been better off focusing on fewer characters and developing them a bit more.Still, I would recommend this book without reservation to those who love contemporary literary fiction. I will certainly read more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Provocative","review":"This is a beautifully written, mesmerizing story about people I came to care about (to the point of aching) by the time I reached its emotional, powerful ending. It is riveting. It is not like any book I have read before--and I have read a few! The plot is unique and intriguing. The characters come together in an incredible situation, all at odds, but by the dramatic ending, they are dancing together in a fine and beautiful waltz. But the ball must end, and when it does, I was left stunned. It is not overly graphic in its sexuality or violence, and yet it manages to evoke strong emotions from the reader. It is romantic, riveting, personal, and spellbinding. Something here for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot me now...","review":"If I was able to give this a negative star, I would. My book club at work decided to read this as it was selected as a\\"Read it, Share it\\" book. Reading it was like sticking needles in my eye balls. And I can only torture myself for so long, so I stopped at pg. 100. This is quite possibly, the worst book I never read.And for the record, the entire book club HATED IT, and we're a pretty diverse group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointing read","review":"I am an avid reader; currently living in an unnamed South American country. I could wax poetic about the beautiful writing and character development in this book, but let's be honest. I was reading it on a nine-hour flight without another option, otherwise this book would have been passed over quickly. It took numerous attempts to even keep going. It was unrealistic, superficial and I feel the ending was disrespectful to the people who made it that far. It was unbelievable and I feel the author lost interest in the book herself and copped out. This book rates in the bottom ten of all time, personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by the Ending","review":"Well, I'd give the ending away if I knew that it would keep other people from being frustrated by this book ;) Yes, the writing is beautiful--I won't dispute that--but my gosh, what a letdown. There's a sense of impending doom, of beauty that can't last, of true love that develops in the midst of crisis--but the end is unfulfilling and cold --almost cynical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat After Me: Repetition, Repetition, Repetition","review":"I thought at first I had a wonderful book, a blend of lyricism, love of music, and romance. Then the absurd happened. The plot plodded along. I felt bludgeoned by the repetition of everything in chapter after chapter. Uggh. Life is too short to read this stuff. If you want something in a whole different class and a hundred times better, read \\"An Equal Music,\\" by Vikram Seth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, if just a tad sappy.","review":"It seems to me that both the positive and the negative reviews are dead on. Yes, it's well written, gripping, a page-turner - IF you aren't turned off by the fact that it's also sentimental and overwrought.If Nicholas Sparks makes you gak, don't get this book. However, I think most people will probably enjoy it: the characters are likeable, and there is momentum throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"push comes to shove","review":"The most profound - and consistent- message in this book is that as a life-threatening situation forces you to come to terms with who you really are (this we commonly believe) - so too should everyday life....as it goes on for weeks, months, and yearsI think it is really valuable to contrast the character and choices of each personality in the story under these 2 scenarios (acute emergency and mundane life)I am withholding the final star due to the ending. It is too politically and practically simple for all of the rebels to be killed. What is the message in that? And what of their struggle continued? The whole of the plot's events should have a larger impact than on the psyches of some well-to-do who now have an unusual vacation story to tell at the next cocktail party......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"Ms. Patchett's book is an easy read. Her writing style is at times beautiful. Therefore, if you are looking for a bit of fluff reading, complete with action and romance, you are unlikely to be disappointed. However, if you want characters to be well-developed and to behave believably or if you want to be intellectually challenged, you should probably look elsewhere. This is not a terrible book, but, because I, based on the high praise, was looking for the latter above, I fount it to be terribly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as a Novel Can Get","review":"This is an excellent novel that flows endlessly, like a river into the sea. I was almost disappointed for it to end. In this age of radical terrorism, each of us live with the fear of being taken hostage. This is a well-written story of terrorists and hostages in a prolonged struggle for various issues within their lives. After the Stockholm Syndrome becomes a predominant factor, the boundaries of those who are good and those who are evil become blurred, as is often the case in reality. If you must read one novel this year, don't let this one pass you by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I caught myself dozing off several times while reading this book. It just really didn't hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing \\"award\\" winner","review":"The BEL CANTO story line is very contrived and contains far too much foreshadowing of future events. How fortunate to have so many talented individuals available to manage any situation. I prefer a story line that draws the reader in, allowing them to make their own conclusions about the events as they unfold. This story is utterly unrealistic and leaves very little to the reader's imagination. I wish I would have realized it was just another sappy romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Belto","review":"Wish I could understand what all the fuss is about. This book was woefully unsuccessful at holding my attention in even the slightest way. I bought it because of the title, only to find out that singing and opera is a minimal part of the plot. I couldn't even figure out where it was taking place - finally got the plot from reading one of these reviews and learned it takes place somewhere in South America.In a word, boring. Hope other readers have better luck with this one. I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you all in another dimension? This book was terrible!","review":"I was completely disappointed. The unlikeliness of the hostage situation, the sheer boredom of the novel until at least page 200 and then the hideous ending...Truly not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"dragging lackluster","review":"I found the read really boring. The anticipation of a great story just died midway and never picked up. Not sure how it was rated highly in the first place. It was like watching a bad soap opera that just never engaged the feelings correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"The only good thing I can say about this book is that the writing is very poetic. The story is dreadfully boring and the ending is horrible. It took me forever to finish it because it was so uninteresting. I don't understand who could be writing all the good reviews...???Don't waste your time. There are much better books to be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Couldn't finish it which is a rarity. Dragged on so long in the first half I just couldn't waste any more time with it and went on to another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel Canto..............very slow!","review":"It became very boring after maybe the first chapter....................the book never moved! stuck in the same descriptions of their movements. I understood the concept. Ms. Patchett explained in her interview that she based it on the Lima hostage of the Peruvian President in 1996 ? but it seems she did not research in what happened in the 4 1/2 months they were detained. Someone would have lived to tell about their ordeal. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book... Weak Ending","review":"I found this book to be a beautiful and compelling read! The dynamic between the hostages and the terrorists, although at times unbelievable, is interesting and unique. The descriptions of the music are very beautiful and the many love stories are unusual and fresh. My only criticism is the ending. It felt too abrupt and more than a little weak. You're better off not even reading the epilogue; Make up your own ending. It'll be better than the one Patchett provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooring","review":"I heard so much about how great this book is that I couldn't wait to read it. I just could not get interested, but kept plugging along hoping it would improve. It didn't. I never did finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian names","review":"I was thoroughly enjoying the novel until the author's choice of Russian names for Victor Fyodorov's brothers: Dimitri and Mikal. It has always been Dmitri,and I have never known a Russian Mikal. I would have thought they were from a different part of Russia if the author did not mention they were from Leningrad. I would love to find out the story behind this choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewrite the opening and closing","review":"About 40 pages into the book I was worried that the author was going to give me the same scene from every character's perspective. And with more than 100 characters in the room, it would get quite tedious. Patchett settles on about a dozen characters to develop and follow through the story. The main section of the book flowed well, but I did get to a point when I wanted it to end. The last section of the book was disappointing. While you expected the terrorists to be killed, the final marriage was unexpected and unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bel Canto","review":"The story takes off and is interesting right from th beginning. Ann Patchett writes with a style I love. Try some of her other titles...you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel Canto","review":"This was my first Ann Patchett book. Her style simply is not for me and I am not induced to read any of her others. If you like her style, you will most likely enjoy this book but, I found it tedious. When I got close to the end, I was only reading a few sentences per page just to get through it. The story itself is a great idea, but the book failed on holding my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel Canto","review":"Hated it. This book came highly recommended from a few people, which is the reason I actually finished it. A very slow read, and I didn't connect with the characters at all. The story, which takes place in current day, seemed so unrealistic to me, in that the unlikely affairs in an unlikely time frame were such a stretch for my imagination. I plugged along because I just had to see how the writer wrapped it up, and was disappointed again. I only suggest this book if you are having trouble sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"As mentioned by other reviewers, the plot \\"speedbumps\\" slow one down a bit, but overall a beautifully-written story, and well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two out of three ain't bad,","review":"This holdiay season I wanted to go with erotic reading, so I got TOO MUCH TEMPTATION, OLDE HOLLYWOOD and this book. I was disappointed with the character choices throughout this book. I was expecting great tensions and twists and got none. It was natural, terrorists hostages angry men, frightened women threats of death for non compliance.... The acquiesence was too easy and the ending will leave you shaking your head wondering why the author ever came up with that. I'm going to watch the news tonight and see if I can find a story to turn into a novel like this author did. So much for originality..... But the other two books were great so I'm way ahead of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work. It's terribly overrated.","review":"Yes, people are raving, and I began to read with greatanticipation, but the book doesn't work. The charactersare not at all deeply imagined, and I never felt close toany of them. Maybe this is what happens when you base a bookon an idea (and one lifted from the news) rather thancharacters.And her prose is fine but nothing great, no sentences you'llbe jotting down and quoting to others.A great novel really brings you deep within the people ofthe story and shows you something new. This doesn't do itat all.Read Russell Banks or Joyce Carol Oates or John Edgar Wideman.They write great novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"i failed to do the research, not something that i would usually like, additionally, not well written, boring and very flat"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who thought this was award-worthy?","review":"I had high hopes for this book based on the plethora of positive reviews and the fact that it had won several awards. Well, whoever decided that Bel Canto deserved an award or thought that it merited a rave review needs to be fired.The idea for the story was unique and HAD potential. However, as executed by Patchett, all potential is lost.The plot is boring, the main characters do not inspire passion or thought, and the epilogue makes no sense. In fact, the epilogue is the worst part of the book. The main character Gen does something that so out of character that it is unbelievable and none of the other characters seems to think his behavior is out of character!Attention critics...You shouldn't give a book an award just because the IDEA behind it is good, the author needs to follow through and deliver a good book.What a disappointment. Skip this book and read something else, anything else. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out well...","review":"Although it was enjoyable overall, it was not that great. (I preferred the Magicians Assistant.) In Bel Canto especially the story drags on too long, the middle has too much \\"filler\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"What's all this hype? As a reader of 2-3 books weekly, I found this beast boring to the point of tearing my hair out from boredom. Absolutely no action, and boring subject matter. This was my Book Club's September read, and if our leader assigns another like this (it ranks right up there with \\"Unless\\"), I'll find another book group to join.Long, laborious, filled with useless detail. The characters have no real definition - the reader knows all about them, but they are lifeless. Each of them, up to page 90 which is as far as I could force myself despite going back to this book 3 times, was more lifeless than the next.If the purpose of plot is to advance the story - please tell me what keeps this mess moving?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost my interest","review":"I am a professional classical musician, and was looking forward to reading this beautiful book about the power of music. To my disappointment, this book turned out to be a total bore, with a stagnant plot and dimensionless characters. The \\"psychological\\" babble only skims the surface of human experience. I'm already three-quarters into the book, and still can't find anything worth turning of the next page. I'm only still reading it because I hate to quit a book I've started. The only redeeming feature of this book is its simple prose, which makes it a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic and engaging","review":"This is an excellent novel that is written with a great deal of flair and originality. The plot is intricate and imaginative, with a lot subtleties and nuances. It's downright suspenseful and exciting too. A terrorist abduction may not sound like too unusual of a plot, but there is more than meets the eye here. Plus the characters are very interesting and well developed. The quality of writing is also extremely high, as well as somewhat eccentric in a pleasing, poetic kind of way. Overall, the novel is excellent on a number of levels that I've mentioned, and I recommend it highly. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel Canto - For Whom the Bell Toils","review":"I fail to see why this book is acclaimed. While the subject is timely \\"terrorism and kidnapping in an unnamed 3rd world Latin American venue\\", the plot is tedious, and implausible. Worse, the author spends 50% of the novel telling the reader about the voice of a primadonna...yes...a selfish primadonna and by the end of the book we are supposed to like her??? Only a quarter of the way into the book I had tinninitis because I was so sick of listening/reading about The Voice. Other characters are woven in but are very stereotypical. The ending is so improbable...it seems the author ran out of time or ink and certainly creativity. Maybe not, since there is only the slightest plot and a boring preponderance of adjectival description of operatic voice. This book could have been saved if there had been some real history woven in or even some real geography a la James Michener...some redeeming value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamon in the rough","review":"Ann Patchett creates an intense and beautiful storyline with this unorthodox and interesting scenario which she equally tops with beautiful reading. I agree with other reviewers who were unsatisfied with the ending, but the book wasn't written primarily for finding closure in the plot but rather for observing the persistent themes Patchett presents.I'm an action-loving guy and originally started reading this book because of the hostage-terrorist situation. I quickly found that this book was much, much better than any action book I had read.The book presents such a surreal yet realistic view of the world that its seriously hard to put it down. Don't listen to the negative reviews; read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucked!","review":"I got this book as a gift from someone I traded books with a lot, usually I've enjoyed all her picks. But this book, despite its great reviews and awards, was horrible. It wasn't even the least bit realistic, given its subject matter, and the lack of dialogue didn't keep it interesting. The romances and awe of the opera singer were absolutely ridiculous to me. To sum up this book in two words...WHO CARES??"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't put down this book","review":"This is the first novel I read by Ann Patchett and it has not only surpassed my expectations it left me wanting to read more. The story line is common, kidnapers and captives start to develop a bonding relationship that is based on their confusion and specific (bad) situation. You know from the beginning of the story how it will end, badly to say the least. But this writer does such an amazing job making you love and understand the characters that you even start to cheer for the continuation of the captivity, for the bending of the rules and success or escape of the so called \\"bad guys.\\" I never cheered so much for the other side as I did here. The novel really makes you think how nothing is ever black and white, good or bad, or can be judged by a single indicator.Aside for the main story line, the descriptions of the interactions between the different nationalities present were so real and quite comic at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I thought that this book was beautifully written. I couldn't put it down and stayed up late at night to finish it.Despite the fact that the plot is centered around a terrorist act, the character's seem to come alive and you actually feel for the hostages and the terrorists.Ann Patchett did a great job keeping my interest, drawing me into the plot and making me truly care about what would happen in the end. This was a lovely book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"This book deserves a standing ovation! I love the characters, the story and the beauty of the words! Ann Patchett has a new fan, my next read will be one of her books. This book will delight anyone who loves the written word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly average","review":"I bought this book really wanting and expecting to like it. I read that it was on several people's top ten book list. The premise sounded interesting. After the first chapter the story stalls, very little happens until the next to last chapter, and the last chapter makes no sense at all. I diddn't care for any of the characters so I gotta ask; what the ...??? How did this book manage to win a prize? At one point the author actually writes something like... \\"then one week later\\". It's a bad sign when an author has to skip over one week's worth of her own fiction to move the story along. Sorry but I can't recommend it. Life is too short to waste time reading so-so writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do people see in this?","review":"I bought this book based largely upon its good reviews. While it is well-written, it is supremely boring. I found the plot line ludicrous and unbelievable. The characters did not seem real nor did I care about what happened to anyone in the book. It is pure hype, sappy, and a waste of time, unless you are trying to cure insomnia. I am not sure you could pay me to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm missing something....","review":"I was excited to read this book after all of the great reviews. Although I like her writing style, the book itself bored me to tears! I continued to trudge along but after being more than halfway through, I've given up. There are too many books on my list and I decided not to suffer through to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting novel","review":"As soon as I finished reading this novel, I started again from the beginning. I think that the people writing negative reviews are probably not familiar with magical realism, a Latin American style adopted by Patchett for this novel set in South America. There is an excerpt from a review on the back cover that really says why this book is so wonderful: \\"the impulses toward beauty and love are shown to be as irrepressible as the instincts for violence and destruction.\\" Too much fiction is written about the human heart of darkness. Patchett succeeds remarkably well in exploring human goodness. This book, if you understand the purpose, and understand the style, is a wonderful experience. I would recommend it for college students that are tired of reading about how terrible human beings really are. After a semester of Hobbes, Dazai, Kafka, and Conrad, this was the refutation that I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Book","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I keep lending copies to friends, and the last one hadn't finished by the time she left for Texas, so I said keep it and had to get myself a copy. This edition is really nice. The cover and the paper and the printing have real class!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating novel","review":"This book held my interest the whole length.I loved the opera connection and I thought the characters were believable. The plot was unusual and timely. The writing language was just right. I loved the combination of opera, language, love, passion, fear, senselessness and accommodation. It is a favorite book now, which I have recommended to many friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I read this book since I had seen the reviews and the premise sounded intriguing. I was not impressed. I thought the setup would allow for some great political, or class, or international relations issues to be dealt with; perhaps this bias wasn't fair to the author. This is possible. I also may enjoy opera, but have nowhere near the love for it as a single one of these characters did. That ended up being a major gripe; I could not believe that everyone loved opera and opera singers that much (oh, and the incorrect naming of a chess piece was also grating). Simply not possible. Finally none of the characters pulled me in. In fact, I disliked almost all of them. The ending was one realistic and revealing part of the book. It was not enough. Reading this ended up being painful; although I am fully aware that it could be because of my personal tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very boring","review":"This book was selected as a book club read, but I am really struggling with this. The premise of a group of people being kipnapped for months on end is just ridiculous. Although the characters themselves are interesting, in general, this one is a slow, tedious read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stockholm Syndrome and boring","review":"If anyone wants to read a book about the Stockholm Syndrome in a fictional situation...this book is for you. There is nothing new in this work that any person couldn't find out over the internet about this subject and with a whole lot less analogies than this novel presents. I'm sorry to say, this is a very boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"If you have a \\"Y\\" chromosome this book is not for you. My wife liked it (she IS a soprano); however, couldn't relate at all to the characters and thought the ending was completely contrived and illogical. Very much in the vein of \\"what are your really thinking\\" and \\"share your feelings with me.\\" Budding juvenile chess masters and choir boy opera singers and the translator that just happens to speak every language known to man (with the possible exception of aramaic) strain credulity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet expectations","review":"I had heard great things about this book, how thought-provoking it is, etc. Most unimpressed.

I wish I had skipped it. Reading 2-3 pages at night it took FOREVER! And, I have to ask myself, why did I only read a few pages? Ans: nothing was happening. This book is truly unbelievable in every way....and SLOW. My impression is that the author has other good books, so I will give her another chance. Can't recommed this one, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel Canto Finisho","review":"I bought this book because of the rave reviews from friends and other sources. I am approximately 3/4 of the way through and have no desire to finish. I feel that the book has been such a bore and letdown that I simply don't care what happens at the end.The story is extremely slow-moving. Quite simply, it is a story of a bunch of rich people at a birthday party who are taken hostage. Sounds like an interesting plot but Ms. Platchet has managed to turn it into a very mundane matter.I did not find myself connecting with any characters and I will say no more. If you want to read the book, borrow it from the library - it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I agree with many of the reviewers that that book is well written and Patchett does a good job of story telling and drawing the reader into the premise.However, like one reviewer, I found myself 100 pages into the book before I decided if I cared or not. I decided I did and felt the next 100 or so pages were actually enjoyable. But the surprise ending was unbelievable, and poorly tacked on to the rest of the story.By the time I had finished, I was angry that I had invested the time reading the book. I don't need a happy ending - but I do need one that has a thread of plausibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland and lacking metaphor","review":"i read this book for a bookclub. we split on how we liked it - as is normally the case. i dislike it. i think it is bland and lacks an external link that would have made the book so much more worthy to recommend. i appreciate the love stories, opera references and the author's deliberate rebuking of stereotypes relating to nationality and gender. there is a factual basis to this book and a little more political or socio-economic commentary however subtle would have been appreciated. There are reasons to like this book but there are so many better books than this to read. quite honestly i'm surprised this book has received as much fanfare as it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like I expected","review":"With all the hype surrounding this book, and all the awards, I thought I couldn't miss by reading it. This book frustrated me the way it droned on without much of anything happening. Unless of course you count hostages falling in love with fellow hostages unpredictable and interesting. The ending was terrible. It was as though Patchett decided she needed to finish the book on the double, so in the span of a few pages all the bad guys get killed, the adulterer gets killed (how convenient that now he doesn't have to face his wife), and the only ones left are the singer and the translator. I found that particular aspect of the story nauseating. I have read other books by Patchett, so I know she's not a bad writer; she just didn't realize her potential in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype....","review":"I read this book after seeing the title on several lists - awards and whatnot - and I was very disappointed. I agree with other reviewers who say that any romance under these circumstances would be ridiculous. Once the romances started in earnest, the book became just another romance novel. I'm all for light beach reading, but I hadn't expected this book to be in that catagory.Maybe I should have waited for summer to read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits and starts","review":"I wasn't especially fond of this novel, but by its ending I found myself a big fan of Ann Patchett. I had difficulty getting 'into it' for the first hundred pages or so, but soon enough I was completely enthralled, and actually surprised when it was over.The novel's plot isn't anything revolutionary, but Patchett's skill at multileveled character development is simply astounding. I'm now looking forward to reading her other works.But, minus one star for that worthless epilogue. Skip it, really. Remember, you can't un-read things. And you'd *want* to un-read that epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"After seeing Bel Canto on many lists, I thought I would check it out. The premise of the book sounded interesting and I thought it would be suspenseful. Instead it turned out to be a lame romance novel with a disappointing ending. I appreciate the moral of the story about slowing down and really learing what makes you happy but most of the plot seemed implausable. You know that there can't be a happy ending, but how about more than one only 3 paragraphs long! That was the biggest disappointment of the book. You finally start to feel for the characters and then you're dropped without any closure. And don't even get me started on the ridiculous \\"plot twist\\" epilogue.I would not reccommend this book to anyone who likes a complete story. While the writing is good, the story left me hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent writing, mostly boring, totally unbelievable...","review":"Basically a Harlequin romance but better written. There were a few stiff lines, yes, like \\"...the silk folds of her brain\\" but for the most part, 'tis better fare than the pure, adulterated romance stuff. Unfortunately, though, this may be even more farcical than your average Harlequin affair: The plot is wholly implausible.A lot of women will like this, I suppose; a lot of men will be bored to tears, like I was.Not a lot of grit, the stuff of life--mostly a lot of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far-fetched fantasy","review":"From the moment this book starts the credablity is lost. The terrorists come in through air conditioning ducts in the house by opening a grate. What house ever had ducts big enough and a vent to the outside for air conditioning? Someone should tell the author and the editor that the \\"rook\\" chesspiece looks like a castle and does not have a horse's head as described in a chapter. Also ridiculous is the image presented of photographer's flashbulbs popping in the middle of the day. Whouses bulbs these days and especially during daylight.If you are a strict Christian you won't wish to read this book.One character commits adultery and two other characters fornicate with each other. And the author offers this up as acceptable romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlikely Love Story","review":"Don't be put off by the unlikely subject of this moving and beautifully written novel. Even the author, who I met and heard speak in May 2002, has trouble describing her unusual set-up. It's about opera (of which she knew nothing when she started writing the book) and hostages, a most unusual combination. Yet Anne Patchett controls the story like a well-rehersed symphony. And yes, as the action unfolds it becomes less a political treatise and more of a love story.The characters are extremely well-drawn, from the ineffectual Vice-President to the selfless priest to the twitchy terrorists, mostly ordinary men and clueless teenagers who find themselves stuck in a no-win situation. Unlikely relationships form and love blooms in spite of impossible barriers of language and nationality.And if the ending seems a bit tacked on, know that the author assued me that true love reigns. And she should know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Marketing Ruse Poorly Written Story","review":"This over rated book can only be popular due to the subject matter, i.e. terrorism. It's so boring, and I can't believe that people actually liked it. My entire book club hated it. I could barely get through it, hoping that the ending would redeem the book, and it was even more horrible. Just each day went on, and the next, nothing happening. And that insipid opera singer, who can't even sing without her written music, what kind of professional is that? Opera is not the freaking garden of eden for heavens sake. It's just a lot of gratuitous high singing. Sure, anyone can vibrato. Try singing clearly. There's a trick.The obvious attempt to get us to see the artistic beauty of the terrorist and their lost potential is the only redeeming quality, and that reference was amateurish and contrived.Do not waste your time. The marketers have created a ruse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel can't oh","review":"Sorry. My 2nd PATCHETT book. I guess we don't speak the same language! Fiction should at least be entertaining as a payoff for the investment of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"condescending, patronizing and empty of wit","review":"Patchett 's characters feel like miniature toy humans--- cute, but incapable of stepping outside the caricature that Patchett so repetitively describes. The essential premise is promising, but Patchett fails to take advantage of it and instead relies on the kind of silly melodrama that El Presidente Masuda stayed home to watch. The result is tedious in the extreme. I felt as if I had been taken hostage.Patchett does know how to write. If only her characters were genuinely interesting, instead of stereotypes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"What a letdown! Having heard great things about this book I was set for a fine read. Reading a few of the reviews here I just have to understand that one person's treasure is...well you, know. And this book is as cliched as that old expression. Character development? Amateurish and simplistic. Thin Plot? Absolutely! Fascinating evolution of the characters? Huh? Improbable and arbitrary is more like it. Plot resolution? Foreshadowed is too kind...telegraphed is more like it. An exception is the unlikely pairing of two characters after the resolution and that is simply another two-dimensional element of a two-dimensional novel. Perhaps it is an attempt at trying to make the book more intriguing with an \\"unhappy\\" ending...one would have to care about the characters for that to work. I was only happy that this tired tome HAD finally ended. Sorry...thanks for playing! There are many fine novels out there...please try again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor excuse for a book","review":"If I could, I would give it a minus 5.How can such inacurate drivel receive the reviews that it did.I want my money back !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A study in minutiae","review":"I bought this book because I am a singer. I heard on NPR that it is being made into an opera. That sounded intriguing. I must preface my remarks by saying that the book I read before this was the autobiography of Maria von Trapp. Obviously, I had just come from a book that was full of twists and turns, close calls, movement from country to country, etc. What was SO FRUSTRATING about this book is its over-reliance on minutiae. The majority of the book takes place in one room. Toward the end, the characters start to travel to other rooms in the house. I became mildly interested when the plot began to turn on the eventual interaction between the characters. Perhaps I am just not a fan of this genre. Perhaps \\"magical realism\\", as this book has been labeled, is not for me. I have no problem with Patchett's writing ability. The writing is poetic and informed. I just feel that the plot was very flat until a spike at the end followed by an unusual epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad spelling","review":"I haven't finished the second chapter yet, and all the spelling mistakes in Spanish are getting on my nerves (not to mention the use of some words).

Ann Patchett is wonderful writer with unusual story lines that grip and amaze. Her words sing like a melodic tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel Canto: A Tedious Musical Journey","review":"Let me begin by saying I am an Opera Buff. I am also a singer. So for me to tell you this book is one, long, tedious read is quite a departure from what you might expect. I kept on reading it, bored as I was, because so many people had recommended it I just kept looking for something compelling to happen. For more than 300 pages, nothing much happens. There were some interesting moments at the end, but you shouldn't have to read an entire book to finally discover something compelling. So,unless you like wishful, fantastical plots, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Ann Patchett creates another wonderful story telling experience. I love her ability to tell a beautiful story and keep your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of mystery set in a foreign country","review":"It takes a long time to get through. The characterizations are well defined. It is taking a long time to get through and I am still reading, but will finish it, as there is enough mystery that I won't to find out how it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"thought it would never end","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this novel because of the excellent reviews and from a recommendation, but I have to admit I was very disappointed. It was boring, very slow and I couldn't get into it. I didn't care much for the characters and their love of opera. It would not end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and drawn out with a rushed and horrible ending","review":"Grueling needless descriptions, but I thought that it might get better so I kept reading it. It took me a very long time to really start getting into it. I did start liking some of the characters. At least I was able to finish it. I got so SICK of everyone worshiping the opera singer in such an unrealistic fashion, and I like opera. And they were in that house for how long?? Ridiculous. And the ending made it feel like the author simply got sick of writing the book and had to bring it to a swift end. I could think of so many better endings. What is the point of developing the characters so well just so they can be swiftly eliminated at the end. Stupid. It could have had a fabulous ending, which is where I thought the author was taking us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleasant read","review":"For me, Bel Canto was extremely overwritten, had stereotypical foreign characters, and an inane story line. I struggled to read it as my mind kept wandering and I kept wanting it to end. The main character was completely unappealing. The hostage situation, ridiculous. Overall, I found this book extremely disappointing and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLOT MOVES LIKE A GLACIER...ZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"you'd think with a premise like this book has,it would be a page turner. oh my. couldn't be farther from the case. i started this book at thanksgiving, shelved it and returned to it only after my book club insisted on reading it for march. i'm STILL slogging through it. while there is technically nothing wrong with patchett's writing, it is just tedious, dull and uninteresting. the plot moves along at the speed of a glacier. save yourself a few bucks and take a pass on this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people who know Latin america","review":"While one can't expect an author to only write about places she knows, readers who know about Latin American politics may find it hard to stay engrossed in this book. There are too many times I found myself distracted by the hodge podge of generic Latin American qualities lumped together into one fictional country and I was reminded of an 1980s old plot on All My Children that took place among the banditos and federales \\"in South America\\". But then, Bel Canto is meant to be operatic. We don't listen to Aida to learn about Egypt. So, if you are a reader who doesn't care about stuff like that, you will probably really enjoy this book. If you do, reading this will probably annoy you and make you feel like a curmudgeon \\"malgre lui\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, Fabio should have been on the cover","review":"I seriously cannot believe I wasted my precious time reading this book! The ending is so horrible that I am sitting here wondering what in the heck happened???? I am so dissapointed in the ending that it just soured the rest of the book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and breath-taking","review":"I belong to a book club and this book was our pick for April. At first I was leery of the combination or terrorism and opera but was hooked from the moment I started reading. Ann Patchett's writing is luminous and you can feel every aspect of the story. It's like you are actually there with the characters. Her descriptions are detailed and specific without being too wordy. You never feel bogged down in the story. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that likes a good book and a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointing waste of time","review":"This is one of the those books that makes you mad you wasted your time on it. I can't imagine why anyone thinks this is good literature? It could have been a very interesting story, but you come out knowing little more about the characters than their \\"base\\" descriptions which you painfully hear over and over and over again.My book was actually missing 16 pages (not sure why) but I read on expecting that not much would change. And it didn't. I just had the advantage of missing another 16 pages of fluff.How could this book win awards?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put this book down & stop reading it if you find yourself rolling your eyes over the excessive flowery sentiments in this book","review":"I completely agree with the reviewer below who gave the advice for us to put the book if you find yourself 'dragging\\" through the book for the 1st 20 pages or so...It really does get worse. Ann Patchett describes her main characters with too much sacharrine, I felt I was getting cavities while reading it. She describes them like a mother who brags excessively about her only child. It just got extremely boring, agitating and too predictable. The way the opera singer was presented was so unrealistic. It gets to be overkill at a certain point I think. I got through 5 chapters and had made a wise decision that I'm not going to finish this book. Ughh..I was so disappointed. Had high hopes for Bel Canto though and her writing style and seriously think that this book was over rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"'like reading in slow motion?","review":"I have to read this book for our book club. I can't believe it has won so many awards. It's so far fetched. I've got about 100 pages to go and I'm fed up to the teeth with it. The characters have absolutely no substance - I'm so sick of hearing about Roxanne's dazzling voice and presence. Then there's Gen with his masterful language abilities - he has fallen in love with a terrorist whom he teaches English to in a cupboard.....This book is dreadful and I fall asleep between chapters. When will it end? Oh I read the end already (just to see if it gets better at all) and it doesn't...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book is boring, pretentious, and overdone. It is obviously the product of a person who has attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop. This is not intended as a compliment. Writers workshops can teach a person to write reasonably well. They cannot make great writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Ending","review":"The only saving grace was the sentence structure and her writing style. The plot was long, drawn out and incredibly repetitive. And the ending was terrible... She summed it up in 2 pages. I continued to push through the book, hoping the ending would make it exciting...but alas, I was disappointed. I do not recommend this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid storytelling","review":"Moronic, simplistic plot. Little character development. This \\"award winning\\" book did little to pique my interest or make me care if anyone made it through the contrived hostage-taking. And the epilogue...give me a break!Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"novel trivializes terrorism, political unrest, and art","review":"Even before September 11, I would have found this novel--with its stock characters (South American terrorists, Japanese businessman, banana republic politicians) somehwere between offensive and dull. Though the author is a wonderful writer, her use of stereotypes and central casting characters and settings ultimately trivializes what could have been an interesting fictional meditation on the power of art. The smugness, insularity, and the connotative shortcuts could only have been written by an American for whom issues such as beauty, justice, and culture are not life-and-death (literally or figuratively) issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth my time","review":"i truly loved The Magician's Assistant. i was,however,totally disappointed by Bel Canto.

Poorly written and poorly researched. Ann Patchett tris to illustrate how unpredictable love is, yanking on heartstrings trying to make us believe, but ends up with disjointed drivvle.318 pages worth of wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Eyesight","review":"The book has an unbelievable story line, no action, wooden characters and an ending out of left field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Overly written","review":"I didn't like this book at all.

I bought it because of the good reviews on Amazon (Patchett's relatives?) and I have yet to care about any of the characters or the thin plot. Feels like walking on a sticky floor. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This book was a disappointment. While the plot was initially intriguing, I lost interest quickly. The characters were unrealistic and the writing style was excruciatingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author didn't do her homework","review":"Two things I appreciate in a novel are an intriguing plot and beautiful prose. Bel Canto began with the promise of both, but the story fizzled from lack of conflict until the final pages. However, the major complaint I have with this book is that she calls the interpreter a translator. Translators work with documents. Interpreters work with the spoken word. I'm quite surprised that the author didn't research the profession of one of the main characters, and not even the editor caught this glaring error. There could be a gripping tale woven from a situation such as this one, but Bel Canto isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start that gradually grows tedious and boring","review":"I read some great reviews about this, and was anxious to read it. I read a lot, and love great writing. However, after 200 pages of this thing, I just couldn't take it anymore. What started off as intriguing and suspenseful gradually turned tedious and implausible. Ms. Patchett's characters seemed to lose more of their charm each day the hostage situation dragged.........on.Eventually, I didn't care about any of them. I just don't see how all those men could suddenly fall in love with Opera and the diva. I have a hard time believing that the people \\"outside\\" would do nothing for four months - c'mon! Mr. Hosokawa...who could like him? Roxane Coss...diva is right - totally unlikable. Gen...great potential for development until his juvenile infatuation with the little terrorist. I don't care what happened. I had to quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull characters and very little plot","review":"I found it difficult to care about a single character in this book, of which there are many. The author uses the omniscent viewpoint, but fails miserably in developing any one character to the point that oneou can like or dislike them. The plot is very slow, so there is really nothing to carry you on. Even the grammar is sometimes amateurish. Some people adore this book, but they're relating to something in it that I simply cannot locate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under developed and disappointing.","review":"I was really excited to get this book after reading the great reviews. However...it just dragged on and on. I simply could not connect with the characters. I just didn't care about them. The author has a beautiful style of writing, but lacks the ability to fully develop the characters in this book.The plot was thin and could have been written by anyone. Perhaps if I was an avid fan of opera I might have enjoyed it more. Many parts were just a bit over the top of reality. I could believe a translator who fluently spoke five languages, but when Gen speaks in eight or more, that strikes me as a bit far-fetched.I finally made it to the end, only to be disappointed again. That type of ending would have happened realistically within the first week or two. But 4 1/2 months later??It was a very disappointing book from a very talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel [Whato]","review":"I'm sorry, but I am a serious reader of good books and this is definately not one of them. [...] it is shameless to trick people into thinking this is literature because it has opera as its backdrop. This is not literature; but rather a long version of a predictable hollywood movie script, complete with overly-dramatized characters and a ridiculous plot. While I do admit that basing a novel on a hostage scene in South America is a somewhat exciting idea, the actual plot is ludicrous. Opera-loving jungle terrorists! A country's president who skips an important dinner to watch his favorite TV show......gimme a break Ann Patchett! The writing is technically fine and there are some mildly interesting characters, but the plot is so unbeleivable it makes the book utterly unenjoyable. If your idea of art & creativity is daytime soap operas and cheesy made-for-TV movies, then you will probably like this work. If you are seeker of good literature, then don't waste your time on this silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like disappointing endings, this is the book for you","review":"If you like character development that goes nowhere, and an abrupt, disappointing, anti-climactic ending, then this is the book for you. The author did a good job of roping you in for the first 316 pages, and then completely disappoints you in the last 2. The plot literally went nowhere. Why develop characters in superfluous detail, then not tell us what happens to them? It almost seems the author ran out of energy to completely finish the story. You grow to feel for certain characters, then in 1 sentence, they're gone, with no more mention of them. And some of the main characters aren't even mentioned at all during/post climax. What an extreme let down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I heard Ann Patchett on NPR and enjoyed listening to her so much I bought three of her books. I'd already read Magician's Assistant (but had forgotten). I really enjoyed Bel Canto. It was very easy to get close to the characters so much so that I was devastated by a certain section of the book. The ending took me by surprise and there wasn't much of a bridge to it. I had to go back and reread to see if I missed anything. Alas, no. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing & unpredictable","review":"This book had a very unusual plot and unexpected ending. I loved getting to know the characters and observing how they reacted with each other. What happens when a group of people from all walks of life are forced into a situation where all of their roles, status, money, and skills are turned around. The poor have the power. The rich, sucessful are deamed powerless. And in a \\"hopeless\\" situation, people find love for each other and for the beauty of music and their own individual talents. I really enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"Imagine eating a bucket of popcorn, and then discovering a dead cockroach on the bottom. That's how the \\"epilogue\\" to Bel Canto works. Patchett has spun us along, whispering \\"Imagine THIS happens,\\" and because her language is vivid and the fantasies appealing, we agree over and over, knowing full well that \\"THIS\\" only happens in the imagination. Then reality dumps a hailstorm on the sandbox. Fair enough.If she had stopped there, she would have had a lyrical tale, not so much cautionary (Pretty maids all come to dust) as whimsical (Isn't it nice to think so?). If she had, as one reviewer suggested, gone with the humor that the story inevitably creates, since it runs contrary to our and the characters' expectations, she would have had a book not so different from Bel Canto. Instead she gives us an epilogue centered on event that is neither a satisfying fantasy nor likely in the real world.Give it a read, if you don't mind cockroaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opera, Terrorism, Love, International Intrigue: WOW","review":"This is a beautifully written novel about a houseful of dinner guests who are taken hostage by terrorists. The dinner is at the home of a South American vice president, and the attendees are successful international business people (including a famous and beautiful opera star). The only people in the book who are not wealthy and privileged are the terrorists, who Patchett also has a knack for making you care about.I enjoyed this book thoroughly and did not put it down until it was through. It was captivating and interesting from start to finish. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some rich descriptive passges but poor structure","review":"I found this book very disappointing in the end. Some of the writing was very evocative and quite beautiful, but just when you were feeling like you were enjoying being immersed in the words, something jarred you out of this feeling. As a novel I felt it was quite unbalanced and ran out of steam. One desperate fan in my book group defended it by saying this was deliberately done to evoke the hostage drama running out of steam. Please! And the ending was appallingly crass and tacked on. Utter tripe was my overall feeling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nectar for the soul","review":"Easily one of the most beautiful and engaging books I've ever read. (And I almost didn't read it -- did I really need a novel about a black-tie dinner party held hostage by band of terrorists?) It is enchanting, insightful, tender, charming...and above all, exquisitly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Wait for the inevitable movie","review":"I think Ann Patchett had a love affair with someone closely resembling Roxanne Coss and wanted to send her a valentine...this book must be it. This character does not merit the fawning every other character performs on her behalf, and the whole concept of these \\"Stockholm syndrome\\" characters acting the way they do is way beyond concocted. Save yourself the burden of reading the story, as this is the precise type of drivel Hollywood loves to produce into an overblown movie (Think of \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" and you'll know what I mean)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Believable, Tedious","review":"I read this book for my Book Club and was very disappointed. The author spends a great deal of time creating these one dimensional characters, who then suddenly behave so far outside the believable that you want to just stop reading the book altogether. I could not empathize with a single character in this tedious book. And the ending happens quite suddenly and unsatisfactorily. The Epilogue is the worst part of all- leaves you feeling totally perplexed (\\"How did THIS happen??\\"). With so many great books out there, I felt I had wasted my time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible writing","review":"I loved this book. I couldn't wait to get to it in the evening and then was sorry when it was over. I re-read parts to keep it going in my mind. The character development was convincing and I equated Roxanne with Sarah Brightman and the impact she might have on a group of hostages, placing myself in the room. The ending was shocking to me although I ended up thinking it was logical. Afterwards I could not imagine any other ending making better sense, and that's the kind of book I quite enjoy. It was well worth the read and highly recommended. I only gave it a 4 instead of 5 because there were some slow parts that dragged on a little. However, loved the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the hype about????","review":"I ran across this book at a book sale and bought it because I remembered seeing it on the best sellor list a year or so ago. My expectations were high because it had apparently sold so well. I see that other reviewers praise it highly. Frankly, the story just didn't work. There are some good scenes and some interesting character development, but this is one that I'm really not recommending to friends. Maybe its me, but Bel Canto just didn't ring my bell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bought this book after hearing some rave reviews. I was disappointed in the lack of information about the motivation for the terrorists. I am not an Opera fan, so all the people who were in love with the Opera singer just because she was good at Opera and was young and pretty seemed shallow. The opera singer herself seemed rather shallow & I never really understood why she fell in love with Mr. Osikawa. He liked her voice - but so did 20 other men there. He was the richest, but nothing else seemed to set him apart. Also, the emphasis on beauty was a bit annoying. Carmen & Roxanne were pretty, therefore they were good and kind a sweet. Beatrice was not, so she was stupid, mean and selfish. I know this wasn't the intention, but that's how it struck me. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare","review":"Many people seem to love this author and while I concur she is a good writer, I find it difficult to believe what she writes about South America. Perhaps it isn't easy for me make the leap with her because I've spent a considerable amount of time in South America and find what she writes about it, even with her self-proclaimed immersion through \\"four days of research,\\" is not authentic. I found her depictions of South America to be colonial at worst and tedious at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"This was a beautiful novel, so deserving of its win of the Pen Faulkner Award the year it was published. There is a dreamlike lyricism throughout the story that juxtaposes with the horrific element of terrorist, hostage taking. As the kidnappers and those kidnapped spend weeks together, they develop strong relationships, some loving and some deep friendships. They become their own entity, tucked away from the world that at times seems to have forgotten them. The tie that binds them is music. The music is the main character of this story. There is magic in the music that makes reality dissolve. The ending is justifiable and fitting. It could be no other way.Patchett has taken a real headline story and fictionalized and infused it with elements that make the reader feel like she has first-hand knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The unabridge cassette tape version","review":"A co-worker recommended the book and I bought the cassettes as I had an automobile trip ahead of me. Surely this will be a movie soon? It was wonderful.For those of you who already have read the book, but also might like hearing it, I highly recommend the unabridged version. The narratora - mimicking all the accented voices of the characters - is masterful and a joy to hear.Now, the most important question: Does Roxanne sing the words you readers saw on the page? Dare I answer?I wholeheartedly recommend Bel Canto on tape!Just READ, Florida!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick, Simple Read","review":"This book is very elegantly and eloquently written. As beautiful as the words are used in this book, I somehow failed to develop an emotional attachment to the characters. I read this book in 4 days, and was unfortunately tired of reading it and was not disappointed when it was done. I was not enthralled by this book. I must say though, I truly appreciate the author's fluid use of words and let the words flow through me as I read it, but honestly, after reading all of the reviews on the book jacket of this book, I was disappointed that as an avid reader of quality literature, I did not find this book to be as good as the many reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"a story to ponder","review":"It is intriguing to see reviewers on both ends of the spectrum in rating this book. It is NOT an action packed, adventure story. Nor is it a soap opera type, shallow relationship story. Instead it is a book to ponder. Some may find it slow, especially if they have become addicted to action stories, which seem to be the current emphasis of modern literature. But give this story time. Think about it. Watch for things the disparate characters have in common, regardless of culture, economic level or nationalities. How do people in impossible situations change, develop, learn to cope? How do they form a new reality? It is utterly fascinating to meditate upon this story.If you prefer a fast paced story, then read another story as you slowly wend your way through this book. It is worth contemplating. Don't be satisfied with only fast food, when you could be savoring fine cuisine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks promising but is incredibly poor....","review":"I had wanted to read this book for awhile based on the backcover blurb and was excited when I finally bought it. This enthusiasm quickly died as I encountered unrealistic characters, a ridiculous plot premise, and a whole catalog of sentiment best left to trashier romance novels. An absolute let-down and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down with \\"Bel Canto\\"","review":"Difficult to hold my interest. I belong to a book club, and this was the book that the entire club read. All of us had the same opinion....that is, it was difficult to read, boring, and did not hold our interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rushed Ending . . .","review":"BEL CANTO was a plausible novel in which characters at an embassy in an unnamed South American country are taken hostage by native rebels/terrorists. For the most part, the characters are fairly well developed, (some of them you wish you could meet)and the author includes glimpses into those lives which are actually humorous, despite the situation. I found the book fairly entertaining but was disappointed by the conclusion, which was unbelievable and deflating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read twice","review":"This book was an excellent read. It is not a book that is easily read, or that can be read in a hurry, but rather engages the reader to think and learn each character. I really liked how different characters were introduced throughout the book, even though it was a hostage situation and all characters were present, but not acknowledged until the twist of their character came forward. This is one of the few books I will read again. I had not thought about this until reading another review where it suggested that the ending was eluded to throughout the book.It was heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully written, meaningless story","review":"Was taken immediately by the beauty of the prose. Ann Patchett is a literary craftsman of the highest degree. Her descriptions are unmatched. However, did not come to truly care about any of the characters. They did not seem real or fully realized. Also, the story takes strange, unsupported twists. Why does the opera star have an affair with the Japanese businessman? Why does she marry his assistant? None of it makes any sense. And after the storming of the performance by the terrorists, there is no action for page after page. It was a painfully difficult read toward the end; and it was a great disappointment that such a beautiful writer did not have a better imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read","review":"Ann Patchett has an amazing way with words - she sculpts characters that are more than 3 dimensional. This is a love story, but is it romantic love, love of life, love of art? All three, I think. I didn't get swept up into this book quite as much as the Magician's Assistant, but I still recommend it. It is a very unique story, with totally lovable characters. I missed them when I was done reading the book! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful book","review":"I don't know how Ann Patchett does it: she gets into the worlds of whatever she writes about, and in this book she knows the life of opera singer, and of a translator, she knows what it is like to be a hostage, and she surely knows what it is like to be in love and on the edge of death. Wow. And the ending, though disturbing, is exactly right.Brava, Ms. Patchett!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and Original","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I don't often give five stars, but I was so enamored of this book that I immediately got the other books Ms Patchett has written. This is still my favorite, with Magician's assistant in second place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bel Canto in Slow Motion","review":"Very slow mid portion of book. A stretch to imagine this really happening - a fictionalized account of a real event (the embassy take over in Peru or Chile). A few gems in the first chapter. SLowwwwwwww!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern classic","review":"Patchett delivers magical, beautiful writing with fascinating characters and wonderful details. Simply the best new book I've read in several years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This novel was unbelieveable for me. I loved the translator's character and his lover/girlfriend. But everyone else in the novel falling in love like this is some 1960's protest - just ridiculous. All these hostages are in love - ridiculous. It is like Love Actually - all the stories by themselves would be good for a movie but all together - too much - unbelievable. Especially this book - all under a terrorist situation - not happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamlike and engrossing","review":"I certainly enjoyed Bel Canto from the very beginning. Only, the epilogue was like \\"WHAT?!\\" With eloquent language, Patchett slowly draws you into the story of international guests at a dinner party taken hostage.You can see straight into the minds of the main characters,which include an opera singer, a translator,and terrorists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite amazing really. A beautiful, beautiful book.","review":"Nominally about a kidnapping in an unnamed South American country, a description of the plot really tells you nothing of the story. In fact, the story really doesn't matter. This book is about the beauty of the English language, and how in the hands of a master (or mistress), words can draw upon your deepest emotions. It's also the kind of book that makes you realize that you can never be a writer, because your own sentences are pallid and flat by comparison. Trust the many great reviews of the book and read it for yourself. You won't be quite the same afterwards. You'll look at your wife or husband with a little more love, you'll find yourself browsing the opera aisle, fingering a CD or two and thinking about taking the plunge. Most of all, your own life will seem a little more urgent. The fragility of it once again reinforced. Most of all, you'll feel alive. And isn't that what the best fiction is about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating story","review":"On Saturday I finished reading Ann Patchett's newest book, \\"State of Wonder\\" - the first work I had read by this author. (I would give it 4 stars, or in school parlance a B+.) I looked up the author and read about this book, Bel Canto, and the awards it has won. I was curious to see how it would compare and ended up buying Bel Canto at a used book store, and finishing it, this weekend.\\"Bel Canto\\" is the better book - the characters are so much more developed, despite there being more of them than in her latest work. There's a depth to \\"Bel Canto\\" that I didn't find in \\"State of Wonder.\\"There are already plenty of reviews here on Amazon for Bel Canto - I am writing these brief comments so that anyone who looks at my book reviews in my Amazon profile will see the 5 stars and consider reading this book, if they haven't already read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For beginners or those in need of creative assistance only..","review":"I just started scrapbooking a month ago, although I have an extensive background in art. I picked up this book thinking I would get a lot of ideas and tips that would help me add pizazz to my pages.All of the ideas presented in this book were things I had already come up with on my own. I was very disapppointed in this book, because when I'd thumbed through it in the store, I really liked the page layout style they'd used in the examples, but the tips and theory behind them were too simple for me. I took it back and exchanged it for \\"Mastering Scrapbook Page Design\\" by Michelle Gerbrandt, which is a much better resource for anyone from a beginner to an experienced scrapper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save The Last Dance and Coyote Ugly met and had a baby.","review":"I got a chance to watch this flick and enjoyed it greatly. It's best described as being in the vein of Save the Last Dance and Coyote Ugly mixed together, in that it has elements of both in it. This is actually quite interesting as I enjoyed both those, and it felt quite welcome here.The acting is just right in my opinion, though I'm pretty sure it won't win any oscars or even get nominated. It's definitely a fun movie though so if you liked Save the Last Dance, and Coyote Ugly, you may just like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"great dance movie that is not available in common movie shops.Price is fair, story is light and nice. lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the burlesque!","review":"The story isn't so great, and definitely not original; a combination of Coyote Ugly and Save the Last Dance.

He loves it, and I think that compared to the other Hot Wheel playsets that he has gotten in the past (which are now packed away or thrown away) this is the best one yet. It stays together and works like it's suppose to. It doesn't take up much room, and he gets a kick out of trying his other Hot Wheels cars to see which ones work with this set.

Pastoralia touched every part of my heart as if i was there with the characters...it is hysterical and serious....satire and truth...I reccomend it to anyone that is able to read, or be read too.

Why he hasn't been on the cover of Time magazine baffles me, but then, like you see reflected in his work, these are strange strange times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Pastoralia is only a forgettable book when compared to the vast majority of works being published nowadays, but is a huge disappointment when compared with Saunders' debut novel, Civilwarland in Bad Decline. Only one short story from Pastoralia -- Sea Oak -- lives up to the Civilwarland's originative creativity. Those who build Pastorlia up into something of an esteemed work are followers of hero-worship, not followers of good satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"modern life is rubbish","review":"In my experience, people with really provincial taste in literature like Saunders because they think he's \\"edgy.\\" He's funny, I guess, and if you only read the New Yorker and Best American Short Stories, his plots are unusual, even original. Even better, he sniffs at suburban consumer culture, painting it in the most garish colors imaginable. What's an overeducated, culturally aspirational hipster not to love?Many other reviewers here call Saunders \\"compassionate,\\" which seems really very wrong to me. The characters are so broadly drawn that it's hard not to think he's offering them up to us as figures of ridicule or even scorn. He never forces his readers out of their comfort zones, to actually feel something for or maybe -- gasp! -- identify with his grotesques.Compassion is hard, and these stories take the easy ways out. Saunders can find it if he wants, but until then I suggest his readers look for it too. Elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losers & Whiners learn to Hope","review":"I was stuck on a plane with no other book to read or I would never have finished this one.

The stories are juvenile, stupid, shallow, idiotic, immature, repetitive (especially in the stupid phrases incessantly repeated in the lead story Pastoralia) and poorly written, unless the author is 12 years old or younger. To me, the book has no redeeming value of any kind. I am going to Email the Chicago Tribune and complain about the critic who recommended this book. Amazon should come up with some kind of rating system that would warn unsuspecting buyere about this kind of book. Something like: 1. Highly recommended, 2. Recommended 3.

What I am wondering is if she sold space for adveritizing as this seems to be the main purpose for this book. If you want names of bakers, florists etc in your area (if you live in or near a metropolitan area) that this author has worked with, this might be a good resource for you.

The video spends most of the time zoomed in on the womans face and you usually cannot see what she is doing. Then there is no transition to the next workout. She is already in position and doing what you are supposed to be doing. Her explanations are minimal and since the video is zoomed in on her face you have no idea what you are supposed to be doing.

For fans of the style, Thompson's early singles offer a swell \\"new\\" set of teenpop tunes outside the usual Brill Building standards by Carole King and her pals. John D. Loudermilk wrote most of these tunes, which were recorded for the independent Hickory label, and they are actually pretty fun to listen to.

It is packed with information, more so than you would see in a modern book. However, it seems when this book was originally published they did not use \\"binyanim\\" to explain the Hebrew verb classes. Instead you will find a lot of seemingly technical jargon for grammatical rules. Some of the dialogues are dull and instead of using all modern conversations or literature the book sometimes has passages from an ancient story called \\"Holophernes and Judith\\" rendered in Modern Hebrew.

The book's premise is quite unique as it was virtually written by the composers' comments about their music - song by song.

If you've ever enjoyed a Squeeze song I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Reference Only","review":"Wow, what a boring, embarrassing show. It's kinescope, even though it's 1963; it's pretty good kinescope, but it's still fuzzy, which wasn't so much of a problem with the old Colgate comedies because the performances are so good that you forget how bad the picture is. But here, Jerry sings and talks like he's trying to be cool, which has a hollow ring to it. His timing is horrific. His jokes are not funny. The whole production looks cavernous and sounds like it: there is a big, empty quality to it. Senor Wences gets an extended routine, but it is not nearly as action-filled and entertaining as his live performances were, or his shorter stints on other TV shows. Also, the top of his head is cut off in this particular framing. The \\"Synergy Entertainment\\" logo is constantly at the bottom-right of the picture, which I find annoying.If I had seen this ahead of time, I would not have purchased it.

I read and savored it as I learned about a different cultural view.

There's plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing as to who did what, but like the last book of hers I read, What Happened Before He Shot Her, this one too is loaded with inaccuracies about the faith of Islam and the different tribal traditions of the Pakistanis and the Arabs. The scenes she created among the Pakistanis were interesting, but unfortunately too many of them were Hindu and not Muslim. Elizabeth George is a great writer, but trying to use her mysteries to create a better understanding of the minorities is not working. Well Schooled in Murder was one of her best books because it was very British, something she obviously knows very well. As I said, this was a good read, but would have been loads better if she either had better research or more knowledge of the subjects she was writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"pare it down, please!","review":"I would have given this book a rating of 1 out of 5, except that the plot was interesting. This is the third Elizabeth George book I have read, but I couldn't get through this one. The author has an obsessive compulsive style of writing that is irritating--every bite taken, every sip taken--is added as a boring beat, until I want to scream, get on with the story--move it along! Finally, when I realized there were at least 300 more pages to go, I skipped to the end. This author would benefit from an editor who would dare to tell her to cut out a lot needless, uninteresting details. I do think she has good plots, but I don't think I'll be buying any more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"Probably the worst mystery I have read. The author takes forever to develop the plot and then introduces twists and turns that keep the story going long after it has exhausted any energy it had. The characters prove shallow and so does the ending. You'll never guess the ending because it's so improbable and illogical. Only at my wife's insistence did I finish this poor excuse for a story. I'm sorry I wasted my time. Try another writer--any other writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restoring my interest.","review":"I enjoyed the early books by this author with Lynley in the lead role but lately he has become annoying. I have absolutely no interest in his relationship with Helen and find that when the author goes off in that direction the story bogs down. Barbara Havers taking main stage in this book was a welcome surprise. The action moved along quickly and I found it hard to put the book down. I hope in the future Havers relationship with both Lynley and her neighbor are explored more fully. It will be hard for me to accept her in a minor secondary role now."},{"rating":"2","title":"comprehensive","review":"This is my first E. George novel. I liked reading it very much, because it is the first mystery novel I have read in a long time which combines social issues(like racism) with well developed characters and plot. I read the entire novel with great interest and my admiration of the writer increased with every page I read. The last part of the novel was somewhat less than believable, and one could feel that the writer was trying too hard to make the ending suspenseful till the last page. But overall, the story and the way it is told is way ahead of the rest of its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"a surprise","review":"I liked it, in spite of myself. I usually like \\"oldfashioned\\" British murder mysteries, and certainly nothing withalot of sexuality. But this drew me in, regardless. Also, instead of being disappointed that Lynley wasn't evident, I was pleasantly surprised that it dealt mainly with Havers. I agree that there were a few loose ends, but I have to say, that all in all, in spite of my reservations, this was a welcome surprise. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Elizabeth George yet!","review":"All of Elizabeth George's books are wonderful, but this is the best yet! She does a great job of bringing her characters to life as real people, and it has been rewarding to see how Barbara Haver's character has developed from the first book through the present one. I hope that Ms. George has a long and prolific career, with many more books to come"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised at all the positive reviews for this novel","review":"I bought this novel as \\"holiday reading,\\" and, having nothing else, read it to the end. I was disappointed, however. It's not on a par with George's other novels. I agree with the reviewers who say that the characters are one-dimensional and that the ending (both the boat chase and the revelation about who killed the victim) are over-dramatic and unbelievable. I also agree that too many threads are left hanging. The writer doesn't have to describe everyone's future in detail, but some suggestion as to how their lives will continue, once this book ends, would be welcome.One more pet peeve: George introduces too many \\"Americanisms\\" into her characters' speech. I've nothing against Americanisms, but as a rule people in England just don't speak like that. (I know: I lived in England for many years). A good editor should catch those before the book goes to print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated","review":"The book could've been cut by a third, at least. I got tired of all the whining about the heat, and about how women on the police force-without fail-are always treated poorly by men. The author tosses in many asides that are meant to be wry, no doubt, but she's not often successful. I'm not looking for a 1st-grade primer, but 600 pages? Please get to the point already."},{"rating":"1","title":"--- What was all the fuss about?","review":"I love mysteries and was excited to read \\"Deception on His Mind\\" after all the great reviews -- especially since I'd never read Elizabeth George before. What a huge disappointment! I found her use of the language awkward and amateurish, (the slang especially seemed very self-conscious) and all of the characters were dismally one-dimensional. The plot was certainly complex and the murderer nobody I had anticipated, but it took a huge suspension of disbelief to accept the solution. George would have done better to have stopped one plot twist earlier.Overall, a big, disappointing waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting","review":"I plowed through this with my boots on. By the middle of the book it was interesting but not an easy read. That would have been ok, except by the time I waded through 600+ pages, I find she just zips up the book. There should have been even more pages! After all this, we are left with unanswered questions. If there is a sequel, I won't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe Elizabeth George wrote this book !!!!","review":"There is simply no comparison of this book with the other books Elizabeth George has written. I refuse to believe she wrote it. The novel's characterization does not fit any her previous novels. I can accept that the characters from all previous novels were excluded, but even Barbara's character does not follow the pattern set by Elizabeth George. I'm sorry, but if Elizabeth George wrote this book, she accepted money under false pretenses. It is just plain bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very meaty and enjoyable read.","review":"Elizabeth George has done well with her latest book. I liked her character development of Sargeant Barbara Havers very much, but then George has consistantly excelled with her characterization, and she is a leader in her objective realism mystery genre. She captures the isolation of the human condition, and the motivations of each of its seperate beings, while still providing an exciting mystery that moves along.Definitely worth the read. Did not need any editing in my opinion; this is not a ninety-minute read author. I liked the ending. And I liked the strong women characters; so often women characters are either romantic leads or background. She does well with the challenges of serious career women in male dominated professions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound quality","review":"It is always possible that my copy is a misprint, but the sound quality of it is miserable. It's as if there is no right channel, the whole stage is off balance. Sound depth is not particularly impressive. Apart from these serious omissions the quality of playing is rather sound, Papavrami is a noteworthy and accomplished violinist and the orchestra also is rather good. These violin concertos are considered to be among the best of the last century. Unfortunatally the recording is so lousy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true audiophile recording","review":"This recording of the first violin concerto has been recommended by audiophile magazines with good cause. Papavrami is as poingnant as can be without loosing an iota of precision, and the sound is as balanced as one can find in any recorded violin concerto. The miking is precise and although the violinist is presented in a detailed and realistic manner the orchestra never loses focus. I use this to test audiophile systems.

I dont know who the woman sitting on the trunk is but there is a picture of my grandfather on p.114. He is man kneeling at the bottom left of the bottom picture on the page. There is also a picture of my aunt, one of my grandfathers five daughters, on p.93. She is second from the right in the bottom picture.This book should be required reading for the school children on the East Side, it is historically very accurate.If you are looking for a book that details the ground up development of a of a major industrial center and the people that made it happen, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"never received it.","review":"I rec'd the wrong book and I never heard if it was rec'd back toyou.

The clincher was the lame ending... what happened to the main characters? What happened to the original family members?If the producers had spent a few bucks on a more realistic mask for the masked guy and a first rate makeup artist for the little girl, and wrote an actual ending, it could have been a much better film and we wouldn't have felt like we wasted 88 minutes of our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick","review":"Never a big fan of horror, but this movie was well worth the watch.

The authors show, essentially ab initio, how you can start from those equations and understand how an antenna works. And how different antennas are optimised for different purposes.Antennas are described for both transmitting and receiving. There is also a chapter on the advanced idea of antenna synthesis. Here, one starts with a given radiation pattern, and derives a combination of antennas suitable to produce [transmit] or detect it.The maths treatment involves extensive use of three dimensional vector analysis and surface and volume integrals. Elegant treatments. But the student had better be well prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful Seder Music","review":"I was glad to have this CD to use as backround music at a recent Seder Meal.

As others have mentioned, there are also a lot of typographical and editing errors, which is odd considering it was written as an aid to certification.There was a lot of information about coastal sailing, but I'm willing to bet that there are a lot more sailboats in the 14' or less range than larger ocean-faring sailboats. At the very least, if I was the author of this book I would mention it's target audience on the cover, or change the name to coastal sailing fundamentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized but adequate","review":"I received this book with a basic keel boating class. This was the second book I read on boating, and I found it much worse than the first (The Complete Sailor by David Seidman). While this book covers many topics, it is poorly organized. The diagrams are next to useless. While it may cover all the topics of the ASA exam, I would not buy it if I were not taking the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailing instructor's view","review":"I have owned a sailing school and taught sailing for 25 years. In 1983 I was putting together a basic sailing book to be used by schools, when I discovered ASA and Gary Jobson's Sailing Fundamentals. I thought it was a terrific book and adopted it rather than finish my own book. I liked the organization, completeness and casual conversational style. Also I liked the illustrations, particularly the wind circle and points of sail in the later (present) edition. We have taught thousands of people to sail and are still using this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized, poorly edited, generally not great","review":"I recently got a copy of this book to take my ASA sailing certificate. Unfortunately, this book is really poor. The information is good, but it's poorly organized. It's completely full of typos (like the page where they were talking about \\"boast\\" instead of \\"boats\\"), sentences which end in the middle, pictures of knots that are incomplete (and therefore, not knots), and my personal favorite, instructions on folding a sail where the pictures start with a folded sail, and end with an unfolded one. If you looking to buy a book on sailing, look elsewhere. Try the Anapolis Book of Seamanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Get Sailing Made Easy its far superior to Sailing Fundamentals. The 1 star reviews are correct.

The book is very cumbersome and does not flow logically."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure this book has anything to do with fundamentals","review":"I'm not sure this book has anything to do with true fundamentals, but it is a basic, run of the mill sailing book. It's probably worth a read, but there are serious voids that could stand to be filled by other books. The big glaring void is the complete ommission of the attitude required to handle a sailboat wholly under sail, the book assumes power assist. I'd recommend picking up a book by FitzGerald, especially Wind and Tide, as this precious little volume will make a good suppliment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailing Fundementals Exactly","review":"As a Teachyourselfer native english speaker I find the descriptions with diagrams easy to understand and it covers everything.

The sail folding photos are indeed worth a good laugh. The only reason I have this book is that it was given out as part of my ASA sailing class.

I can only hope I stopped reading it soon enough.Interestingly enough, the author of the brief review section goes on a rant about what makes a bad practice test, in which he manages to describe many features of the practice test in the book itself. I wonder if he saw the questions that had been written by an outsourced team, felt a little remorse, and decided to give a bit of a warning to careful readers to atone for the fact that he'll profit from having his name on this piece of trash.

But what's the point? I've already told you that it doesn't register your keystrokes. It would seem to me that this fact would make all the others moot.

Everything worked flawlessly, except for the trackball. This thing is nearly impossible to control precisely. It can take many tries before you finally land on the exact spot that you need to. There is no software control to adjust sensitivity. I thought I would get used to it but that didn't happen. I struggled using the trackball for over a week, then the keyboard went haywire. Certain groups of keys suddenly stopped working. In a way, I am kinda of glad this unit went bad because that will force me to replace it (with a different model).

The wireless signal goes dormant after 5 minutes so you then have to haggle with the USB key and the keyboard to get them to see each other again.

When it starts, the function keys are enabled by default, so you have remember to turn it off while typing or you get numbers mixed in,very annoying as the default feature, but more annoying that you cannot set it and forget it.3. Tech support is non-existent. Go to their site, send an email and you get some goofy feedback about how to send them another email to get them to respond...who does that?

I unplugged any 2.4 items that might have been in competition, sat about 3 foot from the USB plug in, and the drop outs were terrible.

Just for fun, I moved into an adjacent room where my HDTV is wired as a computer monitor (the reason I bought the keyboard in the first place).

I bought this because I wanted RF vs infrared, to give increased range and also be less dependent on a line-of-sight operating position. Having used it for over a month I can say that the effective range is less than 6 feet. I literally have to get up off the couch and move toward the unit to get response. And if there is anything between me and the receiver forget it. A very old (>7 years) Logitech infrared keyboard I intended this to replace has a greater range. I've gone back to using that.2) It constantly loses connection. At least once every 2 days I have to fiddle with the batteries and the connect button on the receiver to reestablish a connection.Do not waste your money.

After about 10 minutes of use, it disconnected. Repeated steps 1-2, used for an hour this time, and it stopped working again.So I called tech support and got the answering machine. 10 times in a row, on 10 different days. Emailed them.

My young children could use this keyboard with no problem to browse around on the PC that is connected to our big screen t.v. Would rate it 5 stars except ...After about 6 months it broke. None of the letter keys work. If I press the \\"P\\" key it tries to print. It's as if the ctrl key is stuck down and so any letter key pressed is really ctrl-plus-the-letter.

Tried calling their 800-467-1195 number and keep getting a busy signal.

It's not too big and has many features. The trackball is quite good--it feels smooth, is relatively large and responds finely on screen. Also, the scroll wheel is a nice feature. Add to that a variety of hot keys and it seems this would be a winner. However, the feel of the keys is so annoying it is almost unusable. The keys feel mushy and almost sticky with no tactile \\"click\\" feel. It is not conducive to fast typing. Also, the mouse click buttons occasionally stick. Finally, the battery compartment is poorly located. The \\"lock\\" of the battery cover sticks out far too much and can easily snag your clothing or jeans if you use the keyboard on your lap. This usually results in the battery cover opening and the batteries falling out all over the place. I have used this keyboard for ~1 yr and I think I've had enough. Maybe the newer productions are improved, but my advice is to try it out at a store first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"The concept is SO GREAT. The follow through is MISERABLE. The ball is way to sensitive despite any configurations I've attempted in the software. It only works reliably from about 3 feet despite any claims made by the manufacturer. Having the left click and track ball so close together causes the use of one to effect the other. If you're trying to use it on a big screen you'll only be frustrated by the lack of precision necessary for the task. Unfortunately, this was made for use in the living room where it's pretty much useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second one same problem!","review":"It seems as though this keyboard sometimes doesn't work unless you tilt it back.

At best, it would move the curser and click ok but when you went to type any text, it would just skip about 25% of what was typed. So it would take you a long long time to type anything out that would work. It ate batteries big time which alone makes this a very expensive gadget to own - oh yeah, you'll be replacing way more batteries than you need to because you'll be blaming the batteries on it's poor performance.

The basic idea of it is great, it has all the buttons I wanted (shortcut keys, scroll wheel, etc.). However, its painful to type with when it skips letters consistently no matter how fresh the batteries are. Also, moving the cursor with the scroll wheel is a struggle. If you are only looking to use it for a few minutes at a time its perfect but if you want to type an email or use it for an extended amount of time you'd be better off finding something else.

But the keyboard trackall has become progressively more difficult to control and you can't open the socket to clean or blow out whatever dust or other contaminant is interfering with it. I presume that's why it has become more and more difficult to control the cursor using the trackball. But whatever the reason, no amount of tweaking from the control panel has helped.

It is pathetic; at this range, one in ten keystrokes just doesn't go through. It doesn't help that it uses the same 2.4 GHz band as the WiFi, so the keyboard stops working any time there's an active download, and the WiFi stops working any time you type.Physically and ergonomically, it's great. the sides make very good handles, and the trackball and mouse buttons are well-positioned.

It works every time, which is a pain in the ass, but I'm too busy to bother with sending it back again. I sent the first one back in hoping it was a fluke, but apparently not.I tried everything. It's within 10 feet, no obstructions, exchanged the batteries, tried another usb port etc. It's a shame too b/c when it does work, the mouse ball is great, the keys and their location are ergonomic.All I can think of is the possibility the 2.4 Ghz spectrum is busy in my area.

On the other, what keyboard isn't? As an every day typing machine, there's not many nice things I can find to say about it. As a remote control for a dedicated media PC, it's about as good as it gets. Once you get used to the layout, you can get around pretty intuitively. For a dedicated media PC, I can heartily recommend this keyboard. For an every day, multi-purpose, or work PC, this is not what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Installation a breeze on vista 32 bit, works great","review":"Prompt delivery from Amazon - 2 day service! Installation a breeze on Vista 32 bit. Form factor combining mini-keyboard and trackball/ mouse just great. No problems working from 12+ feet. Had a miserable experience using HP wireless kb and mouse combo. How did I decide on Adesso wkb - 3000UB? Amazon reviews - thanks guys.One issue with kb.

I've never had a problem with the signal.The only con I would be able to bring up, is the fact that they keys are laid out very close together, much like a small laptop keyboard. Sometimes it makes it a challenge to type, but the alternative would mean having a larger, clunkier keyboard, so it is a tradeoff I have no problem with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient, reliable, good value","review":"In my recliner, 42 inch monitor, keyboard and mouse on my lap. Convenient! Once you get used to the keyboard, you still have to slow down your typing.In a few days you will be typing at the speed the system can accurately handle. Going back to a standard keyboard is effortless. With this model it is a very good idea to blow out (clean) the keyboard frequently. I believe it is a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first, not so much later","review":"About a year ago, I bought one of these to use with my PS3 and it was fine. I then stopped using the PS3 for most online stuff because it's nigh impossible to read web pages, etc, from across the room and the zoom function in the browser sucks. So I put this keyboard/trackball into storage until I got a computer for the living room.A couple weeks ago, I got a new computer and relegated my older one to the living room attached to my home theater. I retrieved this kb/mouse out of storage, plugged in the receiver and put new batteries in it.And it almost completely failed to work.The trackball would usually be able to move the cursor, but neither the mouse buttons nor scroll wheel worked, and the keyboard only worked intermittently.So far as I can tell, this thing has no longevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than average design, but very poor construction (haywire after 2 months)","review":"For the 2 months that it worked, it was better than other mini keyboard/trackball combos that I've tried (but that is not saying much at all, since they are almost all terrible). One thing I liked most about this over others was that it rarely needed to be resynched. The trackball worked pretty well for being so tiny, and the mouse buttons/scroll wheel were nice.But today, after using the keyboard for probably only 5-15 minutes per week over the last couple of months, it has gone haywire. Pressing most keys on the keyboard now results in the keyboard sending multiple keystrokes to the computer. For example, the \\"g\\" key sends \\"gv\\". I'm past the Amazon 30-day guarantee, so I'll have to try to deal with the manufacturer Adesso."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"I don't know how this keyboard gets as many good reviews as it got. If you do the math its 3.8 stars (Amazon pads the reviews by rounding up). This keyboard frequently skips characters wile typing making using it a chore. I have tried 2 different USB ports with no change and the receiver is only 3.5 feet away. Also the track ball is unusable due to skipping around probably due to the same issue that make it skip characters.

Example: If you do not type each key very slowly, some of your inputs will be skipped, i.e. (will not type correctly) If you type a word, only half of the text shows up.

After a month of normal use the 1,2,3 and 4 keys stopped working. So I sent it back in. After jumping through many hops to find the manufacture and getting a new keyboard the new trackball on the keyboard stops working after about 20 min of not using it (like watching a movie on your HTPC). To get it to resync I had to remove the batteries, very weird, but still got the trackball problem.I may have just been unlucky and got 2 bad keyboards but that's tough to do.

If they want more than $40, they will have to make a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for HTPCs","review":"I'm using this with my HTPC and couldn't be happier. No driver needed with XP, and the battery life is good. I've seen similar that have touch pads built in instead of the trackball, but I feel ergonomically this design is superior, not to mention cheaper in most cases. I probably wouldn't recommend it if you do a lot of typing because of it's size, but w/HTPC's that is usually not an issue.Only thing I would prefer is Bluetooth instead of RF but that would obviously drive the price up.It does time out rather quickly but that's what makes the battery life so good. I guess an option to adjust that would be nice, but then a driver would be needed.Other than the quick timeout(which doesn't bother me), this keyboard has been flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adesso wireless keyboard / trackball, nice...","review":"nice size, RF works great, and from just about any angle. The trackball is a little stuttery in movement if you move quick, but smooth if slow and firm. The fit of the kybd in my hands is perfect and the placement of the mouse buttons is just right (left mouse button duplicated on both sides of keyboard, and has a scroll wheel on left side)Very happy with this, I use it for a bedroom TV with a computer attached for when I need to surf the web.I recommend this for a lite use, web surfing setup.One last thing, track balls need to be cleaned pretty regular, but I don't see a way to take the ball out of the keyboard to do so. Could be a problem down the line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise ! Surprise !","review":"When buying this mini keyboard, I expected just marginal performance. But to my surprise it's turned out to be very much better than expected. Going from a full sized keyboard to this mini takes very little getting used to.

Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly great keyboard!","review":"For this price I didn't expect much really but I usually have the habit of falling for the priciest most dazzling product instead of one which really gets the job done in an effective manner.Well, this time I went against my usual habit and purchased a cheaper product that looked to have what I was looking for boy was I pleasantly surprised :)This product is compact, light and works excellent. No software, just plugged it in on my Vista 64 box and away it went and works like a champ.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is a bit too compact and that is probably just a personal preference. I'm sure this is exactly what people are looking for. Great job!*EDIT*So after using it for awhile I stopped liking and using it since the keys were kind of awkward the more I used it heavily.Today I found the most amazing use for it though, as a keyboard for my PS3 which actually makes it more useful than it was as a KB for my PC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptably short battery life","review":"I have several wireless keyboards in addition to this one (a Logitech and an HP), and the others go six months to a year on a set of batteries. This Adesso lasts about a month at best. I also have wireless mice that last a year on a single set of batteries. OK, so this keyboard combines the functionality, but should that cut battery life so short?Also, even when the batteries have a full charge, the keyboard goes to sleep after a very short inactivity period. You can't just start typing; you have to click a cursor button to wake it up.I personally like the design, although the keys are not very sensitive. Unfortunately, the short battery life and even shorter inactivity timer make this keyboard unusable.

I found the information useful even when I disagreed with him about his conclusions; specifically he aims to lead readers away from the conclusion that Christianity had too much in common, or was based upon, early mystery cult traditions - although based on the text this would be an easy assumption to make.The main difference it seems is that Burkert treats these cults as dead religions with a certain amount of condescension, while not concealing his higher evaluation of Christianity. He claims that \\"there is no evidence\\" for the resurrection of Attis or Osiris (as opposed to the presumed evidence that Jesus actually rose from the dead) and that Persephone's followers are not resurrected (as opposed to Christians, who will be).Read the book yourselves, but focus on the information provided rather than the beliefs of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I've been researching and studying mythology and rites for years, and I was eager to buy this book.

Wonderful, interesting, creative melodies and excellent orchestration by the Swedish Chamber Orchestra. Joseph Martin Kraus is a very gifted composer. Haydn is reported to have called him a genius.

Innumerable loading screens and tips that interrupt the action, confusing and often contradictory control layouts make it nearly impossible to pull off the moves you want... I'd like to go kung-fu on Shiny Entertainment, but even if they were unarmed, I think I'd lose with these controls. Add to this the horrifying graphics and lackluster, crackly audio, and you'll see why this game shames the name Matrix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Enter the Matrix was a really good game. I liked the action the guns, the graphics, and the extra film footage from the movie. The reason I rated it 4 stars was because when you are in the dark u can't see anything and you are either falling of a ledge or getting hit by someone or something you don't see. I thought the graphics were really good. But another problem with the game for me was the compass that really mixed me up. Also when you type in cheats you have to type in cheat.exe that is a problem if you type in a cheat and have no idea why it is saying command invalid. But otherwise I thought the game was pretty sweet. I think it is the best game that has came out this year. I reccomend that you should get Enter the Matrix. It is an awesome game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"this game still has me in awe and im only finishing the first disc. i see many complain about not being able to control neo, but how much fun would that be if you could endlessly fly away? it is much harder as a regular human in the matrix. One of the best parts is that in most games, the character you choose is a matter of choice,however, in this game, they each have their own side of the stary for you to play through, giving you twice the matrix action.all around fun and [booty] kicking power that we all classify only as...The Matrix"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Okay Game....","review":"First of all the graphics in this game aren't all that great. I mean I know Gamecube doesn't have the best graphics but I didn't that graphics could look that bad for a contemporary game system! Also the game has lots of levels but is too easy. I mean I beat normal mode in two days! Anyway for the good things its sort of cool if you master all the focus moves for fighting enemies. Anyway the game's okay. I would recomend the Lord of the Rings Two Towers instead of this game. Oh well, if your a true matrix fan get it if not get another game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game; other viewers complete idiots!","review":"This is really awesome, you couldn't take me away from it. Much better bullet time than I thought! Real gamers shouldn't care about graphics, they should just be considered the cherry on top, but they're still great!

If youare a matrix fan or you are looking for a good game then buyenter the matrix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atari has truely outdone themselves","review":"What can I say, I didn't truely hate this game with every fiber of my being; just most of it. Granted, on easy, the game had a lot of potential. My friends and I would pass the wavebird around the room taking turns on every level, which turned out to be for the most part, about 5 or so minutes a piece. That is unless you play against Agent Smith, then he backs you into a corner and pounds you into the ground repeatedly. Boring. Don't even get me stated on the ladder animation. If you use the focus while climbing the ladder, it looks pretty good. I don't reccomend climbing without the focus, it's painful to see. Just like every other game, there are cheats, in this game \\"hacks\\" that unlocked a multi player section. I almost had a siezure. I being a button masher, won almost every round due to repeated slamming of the L,R,A, and the occasional B button. I didn't give it 1 star, because face it, it wasn't Brute Force."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Shooter. Ever.","review":"This game truly does rule all, I would give it a ten if I could. This game does have something weird to it, the levels are basically divided into sections, some sections could take 5-10 minutes, while some could take less than 1. Anyway, there are HUNDREDS of different moves you can execute, some of the best including Focus mode, which is basically just slowing everything down, and enables you to pull of matrix-style moves like bullet dodging and wall-running. Overall this game takes roughly 14-17 hours to complete the game with both characters and unlock everything. Which brings up the unique code system, called \\"Hacking mode\\" which lets you hack into the matrix, giving you nearly endless options, and always something new to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix Reloaded","review":"Let me start saying I have never died in this game. The reason why your health meter gos up every 5 seconds and your focus meter you will see what that is. It is hard but more fun so like when attacking a guy you have about 25 diffrent options on what to do as long as you have learned how to do all those moves. The fighting engine is the best in a game. The sound and graphics are top notch. The exclusive footage is just worth it. The visual effects are another thing why this game is worth it,man aren't they awsome. You will be hours on this nonstop because with being 2 discs the fun never ends and it really doesn't. Buy it just buy it is so worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"This is an awsome game, with tight bullet-time effects and a half-way decent replay value. I found it easy with Niobe, but Ghost's levels get harder. But the hardest part is...hacking. Yes, you can use a 'hacking program' to unlock character, weapon, and car bios, drop weapons into levels, activate cheat codes, unlock multiplayer battles (Like a cool Agent Smith Vs. Morphius one), and even get a sword for melee combat. But be careful, it can be frustrating. You just solve the puzzle of a lifetime, then trackers get to you and you lose all your hacking data. Great. Still, it's really fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this cologne","review":"Fantastic masculine, attractive scent chosen as a Christmas stocking stuffer gift for my husband.

I own every expansion pack there is and I was so excited to hear the game was coming out for Gamecube. However, there were a few things with the game I wasn't to pleased about. For one, the graphics are not impressive. Another thing is you can't zoom in as much as you'd like to. Also, the game is very challenging. The biggest problem I found is that it takes extreme patience to play this game because it takes a long time to achieve all the game's goals.I don't usually buy games like \\"The Sims\\" for Gamecube. I like more adventure games like \\"Starfox Adventures\\"(which buy the way is AWESOME!) I'd say, if you're a fan of startegy games, a huge fan of \\"The Sims\\", and have A LOT of patience, go for it and buy this game. Patience is key for this game. It takes a long time to advance. I, having none what so ever, got bored very quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games I have ever played!!","review":"The concept of The Sims was to be able to control a family. The games name origanaly was named The doll house. But since the game was a simulation of a family being controled by someone else the name The Sims was born. I have all The Sims games for PC (execpt online). The game was created very well. Graphics are very good. People speak in simulation language and the curancy is simolians.

Everyone in my family plays this game from my niece of nine years to my sister who hates video games of 31. A warning should be put on this game though, due to the fact that if you play it you will waste numerous hours of your life in front of the tv doing things for your sim that you should be doing for yourself (like going to the bathroom). All in all I would recommend this game to any of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the versions I remember","review":"I put this CD on my wish list before the preview tracks were available, so when I recieved it I was very dissapointed.

I almost gave it 4 stars because I wish there were more pictures - especially of stones and crystals. But the information is so good, it really deserves 5. My other books are used for pictures (reference and identifying stones) and hers I read for information and healing suggestions. This is the first exposure I have had to light bodies - emotional, mental, and spiritual.

The neoprene covering is comfortable to hold in your hands and provides just enough cushion to (possibly) prevent calluses. I would have given this product 5 stars but I think the imprint of the number that indicates how heavy the weight is will wear off over time.

Very nice and heartily recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Comfortable - Too Heavy","review":"I seems to be in the minority here but I really didn't like these safety glasses very much. To be honest I regret having not returned them right away. I found that the lenses fog up, the frames are heavy and they fall off my nose far too easily to be considered safe.

However, I would not recommend purchasing it for use in the bath because water gets inside the ark itself and we have not been able to remove it.

If the ark is kept away from water, it is a good toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute toy, can't use in bath","review":"BAD THINGS: The packaging says that the boat floats, which led me to take it swimming. The boat does not float and the orange \\"house\\" and yellow \\"boat base\\" both became water logged and I cannot extract the water.

Oke needs to slow down and take some time to think between writing each book. I thought it was very unrealistic how quickly the two young ladies became friends considering they didn't speak the same language. This action was sooooooooooooooooo slow. I prefer Oke's more exciting books like the Canadian West series, A Woman Named Damaris, and A Gown of Spanish Lace. They aren't overly sappy and their characters do more than just hug and cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong female characters","review":"I read 2-3 books a week. This entire series is the best read I have had in ages. I think I could have easily read another 10 books in the series. I didn't want it to end. I love strong female characters like those found in this book. I tried a couple of books by Oke alone. I couldn't get into them because the female characters where extremely weak, always crying, stopping to pray every 5 minutes & their primary goal in life was finding a man. God is a feature in this series, but I didn't feel as if I was being preached to constantly like other Oke books. The only negative I have about this series is that I think that another entire book could have been written to wrap up the ending. I felt it ended in a very rushed way. Otherwise it was an excellent series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Book","review":"This has been my favorite book since I first read it about two years ago. I love the characters in the book, and how well they were developed. I was unaware of this part of history, and what had happened to the Acadians prior to this book, and I think this book really helps one to understand how hard that time must have been for those people. I have read the other books in the series, and think all of them deserve 5 stars. These books are definitely keepers! To comment on other reviews that keep comparing this book to other Oke books, it is good to keep in mind that this book was co-written with T. Davis Bunn. T. Davis Bunn also has written a continuation of this series with his wife. The writing style is much different than Oke's other books...but I personally think this one shines above the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical inaccuracies are unforgiveable.","review":"We learn through reading and we expect that authors of historical novels will do accurate research.

People just do not act that way.Secondly, OH GAWD the writing is tiresome. On and on and on about every minute detail repeat ... repeat ... just filling up space.

We keep the base set in the kitchen at the back of the first floor of our house and I can't get any remote handset reception in our bedroom in the front of the second floor. Our house is big but not huge. Its a wood framed house not solid masonry or steel which can block reception. Tonight I am returning the phone to the store where I bought it. One other minor problem that I could have lived with, had the reception quality been better: the dial buttons on both base and the handset are very tiny...hard to see for aging baby boomers like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy this phone...","review":"I've had this phone for 6 months and the handset that came with it won't charge anymore.

Unfortunately I didn't keep the receipt and box and cannot return it.

A person cannot talk to a customer support person. ALL the various phone are computerized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this phone and kept it for 28 days. I was very un-happy with the quality of the phone and returned it for another brand. The main reason for this was the extremely poor quality of the answering machine. I would have to play the message 2 to 3 times to make sure I understood the person talking. The digital recording was very poor and slurred peoples words together. It also tended to cut messages off at the last second, so when someone ended a message by leaving their phone number, I would miss the last digit. Also, the phone quality was poor. If you speak at the same time as the other party, the volume for them would get very low....much like a half duplex system. I also had a good deal of static on the line. I am now trying out the Panasonic telephone and hope for better results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Class III Hidden Hitch","review":"I put this hitch on an 04 Jeep Liberty. Installation took about an hour. I threaded the bolts in before installing the hitch just to clean out the threads. The powder coating was excellent. All hardware was included.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice hitch and well hidden but...","review":"This was a good purchase a great price. It fit well on my 2004 Jeep Liberty and the holes on the hitch lined up to the frame perfect. The only issue I had was with the bolts. They where one thread size too large for the pre-threaded holes in the frame. I went to sears hardware in Huntington Valley PA and got ones that fit. The bolts that came with it are grade 8.8 but I could only find grade 8 so I'm guessing this decreases my max load a bit but thats fine with me.

The storyline by the actual directors is also a great touch.But all of that is absolutely meaningless if the game play and most importantly the game controls are simply horrible. There is no intuitiveness here. You run through the level and get surprised and die, then you try again and you won't be surprised and pass as exciting as fixing a car by trial and error.I'd avoid this game if I were you, rent it if you don't believe me but don't drop 50 to Atari's coffers for this mediocre game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe it.....","review":"What a letdown. What masters of spin convinced us to go out and buy this.The graphics, whilst 'ok', are certainly not up there with other type of this genre - they're nothing on Max Payne for example and that's even a bit dated now. Even on this here GeForce 4800 (P4 3.06), with all the detail turned up and antialiasing on, the graphics are jerky and textures are not smooth.The controls are pretty bad - especially moving between unarmed combat and weapons.The SFX and musical score is good - that's the only positive thing I can say.Poor playability, once you've played a couple of levels, nothing really changes.Very disappointing. A big thumbs down to to Warner for granting the license to this software house. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I love how everyone has reviewed this game based on screenshots and video clips, and don't even own it.I have the PC version. Horrible. Graphics are slow on a high-end system, especially with a few enemies around. Mouse control is atrocious, feels like a console game controller - all over the place. Weapon accurracy is horrible unless in Focus Mode (SloMo). Scripting fight animations lock you in, preventing you from stopping or performing other moves (such as drawing weapons) until they're complete. Even the UI menus are severly broken, as using the mouse will result in double-clicking unintentionally. There's severe clipping problems everywhere (enemies guns stick through walls). A patch was released on May 16 but all it did was add a crosshair to 3rd person mode, and alter the startup screen without changing any functionality.This game has potential and with a MAJOR performance patch, could be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Sloppy Sloppy","review":"Maybe I am a putz. But maybe this is just a lousy game. The graphics are not bad, the storyline is a little weak. But the controls suck and that makes for a lousy game. In first person mode, the controls are way too sensitive, and you cannot change the sensitivity or the up down orientation. The characters do things you do not want them to do, turn whatever way they want, stick to the wall when you do not want them to, refuse to when you do. The camera goes off on an angle you do not want. In fact, playing next to walls, I have seen nothing but the wall on the screen while the character is fighting.Personally, this game had a lot of hope. But poor controls, and lousy logic in certain areas make this game a major disappointment. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT worth it.","review":"Alright, the Matrix and Matrix II were great movies (okay, so I wouldn't go that far for MII...) but this game sucks.

It's rather a \\"guess what you are expected to do exhausting marathon\\".Simply put, you are expected to go through a level as if it were a movie scene, very scripted with no logical reason you should jump to a certain ledge or snipe from a certain position. YOU JUST DO and hope it might make some sense.It's probably a good game to watch while someone else who's got the levels figured out plays.But this is just a movie add-on that couldn't survive on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't turn it off..","review":"I just recieved the Matrix in the mail today. I tried to tune out the hype surrounding this mythical video game as best I could. I turned on the BOX and from the get go I was impressed. The cut scenes from \\"Reloaded\\" help put you into the atmosphere to start off. The first baddy I came across I waxed with no problem. As I got farther into the game, I realized the fighting system isnt supposed to be complex, its supposed to be user friendly and just plain fun. You can tune out the hype all you want. But when you disarm a SWAT team member and use his own weapon to send him to glory it wont matter. Just remember, there may be only 2 buttons to attack with, but pushing different directions makes you pull off amazing combos. Graphically the game is pretty, it aint beautiful, but it sure works. Just picture a game where Max Payne is put inside Bruce Lee's body. This game was completely worth the dough. One more bit of advice, you are not Neo.

Surely the development team could have done better in that area. I've played Max Payne and this is the idea that spawned that. Bullet time's done better here as well.Choose from the two main characters in the movie(which I haven't seen by the way), and battle your way through normal guards, agents and I'd expect the twins as well. You have to do things like taking out helicopters, stopping a plane from taking off, and there's even a hacking feature. I lost interest in this game, because I used to be a computer nerd and was disappointed by the shortness of the hacking. That notwithstanding, the action is good, the gameplay is tight, and the story is awesome.

Using a joystick as a toggle button? Come on.It is also obvious that this was a very quick port to XBOX, since the graphics are pretty pad. Motion capture \\"noise\\" is evident in characters who look very shifty and jerky most of the time (as if they are drunk or something). Also, things like enemies guns and even dead bodies seem to penetrate walls A LOT. More evidence that the engine for this game is not quite fully baked.Overall, this game had a lot of potential, and is still quite playable, but fails miserably to take advantage of the hardware, does not promote exploring the virtual world, and has counter intuitive controls.

How do you dodge bullets in bullet time if you can't strafe?!- Graphics on XBOX is very poor- looks like they took the lowest common denominator of graphics and just cloned it for each platform rather than chosen higher resolution textures or applied antialiasing.- Bullet time effect does not show up in cut scenes.- Camera gets in the way of the fight scenes.Recommend playing Bloodrayne instead and enable bullet time all the time.

The controller configuration cannot be customized, which leaves the player stuck with the default annoying configuration.It also becomes clear that this game was released before it was finished. In many places, enemy bullets pass through walls.

You can pull off some cool moves like the Trinity kick, wall-walking, and the famous cartwheel. The fighting engine is very intuitive also. It has true kung-fu moves in it straight out of the movie.

Not a casual friendly as FIFA but is easily the better Soccer game for hardcore fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really amazing as Netherlands is too..!!","review":"I've been playing this game since some months ago and I can't tell you how exciting and how real it is. The performance is real good, the audio comments are so exciting, the stadiums overwiew is so real, that's for it that I can give the game 5 stars. Also, all the unforgetable soccer highlights are in there, names as Van Hooijdonk, Hasselbaink, Ariel Ortega, Batistuta, N. Quinn, Alex Aguinaga, Luis Hernandez, R. Nestor Sensini, Jose Luis F.

I think Konami has a problem with some organization worldwide.The worst is the Nederlands. Their names are listed as ORANGE001, ORANGE002, and so on. I heard a rumor that the Dutch organization [angered] Konami Winning Eleven staffs, and that was the result.

It's way better than Fifa, but the problem is when you go to a local store there either sold out or only have one in stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good A.I. but horrible basics.","review":"I admit this game as good A.I., but the names of the national team members were dead wrong.

There are lots of complex orchestrations here; not very Stravinsky-like, but more in the likes of Liszt and Wagner. \\"The Lark Ascending\\" is a favorite for many RVW fans, and it sounds beautiful. It has a pure English feel to it, and the solo violin should not be ignored.This CD by Naxos has surprisingly great audio.

The first song, boom, amazing. The second song, awesome. The third song...you get the picture. Nearly all the tracks have a lot of meaning behind them and you can tell the band put their hearts and enlightened minds into making this album. It is by far one of the best first listens I've ever had. I would not discredit the album simply because of its Enhanced status, it probably wasn't the band's choice, more like the record label. In summary, the first song is my favorite and ever since I bought it, I haven't removed it from my CD player. OLP Fans or even new fans will be extremely pleased with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected, but...","review":"Upon popping this cd into my car radio, I was surprised at the change in sound. At first listen, it was hard to distinguish Steve Mazur's guitar work(after Mike Turner spoiling us). Needless to say, it is very subtle, and grows on you exponentially. I was not as disappointed with Gravity as many of the other reviewers, but I do feel that they have not reached the heights of Clumsy or Happiness recently. Song #5, Wipe That Smile off Your Face is one of the strongest songs to date by OLP. Listening to this song, I get chills, and the urge to kick someone's a--. This song would be PERFECT on a movie soundtrack. The rest of the cd is solid throughout, with Angels Losing Sleep being another standout track. All in all, a worthy addition to the OLP discography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooo....","review":"It is so sad that Mike is gone, and that Jeremy has been drugged in some way. Seriously there are no catchy guitar riffs or innovative drumming on this album. It is basically all rhythm guitar with Raine singing along, for some people that is enough, but I appreciated OLP for the guitar and drums, and both of those seem to have left the building.

However, I agree with many longtime fans that the album feels like a regression to me. With every OLP album, the band has done different things musically, and the results have been great. Before Gravity, their albums were innovative, and couldn't be mistaken for another band. With Healthy in Paranoid Times, like with Gravity, many of the songs sound like convincing attempts to mimic other bands.The album is a good album, and should do well commercially. And if you like Coldplay or The Killers or any other band that this cd sounds like at times, you should like the album too.The bottom line is, the album will probably be a letdown to most pre-Gravity OLP fans. There are a few great songs that sound like OLP should sound. Too bad the whole album couldn't have been like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like everyone else","review":"This album is decent by the pop/rock standards of almost any other pop/rock band out there. The only problem is that it sounds like any other pop/rock band out there. The things that gave OLP a unique sound have been replaced with run of the mill devices that leave me wondering if I'm even listening to an OLP album. I have greatly respected these guys in the past for keeping their sound so fresh and alive over the course of multiple albums. I guess everyone runs out of gas sooner or later. This latest release is a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Are You, Arnold Lanni?","review":"Bob Rock is not the producer this band needs. Our Lady Peace is too unique of a band that on this album sounds a lot like U2. Ironically, one of the best examples of this is the song \\"Boy.\\" It's a decent song, but the edge that OLP once had is apparently gone. Naveed and Clumsy are completely amazing from front to back, and I fear we will never hear another OLP album like that. Happiness and Spiritual Machines were both strong albums with some very edgy moments. All that happens with another sub-par album release is that I'll get to hear less of the superior older songs when I see them in October."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, to say the least...","review":"I tried copying this CD, not knowing that it was protected.

I have loved all their previous albums and still listen to them frequently. I ran out to buy Healthy in Paranoid Times and have listened to it about 5 times all the way through hoping it would improve or grow on me with each listen. There are a few decent songs, but overall I would be perfectly ok (actually happier) if I had never bought this album. I had also planned to go see them in concert in October, but can't imagine having to suffer through a lot of these songs live. :( Overall, I'm super disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Cd","review":"This is a great cd.

When i heard that he had left because of \\"creative differences\\" i desperatly hoped that he was not creative force behind the band. I gave them the benefit of the doubt with the disapointing Gravity. but this album proves that my inital fears were merited, Gone is the experimentation, the deep lyrics, everything that made this band different.

Raine Maida has one of the best voices in modern rock. Unfortunately he forgot to bring it to the recording sessions. His vocals usually soar with the support of some clever guitar riffs. This disc is chock full of the riffs, but lacks the vocals. The only exception to this is \\"Angels Losing Sleep\\". This is an amazing track which opens the cd with a bang. After completing the disc, though, you find that the track is horribly misplaced and belongs on one of their better, previous discs. It is not like this disc is terrible (I mean I did give it two stars, not one), but rather I feel as though it is a waste of talent. Let's use this as a learning experience for next time boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the band, but this is not their best album","review":"I'm an ENORMOUS OLP fan, but this album lacks a bit, mostly in the last song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get back to Happiness","review":"I have to be honest- OLP is becoming really disappointing.

Their sound's changed over the years for sure, but they never stopped me from bobbing my head or tapping on my desk. When I get a new album, I try and focus more on actively listening to the songs. Even so, this album blended together into a shapeless mass. None of the songs stood out, or had a unique sound. No head-bobbing, or drums on my desktop.I really don't know what happened. I love OLP, but this album is just bland and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happen?! Come On, It could have been better!!!!","review":"Our Lady Peace was one of my favorite bands growing up. Naveed was and is there best album that they made. Now that music has changed it seems now that Our lady Peace is falling in that hole of lameness. Normally when I listen to a new album by one of my favorite bands, I try to stay focus on all the songs. This album, I was about to fall a sleep. Very boring, all the topic in about every song was the same. I think at this point, Our Lady Peace might just have to hang it up and call it quits, or make another album like Naveed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Progressively Worse...","review":"I'm probably one of the few OLP fans that been around since their debut Naveed. IMO, every release has gotten weaker with the exception of Spiritual Machines which marked a slight comeback IMO. Gravity and this new one might as well be another band all together. The only remaining evidence of OLP is Raines voice, which somehow manages to hold it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaky at best","review":"Recorded 43 tracks for the album, I believe it said in the CD insert.... then they must have picked the worst songs they recorded for this album. This album is almost like a collection of B-Sides. Weak, powerless, just going through the motions. Nothing even worth listening to on this album, besides 3 songs, none of which are vintage OLP.I bought this CD for $17 at Best Buy, and I said, \\"This CD better be worth it for this insane price!\\" Turns out, I got hosed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic at best","review":"I don't even want to waste my time thinking about this album, but for the sake of others, I will. This album is an example of a band (or at least Raine) trying to hard. It seems like Raine took all he felt about the world, its events and state of affairs, and forced it all into songs. Nothing on this album seems like it naturally flowed from heart/mind to pen to paper. I love everything Our Lady Peace, they are my favorite band, until this record. I always told people there was not one Our Lady Peace song that I didn't enjoy. Sadly, these album leaves me with plenty. Maybe something better next time, I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst OLP album ever!","review":"Ok maybe I just need to get used to it, but honestly, think of the worst OLP songs on any of their previous CDs and put them onto one album - what do you get? - Healthy in Paranoid Times. I disagree that it sounds like their early CDs. Naveed and Clumsy are their best albums, this does not rank with those two CDs.Despite that there are a couple songs which are gems on this album, namely : single \\"Where are You\\" and \\"Will the Future Blame Us\\".I would recommend listening to a good portion of this CD before deciding to buy it. Do not expect typical OLP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Lady Peace Rules!!!","review":"I will say for those of you of you who are considering buying the album that I am probably biased being from Canada, eh, but I feel that all of their albums are great (note as per the rating system out of 5 I would give some of there past stuff a 6, while giving this one a 5)! Coming from the 90's rock era its still great to have a few bands around that I can just sit back and really listen to some good music. The album itself has a different sound than their other music but what can you expect in this day and age when everyone expects it to be one up the previous album. I do hear the modern edge and would love some more Naveed like albums but I would take Our lady peace over any other band currently on the market. For me I can really feel the emotion they put into all of there music! Keep those albums coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD","review":"Our Lady Peace has outdone themselves again.

What the heck are they doing, thinking, expecting with such a weak effort? If I could pick one work to describe this album, it would surely be tacky. Its really frightening how many bands, when signed to major recording labels, become more and more homogenous. OLPs sound is ruined forever. If you're a true OLP fan don't buy this album and send the band a message! Where are the lyrics that would invoke emotions stuck so deep that it was cathartic to say the least??? I'm completely baffled........"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of OLP's Best","review":"I can't figure out why so many people are comparing this album to the mainstream feel of Gravity. Healthy in Paranoid Times showcases some of OLP's most creative efforts with deep, thought provoking lyrics. True, it is a far cry from earlier albums. I fell in love with OLP's music starting with Clumsy and up until Gravity, I felt their music was only getting better. While Gravity was a big disappointment, HITP definitely redeems the band. The songs are full of emotion as with earlier albums, but a little more upbeat in tempo and feel. Each song is so completely different from the next. Our Lady Peace definitely displays their range on this cd. Don't be fooled into thinking that HIPT is another Gravity. It is anything but.

I hate to say it, but even though Raine apparently went to Iraq and saw some horrible things, he sure doesn't seem too passionate about it. There's a couple cool songs, but the rest are just sub-par to even good radio rock. And I hate radio rock. Their only chance is to get rid of Bob Rock and find their old guitar player.

It's very well done, if shockingly explicit at times. This is no kid show. It also, as others have mentioned, does not follow the book exactly. It's more like it was inspired by the book. I'm sure most people won't care. You'll either get into it or not, depending on whether you like some very dramatic animation with sex and gore tossed in for good measure."},{"rating":"2","title":"TO HELL AND BACK!!! What a ride!!!","review":"I had no idea what to expect from this DVD. It retells the classic \\"Dante's Inferno\\" in cartoon form. I was afraid the story and the media would be an impossible conflict. I was wrong. Not only is the story accurately told and beautifully illustrated in animation, it is SCARY AS HELL ~ literally! While only about 88 minutes, I could not watch it all in one sitting. It was too powerful for me. I plan to watch it again without interruption now that I know what to expect.The animation is at times very violent. I would not show it to a child; however, it would be great in a high school or college literature class.Having watched this DVD on Hell, I plan on spending more time in Church this week reflecting on my sins and failings.Any DVD that can inspire one to self reflection, is worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandon All Hope All Ye Who Purchase This","review":"The production value of this animated feature is rather low. The graphic style changes no less than 5 times in the film with 5 entirely different depictions of Dante, Virgil, Beatrice, Lucifer and even hell itself. Oddly enough, it starts off with characters that bear a pretty close resemblance to their counterparts in the video game, but dwindles off from there. It's almost as if they locked 5 artists up in 5 different rooms and gave them parts of the movie to draw with no central guidance or communication between them. This movie is a complete pass: clearly just an attempt to rack up more dough off the franchise. Save your money.By the way, Mark Hamill, just because your Joker voice works for the Joker, that doesn't mean you can just use the same voice for every character you voice. Sheesh, it was almost jarring seeing Dante's father but hearing the Joker from Batman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching your friend play a video game","review":"As other reviewers said, watching this DVD is a lot like watching your friend play a video game. Dante's Inferno is classic literature, but you won't find a hint of anything literary here. I can't even imagine who the intended audience for this is: video gamers would rather play; movie watchers would rather watch something else; readers of the classic work will be especially disappointed. I know Mark Hammel hasn't had a lot of work since Star Wars (remember \\"Village of the Damned\\"? Neither do I), but I'm sure he could do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing production","review":"This movie was most disappointing. After playing the game on PS3, I was actually excited to see what a movie based on this epic could be like. First of all, it's short, about 88 minutes. I did not find that the movie reflected enough of what we see in the game or enough that you can read about if you decide to tackle the actuel epic poem written by Dante. A lot has been left out. The transitions betweeen the levels of Hell are marked by titles. The animation is ok at best, not the kind of quality you'd expect from a good japanimation. For some reason, Dante changes appearance without explanation trhough the movie, his past is relived in flashbacks, which is aobut the only thing that corresponds to the depiction of his memories in the game. Personnally, I'd say, if you want to know Dante, read the classic. If you're a gamer, play the video game instead, you'll still learn more about that great story. I couldn't bear to watch more than 40 minutes of it before I got sick of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid...Travesty...","review":"While I agree with the other reviewers who mention the superior quality of the animation, the bastardization of the actual Divina Commedia is appalling. Dante Alighieri was a poet, not a crusader. I had hoped that this work might actually be an attempt to make accessible the greatest work of Dante to a generation that responds best to stories portrayed through animation and visual imagery. It wasn't. In my numerous readings of this classic text, I do not recall Dante being attacked by and killing (though already dead) babies in limbo, nor do I remember Dante having to slaughter lustful harlots in the circle of the lustful by stabbing them in their nether regions. This is not Dante's Inferno, and a person desiring a movie depiction that approaches the great text of Dante's Inferno should instead pick up a copy of Giuseppe de Liguroro's 1911 film, \\"Inferno\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knights Templar Muscleman Big Happy Kill Fun","review":"This was so horribly bad I couldn't believe it. Dante must be spinning in his grave to see what someone has the gall to call an adaptation of his work. There are other adaptations that are great: The Inferno by Dermot Mulroney was clever; The Inferno by Tangerine Dream is beautiful and haunting. This version, on the other hand, is just pure crap. Lots of blood and guts, though; it might even have been good if they hadn't tried to frame it as \\"Dante's Inferno\\", but had just called it something like \\"Knights Templar Muscleman big happy kill fun\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"good details","review":"I enjoyed the way the story was told and the graphics were great. Hope the story goes on for love is an ongoing event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dante for the anime' crowd","review":"While it's been many years since I read Dante's Inferno it's one of those books that leaves you with some fairly strong lasting impressions. I thought that an animated video version had the possibility of being even more chilling but was sadly disappointed. It was more like a comic book than one of the most horrific novels of all time and I found it to be poorly done and not worth the time. Sad, because the medium had to potential to render the classic tale with new levels of horror and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my bag","review":"This movie just didn't jive with me. I've tried to watch it a few times but it's been unable to hold my attention. The animation is done well but the overall story was a little off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Father's \\"Dante's Inferno\\"","review":"Dante's Inferno is classic literature. Tying to make a movie out of it--much less a feature length cartoon has to be challenging. And, unfortunately, try as they might, the makers of this animated feature weren't able to quite pull this off.This is an animated feature that is absolutely not aimed at kids. You probably want to screen and edit the movie before you allow young children to watch it. Partially nutidity, graphic violence and some rather disturbing images (even for adults) are used frequently throughout the film. This wouldn't be so bad if the content, the acting and the animation held their own. Sadly they do not. Instead of being creative with the treatment the producers and director went the safe, predictable route.It's hard to recommend this film to the average viewer. However, I don't doubt that there will be those enjoy the film and, who knows, it could always develop a cult following."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting.","review":"I didnt know what to expect in this animated video. There is blood and guts everywhere. Their is also some nudity. One of the characters is pretty much nude everytime they show her. This is definetly not a kids movie. I actually wouldnt recommend to anyone. I know this is a tie in with the video game and if the video game is anything like the video it should not be allowed to be given to children or teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable low-brow drivel.","review":"This isn't exactly a movie. It's more like the back-story to a video game. It's a pretty pathetic offering, considering the vivid poetry on which it is based. Dante's work was a cultural peak, this wretched movie is a cultural low.And yet, there are people for whom this movie is the perfect choice. What kind of person would that be? Someone who doesn't really care about 700-year-old Italian poetry. Someone who is satisfied with animation involving drab colors and characters who don't move, blink or change facial expressions. Someone for whom plot holes don't matter. Someone who likes swords and blood. In other words, a 12-year-old boy pumped up on testosterone.If you are such a person, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you have even a tiny quantity of discerning taste, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is more of a promo video than a real movie.

I always say the best way to make yourself as an artist is by making records that are not instantly recognizable as your own. And this song proves it - I didn't know it was Kylie until the last 30 seconds of it on the radio. I was impressed. The gurgling synths do sound a bit like your old Atari console but I think it makes it seem all the more nifty. For some reason I see shades of Kraftwerk and Cabaret Voltaire in it.Never has a single by an artist that I don't particularly like ( music wise ( I mean everyone would watch her videos not matter how bad the song was )) has made me think on buying the album that's coming out.Well alright I've had a soft spot for Kylie and I guess she's the one pop star I wouldn't turn the radio off for"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip a beat","review":"Although not a natural choice for a first single, \\"Slow\\" is nevertheless a great song. Funky, synth-laden, and unabashedly sexual, it does seem to deviate from other chirpy/frothy dance songs by entering into darker, more mature territory. Kylie sounds like she's undergone her own personal sexual revolution and the results are a smashing success. \\"Sweet Music\\" is a great track as well, lifting the mood a little bit and injecting some disco-style funkadelic beats. The \\"Medicine 8 Remix\\" might be nice if you were on ecstasy at a rave, but otherwise it just suffers from repetitive blandness. Finally, the video is a nice piece of visual work. Kylie performs the entire song lying down on a beach blanket. The gorgeous, oiled-up bodies cavorting around her are just a welcome bonus. Go ahead and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"come on and dance with me ~","review":"Wow.To the reviewers who've said this was slow paced - you're kidding right??

Later, the joint connecting to the bridge snapped off near the working headphone.The second one now has a broken wire, but _INSIDE_ the bridge (how does that make sense?). I still have the bridge component to the other one, so hopefully swapping it will give me one working pair of headphones and one very broken pair.Other than the durability issues, this is a great headset.

I say that this and Tall Paul's other Mixed Live album come very close. In my opinion, the album starts out allright with the exception of Richard F.'s Down and Dirty(which pumps me up). But once Shiny Disco Balls ends, the bassline drops and a whole new beast forms. Begining with Twister's Revolution, the set gets down and fast revealing a very trancey side. The only change in my humble opinon would be to move Down and Dirty to later in the set. But all in all this album is great and the second best of the Mixed Live series, only trailing Tall Pauls first effort in the Mixed Live series. But then again, this is my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was there.","review":"Maybe most of the whistling you'll hear on this mix was done by me. I've always loved Tall Paul because of his energy, but let me tell you a little secret. The night really wasn't all that great. The club wasn't completely packed that night, and most people left as soon as TP finished his set. The pictures of the crowd you see on the sleeve was mostly the people in the front, and the back was practically empty. Nonetheless, I had a great time that night and whistled real loud because I knew it would end up on the CD. After he finished the set he stepped down the booth and stayed at the bar for a while, so I went up to him, congratulated him and thanked him for a wonderful set.OK, so it probably wasn't the most amazing night in my life, but it was pretty solid, and I got my whistles onto the cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love house music","review":"I picked up this cd because I've been to Club Space in Miami multiple times and have heard how good Tall Paul is.

This is a compelling, candid account of atrocities. Yet through the young Suzanne's introspection, we see beyond the history of events to a deeper meaning. Here is the miracle of having survived when millions of other perished, and after the horrors of the Holocaust, the promises and hardships of the American dream.

This collection of famous operetta overtures by Austrian composer Franz von Suppe is not only an exceptional value, but the music included is just plain fun.While his complete operettas are rarely performed, much of the music Suppe wrote for them has become famous, in particular LIGHT CAVALRY (which we've all heard in countless cartoons) and POET AND PEASANT. Suppe's overtures brim with good humor and infectiously catchy tunes; I would challenge anyone not to be uplifted by this recording.The over-all technical qualities of this album are excellent. Not only does the (very talented) Slovak State Philharmonic play with enthusiasm, but audiophiles will appreciate the roudy brashness of the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"ID yes value guide -- zero","review":"There was nothing in this book but pictures and values of those pictures.

That means it's not going to do any signal processing, which is what I wanted. It just passes the analog signal and nothing else.Switches are good quality, it looks nice (as nice as a switch box can look I guess) and it's got some weight to it. When you push in the buttons its heavy enough and has no-slip feet to keep the unit from being pushed off of the table. This is a major problem of the cheaper selector boxes.I'm using this as an input selector for my Parasound power amp and NHT passive volume control, which only have a single input.

It worked for a very short while and then failed to carry my blu-ray signal any more. Big hassle - don't buy - unreliable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Sleeper","review":"This book is certainly a new take on the Old Testament story of King David. Lots of irreverence and so much that is virtually upside-down. David himself talks to us - a lot - and tells us all. Some might find this depiction of an over-the-top King of Israel kind of blasphemous. I ended up with the wonderful feeling that God is good, all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God Knows How Great This Book Is","review":"Joseph Heller has once again shown his mastery of irony and the absurd. His portrayal of King David is both hillarious and blasphemes. It is not often that I laugh out loud while reading a book. By breathing life into the Old Testament charachters, Heller is able to add flesh and bones to a somewhat boring Biblical account. But God Knows is something more than just a risque telling of Kings, it is also a story about aging, love and religion. He ponders great questions on the fallacy of a God that allows the innocent to die. All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Sophomoric","review":"In \\"God Knows\\", Joseph Heller attempts to tell the story of King David through arrogant eyes. Rather than finding David intelligent or witty, I just found him annoying. In a long book, this is not a good thing. The story seems verbose while lacking the strong social commentary of Heller's other works.The attempts at humor made throughout the book missed the target for me because the characters were beyond my liking. While I did find the occasional snicker on some pages, I found myself wishing for the pain to end. The endless jokes about circumcision were almost as painful as the operation itself.I have enjoyed Heller's other books including \\"Catch-22\\" and \\"Something Happpened\\". To me, this book just missed the mark which may be why this is not one of his better known works. Others may enjoy this book, but it is certainly not for everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing king","review":"Maybe not being a Jew colours my perception of Joseph Heller's work, but I found it irreverent and gratuitously bawdy. Actually I am hardly qualified to write a review of it as I did not read it to the end preferring to pass it on to my next-door neighbour who is a Muslim and who may well be enjoying reading it, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully intriguing","review":"I had to try hard to keep myself from giving in to my initial reaction of, \\"that's blasphemous!\\" many times in the book. On further inspection I always tended to see a very different picture than the surface would seem to describe. Instead of the borderline heretical picture of David that a 20th Century Christian might get without good study, I found an interesting character who actually strengthened my personal faith in a number of ways. The honest portrayal of David as a person who really has some issues with his God, but deep down really still has the requisite faith struck a chord as being very relevant to me and to most modern-day readers who may struggle with religion in todays society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is one of the few Globe Trekker shows I did not like.

It has an incredible array of different black and white designs and comes with a cd-rom for using them on the computer. Yes, it has no color, but with just about any graphics program you can change that. I've even used a few for background elements in artwork or for the inspiration for the designs of kimonos I've drawn. This is not a picture book, but a look into japanese graphic patterns. Very lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Color","review":"I guess I shouldn't have assumed that the patterns in the book were printed in color, even though the cover of the book sure is colorful.

I don't know what fun anyone could get from this game. You have to set up your character with certain characteristics or you can't get him/her to do anything; and then it is difficult to get anything done. The most frustrating part was trying to the the character to do some activity that would get them to advance and they shake their head saing they are not in the mood. You can't ever get started doing anything for having to coninuously go to the bathroom and before you know it you it's time to sleep, and you fall down where ever you are. The characters constant whining is very annoying. I wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got it for PS2","review":"I have PS2 and Xbox and I am assuming the two games are if not the same very similar. If you have never played the Sims before I guess I would suggest buying this. Its confusing at first but a little addictive. But like me, if you have had the Sims for P.C. dont even bother. Its harder to build/buy/live on a console and its definitely not as good as Hot Date or Sims Vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words two syllables... Great game!","review":"... after picking up that controller I was hooked! Though the controls could use a litlle tweaking I got used to them in no time. When I first heard the game was coming out I had some doubts but wow this game is awesome! If you have the computer games and enjoy them then you will love this version! The 3D graphics are amazing and it is so much fun! With the computer games I got bored after awhile with just going to work coming home and going to bed day after day (In the game not real life). In this game you are constantly having to reach certain goals and you never run out of things to do. The multi player part is also fun! Overall this is a great game and a must have!Thank You Much For Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"addictive and fun","review":"Warning: highly addictive...I bought this game awhile ago...and it's highly addictive..I've had oodles of fun playing this game. While it's not perfect (what game is?) I liked it. The game looks quite simple, but after a few hours of gameplay..you begin to figure out that this is not the case. One has to juggle their personal needs with building up their stats (logic, fitness, etc.), having personal relationships, their jobs and their health.I having said there are a few issues with the game. This world has you working 7 days a work, 8 hours a day. You do the math. It would be very nice if the game allowed you 2 days off in a row without the risk of losing your job. You are allowed to miss 1 day, but if you miss more than one consecutive day, you get fired and have to start your career all over again. Needess to say, this can be rather difficult..All in all, this is a fun game...but it's not for everyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT","review":"Get Sims Bustin Out.

I have no teacher, nor anyone around me who knows Latin (or even has much interest). This book has been wonderful for providing me with the information, grammer, syntax and vocabulary I needed in a clear enough format that the need to find someone to ask questions of was very minimal. Usages are well explained, the exercises are well gauged for difficulty, and in general the book is very helpful and usable and I would recommend it highly. My only gripe, and the reason for the loss of one star is that there is no answer key, nor any separate teacher's manual where I could check my work on the exercises. This is only intermittently a problem, but occassionally causes difficulties."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive work on the Blue Angels","review":"The author spent the entire 1994 show season touring with the squadron. The book is full of awesome color photographs, many of which were taken from the back seat of the #7 jet during air shows. These kinds of photographs really bring home the extent of the precision that the Blue Angels fly with on a daily basis. The insights that Shul shares into the daily operations of the squadron make the reader feel like he is a part of the team. As a measuring stick of the depth of the work, I have had the privilege to know two Blue Angels pilots personally and have watched more than 100 Blue Angels performances in my life, yet this book was able to tell me facts about the Blue Angels I didn't know. I received the book as a Father's Day gift and read it cover to cover before going to bed that night.

I rented this game a few days ago and this is the fourth time I had to reset it, now my screen has frozen yet again and I'm not gonna bother to reset it again.

Well, the characters you get to be are not your favorite characters, they are Niobe and Ghost. Not Neo, not Trinity, not Morpheus, NOBODY! The game has bad camera angles also, I couldn't see what was going on because an object was blocking my view. The game also has bad lighting. Some parts of the game are way too dark and I couldn't see clearly enough. The only good thing about this bad game is that the cinematics are done by real actors from the Matrix movie... but still no Neo. Not that i care about Neo not being in the videos, because Keanu Reeves is a sucky actor.Watch the Matrix movies, dont bother with the Animatrix, and don't with the game.

I am saving up for this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Where do I start? The controls are second rate and overly complex. There are some moves available but you will get sick trying to perform them since the button configuration is stinky. The graphics are dated. The worst thing about this game is the gameplay.

If you look beyond the Matrix aura you will see another bad movie tie-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRRRINGGGGG!!!!!!","review":"I didn't enjoy this game.

I love the matrix, and i know we wouldn't have games like Max Payne without bullet time technology-something first pioneered by the first Matrix film, but come on people, how about something called variation? Make it a little less like Max Payne and a little more like the Matrix and it would be a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is really cool","review":"When I bought this game I had seen the first movie and was really excited when this came out. I love the game, in focus the moves are unimaginable. I love doing cartwheels and running on walls. One thing that I never knew how to do until one of the last levels was to make Ghost shoot while he was in the car, and Niobe is driving and you are contolling Niobe. You have to press L1 to get Ghost to start shooting. The reason I gave this game only 4* was because some of the levels can get very frusterating because you have to keep some people alive, and it seems that all those people want to do is die. Even though this game may seem a little expensive it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible gameplay, weak storyline","review":"I played this game hoping to see cool cut sequences and I did see cut sequences, but nothing cool.

Your guy jumps like a mildly retarded man in a suit. The graphics are blocky as all crud, looks like an old PC or N64 game. Bad control also pollutes this mind numbing piece of crap. Jeesh.

You can also play a hacking game, that i thought it was a little silly at first, but it gets interesting and you can spend hours figuring out what to do and what to write next.Great game but i put 4 stars 'cause path of neo is a better game, but this one is very good also."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I rate this game?","review":"This game is addictive. It is extremely fun with great music, great sound, good storyline, addictive gameplay. It would be an easy five stars, but for one thing: THE GLITCHES!The glitches COMPLETELY ruined this game and made it one star. In fact, I couldn't finish it because of how many times it froze; ON BOTH NIOBE AND GHOST GAMES.I'm beginning to realize that game developers don't care about movie tie-ins.

Crackheads are too smart to buy this game. Steal it if you want it but I bet you'll be selling it on eBay a couple days later...

Ideally this should have been a great game--the story is good, and it's captivating because it is a backstory to the new movie. Good voice acting, and FMV sequences..HOWEVER: the gameplay is some of the worst I've ever encountered. the controls are HORRIBLE, and the character movements are stiff as manequins. It just destroys any joy one might feel for being \\"in the matrix.\\"Speaking of being in the matrix: you may look forward to doing nifty Neo-like moves. However, don't get your hopes up--there are a few cool moves, but they get boring and repetetive after a few minutes. This whole game gets rather boring and repetetive.You want a good bullet time game, play Max Payne (that's all this game was really trying to be), but leave the Matrix on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"Where to begin... the graphics aren't as good as they are made out to be, they are certainly nowhere near Splinter Cell. The actual gameplay is fun but one is instantly reminded of Max Payne with the Bullet Time effect. What keeps you playing though is trying to figure out how deep the game goes into the Matrix universe. The \\"Hacking\\" feature is very cool in this respect and is an integral part of the game. And for those who say the game freezes up it is probably because you used a cheat and when you get to certain parts of the game they are not allowed. So turn them off and start at the previous part.Overall the game is a must for die hard fans; but casual gamers will either love it or hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craphole","review":"this game is the dumbest game ever invented. neo isn't even present in the entire game, and in the alley scene, there are CARS that fight eachother. obviously the makers of atari were cracked out when they made this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent but don't buy","review":"I played this game and it was somewhat fun at first but after 5 minutes of playing it gets old!

On the game that I bought, the screen blacks out on the same part of the game with each character.

Don't waste your money on the Beta version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enter The Matrix","review":"All the hype you heard about this game is just that - hype. It's an average game at best. The Tomb Raider games for PSONE are much more enjoyable than this game. The game play is stiff and it's hard to aim. The game locked up on me AT LEAST twice every hour, and no, it wasn't my PS2. This is the only game I've ever had lock up on me. I had to return it to the video store for a new one, which also locked up on me. I played with Ghost and solved this game in two days. In the end, it wasn't worth all the time and effort I put in. The best thing about this game is the Revolutions trailer at the end when you win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good.","review":"I don't have much to say about this game, but it is pretty short.

But it just goes to show you how people are."},{"rating":"1","title":"RENT BEFORE BUYING!!!","review":"You will spend more time waiting on load times than you will playing. Graphics don't even compare to some of the other games out right now. Bad camera positioning is another thing. Really, really sad.

Other than that, leave it on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take the blue pill","review":"At first, I found myself throughly enjoying enter the matrix, but after just 3 or 4 missions, I realized that gameplay consists of a simple pattern: walk into a room, kill everyone there, next room, same thing, end level. Sounds like alot of games, but enter the matrix really just doesn't have enough to it. The cutscenes between missions use the actual actors, so the game is really good for filling you in on the parts we didn't get to see with Reloaded, sadly though, thats really the only thing the game has going for it.If you really like the matrix, its deffinetly worth a rental, but a purchase? I'd have to say, no. It gets boring very quickly, not worth your 50 bucks.PROS:Engaging, fun, cool looking combat.Sweet weaponsCutscenes with the actuall actorsCONS:No real substanceLags at times on PC, and even on the consoles.FAR too short.way to linear, no real environments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Thankfully I rented the game rather than paying out the full price and having played it for several hours I can certainly say I am glad I did not waste my money.I'd have to say there is some fun to be had with the game, the focus time, the realistic Matrix style moves are all great and the cut scenes and sound effects are wonderful and will be enjoyed by any fan of the movies. However the game falls very short in terms of long term play-ability. The game seems to have been rushed to the stores and the game play is painfully liner. To me this is a game that will be enjoyed for the week you rent it from Blockbuster, but if you buy it you'll be sick of it very soon and sorry you wasted fifty bucks.My advice; take your fifty bucks rent the game for a week or two and save the rest of the money to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exit The Matrix","review":"Maybe I didn't get far enough into the game to be blown away, but what I played was boring and frustrating. The controls were difficult to use and after expecting something amazing, the gaming event of the year, I was very let down. The visuals are great, but that's about it. If I wanted great visuals, I'd go see the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gameplay is Great, but dark, long, boring levels ruin game","review":"When I rented the game i expected to play a game that is right out of the movie{s}. Instead the game consists of this \\"Ghost\\" character{Trinnity's brother i gues}. The first 18 levels are fun, but a little short. Then after that you get stuck in a HUGE sewer. It may not seem that bad but after about sewer level 4 you will get really tired of; protecting people that barely protect themselves,running around in a almost pitch black maze, and you can rarely use your Matrix ablities so you have to just go around shoting people{which doesn't brighten up the game at all}. To make matters worse the levels that follow make the game almost look even worse. It's my recommendation that you should not buy this game unless you like long dark levels, and fun short levels. The game is rentable though."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much hype....so little delivery","review":"Talk about missing the boat. It seems like this game should have spent another few months in development and significant time in QA. The bullet time scenes are very \\"been there, done that\\" from seen in Max Payne. The framerate is inconsistent, the storyline varies from interesting to plain silly. I expected more and better.I guess that I would sum it up this way...if you loved Matrix Reloaded...go out and get a copy (cheaper to get it used) or rent it first. Just set your expectations to LOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!!!","review":"I rented this game at the video store, and enjoyed the playing the game, I coudnt my hands off of it,this game is worht buying for Chrsitmas, and its really worth playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh... Would have been great if it had 8 zillion less bugs.","review":"Don't get me wrong, this game is great. But the game could have used MUCH more tech support before release. It wasn't THAT important for it to come out the same day as Reloaded, was it?You can't even beat the XBOX version, as a bug freezes the game right as you go through a vital door. The PS2 version freezes during loading, and the GCN chase sequence at the end? I hope you don't run into the walls, as you'll get stuck in them...

All right, I know its cool the first time, and you can do some cool moves ( including with guns), but the levels are really horrible. I'm sure Atari tried to make a little diversity with the levels (Ghost and Niobi both venture around different parts of the level), but it's basically the same. The multiplayer is really stupid, too. You basically walk around in a little room with another person, no guns or focus, and \\"battle\\", although that might be an over statement. The game is really short, too. It takes no time at all to beat. I beat it in three hours. So please listen to me. Enter the Matrix is a waste of your money, so at the most, rent it, and then return it as quickly as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I rented this game and when I played it I was like \\"holy ----- this game is awesome.\\"The best feature of the game has to be focus. When you use focus you can dodge bullets, run of walls, jump alot farther and other cool moves.Another cool feature is that this game goes along with the movie. For example in the game ghost and niobe get an important letter from a postoffice and in the movie you see niobe hand morpheus a letter. The actors from the movie actually shot scenes for the game.The only problem I had with this game is in the first level some parts take about 20 seconds and then it has to load. That really didn't happen in the rest of the game.I think this is an awesome game and you should definatly check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a game!","review":"I just beat the game (Well Niobie's portion anyway) and it is badass! There is so much going on in it that I recommend seeingReloaded before playing the game, so when you play it you go oh yeah I remember that!

Can't wait for Revolutions and stick around after the credits of Reloaded.(hint,hint)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun, need better graphics","review":"I wasn't going to buy this game, but then changed my mind and got it. I was dissapointed with the main start screen and load/save screen graphics. They are terrible!! But, the gameplay and moves are really fun and i enjoyed this game. The actual graphics in the game are quite good, nothing special. I recommend this game, but trust me, you are going to need the cheats becuase it's impossible without them !! And the Hacking part of the game is also quite fun. But the graphics really need to be worked on if there is going to be another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better on Gamecube","review":"Well, the Matrix is a great game and all, but get it on the gamecube if your going to get it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"How couldn't it be good?","review":"Hey guys,We all know that if this game is half as good as the movie is, it must be really good. Although it does lack Neo, it brings in two new cool charchters, Ghost and Niobi. I've seen the screen shots, and they are above average. Anyway, go out and buy the game, but first go see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"From somebody who ACTUALLY played the game","review":"I found the game to be highly entertaining and haven't enjoyed a game so much since Vice City or SOCOM. Even though the controls are not tight and the cutscenes are Playstation 1 quality, I'm addicted to the storyline and tie-in with the Matrix Reloaded Movie. Thank goodness they did the \\"bullet time\\" effect the way it suppose to be (unlike the lame Max Payne). The music and the actual sound of agents taking over bodies is also engrossing during gameplay. When I hear that Agent take the body of a cop, I know it's about to be complicated and start running! Matrix fans will not be disappointed since this videogame storyline fills in a blank of the actual movie. In a way, some people will find the game more entertaining than the actual movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Compare it to The Movie","review":"I am a huge fan of the first and second sequel to the Matrix. This game was almost a complete disappointment. The first thing that really sucked is that you don't play as Neo or even Morpheus or Trinity!! Now, you tell me how you can make a half-decent Matrix video game without our favorite characters!!! The slow motion features were pretty cool. Some of the levels were really bad but some were alright. The game is pretty fun to fool around with and beat a few times but the storyline is terrible. It's like a little bit of Matrix Reloaded but changed around a lot to make it bad.

Played it a day, and am taking it back to trade it in. It['s bad]. Just another poorly done movie take off. Has some cool features, such as the bullet-time focus mode, and the sound and music is super. But the controls are very badly set up. For example, instead of using the trigger to fire weapons you press the black button??? And trying to aim the sniper rifle is almost impossible. You can tell this was a badly done port over for the x-box. No save function except at set points in the game, and inconsistant level difficulty. You'll play through several scenes fine, then hit one with two \\"timed\\" tasks back-to-back that are almost impossible to complete - not because they are challenging, but just really bad game design. Rent this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinks major","review":"this game is the prime example of what goes wrong when pople try to go outside of thier job juresdiction. this game is an insult to the name of the matrix. its gameplay gets old quick and the fact that you cant even fight the agents stinks. the whole thing is no good, only buy it if you are a harcore fan and want to know the full story, othewise spend your money somewhere else. to play this game is to lose valuable brain cells."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BUT NOT HTE BEST","review":"like my title says, this game is good but it isnt the best.

BUT!!the fact that every level is the same thing over and over again is totally boring, all you do is beat up and kill cops over and over in each level, it gets a little old after a few hours of that. every once in a while you get to fight an agent, other than that its pretty much just beating cops up and shooting them.the game is WAY too easy as well, levels are too short and the story is not interesting. every once in while you get to drive a car around and get away from cops and you guessed it SHOOT them.this game is only entertaining for about the first few days, then it just gets repititious.Worth a rental but in my opinion not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game","review":"This game is probably one of the best games I have ever played. One of the greatests things of this game is ,of course, the bullet time. If you have surround sound, it seems like the bullets are actually whizzing past your ears. But, like any other game, it has some cons.1. Camera gets annoying sometimes2. You keep using the same moves through the whole game so it gets kind of boring3.The graphics aren't really what I was expectingThis game is still awesome no matter what. It's worth my 50 bux"},{"rating":"2","title":"Matrix Amazing","review":"This game is definetly worth your money and I believe if you are looking for a game to buy and play all summer, it will have to be Enter The Matrix.The graphics are quite amazing and are very satisfying to the average gamer. Focus mode is quite possibly one of the best features in the game. Focus is where you can go in slow motion and dodge bullets from your enemies as well as perform many different moves.A very cool part to this game is when they do scenes with real people to tell you what's going on. You can also choose from Niobe or Ghost as your starting character. I recommend doing whichever one you want to first, and then later try the other one.Overall, I say that this game is definetly worth your money and is a great challenge game. BUY IT! BELIEVE MY IT WILL BE WORTH YOUR WHILE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Revolutionary Game","review":"Enter the Matrix isnt just a game, its an interactive movie. Its the first game of its kind. The movie, The Matrix Reloaded, is told through three medias, the movie which gives u the general story, the animatrix which is 9 short storys about the matrix, and this game, which gives u an hour of footage that u can see no where else. Its a brilant concept yet how is the gameplay. I really dont see why so many reviews had problems with this game. In fact i think it controls great and it is fun. U actually feel like inside the matrix with all the cool movies Niobe or Ghost can perform. The only flaw this game has is you can blow through it with either character in about five hours. So in total its about 10 of gameplay. But its worth it. If u havent boughten it yet, go get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"As a Matrix fan myself, I was very eager to get this game. When it finally came out, I bought it immediately and was extremely disappointed. The gameplay is boring and repetitive with very little detail and effort put into everything besides the characters. The game would have been great, except for the horrible graphics and gameplay. The story is not a porblem since it is that of the Matrix trilogy. The fighting is a button-smasher's dream, since you just need to smash the mouse to beat up 10 SWAT guys.With few missions that were actually fun, I can't say that this deserves more than 2 stars.

Could it get any more dull?How about sewers? filled with idiotic enemies who failed to seriously injure me even once.How about driving? What could be more fun than driving?Unfortunatly, in this world a car is an uncontrollable object derived of any attempt at physics.God I hate this game. Many levels later and the only thing keeping me going is the 52 I paid for the dammed thing.I'm bored. Only a couple of new moves have turned up, set peices have been laughable and I find the characters irritate me.I promise, avoiding this and buying any other hyped game will be good for you.

The modeling and movement are good, but there are holes in the plot (I thought it was supposed to be a stand alone story, but there are major plot flaws if that's so.) that are only filled by the movie. Also, when you finish the limited game play, it ends with a great big movie ad for the next movie due out later this year. That's pretty crass.

Even though it was free, I should have been smart enough not to waste my time with this one, but I was curious about the characters from the other book who behave so differently from that one as to be recognizable only by their names.What Rosenberg did, I think, was write a plot outline and twist her characters into pretzels to try to stay within the outlines. Nobody is believable; even the major lies in the book don't pass any reader's smell test EXCEPT FOR OUR HEROINE who is a human pinball, bouncing off one BS story after another and treating her family as second class citizens while cleaving to the tales of a proven sociopath.The ending isn't very satisfying either.By the way, the Kindle version is so riddled with typos it looks like a first proof.

I've never read a book with a less likable bunch of characters in my life. The first chapter sets up the story like its going to be suspenseful and interesting. Unfortunately that's the only decently written part of the whole book. The cops are liars, the women are sociopathic man haters, and the men are misogynistic pigs. The story is so convoluted that I had to reread the first chapter halfway through the book just to see if I'd missed something.Honestly...this book is terrible. There is nothing redeemable about any of the characters. The sexual encounters are awkward and misplaced. The suspects are more likable than the cops. And the ending is laughable.Please, don't do it.

That was the last eye-rolling moment I could take in this terrible excuse for a novel. Write some realistic dialogue and situations, and I might buy in to the contrived mystery plot a little better.Keep in mind I didn't get far into this book when weighing my review against others. I just have a low tolerance for shoddy writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"There are too many really good books out there to waste time on this one. The growing trend with many mystery/crime writers to use a convoluted and rather implausable plot to build suspense. This is not a particularly well written book, filled with unlikeable characters who behave in a mindless manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I totally agree with the person who wrote skip it. This has to be one of the worst books I have read in recent years. I finished only to see if it possibly improved by the end; it didn't. The plot is disjointed and unbelievable ( I certainly hope probation and police departments don't work that way); the diologue is contrived, and the characters, especially Caroline, are superficial,unauthentic and not very likable. How do such books get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Revenge of Innocents, a review","review":"This book was just AWFUL. The dialogue was trite and the plot ridiculous. The ending came out of nowhere. It was like this book was plotted and written by different people. I don't know if Nancy Taylor Rosenberg has a ghost writer on her staff, but the plot just seemed disjointed. This was the first Taylor Rosenberg book I have read, and it is probably my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot and characters both a mess","review":"I suppose to get into \\"suspense,\\" you need a pedophile, lots of murders, and a supposedly competent woman who wanders alone into a darkened empty area just after having received a death threat. As some other reviewers noted, to consider a thieving pathological liar who incites others to murder, who pays no heed to the consequences of her actions and who is consistently foul-mouthed and minded a \\"victim\\" just stretches things too much. It's as if a pedophile in the plot serves the same function as a demon: absolves everyone else of responsibility and awareness. Add in forensic and medical improbabilities, and this is really a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par to say the least","review":"I have never read any of the authors previous works and after this I probably will not.I hope that police work is never really as shoddy as it is in this book. The lead female character is all over the place and makes more and more ridiculous decisions/comments as the book progresses.The victim is not at all sympathetic and I found myself rooting AGAINST her almost the entire book.With an ending that feels like it came out of left field, you would be better not settling down to read this book. Save yourself some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a Lifesaver! It's wonderful!","review":"I was so lucky to stumble across this book and trust my instinct to buy it. The scenes in here are great for students, as well as actors in their 30's. I really enjoyed the variety of subject matter, tone, and characters. If you coach, as I do, this will save you and your students a great deal of valuable time.

The film was new in the package. The volume fluctuates terribly, to the point that it is almost impossible to view. Also, the film skips in several places, leaving gaps in the plot line.

My 8 year old son, who is a Mindstorms genius, has wanted this for so long! How disappointed he was Christmas morning. \\"This doesn't use my pieces, or even my RCX\\" he said--very disapppointing, and I think it should clearly say this is not for the CURRENT version of mindstorms. This book is completely useless to us, he cannot build ANYTHING in the book with his Mindstorms RIS 2.0 set.We have another book from this line, and it is for RIS 2.0, and my son loves it.Update: We learned this book is for the Lego Mindstorms \\"Dark Side Developer\\" kit (Star Wars).

It didn't even have interviews with the band members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"First, Let me highlight a couple notes from the box cover: \\"THIS SET IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY NICKELBACK\\" and \\"This product contains no original music by Nickelback\\"Well, luckily Nickelback was not involved in the production of this nonsense because it would be a sure way to alienate their fans. Much of the audio is muddled, and large portions are actually panned photo stills rather than real video. On the positive side there wasn't much worth listening to so the muddled audio didn't detract much from the overall lousy product. Anybody involved in the creation of this DVD should be embarrassed about taking money for this. At least, I borrowed it from the library so it saves me the hassle of sending it back to \\"Chrome Dreams Media\\", demanding my moneyback ( close to a Nickleback pun!) for their crappy DVD.In case it is not clear, don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic","review":"I bought this in the hopes of seeing live footage of Pickelback, but instead I was tortured to the tunes of 4 hicks playing some craptastic commercialized music (if you want to call it music).If you watch this Chad Kroeger will appear at your house in 3 days and take a dump in your living room.

Unlike Beethoven, each subsequent symphony does not get better than the previous ones. Specifically, Glazunov's best was his first, followed by his 4th, 5th, and 6th in close order. Neither the 2nd or 7th symphonies are very memorable. Both sound distinctly Romantic in melody and tone, but neither has the drama, beauty or richness of the 1st or 6th. Each has one great part; the first movement of the 7th symphony and the last movement of the 2nd symphony are quite good. Each symphony is a standard orchestral work; four movements per symphony, with each movement having a distinct sound. The sound quality is great, as expected from Naxos, but the music is only OK. In all, not worth the new price, but if you can get this album used and cheap, it is worth it for a Russian Romance music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge a book by it's cover","review":"When you first look at Ninja Five-O, you might think it's a silly simple game. However, when you first pop it in and play, you will have a change of heart. Owing a big debt to the Shinobi games of the 16-bit era and the Ninja Gaiden series, you play a ninja cop taking on enemy ninjas and terrorists. Gameplay wise the game is very difficult and challenging, which is perfect for fans of the aforementioned games. The graphics are typical 2-D side scroller fare, but that's not such a bad thing with some nicely animated characters and textures. All in all, Ninja Five-O is a great action game that those who yearn for the days of Shinobi and Ninja Gaiden will love. This is the game that THQ's Revenge of Shinobi for the GBA should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast fun","review":"My grandson loved this toy. The only educational value is getting the car to start off right, but the whole purpose of this toy is to have FUN, and he did. The cars really go very, very fast. It is a bit loud and when the cars fall off they come off at high speed. He's only 3 and he was able to get the cars on the track after a couple tries, now he does it everytime. You may want to supervise due to the high speed of this toy. The cars didn't break even at the high speed ejection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get out the safety goggles!","review":"I agree with the majority of the reviewers that this toy is much too dangerous. What a major disappointment! After taking 1/2 hour to assemble, my son played with it for about 5 minutes. When the cars repeatedly flew off and one almost hit the TV, we both decided we didn't want to risk losing an eye. Also, mine did not come with a safety net to put around it. To make matters worse, I purchased it on-line and now might have to pay shipping to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!!!","review":"My son got this for Christmas...we put it together..and I'm sorry to say this is dangerous..The cars come flying out and can hit my son and a pretty high rate of speed.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I would have expected from Mattel","review":"My daughter got this for Christmas. We set it up (including the safety net) and were VERY DISAPPOINTED. The toy is noisy, one car managed a maximum of 3 revolutions before falling off. Other attempts managed two or less, if any. I just can't believe that Mattel could let this crummy toy get through development and quality control. What a waste - back to the store it went!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cardboard super track","review":"I'm sorry, I don't own this toy. but this toy is dumb. just follow these steps and you will have your own super track. for 4 months, collect paper towel and toliet and foil rolls { the carboard part[. when you have your desierd amount of pecies start bulding your track. you can tape the tubes together or cut slits and slide them together. tape works better and saves time but slits can let you build loops and turns and weird tricks. you do ethier method. leave two ends open for the entrance and exits. remeber to have supporting objects for track parts with nothing below them. you can use hot wheels cars or marbles. have any questions? if so include them with a reveiw for this toy and i will get back to you! SECRET BOUNUS: if you cut a few tubes in half and then add them to your track, you can see your cars go while on the track!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What they don't tell you...","review":"I think they call it bait and switch. Yes, the boy did like it on Christams morning, until I put on the Safety Net. It comes with a stretchy bit of plasic netting that you wrap around the entire thing. YOU DON'T SEE THAT ON THE BOX! Yet, the instructions say it's essential. Not only does it prevent easy access to the track, it squeezes the track so it no longer seats properly in the base. This was obviously an afterthought that they are not expecting anybody to use - I assume in response to a report that the toy is DANGEROUS - which I think it is indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I only spent $1 at a garage sale","review":"I hardly ever write reviews, and though I only spent $1.00 at a garage sale for this, it was a wasted dollar. Much better toys out there that actually work, so don't waste even a dime on this one. My experience has been exactly the same as the rest of the negative reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big in Size - Little in Fun","review":"Yes, it looks like something out of this world, but it really isn't. Not all cars work, but the ones that do will give you a nice little stunt show... for about 5 minutes, then it's time to push it in a corner and never bother with it again. Too many Hot Wheels sets are one trick Pony's. You have your basic short layout, and a power booster, then watch it go around in circles until boredom takes over in minutes. Just rely on gravity and get a simple, two lane race set that clamps to a chair, and has a start and finish gate. More fun, less space, just like the 60's/70's when toys were actually good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible toy","review":"What a waste of money. The tracks won't stay together, and even if you can get them to stay together, the toy is too dangerous to use as the cars come flying off in all directions at high speed. Apparently there was a supplemental safety net added to the toy, but I never saw one in our box."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY---unless you want an eye-less child","review":"This product is the MOST horrible thing ever manufactured. No matter what we try the cars come flying off the track at very high speeds. Enough that an eye could definetely be taken out, or some sort of other horrible injury could occur. I don't care what the age limit is on it! I am 31 and afraid to be near it. My son recieved it as a birthday present, and unfortunetely we threw away the box and the retailer would NOT let me exchange. However when I called Mattel they sent me a return label and are suppose to send me a voucher that I can use for any Mattel item that is equal to the price of this one. Please do NOT waste your money or time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fireball flop!!!!","review":"What a terrible toy! This is another example of how things on tv don't work in real life! The cars NEVER stay on track and shoot out at high speeds to hit the kids in the face and head. It is a deathtrap! It is so ridiculous! I wonder how they even made it run for the commercial! Don't waste your money here. Just call me, I'll gladly send you mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"My son really, really wanted this toy. To date, I have been very happy with Hot Wheels products. Unfortunately, this one is a huge disappointment. Like previous reviews, the cars fly off the track, but I think it's should do that, but not before they make it all the way around. Not once, has one car made it all the way around the loop. My son got spider slam though and he loves it. I think I'll return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A [flimsy], dangerous toy","review":"I bought this toy for my sons for Christmas, thinking that it would be fairly durable and fun being a Hot Wheels product. After many attempts to assemble the thing correctly, the numerous [flimsy] plastic parts finally fit together. However, it is very flimsy and looks as if it may crumble at any second. Do not try to watch TV, carry on a conversation, or concentrate on anything while this toy is in use. It sounds very much like an electric mixer. The cars fly off the track at a dangerously high speed; I'm afraid one of them may lose an eye! Other reviews did mention a safety net, but ours did not include one and there was no mention of a safety net in the instructions. Had \\"Santa\\" not thrown the box away, this toy would be returned to the store. I'm sure it will end up at my annual yard sale very soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw on display at store","review":"We were shopping for this toy and saw it out on display (...). Big waste of money!! When he tried to make it work, the cars got half way up the ramp and fell down. On a separate try using the net, one of the cars came out and hit him in the face. I would not recommend this for anyone with kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this toy","review":"I have the same issues as other reviewers - the toy is VERY dangerous. It is very loud and without the net is scary to watch. The cars leave the track even when there is only one going and they become projectiles. The motor running the cars sounds like a chainsaw as well. We are all scared of this play set - parents and children included. Peculiar how there is an addendum to the instructions requiring a safety net (there is no mention of this in the TV ads or on the set packaging)which after installation renders the set useless as it pulls the tracks out and the cars will no longer run for more than a second without coming off the tracks. I have loved Hot Wheels sets since I was was a child but I cannot get this one back to the store quick enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE PRICE","review":"My son received this as a birthday gift. You need a screwdriver to assemble it. The cars don't run continuously, as soon as they hit the meteor & it explodes, which is every time, you have to reset everything. Oh, and if you ever wanna take it apart & put it back into the box, GOOD LUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Butt...But...","review":"It's a great toy with lots of fun, but you've got to make a decision: use the safety net and make it less fun or go without and have your kid wear goggles so that when the cars fly out of the track at them they won't lose an eye. I chose the latter (and moved it to the basement away from the windows) and it's scads of fun! Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"I saw this thinking how neat it was until the car came flying out of the ball and hit my son at a very fast speed!!!

I would NEVER suggest this to anyone!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fun - a Dad's review","review":"This was a birthday gift for my 6 yr old, who LOVES Hot Wheels and everything about cars. Assembly of the toy was not that bad, you just matched the letters on the tracks. It required some effort to put the screws in, as it was hard to see with the track in the way. Toy requires BRAND NEW alkaline batteries to propel the cars. Anything less will not work. The meteor in the middle is flimsy, poorly designed, and unimpressive. Toy is very loud.Worst of all the toy is just not fun, even for kids that adore Hot Wheels. You drop a car in, they zip endlessly in loops ... and that's about it. When they crash it can be challenging for a small one to sometimes fish the cars out. 6 year old walked away in less time than it took to build it.-- A dad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"I can't believe this toy has not been recalled yet! I was mortified after putting it together, and watching as the cars flew off the tracks at high enough speeds to hurt someone if they got hit in the face. I had one hit my hand and its still hurting. I am new to this \\"hot wheels\\" thing with my 2 boys, and am pretty much disgusted so far at the products offered. What ever happened to the hot wheels I had as a kid? All I can find is a starter set, but no good expansion sets. This fireball is awful. Oh well. I must say that my boys, ages 3 and 5 seem to like it...I just need to make sure they don't take an eye out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had one as a kid","review":"Works as advertised. Very cool. Track will not come apart if assembled correctly. Cars might fly off when you turn the power off; otherwise, we did not find the toy to be a hazard.This one is much better than the gravity powered loop tracks:- it is much more interesting to watch and fun trying to get more than one car racing- it stays together better than than other Hot Wheel tracks we have had- a good example of centrifugal force"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all","review":"My 5 year old loves it, it does make a lot of noise, but how anyone would be scared of this is beyond me.

It is so loud that I can't hear my children's (5 & 7) voices or the TV on the other side. I'd say it's about the same decibel level as a sheet metal factory. There is also a safety factor. When the cars come off the track, as they eventually do, they are going fast enough to cause an injury. My children just stopped playing with this toy after about 15 minutes (thankfully)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Used To Like Hot Wheels Tracks","review":"We've had hours of fun as the 3rd users of a basic Hot Wheels track set. So when I bought this toy for my son, I couldn't believe this Hot Wheels track can't attach to the rest of the track. It's stand alone and just goes round & round & round ... My son was bored after 6 goes but we're still pulling the old track out and reconnecting it all around the house in new ways every time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take the age rating seriously","review":"The age rating police are right on with this toy. My parents bought it for our three year old, and it only lasted a day in our house before we packed it up. In spite of some of the nay-sayers, the cars really do fly out of the loop very fast (even w/ the ugly netting). We didn't have too much trouble with the track coming apart, however, the net did gradually slip off of the loops.Ultimately, my biggest complaint with the toy is that it isn't that fun. It's a bit like watching a lava lamp: very interesting for about 90 seconds, and then on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Wheels Fire Ball","review":"I got this toy for my son for Christmas, this was the most important item on his list and every time he seen it on TV he would get excited. Well that was before. After playing with it off and on for about an hour, my 3 year old was watching when, I could not believe it, a car came flying out and hit her in the arm. needless to say we packed it back up and took it back to the store. I told my husband as soon as they fired it up it look dangerous as fast as the cars flew around and I had no idea they would fly off just as fast. I am glad no one was seriously hurt, and I was not about to wait around for it to happen either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be recalled ! Would have given 0 stars If possible!","review":"My daughter received this for Christmas. Luckily, my husband and I put it together and played with it first. The net was a suprise-no mention of it on the ads or the box which I felt was mid-leading. The thing is so LOUD but the worst part is that the cars fly off the track (FAST) causing them to become little metal missiles. It hit my cat (thankfully in the leg) but it scares me to death to think of my daughter playing with it. We are boxing it back up and returning it. I have called the Consumer Products Safety Commission and filed a complaint. I urge everyone else who feels this way to do the same. Perhaps they will re-call these things before someone gets seriously hurt with it. I have tried to call the 1-800 number on the box but due to high call volume I must call back. Gee, I wonder what the calls are concerning. I wish I would have read the other reviews on this website prior to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Junk","review":"Wow, what a piece of JUNK. I bought this toy for my Grandson for Christmas. After his father and I spent over an hour trying to get this thing totally assembled, it held Nic's attention for about 10 minutes. His comments, \\"I can't get this meteor to stay together, the cars keep falling off, the car hit me in the face, is this ALL it does?\\" My comments, poor assembly instructions, poor design, poor quality, very noisy, potentially dangerous, no educational value, after you see the car fly by a couple of times it is repetitious and boring. And, the safety net is a big joke, we couldn't get it on and keep the shape of the track, we stretched it, soaked it in hot water, stretched it again, every time we put it on the track fell apart and we had to reassemble it inside the net, doesn't look like a ball it looks like an egg.

I am not happy with it at all, and neither is my son!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sucks!","review":"This thing ...so badly. I bought it for my son and the cars flew off the track and right into his mouth. We had to rush him to the dentist immidiately. I loath this toy.

He loves it, but from a parents point of view; it's very loud and the cars shoot out suddenly. The manufacturer has added a netting to put around it(not shown on the box)to help keep the cars in.

We set it up and they were SO excited to play with it. Their excitement turned to frustration quickly, though. When the motors are on, they're really loud and not powerful enough to send the cars all the way around the loops. They made it just under half way and just dropped. When my boys used a real lightweight non-HotWheels car, the car took off but didn't stay on the track. Instead, it took off flying through the air narrowly missing my youngest sons head. They thought it was hysterical...I definitely WOULD NOT recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"I was very disapointed with this toy. My son received this toy for Christmas last year from Santa. This toy was difficult to put together, chintzy, and never seemed to work right. The cars go around and around and that is it. The children can not really play with it so it did not keep their interest for long at all. It seems to me that Mathcbox and Hot Wheels toys are very overrated. I HATE spending money on them because almost all of them that we have ever owned have fallen apart shortly after we bought them. This product was a let down-- from it's difficulty to put together to the fact that it takes up so much floor space, to the fact that it fell apart so quickly and was barely used. It also eats batteries. I would NOT recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire \\"bomb\\"","review":"When playing with this toy, our dog runs for cover!

Ripped off again by hotwheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it!","review":"As the previous reviewer said, something certainly does happen to Lucy who can't stop lying. But please remember, this is a CAUTIONARY TALE in the same vein as The Boy Who Cried Wolf. Plenty of traditional fairy tales and fables contain unpleasant consequences for naughty children. These kinds of stories have been around for centuries and none of us are worse off because of them. But unlike the more traditional tales where someone gets gobbled up by a wolf, the main character in this story merely gets carried away atop a giant wave. My kids, age 7 and 3, LOVE this story as well as the other two books in the series. It's written in a tongue-in-cheek manner that even young children know is make believe. The illustrations are really cute, the story is fun, but the underlying lesson is a good one... lying can get you into a lot of trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Harsh - Agree","review":"I think the lesson is too harsh, as well. It's not a fun book to read. We put the book in the garbage after reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh consequences","review":"My wife and I loved the idea of a pre-school book that addressed the importance of telling the truth, which is why we purchased this book for our two young children. After the first read, on Christmas Day of 2004, we found the lesson rather harsh with exaggerated consequences: Because Lucy lies so much, she believes that other people lie also. When her father warns Lucy's family that a \\"Great Big Wave\\" is coming, and that they must run, Lucy remains in bed and is swept away into the ocean. After all this has happened, Lucy's father asks nonchalantly if the rest of the family would like tea while Lucy is seen floating out in the ocean on her bed.The following day, 12/26/04, the tsunamis in the Indian Ocean took the lives of thousands of children in Asian countries. Unfortunately for the author, who of course had know way of knowing such a catastrophe could ever take place, I can't imagine reading this book to my children ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of Emmylou Harris and Sarah McLachlan","review":"Julie Adams has a warm-toned, soulful, country-folk sound. If you like Emmylou or Sarah you'll definately dig this. The backup band is tight, restrained, and has the sound that I would liken to early Cowboy Junkies.I would like the CD better if she stayed away from the blues. Not that she does them a diservice - it's just that she is so good with the ballads. The odd thing though is she does the impossible task of doing a Marvin Gaye song well (Trouble Man). Nobody until now could do that in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gift","review":"I bought this book for my nephew, for his birthday. I don't think he read it, but I would like to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another extremist attack on our judicial system.","review":"I am becoming ashamed of our country in that books like these are being taken seriously.

It put me to sleep"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased opinions, innacurate interpretations of events.","review":"I wouldn't recommend you pay money to buy this book, nor would I recommend you waste your time going to the library to access the book for free.Although the author is facutally true in his information and facts, many of his arguments no longer apply to the modern day. Indeed several arguments cite incidences in the 1800s.In addition, his interpretations of the motives of the Supreme Court are extremely biased. Never before have I seen someone who is so learned on the constitution, unable to understand the relationship of this document in the descisions of the Supreme Court.In short, I was very disappointed in this book. Buy it or read it at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical drivel from a hate mongering fundamentalist","review":"In World War 2 this guy would have been known as a Kapo......sending up his own people so he can come out on top....he is unintelligent and a fabricator of hate news.Guys like this are the very reason the US is so hated by everyone these days....buying his books and listening to him on radio only supports terrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled and silly; but still rather lively","review":"For consistency and thought content, this book is disappointing. Still, the discussion is lively and a bit of fun, and therefore may be worth a look.The book's main thesis--that the Supreme Court's activism is ruining America--is undercut by the case examples at least as often as it is bolstered by them. This is not truly a thoughtful book. Nor because of its flawed content can it be seen an important addition to a national debate about how best to strike a balance between government power and individual freedom.The book is amusing, but ultimately shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time...","review":"Boring, poorly-argued diatribe. Levin should stick to radio where his words fade quicker. When tackling broad topics like this he becomes vague and uninteresting. For a better window into the current argument about judicial activism, try \\"Becoming Justice Blackmun : Harry Blackmun's Supreme Court Journey,\\" also available through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy and demagogic","review":"This book is just another 'conservative' screed against the Bill of Rights and U.S. Constitution. Civil rights are an evolutionary concept to all but the most reactionary elements in America. This book panders to some of those people's worst instincts. Look at who wrote the Introduction--an expert on nothing--uneducated, bigoted, and a prevaricating, demagogic, hypocritical drug abuser. This book is only for the most reactionary, uninformed, uneducated segment of the populace. Pass it by if you REALLY care about America!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"Judges who don't follow the party line and support right wing causes are bad. Judges who say create new precedents that only apply to one case, say one that gives Bush the White House are good. Actually that's not quite fair this guy isn't quite that pathetic a hack but neither is he particularly convincing. What is most noticeable to me about this book is how far to the right these guys have moved the playing field, in this new conservative fever Republican judges who haven't swallowed all the kool-aid are to use Pat Robertson's words worse than the 9/11 terrorists. As for the \\"strict-constructivism\\" con, that's been threadbare for twenty years since you never hear a whine about judical activism that supports right wing agendas. Frankly I'd rather read Hannity at least his intellectual pretensions are more of a giggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Hoping for More Analysis, Less Block Quoting","review":"The author is a decent legal thinker who posts frequently on NRO's The Corner blog. His posts there are thoughtful and nuanced. Not this. It seems to me the publisher \\"dumbed down\\" the book for its expected readership, diluting and flattening out the nuance and argumentation, leaving a lot of rhetoric, extended block quotes, and Rush Limbaugh. With the judiciary under attack as the only branch not currently under the political control of the Republican party, it does not surprise that judges have become targets of the other branches of government. There is surely much food for thought regarding Marbury vs. Madison, federalism, and the role of an independent judiciary in our system of government, but I think much of the analysis has been left on the cutting room floor. I'd be interested in an unabridged version of this book, or perhaps will just keep reading Mark's posts in The Corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politicizing an independent body","review":"Mr.Levin wrote an extensive review on the matter and I appreciated it. In my opinion though appointing judges with ideology inclined towards one political agenda would not be the correct approach to the issue. I am not republican or democrat, conservative or liberal. I am an ordinary AMERICAN voter. I need judges who are impartial and interpret the law. I do not need judges with agenda on either side. If we go that way then soon we will be appointing polarized and polititized personalities to an supposedly INDEPENDENT body. There is already a name under consideration with apperant long history of lobbying and not impartial undertakings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The unelected and unacountable","review":"Anybody studying constitutional law, must read this book. If you don't think that politics plays a big roll in our Federal Judiciary, well think again!Our unelected and unacountable Federal Judges, are known to be increasingly legislating from the bench, and re-writing our Constitution.

I was a little disappointed in the content, as from the first few pages I discovered it's more of a right hates left attack on liberalism circa the judiciary. It has more to do with how judicial decision affect party politics and how if you disagree with a verdict that judge must be an \\"activist.\\" If that is what you are looking for, I recommend it.I'm more interested in say, how judges use immunity to break the law, destroy lives, uphold blatantly unconstitutional government actions and protect their cronies while they fleece regular Americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Levin - Will You Please Just Go Away ?","review":"Another classic spewing of neocon diatribe from the sewer that is Mark Levin's mouth. If Mark Levin wrote a book saying to go play in traffic, all of his braindead followers would go do it... In fact, that would be a great idea. I hope he writes that book. Seriously though, all you warmongers need to put the books down, pick up your rifles and go fight your own wars. We the People will gladly buy you all one way tickets to the country of your choice. You bunch of chickenhawks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Levin is an idiot","review":"This trash is worthless. Mr. Levin is evidently unaware the majority of the Supreme Court were Republican Appointees. Roberts and Alito (Bush), Thomas (Bush I), Scalia (Reagan) and Kennedy (Reagan). Mr. Levin just can't accept the US is no longer governed by the laws of the 17th Century . . which is where his scholarship probably belongs.. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"great one\\" with a great book","review":"The \\"great one\\" Mark Levine has detailed the account of the Supreme Court in defying the separation of powers. The Court has increasing been making the law and not interpreting the constitution. Judicial tyranny is robbing us of our freedoms and Mr. Levine shows that Americans right to vote has been diminished. Our votes have at times been negated by the Supreme Court. The Founding Fathers desired three equal branches of government. However, the Supreme Court has succeeded in imposing it's will on the other braches and the voters. We have to understand the role of the judiciary branch in America. Without this knowledge we may lose our freedoms. Mark Levine has done an outstanding service to America in providing this writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and Fascinating","review":"I recommend this book to everyone. The information contained in this book is not only educational, but it is pertinent to the cultural battle that is underway today by liberals using activist judges to circumvent our constitution. An easy read, and a must read, and you will understand how the courts are having an effect upon you and your children, whether you realize it or not, by bypassing the legislative process to make the government do things we would never vote for in a million years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a wakeup call to America.","review":"This work is an impressive piece of research and analysis of the trends occurring in America's judiciary. Mr. Levin demonstrates a rare depth of historical perspective in treating the inner workings and agendas of this mysterious collection of lifetime appointees. His illustrations and supporting sources of evidence are both convincing and somewhat frightening. If the practice of deliberately misinterpreting (or indeed ignoring) the constitution were to continue in the rulings of activist judges then the prospects for our democracy's survival are dire. I loved the book, have given a half dozen copies to family and friends and cannot adequately commend the author for a truly substantive contribution to our awareness and understanding of this threat to our nation's liberty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men in Black: A Primer in the Evolution of the Court","review":"As a student of history and politics, I was stunned at the depth and heretofore unknown facts that established the court as it functions today. In fact, as revealed in Men in Black, the founders had no intention to establish a Supreme Court that functions as it does today, to wit, on whimsical mood and mode.Furthermore, the constitution did not define such Court function. That the average person who is somewhat aware of the makeup of America's political base has never been taught any of the information covered in Men in Black is a downright shame. This lack of education allows for the court to continue to be corrupted by 'common feels' of the moment, instead of performing its basic, and only function I might add, which is to rule on the law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look at where we have come from","review":"In this book, Levin traces one controversial Supreme Court decision per chapter. He spends time on what the framers of the Constitution intended, followed by the slow perversion of that intent, leading up to a landmark court decision (i.e. Roe v. Wade). Reading this book made me very grateful for the \\"originalists\\" on the Supreme Court that stand up for what this country was founded on. Unfortunately, there are not enough of them.This book would be a good read for everyone, whether you agree with the authors stance or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLANT....A MUST READ SUPREME COURT BOOK","review":"Everyone should read this book no matter where you stand politicially.Our CONSTITUTION must be upheld for our GREAT NATION TO REMAIN FREE. Our Founding Fathers put together the Constitution to protect US from Government. This book shows that the SUPREME COURT JUSTICES choosen should ALL FOLLOW the Constitution and NOT TRY TO READ SOMETHING in it that is not there. While most of the public's attention focuses on abortion and gay rights, Mr. Levin shows how many other areas of our basic constitutional law have been corrupted by judges willing to supplant the intentions of the framers with their own moral predilections.Americans need to read this book ......READ YOUR CONSTITUTION with an honest, clear vision of our FREEDOMS."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for the title","review":"Another slanted book. Levin gets a drug-addicted blow-hard (Limbaugh) to write his forward. What a laugh, this alone shows the legitimacy of Levin's point-of-view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Con(servative) Artist Tries to Get Rich","review":"Mr. Levin selectively chooses and then misdescribes cases to make a point and a few bucks. Flag burning is a great example. Conservative judges for a century have held that some conduct amounts to speech and is protected by the Fisrt Amednment. Justice Scalia agreed with that in the flag burning case and so do the great majority of conservative jusrists. What Mr. Levin really dislikes apparently is the First Amenment. He apparently wants his fellow citizens to conform to his beliefs as the only politically correct views. This radical and extremist position puts him in direct opposition to the Constitution he claims to be defending. The book has one good purpose -- it would help start a really good fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"reality check people please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"before you go and back this garbage, lets just hold up and examine what the supreme court of the united states has done for this country in the past before lambasting it. the supreme court has done such \\"crazy\\" things like ruling against segregation in brown vs. board of education and giving people the right to privacy back in lawrence v. texas, or how about allowing people of different ethnicities marry in loving vs. virginia. these are just examples of some of the things that judges of the US have done for this country in the past. so before you decide to believe in this rhetoric, think about the rights that you have today and ask why you have them????? its the judges of this country who are protecting them, and its people like the author here who go about lambasting everything when they dont get their way. what crybabies!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't make sense","review":"All these cries of activist judges and judges taking over the system.

The conservatives on the court--Roberts, Alito, Kennedy, Thomas, and Scalia--are the true judicial activists who are (as the conservatives like to say) \\"legislating from the bench;\\" the narrow 5-4 decision by the SCOTUS to side with Citizens United is proof of this. Thankfully, the Republicans are finally waking up to realize the monster that they've created.

The story will have clues as to how the puzzles can be solved. Though i know how difficult it is to come up with interesting and difficult pzzles, the designers of this game haven't stepped up to the challenge. Aside from theme, the puzzles have little to do with the story, by that i mean there's little in the story to actually help you progress in the game.Seriously, I wouldn't recommend this game to adventure game fans. Sorry-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This game was terrible - really bad. The graphics were decent and the puzzles had interesting concepts behind them, but the way that you had to solve them made no sense. There were many objects that you had to find to proceed in the game that you literally could not see; the only way to find them was to run the cursor along every square inch of every screen in the area and look to see if the cursor changed to pick-up mode in order to find what you need. This game was much more frustrating than fun... a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"thouroughly dissapointing","review":"this game was horrible. often times you can't see items and there is nothing to indicate that something can be done with say a wall or a paiting unless you happen to try an object on it.

The puzzles are illogical and HARD. I was constantly looking for cheats. my opinion: this game is not worth two cents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy game","review":"It's one thing to have timed puzzles, it's another thing to have entire sequences timed. The thing I like about adventure games is being able to explore locations and items in a deliberate manner. I don't want to have to race around clicking on every item or using all my inventory items randomly in hopes that I can get a sequence done before time runs out and Holmes is killed off.

I was horribly wrong. This was one of the worst games ever made.For example, about 5 minuites into the game, you have to solve a puzzle before you can do anything else. I dont like puzzles a lot. Well, this game was full of them. Half of the things you were required to do turned out to have no point later in the game. To make my day of gaming even worse, I have come across 2 slider puzzles in the game so far, and i havent finished it yet. {im not anywhere near to finsihing it yet.}The cursor in the game is very confusing. I just kept clicking around the screen because i didnt understand any of the cursor symbuls. I have counted throughtout my half gaming experience, and noticed the cursor changes 6 times!If you are going to buy this game, get a walkthrough first, because i couldnt do half the stuff on my own without one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Dreamcatcher usually puts out very cool games, but this one looks like it was made in 1992 (and that's being nice). The graphics were poor compared to other adventure games, and a lot of the puzzles had nothing to do with the game. I could not tackle a puzzle sometimes because the clues had really nothing to do with the game, so it was hard to know what to look for. And one puzzle near the end required the player to LITERALLY find a pin in a completely destroyed room (like a needle in a haystack!). There was NO WAY of being able to see this piece, let alone find it, unless you carefully followed the directions of a walkthrough. I think they could have done better.

I think that other technical matters(Bow driving, fingering, vibrato)and musical matters(knowledge of Bottesini's language in relation to the instrument's possibilities) allow performers to make the audience forget about the instrument and enyoy this pure, simple and passioned music. This was what Bottesini did in his time; he could SING whith his instrument. Bottesini's playing was very close to \\"Belle Canto Italiano\\", he was a lover of the opera (his mother was a soprano and he was a close friend of Giusseppe Verdi). In my opinion Rinat Ibragimov is who is closest to this human, warm, passioned voice. I think that we must listen to all versions of Bottesini's works and discuse about these matters.

Nearly 20 years later I discovered \\"Ghosts of the Great Highway\\" by Sun Kil Moon (the \\"New\\" band from Mark of RHP) and loved it. Didn't sound much like anything else being released in this day and age ... which was a plus. If pressed for a comparison, I'd say: Nick Drake meets America, as produced by some musician from the 4AD label. Very moody, mesmerizing, and atmospheric. I saw this CD at a shop in Kuala Lumpur earlier this year and bought it, not knowing it was all Modest Mouse songs. Whatever. I know almost next to nothing about Modest Mouse, so I can't compare this to the originals, but I like most of these tracks, or at least Mark's interpretation of them. The only negative; the album barely clocks in at 30 minutes. Not much music, but the quality is high. Favorite track: \\"Trucker's Atlas.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Interpretations of modest mouse songs","review":"I was quite surprised how good this is. The singing reminds one of Neil Young in his slowest songs from the early 70's. The understated guitars are subtly and beautifully played.

Now the problems I hear, in each song except Convenient Parking he drones on and on and on. Maybe thats his style, but you can't really get far doing that in each song. And what's up with that guitar?! It's the same sound for every song, just playing a different order of chords. I see some people posting that this is better than Mouse and this blows Mouse away, well why is it Modest Mouse has been nominated for Grammys and this guy hasn't? Why is it Modest Mouse was voted best band of 2004 by over 5 different best-selling magazines and this guy wasn't? Why is Modest Mouse's music better then this guys?

It met my first goal, she loved listening to it on my system, and I wound up enjoying listening to it myself much more than I would have expected (I don't typically listen to this type of music), the recording quality and choral performance is so fabulous. It's inspired me to start listening to other choral music, but none of the CD's I've listened to since have the same sound quality. The choir washes over you like a warm wave of sound, the pipe organ is understated and appropriate to the pieces, and the soloists are very good.

The greatness of this book is in the fact that Mernissi tried to erase many of the misconceptions about women's rights in Islam as a doctrine. According to her, when it comes to women's rights, the practice of Islam in the Arab and Islamic world is not necessarily compatible with the doctrine of Islam.

There is a green section and blue esction of the accuracy meter. If you hit it on the green section, your pitch will be more accurate and most likely you will throw a strike. If your pitch meter hits the blue, then your pitch will end up as a ball or an easier hit for your opponent. I really ike how you can control the accuracy of your pitch or throw.

Often in this busy world we overlook the spiritual aspects of life and may not even know when we are blessed. Through the short stories of people as ourselves we see God is indeed alive and ready to assist us whenever we ask for his help. It is refreshing to find a book which makes God so available to us as individuals. As the words on the cover of the book ask: When God calls, are you listening?

The book doesn't help much with developing a foundation for your own ideas of how to work with Photoshop either.

Simply reading the first chapter would frustrate me; the author would should some complex example and then would mislead the reader that he would be explaining the example thorough. Instead, he would mention a small portion of the example and claimed that it would take too long to explain the example. For goodness sake, if the example is too complex to explain, then please use a simpler example - don;t try to impress the reader with a complex example only to refer to some other Oreilly books. Do you notice that he does not refer books other than those published by Oreilly?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Java & XML: Unbeatable Combination!!","review":"This book contains an enormous wealth of information about Java's tying with the essentials of XML. I'd still recommend obtaining another book exclusively on the intricacies of XML, since only the basics are covered in this book. XML contains a lot more than the few pages that this book talks of it.But XML is nothing without the software that interprets, handles and otherwise processes the format, and this book details this tying in with the Java language very well. Java parsers, APIs (SAX, DOM and JDOM), web services, everything is covered.One book that your Java programming bookcase should not be without!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poorly written Computer Science book","review":"While not the worst computer book that I have read; this one straddles the fence quite nicely. The author seems to know his subject, but is a bit scatter brained in places. In some instances I have to re-read paragraphs as if it were code itself. It only gets two stars, because grammar seems to be as important as content. It's an okay book otherwise, but the could have left out the xml primer, as it wasn't very meaningful. The overall content of the book is good, but nothing really seems to stand out here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Poor explanations.

I put it down for a few months. When I picked it up again, I made sure to do all the exercises while I read them, I immediately knew that was my problem. I think people that have not liked this book didnt' because it is very specific, the movements are very subtle and they dont have the patience to reread the same page over and over again. I find that when I do the exercises I still start with ex no. 1 and work my way through them one at a time. Someday I may not have to do that, but not for now I do since there is so much concentration needed. I highly recommend this to all people, but know that it takes yes, effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Based upon previous customer reviews, I was very excited about getting this book. I thought that it would help me to resolve my problems with my lower back - herniated disk L5-S1, and add flexibility. Instead it's much more of a discussion of how the pelvic bowl and floor work along with imagery of what they look like in action. It provides very little practical information about how to improve any problem areas or strengthening them. Most of the pictures are based upon the female pelvic structure, and I think the cover picture is designed just to attract male attention. This book was a waste of my time and money.

Has Ms. Michaels ever been to a training camp? Tom Clancy did research for HIS books, and it shows! I also found the character development to be appalling and unrealistic - something that seems to be a common vein in her books.

The premise of 5 ladies being approached to join a secret mercenary group is completely unbelievable. The 5 women to me seemed silly when they thought, why not, let's give up our lives as we know it and go do this.

They would need some sort of training. Fern also left out some serious details about Sam and Pappy's love connection.

He generally likes to be a loner, and when his father decides they are going to move to Africa, he likes the idea. All goes well until their second plane ride into Tanzania. The plane crashes and Chris' father and the pilot are severely injured. The rest of the book talks about their quest for survival. The Place of the Lions had the potential to be a decent book. It has a great beginning, but once you get to about page 40, it starts going down hill. The book is extremely repetitive about lions attacking and \\"Chris' big desiscion\\". If the author would've just gotten to the point instead of dwelling on unimportant issues it would've been a lot better. I feel the book is generally geared towards young boys aged 10-12. This book really reminded me of Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen. If you enjoyed that book, I'm sure you will also like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"The current Bishop of Albany, NY expresses his ideas on what it takes to be an exceptional catechist.

The material that Dallas takes it upon himself to cover is broad and complicated -- the political and diplomatic history of several nations, of course, as well as military, social, and economic material as it bears upon those central issues. Yet Dallas pulls it all off, and makes us care, too, about the personal frailties of the \\"rich and famous\\" of Europe almost two centuries ago. The personalities that stuck most to my mind as I closed this book were not quite those of the \\"headliners\\" whose names we all remember from school -- Napoleon, Talleyrand, Castlereagh -- though they all get their due. The figures who stick most to my mind are those of the Duchess von Sagan, Benjamin Constant, and Samuel Whitbread. Dallas illustrates a truth sometimes forgotten, that the novelistic touch in the portrayal of character is a great gift for a historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the subject","review":"If you only ever read one book about the background of the Waterloo campaign, this has to be it.

Mr. Dallas' work is indeed meticulously documented, but that very meticulosity renders his story line exceedingly difficult to follow. Most of the book attempts to help the reader understand the antecedents of Waterloo through the Congress of Vienna. The account of the Congress was disjointed. Characters were introduced with little context.The description of Waterloo itself seemed to me to be a very short leap preceeded by far too long a run.I just didn't like the book.

If it had that, this would make a great game complete. This is fun and the graphics are superb. I love this game and recommend it to you.

The summaries range from alright to bad. He glosses over terms quickly and doesn't explore any depth nor does he point out points of controversy. Even though these are summaries, they seem fairly vapid. It doesn't help that many of the works discussed are not available in English. The capstone for the book is when he talks about why these philosophers aren't studied much. One can't help but think this is the thing he got most correct. They don't fit into most phil. departments and they don't fit into most East Asian studies departments. This book doesn't seem fit for an intro course nor does it seem fit for a focused seminar. Unfortunately, Heisig's book is forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"BMV 1030 is a masterpiece","review":"Naxos' J.S. Bach releases have been excellent thus far, and the two volumes of flute sonatas are no exception. Both are highly worthy of being purchased, and this second volume might be even better than the first. This is mostly due to the BMV 1030 sonata, which deserves a special place in the Bach canon. It is not discussed as often as are some of his other masterpieces, but it is just as beautiful as these better-known works. All three movements linger in the memory long after the first listen (the spectacular third epitomizes the driving power of baroque music), and words can't really do the piece justice. The remaining compositions are also nice, but the CD's jewel is definitely BMV 1030 - this is a perfect disc to experience some lesser-known but no less crucial Bach works."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The Fury of Our Maker's Hand was possibly the best heavy metal album EVER!

The CD offers more of what JE fans have come to expect which isn't really saying a lot, considering the group has been in the game for ten years now. The production is the same of the majority of the CD and once again those damn twins handle most of the singing. While there are some standout tracks such as Seasons Change, Baby Feel Me and Hopefully, JE is going to need to come harder on CD number six to keep me as a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Short..","review":"Unfortunately Jagged Edge didn't come hard on this album. This is the worst album of the bunch. The lead singer has a voice that sticks out and most of the songs on this album don't express that. He has the voice to sing more powerful songs. Another thing is the topics on their songs seem to be juvenile. The continue to talk about getting girls cause they're pimps. I think its time these grown men now realize their older and sing songs that mean something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Latest Two","review":"Like a lot of reviewers, I have been a fan of JE since I heard their debut. I love the twins' vocals and talents. This is their 5th album, it's good, but not the best of course. They still hold hot and tight beats very well,but I think we need some more changes, such as a few of romantic ballads...Better than their 3th and 4th album, maybe it's a nu beginning,C'mon JE..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed","review":"I have been anticipating this album for months now and i couldn't be more disappointed. I love Brian and Brandon and respect all of their work but I cant believe they even put this out. Good Luck Charm is the best thing on here. When I heard good luck charm I expected the rest of the album to be just as great but it definetly isn't. Lots of bad production and filler songs. It is gonna take a spectacular and immediete album to make up for this work. Maybe next time guys. I do not reccomend this cd. Maybe the low album sales will smack some reality into them and make them return to their original great music. Love tthem but hate the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pan!","review":"Purchased for my daughter.

The characters were fresh and unique, well developed, believable and consistent. The romance was palpable and the characters remained true to themselves even as they fell in love and learned invaluable lessons about acceptance and trust. Descriptions were vivid, and I felt myself transported back in time, enjoying the glimpse of 17th Century Massachussetts, the Caribbean, and Jamaica. Ms. Reed clearly did her research, and it shows!

We use a MAHA MH-C401FS charger which charges each battery independently so they don't get overcharged. What else can you say about rechargeables? Either they last long or they don't.

I give up. I can charge these overnight and they'll show as full. I'll store them in our battery container and watch in horror as the kids go through them complaining that they aren't working.

I grab 2 batteries and place them into my Energizer DUO charger. When i place them in, the green LED on the charger begins to blink, rapidly. This was strange to me because my old batteries never got a blink like this. I then go to look at the manual to see what all the flashing meant. I was surprised to see that it meant one of two things. It meant that either i have non-rechargeable batteries in the charger or the batteries are bad and are defective.

I asked for an immediate refund (so I could buy my product elsewhere)....but after exchange of emails assuring me that refund was in the works,plus a phone call to their customer service to request prompt refund, after 10 days I finally had to file a claim with my bank which promptly reversed the charge.So beware of vendors holding your money without service---this amounts to you giving them a free loan for 2 weeks!

Rally Fusion, Colin McRae 3, V Rally 3, and Rally Championship are probably not coming out on Gamecube, but this will more than do. It is way ahead of Ubi Soft's Pro Rally 2002.If you want a rally game, this is the best one available, with the possible exception of Rallisport Challenge (PC, XBOX).

Well if that perfect game hasn't come yet go out and buy Freedom Fighters. These days it just seems like EA Games is just pumpin out one winner after another. The multiplayer capabilities are enought to buy this game for. The gameplay is intense and difficult, and the AI is very intelligent. The tracers and your team members all around you in the fight for freedom is just an unbeleivable gaming experience. I also own Conflict Desert Storm, and I must say Freedom Fighters comes out on top, with a SOCCOM US Navy Seals coming into a close second place. Everything about this game I love.

As someone who loves GTA, Godfather and Mercenaries, I had high hopes for this game. But it is more oriented to turn-based strategy, as you have to order your minions into fights and spend more time commanding than running and gunning. And speaking of gunning, having to press the analog stick down to aim is klunky and slows down the action. I was excited to get this game, but the excitement wore off and became frustrated neglect after a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total disappointment","review":"Don't even waste fifteen dollars on this game. I am at the tail end of Call of Duty and decided to prepare myself for a new game investment and the reviews here suggested that Freedom Fighters would be a good time. NO! It is terrible. The set up for controls is unnatural and the sight of my character's body instead of a weapon is disorienting. The multiplayer aspect is a failure as well, becoming a stupid game of capture the flag. The orders you give to your recruits is mindless. You'd have more fun taking a twenty dollar bill and burning it instead of playing this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever.","review":"Freedom Fighters is defintley one of my favorite video games no question. This game is such a blast in both single player and multiplayer. It has a great setup for the single player as you fight for freedom against the Soviet Union. The multiplayer mode on this is also a blast, you get to take over bunkers raise the flag etc. On multiplayer it has 3 maps to chose from. Also on multiplayer, it has weapons laying around to pickup or swap for a varity of firearms. This game can have 4 players playing on multiplayer. But i don't know how that works because my playstation has only two controller slots. Thats the only very minor downside and it has to do with the system, not the game. Well, this was my experince with this game, and it was a positve one.

Isabella Angelina- Angelina Jolie. Phil Bagzton- Jake Gylenhall.Troy Stone- Kevin Dunn Mr. Jones- Max Von Sydow. Tatiana Kepinski- Radha Mitchell.

His luminous, imaginative, yet utterly realistic paintings helped convince millions of post-WWII Americans that space travel was more than an fantasy -- it could happen in their lifetime if they wanted to do it badly enough. It's unlikely that this turnaround in public opinion to support the space program, beginning in the late 1940s, could have happened without Bonestell's inspirational artwork appearing in hundreds of magazines, books, movies and on TV. With Schuetz' book in hand, anyone with access to a decent University or City library can easily locate the original printings of Bonestell's illustrations and see for themselves how and where the Space Age was born. This is easily the best book on Chesley Bonestell and comes highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A word about sizes...","review":"Both products are 5 star winners on their own...But BE AWARE that the tripod DOES NOT fit in the case.

For those of you that played Splinter Cell, you know that Splinter Cell is a near perfect stealth game. But Tenchu is just a dumbed down stealth game in comparison.First of all, the point of the game is to get stealth kills. I didn't like that aspect at all. The point of being a ninja is to go through the mission undetected without leaving traces. But you're just jumping around and leaving bodies everywhere.Also, the AI is stupid. I'm so used to Splinter Cell where the enemies can hear you sneak up behind them if you're not careful. But here you don't have to stalk. You just run up and kill them. They also give up too easily. You can hide behind a tree and they'll get stumped.Finally the camera is horrible. It is very hard to actually sneak if you can't monitor the enemy because the camera is being retarded. I think this game might be a little more fun if the camera work was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old only worse","review":"This game is nothing more than a revamped version of the first two. However, the controls are even worse and the camera often leaves you facing some other direction than which you are seeing. You continually have to press L1 to readjust the camera. The levels are almost exactly the same as the previous games. Combat is flat out stupid and there is only one new feature that lets you gain new combo moves by piling up stealth kills. That's fine and dandy but the combo moves gained are combat inefficient. Waste of money, waste of time.

You will absolutely love this novel.Also recommended reads: Impossible, Eleven On Top, Full Bloom and Fire In The Ice"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and hard to finish","review":"While I love Sandra Brown's writing, this book fell short by a long shot. I couldn't like any of the characters and just wanted the book to be finished. I even considered skipping a few pages towards the end to get it back to the library on time. It's sad to think a SB book took me almost 14 days to read. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"whats going on here?","review":"I\\"m really surprised that people gave this book so many stars! I have been a Sandra Brown fan from the beginning and I love her books and look forward to each one. The last book I really loved was \\"Envy\\" and it seems that every book after lacked a little something. This book was slow and none of the characters did anything for me. I felt no reaction good or bad towards any of them. I felt this wasn't what I have come to expect of her books. I usually finish her books in one sitting because I cant put them down...I struggled to get through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I've read alot of Sandra Brown and this one literally put me to sleep. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. I should have listened to my instincts and just stopped reading it when I couldn't get into it by page 100, but my Mom said it was so good that she couldn't put it down. It seems a lot of her recent work doesn't live up to her earlier works such as Witness. I was very disappointed, and I hate the new premium paperback, it's too big and heavy, probably just another way to make a few more dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"same ole same ole","review":"ms brown likes to use the *N* word in her books, i want to read a book to enjoy. i understand in older books before people knew better it would be there. but i do not see it to be necessary in this shallow novel. i will not be reading any more of her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's to like?","review":"I will confess that I started this book and did not like it...NONE of the main characters, with the exception of Beck and the dead brother, were likable...so I borrowed a friends audio (unabridged) cd and listened to it while going back and forth to work. The story was just interesting enough to keep me going, but I felt like our heroine was stupid (and she was supposedly a brilliant business woman), whiney, bad-tempered, and amazingly shallow - you hate your father's business and all he stands for, yet are irrisistibly drawn to his right-hand man?I usually like Brown's book, but not this one."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(O,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-a0493c6c"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/46.md","filePath":"quotes/46.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/46.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
