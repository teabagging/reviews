Terribly afraid of dark stains, though. She decides first that she wants his bed (without him in it) and then him (with the bed).

It's a cute little romp about a girl(Merle Oberon) playing a joke on a naive gorgeous young lawyer(Lawrence Olivier). He easily falls in love with her but thinks that she is a wicked woman who's been married several times. She plays along and lets him think that it's true causing all kinds of funny chaos in the life of the love -struck lawyer. Lawrence Olivier looks especially dashing and handsome!

Nice to watch Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon in their happier days (they hated each other later in Wuthering Heights), but this rating is not for the film itself, it's a rating on the DVD quality only. This is basically a VHS transfer to a DVD. Gritty quality and faded colors. If you get the chance to catch the oh-so-much-nicer Turner Classic Movies showing of the film, you'll see a big difference. If the TCM version was on the DVD, then easily 5 stars. This DVD only gets a generous 2 stars (1 star because it's on DVD and 1 more because I've seen worse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess you had to be there...","review":"Fans of Raimundo Fagner, a pop idol in the Brazilian Northeast, may like this, but for most listeners outside of Brazil, I doubt this florid pop album has much to offer.

Practically the entire movie is filmed free hand, and not a steady freehand. This effect is usually uses as a tool to convey haphazard action, and thats fine. When used sparingly. I literally got a headache from watching this movie. Much of the care that seemed to go into the far superior Nightwatch is missing in this trainwreck. I honestly had no idea what was happening through at least 70 percent of this film. The production just didn't have the sleekness of the predecessor. It felt like a rough draft. I hop that these guys can do a better job with Twilight Watch, although I dont really understand where the story can go from the ending of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daywatch","review":"I really think the whole concept is great. This movie was not a letdown at all. I think that with a bigger budget, better actors, and a better director, this could be redone as one of the greatest trilogies ever.

It's also a trying movie that wears out its welcome about an hour and a half in. (It's 146 minutes long.) It also falls apart at its cop-out ending, which I saw before the prologue ended.Day Watch tries to succeed, it really does, but it's not that the movie is too ambitious. The main fault with the movie is that the concepts introduced in Night Watch only make for one movie. Any further movies and the concept is exposed as being, for lack of a better word, stupid. Nothing is really explained. Every character thinks they're smarter than each other only to be proven wrong time and again. The whole experience insulted my intelligence and tried my patience.And have I mentioned that lame ending?Avoid this movie and its prequel Night Watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russian Magic Fiction","review":"I bought this movie because he had just bought an HD LCD TV (and got a free bluray player from Amazon).

The backstory and plotlines are WONDERFUL! I can see that this setting has a fantastic potential.Unfortunately, I don't think it was pulled off. I don't mind dubbing. I'd rather have dubbed than subtitled. The special effects were rather cheesey and a number of the characters were strictly two-dimensional (and some even almost one dimensional). I inferred a lot of the plot and had to explain it to the spouse as things progressed.I want to like this movie.

And thats how our tale begins (continues)...Zavulon and Geser continue to play their unending chess game through their pawns Yegor, Svetlana, Alice, Olga and Anton. But this time the stakes are really high!This is a great story about fatherly love (not only Anton and Yegor relationship), responsibility and sacrifice.With very good special effects and a decent adaptation of the second and third books of the series, this movie is a treat for the urban dark fantasy fan.There are memorable sequences like Alice and a Mazda or the birthday party (this fantastic scene was filmed at a real party!!!).The extras are somewhat weaker than the Night Watch DVD; it only includes a making of and a trailer. The subtitles are brilliant.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See Sequel","review":"Sequels be damned some say, but never in this great masterpiece of work. DayWatch finally came to the US and it was one of the best sequels to date in the Vampire Series. I recommend watching it in its native tongue of Russian to really get into it, but if English is a must, it holds up pretty well in the dubbed version. Cutting edge camera angles, imagery and acting. The costumes are very well done for this Russian tale of Teeth, Love and the power struggle of Good Vs. Evil.I can't wait until the Third Installment comes out and watch the series back to back. DayWatch is a Masterpiece Sequel to NightWatch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No animated subtitles!","review":"Please note that I am rating the disk alone and not the film which I give 4 stars.

Apparently Fox decided that the subtitles were not worth releasing in their animated form for this first dvd launch, so we are stuck with normal player-based subtitles (white and plain).A bit of a let down, but perhaps we will get a definitive version later down the line.

His book was indeed what some might call propaganda, but one should look at the real propaganda books of the era before becoming upset.

However it is perfect for the professional finisher - especially if you take an interest in historic paints and techniques. There are many excellent recepies for historic paints, including calcamine. For the serious decorative painter this book is top notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Beginner","review":"This book shows beautiful faux finishes, but goes more into the natural and/or elaborate elements needed to attain the beautiful finish. It doesn't teach the beginner or home decorator the basic steps needed to attain the wonderful results.

Skeptical, but complied and amazed! it worked. (I had already rubbed it with my fingers, but that had not helped.) I don't know if that is a mirror or a contact. It's the only metal showing on the whole thing.Anyway the copies look fine, I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foundation Music","review":"Foundation Music, as Britten used to describe this kind of music.

Since they were having a great sale I decided to check out a few other groups, and got this CD based on all the good reviews here. This was definitely not what I was expecting...I mean maybe it can be classified as \\"indie\\" but it reminds me of radio pop punk in a bad way -- I think because of the electric guitar sound on a lot of the upbeat songs, the cheesy cliched lyrics, and the lead singer's voice. Something about that voice grates on my nerves to no end! Overall sounds like, hmm, Motion City Soundtrack maybe? I don't know a whole lot about this genre so it's hard for me to come up with a good comparison.The album's not terrible, though. The instrumentation sounds decent, there's just nothing to differentiate most of the songs to me. No spark. For similar indie pop/rock done well, check out Spoon, Ted Leo, maybe the Hold Steady \\"Boys and Girls in America\\" or Pavement \\"Crooked Rain Crooked Rain.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 1st Album","review":"These boys started off their career with a head start. This is album is solid start to finish -- the perfect record for a warm summer night drive. The harmonies, the production, the songs, and of course Nate Henry's vocals, like warm butter spread across a sonic bagel.The bonus tracks are cool as well, and definitely make this album a steal at only 8 bucks.

I am blessed to have his music and i am so thankful that he is not one of those musicians that speak half-truth when they are composing christian lyrics.Here is a tip: Take the time and listen to the whole album with the lyrics in front of you. It will be a great journey!! Neal, may God continue to bless you with uncompromising truth in your ministry!By the way, Sola Scriptura is definitely the complete message for us.

However, in listening to the album I can only say that this album is simply sheer enjoyment. I have all of Spock Beard's disks and all four of the newest (post-Beard) CD's of Neal. This one's got everything. It's complexity, heaviness and beauty are in my opinion, in perfect balance. To me Testimony was a perfect 10. However, I felt that \\"One\\" fell short to maybe an 8. Then ? climbed up to a 9. S.S. to me is a 10.5 and still growing (on me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing!","review":"One of those few c.d.'s where you are musically and lyrically completely content. You feel that you are actually getting a glimpse into Neil's soul as he deeply reveals his thoughts and amazing musical talents. As another reviewer said, as a christian, it speaks to your heart and mind. For all those Christians burnt out on bubble gum pop, here's your answer. Clear influences of Yes, Pink Floyd, Rush, and the list goes on. For those that want to cry and complain about the lyric content and christian lyrics the solution is simple: don't buy the c.d. I'm sure Neil and everyone else could care a less if you like it or not. Thank God for Neil Morse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great !","review":"The opening track is really good, it is one of these great prog tracks lasting nearly half an hour with a strong ending section. Overall, the cd is really great and the musicians are talented. My only complaint is for the lyrics, since I don't believe in any God, the message is a bit boring to me, but I respect Neil and his thinking as well as anybody who have faith, after all, he is a great composer and his music is just amazing, that's what it is all about !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes the truth is offensive...","review":"and truthfully, the music on this album is some of his best. When was the last time you went to a record store and bought an album 75+ minutes long with 4 songs? Neal Morse is one of the few musicians who can do this and make it work.Many times while listening to this album, some of the musical themes and musicianship make me feel like I am listening to a Transatlantic album. Many times while listening to this album, I feel like I am listening to a GOOD Spock's Beard album. Some themes in their structure can be compared to Snow.Obviously Neal Morse is the brainchild behind some very good bands, yet he gets bashed when he writes lyrics about eliminating religion and making God personal again (which was Martin Luther's idea). And when was the last time you heard a concept album about Martin Luther, a vivid historical figure?Buy the album and find out for yourself, but don't deny the musicianship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good Game","review":"This years Madden 2005 is a pretty cool game. I just wish they would improve the graphics like in ESPN NFL 2k5. The heads on the players look like really big dead ballons in relation to their body size and the crowd animations and grass textures are just plain ugly. As always, the Madden series has excellent gameplay and slick menu systems. John Madden's play by play is really cool. If the developers could improve the graphics this game would be awesome. I like my video games to look as realistic as possible like Doom 3 or Ghost Recon 2. Madden has the gameplay now they have to improve and update the graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"First of all this kills ESPN and all the others .

Madden has not changed that much except the Feild Goals and the hit stick which you have to time just right to be effective.

In the old game, you could play on DEMO view, and if you knew anything about football, you could read the plays, know where your best players would be on a pass play, or a run play, and run the play according to its design. So it was like actually watching a game in action, but you controlled the plays and the action. It was a great game. Not anymore. I won't play it and I hope I can get my money back.

John Madden thought that it would be a great idea to have no choice on if you want or don't want to have the salary cap turned off. Now usually I play for the first couple years with a salary cap, like i did this year, but I found out that after I played 2 years of my season I couldn't play because I was 30,000,000 dollars in the hole and I did not have any created players, and they were all average players. I play with the vikings. The only people on that roster that have big salaries are Moss and Culpepper. Why doesn't madden get rid of that AI. thing, that is the dumbest thing on the game.

Reading such glowing reviews here, and liking \\"similar\\" music like Zero 7 and Tosca, I snapped up the one (used) copy in the store. Disappointing, to say the least. On first listen it seemed, like the earlier reviewer said, cheesy and corny. I shut it off after about the third track. Then I thought it might be decent background music for work, where I have to avoid being too caught up in music anyway. Wrong! This album is just not good. It's almost mindnumbingly repetitive, so much so that instead of soothing and lulling me like this sort of music is supposed to do, it started to drill into my brain like some sort of torture device. And hard as I ended up trying, I just couldn't detect any kind of personality behind the music. It seems almost entirely derivative, though there are some nice effects with chimes and bells or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh . . . no","review":"There was something a bit corny and cheesy about caia that just didn't appeal to me. There's a warm, all engulfing fuzzy feel to this disc but it left a bad taste in my mouth. It seemed a bit too over produced and the music came across as murky and muddled. I tried selling my copy at three different used music stores and no one wanted to buy it. If you like your downtempo a bit cheesy and forgetable, the magic dragon is for you. Not a single track reached out and grabbed me and the disc kind flowed in such a manner that eventually every track started to sound a like. I was finally able to unload my copy.

The main problem is in the half the book that's taken up by flotsam and fluff.The reader from Detroit was very right in saying that \\"the... specialty priests are vastly underpowered compared to the priests in any other AD&D work\\"; hence why it's necessary to tweak and add to them extensively. The powers are also so restricting that they're worth ignoring entirely; the only thing they'll do is make dozens of AD&D pantheons clones of each other.The main purpose of this book is to give some ideas on what gods may exist and what their priesthoods are like. If you do buy this and use it in your campaign, however, DON'T USE ANY OF THE SPECIALTY PRIESTHOODS AS IS...

It's all been duplicated elsewhere.","review":"The Complete Priest's Handbook is one of those TSR works that is almost completely replaceable with other works.First, the Faith creation system and specialty priests are vastly underpowered compared to the priests in any other AD&D work. You're better off using the class customization rules from Player's Option: Spells & Magic, or even raiding a world-specific work and tweaking the priests.The kits are generally boring, and most are essentially identical to similarly-named fighter or wizard kits. The personalities are okay, but any experienced roleplayer won't need them, whereas an inexperienced player would be better off looking at potrayals of clergymen in general fiction for archtypes.Finally, the equipment and combat rules are essentially identical to those in the Complete Fighter's Handbook.In short, it isn't very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"world of the unknown classic collectors edition","review":"this dvd has some really interesting material but its very poorly filmed,and set in the 70's, so quite poor quality, as compared with today's technology.But, it does have some interesting topics included, although they tend to jumparound from one to another quite quickly, without warning.I was a bit disappointed in this DVD, on the whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best author","review":"Mrs Mccomber is the best author I have ever read.

Second, they do not have the strongest historians on their writing staff. e.g. He makes fun of Abigail Adams for her poor spelling, when at that time, spelling was not standardized.

Let alone the money her family stolefrom the Iranian people.It was this very repressive nature of the Pahalvi regime that led touprising and revolution in Iran.

From Ashraf's point of view, her family came from nobility and were born to power. The reality is that the Shah's father was a poor miliatary man. He couldn't feed his family, but later rose to power through cunning and force.In this book Ashraf writes about all the good works the Shah did in Iran. That's like saying Saddam Hussein was progressive. For instance, in both cases women did have more rights - nothing close to the West - but more. But at a high cost of living under a dictator.The current government in Iran is abysmal, but the Shah's rule was horrible, too, maybe a little less so.

I found them gasping for air and soon developed small amounts of red algae. Keep in mind, I have maintained the aqaurium the same way with the same products for years. The ammonia remover must contain a phosphate that also removes the CO2 and oxygen from the water. This causes many fish to die and the red algae growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"be nice to your fish - use stress coat","review":"yes, it's an added expense, but stress coat is very nice to have on hand for anytime you have a less than perfect situation in your tank; adding new fish, setting up a new tank, cleaning the old one or maybe the water quality got a tad bit too dirty before you changed it, or maybe your fish got sick/ stress coat just helps to ease the stress on the fish. be nice to your fish, use tress coat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy fish","review":"I've been using this product for both my pond fish and aquarium fish on a regular basis. Doing partial water changes seems to be less stressful for the fish when using this product. But then, of course, I'm not a fish, so I am just guessing.At least, I've never had a problem with partial or complete water changes or topping off either the aquarium or the pond due to evaporation. It helps with their slime coat and after using it, I do water tests for ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, etc., and the chlorine always shows negative. I buy this stuff by the gallon as it's much cheaper that way.It's also recommended for use after handling or netting the fish or for any stressful situations. So far, all of our fish are doing great and growing like weeds.I plan to continue to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"API","review":"I use this once a week during my 20% water change.

There are some Indigenous chants and mantras that are scattered throughout - but respectfully done to the songs they are included in without being overpowering. The flute work is genuine and soft. While a few songs do sound quite similar in tone, that is OK as they help to reinforce the spirited mood of the whole album. Overall, these efforts capture the essence of oneness with nature and respects the listener with a gentleness that is welcome in today's modern world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of these reviewers don't get it.","review":"I'm giving this record 5 stars to offset the crybabies who want Elvis to sound like the old days. GET OVER IT! This is his most complex and mature recording to date. Elvis's dalliances with Burt Bacharach, Bill Frisell and the rest have come to play here in a complete album of songs that show Costello at his best. His songwriting skills are better than ever--this disc will one day be called a classic. In fact, I predict it will win a Grammy. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"Being an Elvis Costello fan for some 15 years now, I was really looking forward to this disk, especially since the reviews have hyped it as a \\"return to his roots.\\" Don't believe it. I count two good songs (\\"15 Petals\\" and \\"Tart\\") and a few other ok ones (\\"Spooky Girlfriend\\"). The rest is not good, unless you are a BIG fan of his later, post-Spike work. There isn't a song on this album that is as good as the older material. It'll sit on a shelf alongside Mighty Like a Rose: i.e. unlistened."},{"rating":"1","title":"When I Was Cruel - I Was MUCH Better","review":"45 is pretty good. And, um, yeah. Ok, now be honest, is there a single song on this album (all 60 minutes plus of it) that is better than any single song on:Armed ForcesImperial BedroomMy Aim Is TrueGet Happyor the underated Blood + ChocolateIn my opinion, nope, not a one. I guess everyone is excited because When I Was Cruel isn't as horrid as Spike, or Mighty Like a Rose. But sad to say, if this is the best he can do, then the thrill is gone indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'm done with Elvis","review":"Yes, it's about the best he can do now, very slick and polished and somehow completely lacking. I guess he has just left me behind...or I've left him...or something. I was pretty excited by the first track or two when this album came out, but I ended up only listening to this CD three or four times...nothing caught in my mind..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor has no clothes","review":"The tuneless, witless, ponderous chants (\\"I believe we just become a speck of dust\\" x10000), noisy, overloaded guitars, and overfamiliar patented Elvis phrasing and vocal tricks overwhelm the couple of decent songs on this record. And the horn arrangements? Uggh. Just horrendous. Critics and fans seem to be suffering from mass delusion on this one, and I would be bet you dollars to donuts that no one is playing this as often as their hyperbolic praises would lead us to believe. I guess I am mostly alone in thinking the songs he wrote for his project with Anna Sofie squash like a grape the ones on this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece? If You're An Insect, Maybe","review":"Eighty-some reviews clearly are not enough -- not when there's still an average of four stars showing for this incomprehensible mess of a cd. There isn't much I can add to all that's been already written here, but I do want to weigh in on the side of the nay-sayers. This batch of songs is so far below EC's old standards; I am utterly at a loss in trying to figure out what happened, or what Elvis was striving for. The sound quality is the worst I have ever heard, the horn arrangements are horrific, and the songwriting itself, well . . . it is just awful. And this from one of the greatest and most prolific songwriters of all time. Oh woe. And before you plunk down your money for it, whoa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis The Way He Ought to Be","review":"I think the Amazon review describes it pretty well. My first thought when I heard it is, \\"Finally, a REAL Elvis Costello album.\\" The album is laced with many of Elvis's good old tricks (lots of loud guitar, and some pretty searing lyrics), but it also has a more mature side that only adds to the overall record. The lyrics are more personal than political, but they still really work. His use of new instruments and sounds adds a new layer to his style, but doesn't overpower it. It has plenty of his raw power, with some incredible subtle touches. The song construction is excellent. Overall, if you love Elvis you'll love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe everything you read....","review":"I don't want to say something too strong, but the reviews I am reading are are so effusive that I can't take them seriously.For example, what do you mean that there has never been a terrible EC record? Honesly, HE would admit that. There have been any number of them. That is the very reason why he's worth listening to - because he's made bad records, too. Hello?Time will if this one stands up. Upon three listens, I doubt it, but I could be wrong. I used to think that Armed Forces was terrible, too, but now I see what was good about it. Nobody talks about that record any more....it's all My Aim Is True, This Year's Model and Blood and Chocolate. (Not even King of America, which amazes me....).Anyway, enough of your praise. Listen now, judge later.Cheers,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"I bought \\"MY AIM IS TRUE\\" in December, 1977, and followed this man's every album and single, all the way through to MIGHTY LIKE A ROSE in 1991. But I finally realized the harsh truth -- he's HAD it. I think Costello used to believe in something -- maybe anger, maybe rock and roll, maybe hatred or lust -- but SOMETHING. Now I think he just wants to churn out more records and to rehash the same old \\"revenge and guilt\\" trip for the thousandth time. He used to be a nihilist in the best sense -- smashing through all the false values of pop love songs and finding the lust and terror and power games underneath. Now he's a nihilist in the manner of -- oh, maybe the way a bad Las Vegas singer is nihilistic. He pretends to be involved in the craft of songwriting or the art of it, or some new political problem or his \\"spooky girlfriend\\" -- but he's really just \\"going through the motions\\" as he wrote once back when he wasn't. He's got nothing left to say but he still wants your money. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Imposter Lives Again!","review":"I think Elvis Costello actually died 15 years ago and this person has taken his place, writing (or I should say overwriting) a bunch of meaningless songs. There's not one song on here that is better than the worst song on any of his first 5 or 6 records, or that I would want to hear again. He should quit and just keep rereleasing his wonderful early work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I bought this on faith that the real EC was back. The guy who could twist meanings and tunes to places you never expected. The guy who authored the lines \\"thinking about grand larceny, smoking the everlasting cigarette of chastity\\".Nope. While it's better than much of his post-Blood and Chocolate stuff, this album is still, frankly, pretty boring. Oh, there's a couple good songs that'd merit a mix tape inclusion, but I'm not going to listen to it many more times.Ah, Elvis, mighty are the fallen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cool for the masses","review":"Very disappointing CD from the man who wants to be considered the witty antagonist of \\"Pop\\". It's admirable that he has long harbored interest in all varieties of music....it's just unfortunate that he makes it all sound the same. His limited vocal range worked well in the driving, catchy rhythms of his early music....and his snide, often cruel insights worked well in his \\"young angry man\\" days. Now that he is older you would think he would temper his view of the world and quit trying to be so clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Look, you can say all you want to justify this album, but for us lay people, a boring album is a boring album. This album sounded like one continous song - one of his non-descriptive songs that you've heard before but can't recall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis Is Dead","review":"It pains me to say that Declan McManus (his real name) no longer has the chops to fill an album with hits. Sure, he can still write great lyrics, but this album is sadly lacking in melodies. Without the foundation of hummable tunes, the music collapses. I think Costello deserved to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, but I was disappointed...ARRGHH!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to a new form","review":"EC's best effort since 'Blood and Chocolate' and his first truly great album in more than twenty years."},{"rating":"2","title":"EC DOES return to roots","review":"Having read the divergent reviews on this site, I have to comment. I have been an EC fan for about 20 years, and will continue to follow him regardless of what he puts out.However, this album is a lot of fun. I think about half of the songs are innovative and 2/3 are a lot of fun. My favorites evolve. After 6 listenings, I'm favoring \\"Tear off your own head\\" (Elvis must have played with dolls as a boy) and \\"15 Petals\\". The remaining third of the songs do sound retro-Elvis to me, and could have appeared on earlier albums.The biggest surprise to me is the sultriness in Elvis' voice. \\"I Want You\\" was a very sexy song that I got laid to in college, but I've never experienced Elvis this seductive before.Overall, definately worth buying for anyone interested in innovative pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"What can I say other than I love it. It is a wonderful, stupendous, phenominal, great, super, rocking, kick [butt], wow I want to listen to this again CD. If you don't have it, get it, and enjoy. On a different note, Elvis Costello has an almost equally wonderful website at elviscostello.com. Go see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best in eons!","review":"After years of what might best be described as \\"side projects\\" (albums with Burt Bacharach, Anne Sofie von Otter, and \\"The Juliet Letters\\" Costello returns to what he has always done best -- rock, with a decided acerbic edge.OK, OK. So he is pushing 50 and can never really be described as one of \\"punk's angry young men,\\" but then again this isn't \\"This Year's Model\\" and isn't intended to be. What we do have here is totally ace song writing from one of the masters. The experimentation of more recent efforts is gone, but what is here is a reminder of what made him such an important figure in the late 70's/early 80's in the first place. Don't miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool Elvis-where have you been?","review":"Where have you been Elvis? His forays into different musical genres made me lose interest. A new Elvis release was usually greeted with cynical questioning about what strange collaboration or direction was it going to be this time? The most recent Elvis cd I purchased was My aim is true with extended selections. When this cd was released and the reviews were exclaiming his return to form, I thought I would at least listen to the sound clips. Wow. Good stuff. Musically it is as interesting as anything he has done. Lyrically, it is as obscure as anything he has done (meaning I have no idea where the songs are supposed to be going). 45 is straight out of early elvis material. Spooky Girlfriend matches the start and it keeps on going. This is not just a rehashing, but a revisiting of a style that works beautifully. Welcome back Elvis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW COSTELLO","review":"The songs seem designed around the sparse but dominating pop hooks that serve as melodic pitstops to Costello's dark, new album, \\"When I Was Cruel\\". He seems to chide the new youthful generation of popular music tastes in \\"Cut Off Your Own Head (It's A Doll Revolution)\\", and on the title song he stands alone among failed peers and salivating starlets as if witnessing a phenomenal but faddish pop act spectacle under the glittering silver ball dance light of Abba's \\"Dancing Queen\\". This is not as surfacey consuming and exhausting as some of his recent work and the musical depth and crevices of \\"When I Was Cruel\\" could take several months to explore."},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome back, Mr. mcmanus","review":"the greatest songwriter of my generation is back, finally,with his best work since \\" the king of america\\".no more fiddley-dee with the bronsky quartet or burt bacharach(which i did kind of like). anyone who recently saw him On BRAVO\\"s musicians must realize that he hardly takes himself seriously, he is naturally, unabashedly, and without pretense the finest melodist since mccartney and the best satrist since h.l mencken. perhaps i go too far.bottom line....its a terrific record and if you loved him in the late 70's and early 80's, you need to purchase his cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics","review":"It appears that Mr. Mac Manus has gotten ballads,guest performances,and producing for other artists out of his system for now and has returned with an album of songs worthy of \\"The Angry Young Man\\" label he was tagged with in the late 70's. With 3/4 of The Attractions back in the fold, \\"When I Was Cruel\\" is filled with great musicianship, and of course the lyrics more like tracks from \\"Brutal Youth\\" than \\"Painted From Memory\\"While songs like \\"Tear Your Head Off\\" sound just a little too familiar, the time signature and experimental sounding \\"15 Petals\\" reassure you that Elvis is back. LOUD guitars and the always amazing keyboard/piano work of Steve Nieve make this the album Costello fans have been longing for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruel to be Kind","review":"Thrilled to hear Elvis rockin' out again. Love the single and \\"Tart\\" - \\"Alibi\\" - \\"When I Was Cruel\\". First CD I've purchased in ages that I can't get enough of. So glad he's not doing one of those esoteric collaborations again. Look forward to his tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King of Confidence","review":"The buzzword on this this nifty, noisy treat is that it's LOUD -- and it is! But I think the key to WIWC's success (and make no mistake: it's an unqualified success in every sense of the word) lies not in its sound so much as its attitude. Or rather, Costello's attitude. He's cocky again -- as if he's finally remembered that he's the greatest songwriter of his generation and doesn't need to tiptoe around the recording studio and compromise himself or his songs in any way whatsoever anymore. Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Did not like this album. 45, spooky girlfriend, and tart are good songs but the rest was to my ears pretty much unlistenable -- where have all the catchy lyrics and melodies gone? His newer singing style worked very well w/ Burt B and in concert with Steve Nieve, but for \\"rock\\" or \\"new wave\\" style album it detracts. Besides that the backing music is too strong and hard -- give me more keyboards, flutes, harps etc.What I really miss are the interesting and frankly unbelievably beutiful musical arrangements which can be found on many EC records; the first five albums which are essential, plus Spike (superb music and lyrics start to finish); imperial bedroom, king of america, goodbye cruel world, mightly like rose.The Beatles did not put out a bad album and there is no reason why EC, who is equally talented, should either. Dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing music","review":"Elvis has once again shown he is incapable of writing a bad song. This album offers delightfully dark songs which are his trademark. Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis is King","review":"Disregard the reviewer who asks for forgiveness for his long memory in which he compares this album to \\"Spike\\". His memory is not so long as he imagines: The song described was \\"Veronica\\" not \\"Victoria\\". Anyhoo, a return to form is not a bad thing when the form is this shapely. Especially when compared to what else is out there these days. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let us now praise Ohio Players","review":"Ahh 70's funk.

The sound quality is cheap, the music is off key too often (it hurts to hear how many times she is flat), and the band tries WAY to hard to make time changes that simply are ill planned and poorly executed.

Then I started getting the blue screen showing USBATA.SYS being the culprit. Now, I leave it unplugged when turning on my PC and plug it in only if I need to use it. I am working with their tech support trying to resolve this. Because their support is weekdays only (no weekends or evenings), I can only call them during the day at work, then try something at home and call them back the next day. It's very tedius process. If I don't get it resolved in a few days, I'd probably return it.

Windows 2000 recognized all the 4 drives and showed them in Windows explorer. Now when I inserted by Compact flash card, it did not recognize the media and kept asking me to insert the disk in the drive.I tried rebooting multiple times, installing and uninstalling the drivers. No luck. I even tried the other drivers recommended by another user in his review.

No problems with the MMC and the FlashCards, but the IntelliFlash was not able to read one of the 2 SmartCards I tested. It seems that it is not able to read SmartCards from some brands.The documentation that comes with the reader is very poor and does not address important information, like the correct way for inserting the SmartCards. I found it after spending some time searching on the Viking website. BTW, you have to insert the SmartCard with the golden contact facing down.

After downloading and trying every type of file restore program I could find on the Net to restore the files, I finally had to give up, reformat the card (losing all the photos) threw this reader in the trash and purchased a SanDisk reader and have had no problems.

First they break a vase with roses that Mama Bear just put there that morning. Who knows what they will break next. This book teaches kids that fighting is no use.

The instruction starts with very simple lessons that teach basic rhythmic walking, tango embrace, and lead an follow concepts. I liked the close-up views that demonstrate how feet should move, in slow motion and also with music. Instruction is in English by Fabian Salas himself, which is great, since you are getting it from the master teacher, not through a translator or subtitles. The video ends with a demonstration dance that incorporates all the material learned in the ten lessons. A very elegant dance indeed. Of course, the two exhibitions at the start of the tape, taped in front of live audiences, are absolutely amazing, and show how much there is to the world of argentine tango. Five stars plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic and real","review":"How is Argentine Tango different from the Ballroom Tangos (American, International, Hollywood)? It is different from the Ballroom tangos in everything: music, rhythm, embrace, steps, improvisation, shoes, feeling, ..., everything. If your background is in ballroom tangos, but you want to learn the real thing, you must forget the imposters and just think of Argentine Tango as a completely new dance. For a ballroom dancer, the Argentine Tango may seem like a puzzle - all those turns and spins and stops. It can be very surprising, exciting and unpredictable. This DVD series creates the building blocks of this dance. How else would you know what the real Tango is? If it is addictive, then it's from Argentina.

The fact of both shows are not the same. The differences were;on Season One's \\"The Bad Ol' Days\\", character \\"Rob Petrie\\" was dreaming that \\"Laura Petrie\\" (Mary Tyler Moore) was doing the housework, as if in the 1920's or 1930's decades, if not both, but extremely fast that what was filmed, was sped up to make it appear as if Laura Petrie was extremely speedy, doing her housework chores!Why there was no audience, this time, is that Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore were still saddened of the assassination, of USA's 35th President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, back on Friday, November 22nd, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.PS: The filming date & original televising dates differ between 3 to 4 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only episode I truly don't like","review":"This episode doesn't hold up well under the philter of time. A character in the show has a horrible secret that is tossed about a bit cavalierly, once it is revealed. It's unacceptable not only today, but back then as well, I imagine. The studio audience doesn't react very well either.It's a relatively average episode of the show up to that point, but that part just submarined it for me. I've seen the whole run dozens of time in syndication, but I don't remember ever having seen this episode before. Maybe this is why. I've never seen another episode of Dick Van Dyke that I just plain didn't like, but I anti-recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season Four is excellent.","review":"I have been watching this series in order and have been watching season four for the past week. I find it just as entertaining as the first three seasons. I find that the story lines that take place with Buddy and Sally are the funniest. While the ones with Laura are very heartwarming. I remember again with each episode why this was one of my favorite shows growing up. I received quick shipment and the product is first rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of seasons 1-3.","review":"I have now watched seasons 1-3 and must admit I liked season 2 the best.

Why? Physical comedy.Physical comedy never gets old and is truly timeless.

The entire cast is great and the comedy never gets old."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dick Van Dyke Show Season 5 Set","review":"The Lone Star is NOT for the show itself, which is fabulous. It's for Image Entertainment's lack of response to the defective DVDs in this set. I just purchased the 5th season (having bought the 4 previous sets with no problems) and so far Discs One and Two are defective. The episode titled \\"Draw Me A Pear\\" can't be watched at all. And the episode \\"52,45, or Work\\" cuts off half way through. I haven't watched the rest of the DVDs yet, but can only imagine what I have to look forward to.Has anyone out there purchased this set and been able to watch the whole thing without any trouble?"},{"rating":"2","title":"America before I was born","review":"Having been born in late 1960, I found it strange watching my way through the first season of this show. I never knew America when it was like this. It all seems so quaint to see a pre-Betty Friedan marriage, or a child who respects his parents, or Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke having two glasses of milk on their bed table before they go to sleep. By the time I became cognizant of the world, it looked more like what I was seeing on All in the Family. In fact, the Van Dyke show gave me such a nostalgic longing for the past that it even somewhat dampened by enjoyment of the show itself, I'm sorry to say. Nevertheless, there is laughter and great talent to be found here, so don't let the black and white picture talk you out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written. Great story.","review":"We have been to Vietnam twice, both times to Hanoi. I was, therefore, easily drawn to this story.

Sachs writes about people, not places. We get to know Vietnam by getting to know the people she meets and becomes close to, and we also get to know her---she writes in such a truthful way. Her writing doesn't seem to have an agenga, as does much writing done about similar circumstances. Even if you don't have an interest in Vietnam, you will enjoy this book if you just plain enjoy good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"In this second volume (and third part of the trilogy... a bit confusing this -very short- trilogy divided in two books) I missed nearly all the qualities of the first volume and found the flaws heightened.The storyline loses its pace and gets a little slow and boring, which is surprising enough if you reckon that this last part is essentially a manhunt, a subject that, if well done, should actually be breathtaking.Characters feel a little stereotyped, they declare their feelings for each other a little too loudly to be entirely believable.The overall impression is a sense of pedrantry, as if the intent in writing this last part of the story was to be didactic about homosexual relationships.The price is very high for such a short volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timely conclusion!","review":"Kalleen and Aaric are busy undoing Kalleen's future in the past...whilst the psychopathic warmongers (who'd make Bush and Cheney look peace-loving)of kalleen's original time seek him frantically, lest he undid their temporal sequence.

You will be completely lost in Stealing Some Time book two if you have not read the first book.This book has more of the same of book one but the biggest difference is that Aaric and Kallen get to know each other more as Kallen spends some time in Aaric's 1800 world.Of course, Kallen is in pursuit by the powers that be (in his respective time and world) as they learn he stayed behind. They don't know why he did but the ball of yarn eventually unravels and everything comes out.Nothing, and I mean nothing, exciting happens in this book. Tons of dialogue between Aaric and Kallen and lots more tech stuff happens that slows the pace of the book out of warp speed to a crawl.Yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as Great but some flaws!!!","review":"The ending to this book was indeed VERY ROMANTIC and i somewhat came to tears..I liked the ending very much...It's one of the things i liked about book 3..Overall,this book comes to an end very nicely but there are flaws compared to book 1 and 2...For instance, there seems to be some weird GRAMMAR problems with this book and the use of language is just outright WRONG..It makes no sense too me why the author changed soo much from book 1 and 2 to book 3..It just doesnt't work at all..Book 3 tends too have WAY too MUCH repeative INFORMATION which gets tooo long and boring other-wise the book is definitely great...Esp with the detailed SEX scene..Ohh my God, loved them..I still like the whole set...The soo called 3 books, which is condensed into two books, is way too short, in my opinion..I wished it was LONGER, over 300 something pages book it wasn't...OK, that's it for the review..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fruit Holder","review":"This was a birthday present for my husband because he loves fresh fruit and really got tired of having to eat over riped bananas...so when he opened this for his birthday he just laughed and said now my bananas won't ever be over ripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool!","review":"I like this and so does everyone who comes into my kitchen!

If all you know of Nat Cole is his lousiest hits like \\"Lazy, Hazy.....\\" prepare yourself for a very pleasant surprise.

The Natural Guitar II is one of those albums that you can listen to when you are in \\"one of those moods\\". It is calming and quiet, combining the sounds of nature with great guitar artistry. Birds, frogs, wind, etc., all complement some very smooth acoustic guitar work. I highly recommend this if you like good background music."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be okay for some projects","review":"This disk has a reasonably good selection of fruits and vegetables, and random household/office items, but beyond that, it's not too impressive. The lack of animals (aside from insects and one taxidermy duck) and vehicles is particularly disappointing.The images are all fairly low-resolution (no more than 500 pixels on their longer dimension). Also, these images do not have transparent backgrounds -- all of the images are in JPG format with white backgrounds. I'm not sure what the \\"Work with multiple vector-based clipping paths\\" part of the product description is referring to -- there do not seem be any clipping paths associated with the images on the disk.Overall, I think it's worth the $1.74 I paid for it, but it's not worth much more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"mixed reviews here...","review":"Had the tv system years ago- son loved it, and it was very educational, therefore I gave the few star rating. After a year or so, it kept malfunctioning, and though we got rid of the system, we kept the games and got this portable version for $25 (after Thanksgiving sale). Son played with it for a day, then it completely stopped working. Had to return it to the store, but they don't do exchanges, so in order to get a new replacement, I'd have to have purchased it for the full price of $56, which I was NOT doing. Therefore I'm stuck with 10 vsmile games, and I don't think I want to deal with buying anymore vsmile products. Too bad though- their products ARE educational and fun, and though sturdy- makes no sense if it doesn't work..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dangerous!","review":"We bought two of these this year for my 3 year old and my 4 year old daughter's for Christmas. How disappointing was it for one to work out of the box but the second one to not work AT ALL!? Then after about an hour of my oldest daugther playing with hers it just stopped working. When my husband was trying to see what the problem may be he realized the rear, battery section was SUPER HOT. He opened it up and the batteries were MELTING!!! This appears to be a problem with the Vsmile Pocket's either not working at all or having a short. I'm not sure why they have not been recalled and fixed. I didn't check reviews on it before I bought it but had I, well, I would've went with the Leapster.

They said they would send a call tag to pick up the game and when they get it back they will ship me a new one. Well today is the 16th and still no call tag. I called again today because there is no way a new one will be here by Christmas if I have to wait for them to get me a tag and wait for it to get to them before they ship UPS ground for Christmas. It's their policy they keep saying. Then I asked to talk with the supervisor and was told the Sup would call me at 5:30 central time today. No such call happened.

I say about because the first one lasted 4 months and the second one 8. So the average is six. He is not a toy destroyer either. He has a Nintendo DS and a Playstation 2. Both of them for years, and they aren't even designed for kids. I just like thse because he learns playing them, so he's limited on his PS2 and DS.

That one worked for maybe 3 or 4 minutes at a time (after you spent 10 minutes trying to get it to work), so I sent it in for a new one. My 3rd one (and 5th V Smile system) still does not work right - it still acts like it has a short in it, like the others I had. I have spent literally hours trying to get these to work - with no luck. My kids are dying to play all these great games, but we can't get any system to work.

She actually had the video game console version first and then we bought the pocket system since it was portable. My second daughter often wanted to play it but didn't quite understand (she's 2 1/2 now) but around Christmas, she was able to play it (after getting a V-Motion for Christmas, which can also play these games). I love that I can use the same games on three different gaming systems. And, we've had ours for over three years of PLENTY of dropping! My eldest got a Nintendo DS for Christmas; this is nothing like that (and the only thing I don't like is that there is no pen...but I think my almost 3 year old would not be able to use the redesigned Pocket that has a tethered pen since it's not used on the actual screen).

I don't have to worry about whether it's appropriate for her or not. We did/do have the issue w/ the the unit not turning on after replacing the batteries.

I've come to the conclusion that if you have a vpocket and your kids like playing with it, you should expect it to die very soon. I considered buying the cyber pocket but the reviews on that are worse...their newer model. Also the AC adapters for the vpocket don't work with the games!! so I had to constantly put in batteries.

I think it's just about the funniest book I've ever read. Not only is it funny but Fielding points a sharply satirical finger at just about everyone living in England at the time. One of the things that I love about the older books is their insight into history: though it's an obvious satire (much like the work of Cervantes) there's so much history here. Yet you see yourself and your neighbors here as well. We're still surrounded by people who are petty, pompous, flirtatious, morose - what have you - while we remain paragons of virtue. In a sense this is Joseph's problem: he's a good kid trying to make it in a crazy world (still a modern story). He's simple and kind and believes others around him to be the same. He's continually amazed when they prove otherwise. Really a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"I loved this book. The adventures of Joseph Andrews are colourful and riotous.

As an avid fan of the original Wild Weeds and a fan of Al Anderson's guitar playing and soul music compositions, it was disappointing to see him change the Weeds into a country band, relegating the incredible bass player Bob Dudek to playing boring drum parts and giving the fantastic B3 master Ray Zeiner good reason to leave the group. At least NRBQ was more interesting than what the Weeds turned into, but not much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"the boys...","review":"I first heard nrbq in 1972. The \\"sneaker\\" album (whatever the name). I was completely and continue to be blown away by this r&b quartet, (originally it was the \\"New Rythm and Blues QUINTET! How many of you knew THAT? )Any college students who like swing...check these guys out. You won't be sorry......"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic by all accounts","review":"This was my first NRBQ album. I borrowed this record from my bass player and I was hooked after a few listens. The fun aspect of rock is sorely missed these days and NRBQ helped me realize what an important ingredent fun is with regards to the total joy music was intended to offer. I believe that was a run on sentence, but when describing this band, a run on sentence it hard to avoid. Can't wait to buy the new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance Without Fear","review":"NRBQ got lost in the late 70's mix because they were a fun-time college-radio band at a time when college radio was overrun by angry young punks.That's too bad for the average schmoe, who never got to hear much of this great LP.In the late 1970s NRBQ gained a reputation for amazing live shows where, among other things, they would take requests from the audience and could faithfully reproduce virtually any song mentioned. They were a good time without being stupid. To hear Joey Spampinato hum & strum \\"I Love Her, She Loves Me\\" is to understand what the sweet side of Pop was meant to be.NRBQ AT YANKEE STADIUM is so full of good songs it just makes you sick that everyone hasn't heard it. It is a victory for average man, who wants to have fun without being stupid, who wants to sing without being a sap, who wants to dance without fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential essays on Southern Folklore white & Black","review":"As someone who researches and writes on African American folklore, the banjo, and string band music, I cannot live without this book. I have ended up not just buying it and reading it myself, but buying copies and having them sent to my colleagues. Kip Lornell's comparison between the Blues in Raleigh's Black community in the 1930s and the surviving Black string band music in nearby Orange County drew me there. I was glad to see an article by my friend and colleage Cece Conway on one of my favorite North Carolina Black banjoists. But I think I have gotten the most use and reference out of the article that discusses how recent playing a banjo behind a fiddler is and shows how fiddling changed because of the banjo. I hope someone will write a study of how adding the guitar to the string band or even the piano to accompany fiddle changed fiddling"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of the Bell Laboratories Series","review":"Harvey Fletcher started doing research at Bell Labs in 1914 and this book was a groundbreaking part of the Bell Laboratories Series, along with books by Irving Crandall, Thornton Fry, T.E.

It still provides a fascinating look at the research methods and perspectives of someone putting together ideas on speech and hearing applied to practical problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This box set was terrible. It included two DVDs, Punk Poets and Up Close and Personal. Punk Poets was decent. It had a few interviews with people that knew Blink before they became famous. Up Close and Personal was the worst documentary I've ever seen. On the cover of the DVD is Blink and what they look like now. On the DVD, the most recent footage of them is from the late 90's during Dude Ranch, and they keep playing the same footage over and over again. They also interview a random porn star that was in a movie with Janine, who was the woman on the cover of Enema of the State. She says she likes Blink once and then flashes the camera the rest of the time. Also the \\"host\\" of the DVD is unprofessional, and you can tell he knows nothing about Blink. He calls their hit song, \\"What's My Age\\". I would not recommend this to anyone. I would recommend buying punk poets separately or watching it on Amazon Instant Video. It was defiantly not worth 20 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This","review":"Do not buy this item. These are unauthorized bio's that are made like cheap tv tell-alls that give you nothing. Hopefully one day Blink will get the doc treatment like Foo Fighters or Pearl Jam has in the past few years, but this is not the doc you are looking for.AVOID AT ALL COSTS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst documentery in history","review":"I'm a huge Blink fan so when I saw this Documentary I was stoked and thought even if it's not that great it will still be worth it. Well it was the worst piece of trash I've ever laid eyes on. No Blink music, the same b-roll shots over and over and over and over and over. I'm pissed that I spent money on this but I'm more pissed that I actually wasted an hour of my life that I can never get back. It had about 10 seconds of actual band interview footage. The production was a disgrace. This is someone trying to capitalize on somebody's success. Very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink 182 Box Set","review":"I got this box set as a gift for my brother because Blink 182 is one of his favorite bands. When I received the item I noticed on the back of the box that this dvd was not authorized by the artist. That was a red flag and also the fact that whoever created the box cover spelled authorized with an \\"s\\" instead of a \\"z,\\" so I knew that this could not be legitimate. I returned the dvd for a full refund because I did not feel comfortable owning it, not to mention that the dvd is supposedly horrible from what I read.

Here's the problem:If you overload the memory, the machine freezes. Aparently there is a firmware update, but I found out too late. The frame will not boot any longer and wont mount on my computer. (part of the problem is that the manual to operate the frame comes on a CD, and the manual is NOT Mac compatible... surprize the manual is not a pdf file).I had the same problem as the other reviewer, HOWEVER, I got better support. I got online, and their email and chat buttons were disabled, so I used their phone number I got from the web site. After navigating through the phone maze, I got a hold of a helpful agent.

But fans of the musical A Chorus Line can see some ACL alums honing their skills here. Donna McKechnie is lead dancer in \\"The Beat\\" musical sequence (she's in the red and white striped blouse) which is a nice featured part. Clive Clerk is also in that sequence (boy in the white shirt with grey slacks), but unfortunately the pan-and-scan cuts him off a lot because he is on the side. He also gets to start the \\"A Girl is a Girl\\" number in the locker room and he gets lots of bits in that number."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab some popcorn, an easy chair and enjoy the beat!","review":"I remember watching this film as a small child with my mother. I loved it then and am glad it is now on DVD. I watched it on a black & white TV back then, so this is the first time I was able to see it in color. It is such a treat--so sixties camp, yet fun for the whole family! I was delighted to also catch it on cable in its widescreen mode (the DVD is pan & scan).

I like how the girls have healthy looking not over ripped skinny bodies. There is not much talk of burning calories so far, like I said I only watched the first 15 minutes. I do not like hearing body disparaging comments when I exercise. Calorie burn focus is not helpful. Fit and strong, no matter the body size is what is a healthier message for me.I feel sweaty and cardio is done, ready for some weights when I do this workout. Hopefully I will be able to do more but I am recovering from Lyme disease so I need to be careful.Amy is a good instructor. If you get it and you are in poor cardio shape, take it easy!!!! Start slow and build up to more at your pace.It is about caring for the body, not burning it or shredding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy is kicking my booty!","review":"I love Amy DVD's and this is by far the most difficult. It's the hardest cardio DVD I've ever done and am usually sweating buckets by the time it's over with my face the color of a tomato. What's great is there are three different levels of each drill so that you can adjust to your ability level and switch it up during the drill. Usually I go with the hardest or middle level of exercises but this workout had me so out of breath I had to alternate between the easiest and middle levels. Amy's cues are perfect and she gives you plenty of time to see the different exercise levels before you start the moves. It's a great workout for those already working out at least a couple times per week. If you're new to working out or coming back from a hiatus, be prepared to have to pause the DVD to catch your breath and not hurt yourself! Since it's all cardio it's great for burning calories and will definitely leave you sore for a couple days afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was out of breath!","review":"I've done P90X, P90X2, Insanity, Insanity: Asylum, and TurboFire this is one tough workout! By 10-15 minutes into it I wanted to die! I cringe everytime I put this DVD in. The only thing I don't like about it is that you do the same Tabata drill 8x in a row. You have 8 cardio drills, you do each of those drills 8 times for 20 seconds and then rest/recovery for 10 seconds. I reccomend this to anyone! This video provides 3 different levels of intensity. I switch back and forth between level 2 and level 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is an butt kicker!!","review":"Awesome DVD! I can't wait to work up to the modified exercises..My lower body was super sore the next day"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too repetitious to do again","review":"Like other reviewers, I would not reach for this DVD again. You are taken in an out of your zone every 30 seconds, which allows you to dread each upcoming exercise. The work out is hard. And because you are repeating only 8 exercises, 1 at a time, it is very boring. Not what you want in a strenuous workout. You want the time to fly.I know Amy Dixon has her supporters, but I really do not like the constant narration. It's too shrill and distracting for me. Does not inspire or motivate. I prefer instructors who let the workouts speak for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain BORING","review":"I like Amy D. I have 2 of her other DVDs and I like them. I think she's knowledgeable with a great personality. In spite of that, I found this workout to be very boring. I mean, I was dripping in sweat but I just couldn't see myself reaching for it again and again. It has the dread factor. I don't know how else to explain it...maybe if this were a live class that I attended it would be more exciting but on the DVD it was just boring. I'm glad many others liked it...just wasn't my cup of joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!","review":"First, let me say that I am a total cardio junkie. If I am not dying and drenched in sweat by the time I am done, I feel like I have accomplished nothing. With that said, I die every time I do this workout. I LOVE IT. It's fun, effective, and challenging. I saw the difference within the first week. It helped get me through my very stubborn plateau. Amy Dixon gives very good instruction on form, and is genuinely motivational without being obnoxious or annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Amy will kick your ass. 3 different levels, so you can choose, but if you go all out (which is the point of Tabata and interval training) you will definitely get your cardio in for the day. I'm not sure she gets that point across as well as she should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moisturizing but irritating","review":"This was recommended to me as a great eye cream and I think it has helped with fine lines, but it is so irritating (leaves my eyes itchy and blood shot) that I am about to return it.

It is a wonderful reminiscence, and evocation of a time and place -- rising middle-class urban Jewish life after WW II. The recipes are excellent, and the food delicious -- but the time and fussing it takes to prepare them! It is a chronicle of a life in service to the consumption of food by others, leading to a perhaps unsavory mix of subservience and domination, love and guilt.

I'm sure others may like it, and that's cool as we're all entitled to like what we like, but for me, the interest that spanned the first Mindcrime is not here in this one.

That's pretty much wot I want to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"prepaire for disapointment","review":"Without a doubt, the worst Queensryche album ever. If you're looking for something close to the first mindcrime prepare to be disappointed. Rockenfields drums can't beat life into this empty souless glob of glue. As you probably know, Chris Degarmo is not on this album, in his place are some sorry effects that sound eerily like they came off of an 80's Yamaha keyboard. Tates voice is wasted and the lyrics are corney and half hearted. They have some gaul putting out a mindcrime album that doesn't even have a single memorable guitar riff.Nothing like the first mindcrime... more like Quiet Roit's third album QRIII... only with even less impressive guitar if you can believe that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this, I had high hopes, but....","review":"...Operation Mindcrime II just isn't something to get excited about. I really like Queensryche. They are one of my top 15 bands of all time. I have all their studio CD's, but after more than a few listens, my greatest disappointment comes from the fact that for a concept album, the story just isn't evident! Like many other reviewers, I wasn't expecting OMII to mimic it's predecessor. But I did expect some energy and excitement and most of all, a story. Those qualities don't show themselves on this effort. If you are already a fan of Queensryche, then this CD is necessary for your collection. Like me, you probably will listen to it occasionally for songs like Rearrange-You and Chase. I still like Queenryche, but this one is not one of their better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put down the Kool Aid","review":"I've been hearing it for more than 18 years. How great Queensryche is.

You just don't get it!\\" Right. That's what the Emporer's tailor told the townspeople about his new clothes.

I was so pissed off that I didn't know if it was from road rage or the fact that the CD sucked. Where was the awesome sound of the guitars battling it out back and forth as before? Was Scott suffering from arthritis that he couldn't produce any kind of drum beat besides the basics of boom ching boom ching? Where was the excitement and energy?

HITNF, Q2K, and tribe seemed to have a different guitar pitch; almost like they were either tuned differently or some kind of deep mixing machine. OM2 comes back to what made Queensryche powerful; dual guitar leads, heavy drumming, and powerful vocals by arguable the most powerful voice in rock and maybe even opera!Its not OM1, but comes pretty close. Its been 16 - 20 years since empire, OM1 and rage. Every Q-ryche fan completely digested each album and knows it. OM2 will fit right in with the classics, but it will take tame. It just falls short of 5 stars, but its an outstanding effort, powerful, meaningful, and sounds great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem in the Rock Opera Genre","review":"[I did download in MP3, but only found the reviews with the Audio CD section.]I've loved the original Mindcrime for over 15 years now? This is not a dissapointment. Yes, no DeGarmo which is inherent in the 1st Mindcrime rock opera.This is digital. This is with symphonic orchestra. Tate's voice conveys a different time, and an older person.For the truly SPARSE rock opera genre, which is so rarely attempted............Operation Mindcrime I & II stand above their predecessors; \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" and \\"Tommy\\".Bravo Queensryche.

Tates vocals were uninspired and lacked the range The songs didn't flow together as they did in the first album. Rockenfields percussion was also unimpressive (and I have great respect for him as a fellow percussionist). It seems like he phoned it in. What happened to the driving rhythms of the first Mindcrime? A diffent guitarist and producer also made for a different sound and feel to the album.I realize this isn't 1987, and things change. But if you're hyping a sequel album you should sick to the formula of the first. I'm selling my album in the used section if you're looking to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"you have to give it time!","review":"I am a long time fan of course, since 83 to be exact. I figured this album would be strong, which it is. The thing about this album is, you have to listen to it a few times and really let it sink in. We have all had albums like that, some get you right at first, and some take a few listens. OM2 is that way, the album really has some good song writing, contrary to some reviews I have read, again, give it time and you'll find that this is really a great record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous and Disappointing","review":"It seems like there was no thought given to the musical quality and the lyrics are absolutely silly. For example from the \`I'm American track': \\"I've got this plan in motion, countdown. Assassinate, terminate, smack down.\\" Unlike the original \`Operation Mindcrime', there is no discernable story line. The songs sound more like rants rather then tools for expressing a chronicle as was done in the original. As far as the vocals, some of the songs sounded like a guy talking too fast with loud music in the background.This album is such a far cry from the original that it speaks volumes to exactly how little the commercial music industry thinks of producing a quality product in this day and age. Queensryche really let their fans down with this rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This album is brilliant! What more can I say? I can't stop listening to it. When I can't listen to it, the songs run constantly through my head. I feel it's a fitting follow-up to an album that is, in my opinion, the best album of all time. Ignore any bad reviews since those people just don't \\"get it\\" or haven't given it a fair chance. Listen for yourself and make up your own mind. :) It'll grow on you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak second effort...","review":"Save your money and pass on buying this weak CD. I really tried giving it a chance. It doesnt even come close to the first Mindcrime project. Indeed a tough act to follow, but Mindcrime II drones on until the 13th song of the album. Still not worth buying for 2 or 3 good tunes. Dont get me wrong, I'd still go see these guys live in a second, but all bands can miss the mark in concept albums: especially a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Amateurish","review":"I have been a Queensryche fan since the first EP and have been disspointed with the direction they have been headed in since \\"Hear in the Now...\\"I thought perhaps the sequel to \\"Operation Mind Crime\\" would harkin back to their roots and produce a good album. Wow was I ever wrong.I have listened to it for 4 days now hoping that perhaps it will grow on me; but alas it has not. The songs are amateurish and weak. The production sounds like a bunch of teenagers recorded it in their bedroom. And with the exception of Scott's drumming (which is always solid) the musicians sound uninspired, like their just going through the motions.I felt \\"Promised Land\\" was their last good disc. I am officially giving up on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like QR, buy it.","review":"It isn't anywhere near OM1, but they manage to sound exactly like they did (vocally and instrumentally) 20 years ago. I saw them in DC at a club a couple of years back, and Geoff didn't sound like his old self. He does on this one.This isn't anywhere close to the concept thing that OM1 was, but it's nice to hear some QR that is properly mixed with real bass. I thought about giving it 3 stars instead of 4, but it's obvious that they put plenty of work into making this one sound good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty damn good!! But the Licks are missing","review":"I remember seeing Queensryche on an under the wire late night tv show, when the first ep came out. I was hooked. What a band, creative, smart, extremely talented and overlooked. That would all change. These guys are amazing and there is no way around that. It has taken a couple of listens to let this disc sink in and it probably never will, just like The first Mindcrime. It is so good and so fresh it stays stuck to your soul. However, while the writing is excellent and the old adage revenge is a dish best served cold is very true in this case. I miss Chris Degarmo in a big as I am sure most fans do. It is so obvious that his talent is no where on this disc. No one wants a carbon copy by any means, but that signature sound........ Micheal and Chris are like Adrian and Dave, and Glenn and KK. With that said it is still Queensryche and this is still a good disc. Well worth it and destined to be a classic. Four stars simply because I am big Degarmo Fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely lacking their leader!","review":"Queensryche have simply never been anything without Chris DeGarmo. All the albums without him have been pretty much dreadful, and the only good points of \\"Tribe\\" were the few songs co-written by him. This is just another excuse to latch on to some past glories. And to me, \\"Mindcrime\\" has never been their pinnacle. I would give that honor to \\"Empire\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"This effort was a real letdown. I had a long business trip drive by myself. I had 4hrs. dedicated to listening. I was hoping to find some glimmer of hope. There are a few good songs. That's about it.

Mindcrime II continues the tradition. Nothing on the album is even remotely moving or emotional, like the original. I tried to listen to it for a week, and couldn't figure out was going on. It is now gathering dust. The lyric sheets aren't very helpful, especially being in fine print. If you're a fan of the band, get the LiveCrime and Live Evolution dvds, and the remastered cds (that end with Empire) and leave it at that. Queensryche lost their identity and passion when DeGarmo left (although the Live Evolution dvd is good, but it's because of the older material). Even if the rumored tour takes place with the band doing Mindcrime and Mindcrime II in one concert, I doubt I'd go. If I do, I'll probably leave after the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, Mary committed suicide.","review":"Check out Operation VideoCrime (or whatever the title was).

What one word should you look for? SUICIDE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down!","review":"I have been a big QR fan since the Rage For Order album, but the honest truth is that this album is very disappointing. I have always respected these guys, but the table turns when you wait almost 20 years for a follow up album to Operation Mindcrime, and this is what they stick you with. It is sad to see that the best has already came and gone for this band. Losing their original guitarist has definitely been a negative for them. Geoff Tate will always be one of my favorite singers though....right up there with Steve Perry and Bruce Dickinson. However, I am still amazed at the lack of in depth lyrics and musical writing ability that went into this follow up album. I think it would have been a better idea to hire some hotshots outside of the band to do the music writing!

I've had this album for over a month, and I like it more every time I listen to it.I recommend \\"Operation: Mindcrime II\\" to fans of Queensryche, the first \\"Mindcrime\\" album, and/or fans of the more classic metal genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This is the absolute worst CD I have heard. In my opinion this is a washed up band trying to extend a previously successful CD. Absolutely horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffers from the classic late Queensryche failure","review":"There are just too few tunes. The original Mindcrime was a fanatastic combination of metal and melody. A lot of Mindcrime II comes across as simply noise.Mr Tate's voice ( as strong as it is ), is clearly not the thunderous organ of his younger self and at times sounds very weak and is swamped by the \\"music\\".The story is not very clear and I'm afraid simply not interesting to the listener.This is a BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Operation:Milk Mindcrime","review":"First off, there are a couple of songs on this album that are worthy of Queensryche. Unfortunately, Geoff Tate and the band decided to revisit a truly great album (and concept album to boot). An album of the caliber of OM1 should be left alone. It just goes to show that QR (or what is left of them) wanted to capitalize on their long lost success. A great band would never have felt the need to revisit perfection. Instead, that band would make a new, different album of perfection. I don't want to get into the whole Queensryche w/o DeGarmo discussion, but Queensryche just does not exist anymore - whether that happened with DeGarmo's departure or not, Queensryche is dead. What is left is a band struggle to make a name for themselves riding the moniker of a once great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completly different and maybe better!!!","review":"This is not OM1 and does not sound anything like it. Thank god! Don't get me wrong, I love OM1 but did not want to hear the same songs again. The music on this CD is far more experimental and free flowing. I love this direction and think it is musicly, as good as anything the band has done thus far. Let me be the first to say. I LIKE IT BETTER THAN THE FIRST!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Gave Up On These Guys","review":"They finally got some fire back! After Empire, one album after another got duller and duller, until I pretty much wrote them off. I heard about Operation Mindcrime II, I was curious, I got it, and I was rewarded. The Dio and Tate \\"The Chase\\" duet (Dio as Dr. X)... great! The opening track, \\"I'm American\\"? Very heavy and cool! And the ending, last few tracks, a bit reminiscent in tone to maybe the close of The Wall, with the main character spiraling into madness... nice ending! They did recapture the older Queensryche sound, adding a bit new to it. Didn't think they could do it (ignore reviews that said they can't/didn't). Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy","review":"This album does the exact same thing that the original accomplished: captured a feel for a story. The original captured a haunting air of mystery, (at least the last half of the album did) and OM II captures the idea of revenge. It's harder to listen to than the original (not in a bad way), but that's because it's more frantic. I believe it's suppose to be that way since Nikki's doing whatever it takes to track down and get revenge on Dr. X. I think that within a couple of listens, people will undestand it and give it the appreciation it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough!","review":"I think when a follow up to something as phenomenal as the original Mindcrime comes along, fans have an unrealistic expectation that it could be as good as the first. How could it be, though? Now that I've had time to just listen to Mindcrime II as it's own creation, there are some really wonderful musical moments on this CD. I think the music flows real nice from one track to the next. Granted, there are some weak songs, but I think overall fans will come to accept this as a good recording after some time has passed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful!!! so sad","review":"I was really looking forward to this!

I find myself leaning toward \\"this sucks\\".I've been a ryche fan for many many years and was captivated by OMC, I dont know what this is suppose to be? Theres some good tracks but it falls too short of OMC to merit more than 2 stars.If your a fan than you will want to surely get this for the collection. If your new to this band then go back to the beginning and hear them at their best. Sorry guys....18 years wasent enough between Mindcrimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...Queensryche sucks without Degarmo","review":"How a band can continue to write and release songs under the Queensryche name when their main songwriter leaves the band is beyond me.There isn't a soul left in the band that knows how to write good music. The new guitarist Stone is useless...he should be playing in a blues rock band...not Queensryche.Tate has lost a lot of range from his voice. Who cares is he can occasionaly hit a high note...he no longer sounds comfortable in the upper ranges and his lower note singing is very sub par.Time to retire. This last ditch effort to make $$ isn't fooling anyone. Geoff Tate also has professed that he doesn't like metal. So the only reason he would continue playing it is for $$.It's truly sad what Queensryche has become. The original Mindcrime was masterpiece. I don't even know what to call this mess called Mindcrime II. I don't know what's worse...Mindcrime II or St. Anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Follow-up From A Band Who Should've Known Better","review":"How dare Queensryche tarnish the good name of the brilliant Operation Mindcrime with this lame piece of trash. The absolute worst drum sounds on any major release in the modern era. Overblown sound effects do little to hide the trite lyrics, lackluster vocals, and weak guitar work. The most disappointing cd of the year by far and though not the worst of Queensryche's career, certainly the biggest rip-off since the title implies that the material will be as strong as Mindcrime 1. It's not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded Expectations","review":"When I saw this in Best Buy this morning, I was thinking \\"Oh God, this could be either really good, or really bad.\\" I picked it up by chance, and figured it was worth a shot.The first three or four songs on the album are the weakest, so don't let them discourage you. After that though, some of the sounds of the original Mindcrime can be heard, which in my opinion, makes the albums fit together well and I enjoyed it alot.I honestly wasn't expecting much from it, thinking it would be some kind of trashy attempt to relive the glory of the '88 release, but for the most part I was pleasantly surprised with a solid album that will probably grow on me some more after repeat listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to form","review":"I'll skip comparisons to the original Mindcrime. This is the best Queensryche album since Promise Land. Over the last few albums, they have gone for a more laidback sound, not pushing themselves musically as they did with more progressive releases like Rage for Order. It seemed they were trying to please the Silent Lucidity fans more than the true fans who wanted to hear something more challenging. With the new album, it is at the same time experimental, challenging, but also rocks harder than they have on album in a long time, although they have always maintained a high energy live show. If you're enough of a fan of Queensryche to be reading this, you should get this album for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"Operation : Mindcrime was one of the best cd's evetr made. That was the one cd that got me in to all the stuff I like now. It even tought me alot on the drums. So, when I hear there's a new SEQUEL coming... of course I jump. I just couldn't believe that they actually slapped an OPERATION : MINDCRIME label on it and tried to pass it as a sequel. Actually, I don't think that this cd would've been near as horrible if Chris DeGarmo was still with the band and had a hand in its creation. Geoff Tate can not write lyrics... Chris wrote 90% of the lyrics in the original, and ended up with epics like 'Suite Sister Mary', and Geoff ended up with 'I'm American' after his failed attempt to write songs on the new cd... maybe it's about time to give it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Operation Mindflop!","review":"When I heard there was going to be a sequel toOperation Mindcrime(one of the best album's of all time)I was as a little worried.Could the band possibly write anything forthis sequel without their guitarist(Chris Degarmo their main composer)that left in '98.They've only had two good songs(Breakdown from Q2K and Open from Tribe)since then and Chris cowrote the latter.I made myself listen to OMII the day it came out.Just as I thought,only one song stands out on this platter.(I'm American) No new ground being broken here.I'm wondering if the band is in touch with their musicality anymore. I miss the true melody in their old music that they have for gotten to include in their new projects.Why put this disc out when it's this bad..

Do yourself a favour, check out Pain of Salvation, or Evergrey... Maybe Wolverine?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Downfall of the Ryche","review":"I can't believe this band is still trying to \\"recapture\\" the sound of their glory days. They have been on a constant downfall for years. They have put out many bad albums but trying to revive the Mindcrime spirit by just naming an album Mindcrime II is a shame. Without DeGarmo this band cannot write songs. Sorry that's the fact. The storyline is boring and predictable. The production is sterile and hygenic. The guitar work is truly awful. It is so forced only so it sounds 80's but still you can tell it's forced. Tate's vocals are weaker than before even though I give him credit for trying. Get the early albums of Ryche and stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just downright BAD!","review":"BAD BAD BAD BAD!!!!

It's more dissapointing than anything because I know that the band, and the production crew who recorded it, are capable of so much more. I have faith in them, I know that they can do better.

I have played it non stop since day 1 and while its not quite as good as the first one, its a close second. There are a couple of weaker tracks that you may skip over such as Speed of Light and Circles.

Compare \\"Rage for Order\\" with anything else that came out in 1986 and you'll see what I mean. Same with the original \\"Operation Mindcrime.\\" Fast forward to 2006 and OMII is just miserable. It's as if they've lost their identity. Come to think of it - they did when Chris Degarmo, who along with Tate and Rockenfield were the heart of the band.And what's with the cheesy keyboards?

Imagine my disappointment when she omits the first verse! Did she forget the lyrics????? What a waste of my money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live","review":"Who said that it was live? Is it written somewhere? No! I'va bought this cd and i listen to the first song and said maybe other songs are not live but THE WHOLE CD IS LIVE! I am lucky that i love A LOT sarah mclachlan's music because i would be disapointed... but even if its live, sarah mclachlan music is soooooooo good that we forget the fans behind. but i think that she should do a greatest hits album but not live. it would be so amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Attempt to Extort Money from Her Fans","review":"Enough already! Fans of Sarah should finally say \\"Stop!\\" to the never-ending stream of repeat material from this fine artist. There's no question that she writes great songs, and there's no question that she has a great voice. But ever since \\"Solace\\" way back when, Sarah has followed up every album with a live album or a remix album or an alternate takes / demos album.How many versions of \\"Ice Cream\\" are out there now? Four?While the sound is pretty good on this album, the fade-in-fade-outs are annoying and none of the versions come close to their original forms. \\"I Will Remember You\\" was great four years ago when it first came out, and the studio version should have won a Grammy a long long time ago . . . so how is it the live version becomes a hit?Sarah McLachlan and Netwerk are just trying to extory money from her fans.Boo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't capture the essence of seeing McLachlan live","review":"Sarah's \\"Mirrorball\\" album is an overproduced, uninspired work. Anyone who has seen Sarah live should know that this live album doesn't do her justice at all. The tracks are too glossy and often don't even sound live, like \\"Sweet Surrender\\", \\"I Love You\\" and \\"Possession\\". Hopefully Sarah's new \\"Afterglow Live\\" CD will be a better example of how radiant Sarah McLachlan is in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"ughhhh","review":"First of all this woman can hardly sing. Why is she putting out a cd that consists of songs she had already released? I don't understand why everyone likes her, and I would say DO NOT get this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do We Deserve This?","review":"I was never a Sarah McLachlan fan, a friend of mine handed me this cd and said it's so deep. After listening to this I came to the conclusion that it was deep, wallowing deep in misery. Sarah takes her same old tired songs and does them live, giving her the ample opportunity to expand every nuance of the music making it seem almost unbearable. If you are a Sarh McLachlin fan stick to her older works, someone made the mistake of calling her a diva and she is taking it to the extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold On, This one is better than ice cream...","review":"Chalk up another spectacular CD to the songress of folk rock, Ms. Sarah McLachlan. Due to the fact that Sarah is live on this album, her music is completely free and real. ANY of Sarah's loyal and longstanding fans could recognize the growth and evolution of some of Sarah's classic songs on this release. She's not perfect and this album isn't meant to portray that. Mirrorball is a 'beautiful release'. It is free and full of emotion. As far as the last Lilith tour goes, this CD was a wonderful way to end years of touring, especially at the end of 'Angel' when she says 'Good night, we'll see you soon.' And we will see more of Sarah soon. Sarah has been with us for over 10 years and she's not going away. Sarah's music is like a seed that has been nurtured and stimulated. It just keeps blooming and growing with time. YOU ROCK, SARAH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirror Ball--A Past Reflection","review":"I am a new listener to Sarah McLachlan. So, this compilation, a reflection of some of her best songs, works for me. I enjoy the strong , emotional vocals as well as her passionate timbre. And she has a great group of musicians enhanching her voice.These tracks are an eclectic collection of well arranged, well mixed, music. \\"I Will Remember You\\", is a live version here & puts me right in her concert audience. \\"Ice Cream\\" and \\"Angel\\" were a pleasant surprise for me.A good CD--especially for new fans of Ms. McLachlan.Thanks for your interest & comments--CDS"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST FEMALE ARTISTS EVER","review":"Sarah McLachlan's voice is one in a million. It can bring tears to the strongest of eyes. Live CDs usually get on my nerves,but this just too great of a collection worry about things like audience noise. Mirrorball contains such beauties as \\"Angel.\\" This is definately one of the most emotional songs ever written. \\"I Will Remember You\\" is a tear-jerker if ever there is one. You absolutely can not go wrong with a treasure like Mirrorball."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"hold on\\" brings tears to my eyes","review":"It has been a couple of month since I has free time out of my hectic life and listened to this cd. Sometime the work life is repeatitive and time consuming, it makes you yern to feel alife.Just a few minutes ago, I played this cd, and listening to the song \\"hold on\\" brought tears to my eyes. Her lyrics are so powerful, and envoked such strong emotions, I had to repost my review of this cd.I remember the first time I heard Sarah's, I dismissed it thinking her tunes weren't catchy enough. It was a couple month later, the same song played again, but the experience described in the lyrics hit home this time. I think for those who haven't yet truely experienced Sarahs music, they just need to connect to a single song then they will begin to understand.Anyway, I previously gave this cd 4/5 since its a compilation. But looking at this cd by itself, its a 5/5. If you haven't heard of Sarahs music, you owe it to yourself to give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Concert at Home","review":"This is a great album to buy even if you have lots of this material on other CDs. She does a great live show and it conveys on this album. The songs are even more enjoyable to listen to and you almost feel like you're there. Well recorded and I believe it's an enhanced CD (at least my copy is) so it has additional material on it as well. If you like Sarah or want to find out, go get this one!PS: The IceCream song is a waltz! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Perfect Live-Album!","review":"Though I'm usually not particularly fond of live-albums, this great album may very well be my favourite by Sarah McLachlan. It seems to me it has it all. Great vocals, a terrific band and some of McLachlan's very best songs; moreover the sound is as close to perfect you can expect from a live-album.The opening song \\"Building a Mystery\\" I first heard when someone played the \\"Lillith Fair\\" dvd for me. This was the song that opened my eyes and ears for McLachlan and her music.Among other outstanding songs \\"Hold on\\", \\"I Will Remember You\\", \\"Aidia\\" and the early song \\"Path of Thorns\\" deserve a mention. Great to hear the audience sing along on the live-favourite \\"Ice Cream\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A few songs I repeat over and over...","review":"Sarah seems to be in a constantly melancholy mode here, which is fine with me. Because the songs are all done live, you feel the lyrics, the words, the instrumentals, all more than ever. Her voice is haunting and her lyrics speak depths - sometime depths I can't understand, LOL. My fave tracks are:1.) Building a Mystery - Who is the man she speaks of?2.) Possession - Just really amazing song, LOL!3.) Sweet Surrender - Good backup, haunting melody."},{"rating":"2","title":"bitter","review":"This has got to be the most depressing songs I ever heard, but I devoured every minute of it because I know all to well what sadness is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"This is a must have for Sarah fans. I got this CD yesterday and I have NOT been able to take it out of my CD player! This CD accents her amazing music talents and how great a musician she is. She takes her best songs and turns them into brand new masterpieces (\\"Hold On\\" has been changed from great to amazing). You need to buy this CD. If you don't have it you don't know what you're missing- and that is a WHOLE LOT! Bravi, Sarah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Goood Album, with alot of remixed songs!","review":"I liked all of her other albums, although it's LIVE, it has some of her best songs. I'm more into her heavy stuff like \\"Possession or \\"Sweet Surrender\\". I love it when she rocks on Possession, especially when she holds her voice up(\\"just close your eyes!\\")with her band to back it up. Among other things, she has an excellent band and her voice is so powerful. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"You can take Sarah and Give her the song Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star which we have all heard more than enough in our life and she could sing it with such clarity and grace with each note that it would take your breath away. Well that is exactly what Sarah gives you on her live album Mirrorball. It may not be her number 1 hits but when she sings each and every song she is pouring every ounce of emotion into her song and it takes my breath away. Even though we have all heard these songs more than enough Sarah is taking a personal approach and singing the songs that she feels best describes how she deals and feels about the world and her life today. The music may not be new but it is a great way to end the millinium. So BRAVO to you Sarah. Thank you for providing me as well as many others with the joy and diviness of your music. I know you will bring us even greater pieces in the future. You are beautiful in so many ways and do not ever change!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was so good, I couldn't believe it was live!","review":"Whenever I go to concerts or hear live recordings, I'm usually disappointed. However, Sarah is one of the few artists who sound as good live as they do in a recording studio. Neither her vocals nor the instruments over-power one another. I particularly loved Possession, Sweet Surrender, Icecream, and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. This CD is beautiful and relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD I've ever bought","review":"When I bought this CD in the summer I was only expecting a small compilation of her best hits, but in a \\"live\\" format. After getting home and listening to the screams of the crowds, and Sarah's smooth voice I was extreamly surprised. The best part of the CD is that makes you feel like you are acually at one her concerts. She sounds just as good live as she does on any of her CDs. So there is not dissapointment about that. It's been five months since I've bought that CD and I still listen to it everyday like I a newly bought CD. This is truly this is the best CD I've ever bought, and I will always keep this CD near to me. It is definatly worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice from heaven","review":"I love Sarah McLanchlan's voice.When I heard\\"Angel\\"I had to get this CD. They played \\"Angel\\" when John Kennedy died last year on one of the TV show's.Its the most beutifull song about death.There so many hits off this album,\\"Building a Mystery,Adia,Sweet surrender,\\" but my favorite is \\"I will remember you.\\" When you see Sarah perform this number,she just shines.Of all the new talented female singer, songwriters,that we've been hearing on the radio, I think Sarah has the brightest future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cd I have bought in years!!!","review":"I had never even heard of Sarah Mclachlan before I bought this cd. However, I had heard \\"I Will Remember You\\" on the radio and I could not get the song out of my head. It spoke volumes to me about a past relationship I had recently come out of. Oddly enough, this song put trust in my heart again and I was able to move on. I know that sounds strange. I have tremendously enjoyed every song on this cd. I have really gotten my money's worth. Thank you, Sarah, for your raw and wonderful talent that stirs people in their lives. That is the mark of a great musician. In my book you are right up there with the queen of rock, Ms. Janis Joplin. And that is an extreme compliment coming from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"This is my first Sarah McLachlan cd, and I love it! After hearing the live verson of \\"I Will Rember You\\", I was a fan. This was a very good purchase for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a live album!","review":"It's a collection of live songs yes, but it is not what I expected from Sarah. The recordings are fantastic, the song list has all the hits, but where is the true nature of a Sarah live show? Being a real fan of live music, I was disappointed to hear a whole bunch of tracks strung together in no logical order at all. I would have rather had a disc that did a better job of pulling you into a real concert, rather than a bunch of live \\"radio friendly\\" snippets.You have to give it a high mark though, if for no other reason than Sarah's amazing voice and live presence. Possession is amazing, and the recordings are all crisp and perfect. Buy it and remix it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SARAH ROCKS THE WORLD !!!","review":"Alas, June 15th has arrived, so of course I just ran out and purchased MIRRORBALL!!! Did the same for SURFACING too!!! About MIRRORBALL, WOW is about all my mind can bring out right now because this woman has literally blown me away with her undying talent! I feel I'm on top of the world as I listen to this outstanding album! BUY IT NOW ... YOU WILL BE SO GLAD YOU DID !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Sarah McLachlin has a load of talent evident on at least one of her previous releases (...Ecstasy). However, this disc falls well below expectations. If you're looking for a better new release, try the new Weird Al or Chemical Brothers CDs, as both are far superior to this slop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful voice, not always beautiful words","review":"First Sarah McLachlan cd I've ever bought. I think she has a very beautiful voice. However, as I was sitting there listening to the first track, \\"Building a Mystery\\", out of nowhere comes the f-word! Another track later I hear \\"bulls**t\\". Sorry Sarah, I don't allow those words in my house. I took the cd back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why live performance????","review":"Most of the songs were absolutely amazing She has a great voice and the texts moves me... But WHY did it have to be a live performance??? I ruins the whole album. I am sure that the people that were present were very happy, but as a person who is very sensetive to sound, appreciate the purity in sound, the background noice was a huge distraction. Sarah, there is nothing wrong in doing a studio recording. You can still capture the soul of the music in a studio. All I can say is that I am waiting for the album to be re-released as a studio recording with no distracting noice that does not represent the music. I want to hear the Sarah and ONLY Sarah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am pissed off that \\"I Will Remember You\\" is a horrible version. One-Third of the original song is chopped off for no apparent reason. Plus there is way too much audience interferance. If you want a good Sarah McLachlan album buy \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" or \\"Rarities, B-Sides, and Other Stuff.\\" Trust Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've found Sarahs' music to be very relaxing","review":"i listen to it when i want to strangle someone, but it's not what you're thinking. i listen to it to mellow out.

I am your biggest fan. I have traveled to differant states just to hear your concerts! Keep up the good work, it is excelant!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Live Cd's","review":"Excellent *live* recordings. \\"Path of Thorns\\" is one of my favorite tracks. It ranks with Pink Floyd's Pulse as one of my favorite Live Albums. \\"Mary\\" and 2 other tracks are available on a special edition CD (only one vendor sells), probably they'll appear on single releases soon. Only thing that could have made it better if if the tracks were from one or two concerts, rather than a mix (with a pause between tracks)... oh okay, I'm spoiled by Pink Floyd's live albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY ONE SM CD--YOU'VE BOUGHT EM ALL","review":"Is is just my imagination, or does Sarah McLachlan repeatedly re-release her songs on follow-up albums? I love her music--but I don't want to keep buying the same song sover and over again--what's UP with that??? While I considered purchasing Mirrorball, I looked back over my collection and realized I have virtually every song on it! You call that a NEW release>???? :-0"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DISAPOINTMENT WISH I HADN'T BOUGHT THE CD","review":"Since I'm a die hard Sarah fan (Yes, I liked her before she came out with angel) I thought the C.D. would be good, but the whole thing was terrible. I even went over a couple times and tried to listen to it, but to sum up the whole C.D. in one word it really SUCKS! The song quality was awful, she sang her songs better on her other C.D.'s: Solace, Surfacing, Rartries & B Sides, Fumbling Toward Ecstacy, The Freedom Sessions, and so on. Just Don't buy the C.D!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is excellent , easy to get in to . lovely music.","review":"I keep this on whenever I can. Mostly in the evenings when I wont to unwind. Her voice is excellent. She really knows how to identify with feelings, and emotions. I get a real sence of peace when I hear the music. I seem to blend in with it. An excellent way to make it all seem worthwhile . A real find in today\`s hectic world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - I really liked it!!!","review":"I was not familiar with Sarah's music, and this was a good introduction for me. She is very versatile, and she is VERY good at what she does. This CD got me through an out-of-state move: even the moving guys who were helping me pack up my stuff were impressed!! Listen to this CD for the pure pleasure of a live performance - you won't be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opens a lifetime of memories","review":"I was driven to this album by the haunting, dramatic ballad, ANGEL. ANGEL is typical of this CD, in that there is a tremndous range of emotion and passion the listener will expereince. The CD is remeniscent of the 60's folk songs and the feeling and passion they engendered for the lsitener. If you are looking for music to move you, then this is for you. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul stirring!!!","review":"With many recordings, you get a glossed-over and sometimes emotionless song. With Mirrorball, you get all the emotion of each song. I had been a \\"waivering\\" McLachlan fan until this CD. I absolutely adore it and I feel I will never be without it. The song Good Enough was quite a surprise...a new favorite that everyone should listen to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice Of An Angel","review":"I have always loved Sarah's Voice. Talk about calm, cool, and relaxing! She can not even be matched...not even by Celine!She is incredible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirrorball is Awesome!","review":"This CD is amazing. It's the first Sarah McLachlan CD I have ever bought, and I've bought two others since. Every song on Mirrorball is great- I listen to the CD from beginning to end everytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a charm, that Mirrorball......","review":"I sure hope NO ONE turns down the chance of buying this record. Because if you do, you're missing the musical experience of a lifetime! This live record is so awesome. The music sounds so fine, it'll take your breath away. The track \\"Do What You Have To Do\\", is probably the best love song a person could ever hear. Sarah Mclachlan is at her best on Mirrorball!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is what happens when you sell out","review":"sarah mclachlan is probably the least prolific artist i know. it's not a bad thing, except that she enjoys releasing \\"filler\\" albums, like Live (1992), The Freedom Sessions (1994), Rarities, B-Sides, and Other Stuff (1996) and Mirrorball (1999). she is also releasing an album entitled Remixed later this year, though it will only be available in Canada. when i heard of a sarah mclachlan live album, i was excited. i wasn't, however, excited at the track list. how many times have we heard these songs? sarah mclachlan is nothing more than a marketing genius now. she hasn't had one new song since 1997 (excluding when she loved me) and she is just marketing her older songs to the point of nausea. i can honestly say i won't be buying her Remixed album and i am not so sure about her new record either. get touch, solace and fumbling towards ecstasy to hear the \\"real\\" sarah mclachlan."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I am not as fond of this album as I am of her studio albums. I find that some live albums can be self-indulgent, and unless you're a hardcore fan, they do nothing for you. And that's the case with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless!","review":"First of all, I'd recommend this CD to anyone..I absolutely love it. I own every single CD that Sarah has ever released...and what really irratates me is how people gripe and complain over a live album. Live albums do not necessarily evoke a specific mood like an album done in the studio. When you listen to Surfacing you feel something entirely different than you do when you play Mirrorball. With this live album, Sarah does her duty as a performer and a musician.. She sings (better live than any other performer i've seen), and she delivers (enormous punches with songs like \\"angel\\", \\"do what you have to do\\", and \\"fear\\"). The lady has talent. The lady has style. And if you do not like this album or her, then I probably wouldn't like you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of an Angel","review":"I have this CD in my car and I love to turn it up so I can really hear her beautiful voice. The version of \\"Angel\\" (from the movie \\"City of Angels\\") is only the piano and her voice - it's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beatifull c.d. easy to sing to","review":"This is a beautifull c.d. it is easy to sing to while listening. Unlike a lot of other c.d.'s i loved most of the songs. I don't think there were any i didn't like. A good c.d. to buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah's even better live","review":"Mirrorball is the perfect example of Sarah's pure and true voice. It shows her ability and her talent at song writing. She sings with sincere emotion. It is easy to believe in her and her songs while withdrawing from the moment and emersing yourself in to the music. Her songs are deep and meaningful. Mirrorball is the best live CD that I have heard in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirrorball","review":"This is by far the best CD I own. Most live CD's lack something... this one by far does not. It has more spirit than the other CD's I own by her. I would say- if you're thinking about buying this CD, do buy it, it's well worth your money. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever Happened To...","review":"Sarah was unmatched for creativity, sincerity and power in her time. And now we're sort of left to wonder, whatever happened to her?She is still around, and still performs. Mirrorball was perhaps the createst living record of her contribution to music and to our lives, though. \\"Angel\\" still floats through our minds whenever we face loss and lonliness. A friend asked me to make up a CD for her funeral, and, of course, \\"Angel\\" had to be a part of it. Hearing it again, in this live version, brought back all the emotional power and comfort she built into this song so long ago.We will be in the arms of the angel - all of us. Thank you, Sarah, for everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the wide sound on this cd","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Fumbling towards Ecstacy\\" and \\"Surfacing\\", but what I love most about \\"Mirroball\\" is the wonderful accoustics and just the overall sound of this cd. As opposed to her studio recordings, from which you can tell are recorded in a rather small room, Sara and her band really get a great sound on stage. She sounds every bit as good live as she does in her other recordings, and I happen to like her voice better live, because she is more expressive. This CD is definately worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant!","review":"Sarah shows off her wonderful voice and musical abilities on her fab tracks from 3 albums live, no fancy production ,as music is supposed to be heard"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!.... but missing something","review":"I've been waiting for a \\"Live\\" album from Sarah Mclachlan, having seen her in concert. This fills the void, but I have to ask who made the decision to put the bonus disk in the package and only fill it with three songs? Where are \\"Vox\\" and \\"Into the Fire,\\" two songs she did on her tour regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE NEW STUFF??!!!","review":"mirrorball is a beautifully recorded cd, however, is a disapointment. this cd is generally for the \\"new age\\" sarah fans that have started to follow all of those now over played generic radio songs, (i.e..building a mystery, adia, sweet surrender...). what about the devoted sarah fans that have been with her since \\"OCTOBER GAME\\" and \\"TOUCH?\\" there are beautiful songs on solace and touch as well. also, if it was necessary to put all of the radio songs on there, at least compensate it with a few new songs. in addition, there are many true sarah fans out there who, like me, probably have every live bootleg cd that is out there. this cd didn't sound like anything different. don't get me wrong, sarah is my girl but, i really expected more. if you just started following sarah, it's a great cd that you should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GOTTA HAVE IT","review":"THE BEST CD I HAVE LISTENED TO YET Sara is the best I think that she has the best voice than anyone else her voice is haunting erie and magical"},{"rating":"2","title":"words cant describe","review":"Sarah is immaculate and I am sick of critics giving bad reviewsof this cd.....If this cd does not move you then you are a heartlessperson.

The energy she gathers from her audiences is amazing....She captivates her audience like no other performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirrorball is an incredible album.","review":"While both Surfacing and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy are both superior albums, the true essence of Sarah McLachlan's hauntingly expressive voice can only be captured live. To see her perform live in concert is breathtaking, and Mirrorball, McLachlan's latest release, gives full justice to her awesome talent. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, even those who have never before experienced Sarah McLachlan."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous singer and songwriter","review":"she inspires me and my personal life she is the reason of a love i hold so true to me... thanks sarah for angel!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"someone pass some new tunes...PLEASE","review":"I love Sarah and have for many years...heck I trecked up a mountain to see the first years Lillith Fair...but this album does nothing for me. It is the same songs we have heard for years and yes, it is very uninspired. With her amazing songwriting techniques, I would rather she focus on new material---not recycling old material that thanks to Sarah becoming more \\"mainstream\\" is being played to death on the radio. Im waiting patiently for some new, inspried tunes....And recommend that true Sarah fans pick up \\"rarities and Bsides\\" before buying this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job","review":"This c.d was breath taking the way she sings her voice is so soothing.

She sounds as good live as she does in her studio albums. Jewel is one of the only other artist who I can think of that sounds just as good live as on her cds. Sarah is a great singer and her voice really shines through on this cd. It is incredible. If you are a Sarah fan you'll love this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible album","review":"dont get me wrong i like sarah i just dont like this cd. i mean where r all the songs from solace those are the real gems. also sarah has toured 4 times to support surfacing. 3 times at lilith fair and once on her own tour. she needs to write some new material. however there is a great version of ice cream on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing as Always","review":"Since I am now a teenager, I first heard \\"Posession\\" at a younger age, and I did not remember who sang it or anything like that. But years later, I heard \\"Adia\\" on the radio, and immediately went out and bought \\"Surfacing.\\" All the songs on that became my favorite, and I just craved more. \\"Rarities\\" and \\"FTE\\" followed. Sarah, to me, is a magical person who, through an amazing talent, expresses her emotions through her songs that make you want to melt you feel so overwhelmed with realization. I can relate to every one of her songs, and whenever I need an escape, Sarah provides it. I just wish I had her ability to convey feelings so I could provide proper praises for her!!! You rule Sarah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Songs Performed by Sarah","review":"I believe that Sarah McLachlan is a very talented singer. Two of my most favorite songs would have to be \\"Building a Mystery\\" and \\"Sweet Surrender\\". Both are very inspirational, and have a sort of day dreamy feeling, like your in another world.

I read some of the reviews here and decided it would be a good purchase.I was shocked, to put it mildly, with the vulgar language used in some of the lyrics.

I was hoping to hear something that hasn't been commercialized upon yet, doesn't sarah think that she's made enough money off of these songs? Now we're not just gonna have to hear Angel on the radio every five minutes, but we're gonna have to hear a live version of it too? and c'mon people, I really like sarah's voice and her songs are well written, but a goddess? Sarah McLachlan is a woman just like any other woman, the difference between her and us is that her talent has been recognized and captured by the media/public, we are all as talented as her in some way or another, she just happened to take initiative and harness her future by getting herself in the right place at the right time with the right people that had enough money. Now that she's done that we put her on a pedastal and by living vicariously through her, we don't try to achieve it ourselves. Goddess indeed, woman I say! Grrrrr...."},{"rating":"2","title":"June 15th, people","review":"OK, so I've heard most of the live songs on Mirrorball on singles and the radio, but there is no way (that I can see) that these people could've heard the entire CD since it does not come out until JUNE 15TH. Hello? Anyway, Sarah McLachlan is God. She has the most beautiful voice in all of the music business. In fact beautiful does not even begin to describe what she is. She is so much more than a singer/songwriter as well. Her generosity and apparent kindness makes her the most wonderful person in the music industry. I have a difficult time imagining any piece of work by her that is imperfect. Thank you Sarah, you are truly wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"More beautiful every time","review":"I was lucky enough to find a recording of \\"I Will Remember You\\" in the US but I will get this CD anyway.

For those of you who don't know, this release was mainly intended for video release(vhs,dvd)and let me assure you, it is clearly one of the best live releases i've ever heard or seen by any artist. I've never been a big fan of live recordings, because the quality is rarely that of the studio version. Definatly not the case here. I truly think some, if not most of the tracks on this CD sound better than the originals, with more power and energy than the studio releases! which is common for a live album, however as I said earlier the sound quality is not that of a typical live album, It is absolutly incredible! If you didn't like the CD try the video. If you did like the CD I highly recommend the vhs or dvd. This is definatly Sarah at her best!

From the broken record of Lili Marlene, to a mother in denial turned heroine, to a nameless German soldier who risked himself for a small family on the run, to a boy and a man with no common language trying to become friends, this work captures the very nature of fear and hope and frustration and plain old survival in a world gone mad. I was in tears, literally, as I read through this amazing story of a boy's transition to manhood in these most terrible of times.Colonel Samuel's prose is Spartan and straightforward, unencumbered by needless embellishment. Yet the sights, the sounds, the odors and the deepest feelings of his experience wafted through my senses.Thank you, Colonel Samuel, for sharing your amazing story. And thank you, Mr. Ambrose, for bringing this remarkable memoir to publication.This book is an absolute treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, charming","review":"This book is so much better then two other recent books I have read on Nazi Germany, 'Hitlers Niece' and 'The Good German'.

I think many of us have been unaware of what struggles the average German family went through after the war's end. I won't repeat what previous reviewers have already brought up.

My dad, also, was a german boy at the same time as the author. His experiences were so similar. My Dad does not talk about it much at all, but from what he has said, it seems as though the book is an accurate historic account of those difficult years. It was both sad and happy, told without melodrama and I was disappointed when the book was done. I wanted to know more and felt a connection with the author and his family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"My wife bought this book for me at an author's book signing when she and my son were on school trip to Washington D.C.This is a well-written, very engaging book. The amount of trouble the author had to deal with as he grew up is amazing. The story as told lets us know how people suffer from war. And it really doesn't matter which side they are on. They are people who through no fault of their own get trapped up in the toils of war and find themselves in a struggle for survival.This is a book that tells us how individuals, not countries, suffer from war. It held my interest from beginning to end and, though I have read many, many books dealing with WWII, this book gave me a better understanding of WWII and a deeper appreciation of those affected by it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative Account of WWII Devastation","review":"What a book! Wolfgang Samuel's GERMAN BOY is the true story of the efforts of his life from ages 10-15 in surviving in Germany from February 1945 until January 1950. Battling the Russians, starvation, disease nearly every step of the way, the narrative is more thrill packed than any fictional account I have any read about WWII and its aftermath. But, the account is also humbling to the nth degree. As if the War was not terrible enough with the lost of live, post-war Germany preyed upon women and children indiscriminately. Just a great read, one that I would highly recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"German Boy","review":"My friend living in London, England, read this book and suggested it to me. It is the story of a young boy growing up in war torn and defeated Germany. He later comes to America and become an Air Force officer. It is a worthwhile and fascinating study in overcoming hardship. It focuses on a part of war that most accounts of war fail to do: the civilian population and the wars effect on them. But the book is more than that. It is a highly personal account of survival and hardship in growing up.

Gorky is, after all, the \\"father of Russian literature\\" -- yet most people have never heard of this writer par excellence. His storytelling is smooth, intense, and warms the heart like a swig of vodka on a nippy night in Nizhny Novgorod (Gorky's birthplace). Wilk's translation is clear and quite excellent. Gorky's vivid memories of childhood will inspire one to recollect their own experiences growing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"My daughter has ezxema and i needed organic cotton bibs, so I bought these.

A terrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frays in the wash","review":"I am so disappointed that these bibs are fraying and pulling quite a bit after only 3 washings. The binding is not overlapping the main fabric enough on one of them, which is already making a big 1\\" gap that is fraying. The tags are fraying, and the terrycloth has many \\"pulls\\" where the yarn loops have pulled out to 1/2\\" and 2\\" long strings, making the once adorable bibs look very scrappy. I have washed with the Velcro fastened in regular cycle warm and tumble dry on medium heat. I'll give 2 stars because they are so cute and soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent materials","review":"I received a set of bibs with a trim made of a different fabric than the rose satin pictured--it's a pink and white flowered print in a non-satiny fabric. I also have this set in sage green, which came with the pictured satin fabric. The green satin trim completely frayed in the wash and pulled away from the terry cloth as other reviews have described. Oddly, the white satin bibs are just fine. While I'm happy with the way the rose set has held up over the past 3 months, I wouldn't order this product again because the quality has been so inconsistent. If I received another set with satin trim, I would send it back immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"fraying trim","review":"agree with the other reviews that the satin trim is falling apart and fraying after only a couple washes. would not buy again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good option, but could be better","review":"I like that these don't have all kinds of appliques and cutsie kid things. They are also terry cloth, so they are a bit more absorbent than a lot of the bibs of this size. However, as soon as it gets a little too wet, the wetness seeps down and gets the baby's shirt wet. My daughter is a spit-up queen, so we go through a half dozen of these a day. It really needs some sort of thin waterproof layer -- that would make this a 5-star product. The velcro is strong so it stays on the baby, however it's loud when you remove it so it sometimes scares them or wakes them up if they have fallen asleep with it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not leather as stated","review":"Description states snake printed leather; however, purchased shoes and it is labeled/stamped all manmade materials.

These shoes were the perfect look, although a little bright of a silver. I wore these to a wedding and the strap kept falling off my heel. In between the wedding and reception, we stopped at a CVS and I purchased those Dr. Schols silicone grip strips, but even with those the the strap refused to stay on. I was hugely disappointed.I wear wide mostly for my toe box and perhaps my heel is normal size and that may be why they were too big. Still there was a small elastic section on the strap, which should have made it automatically adjust to my heel size, but the elastic was not very springy. Sort of stretched out.One more thing if you wore these without stockings they may work for you. However, for me silver is a winter holiday type choice and I would never go without nylons in the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty shoe, definitely runs small","review":"Love the look of this shoe and its heel height. Got lots of compliments as well, but as other reviewers said, it runs small. The \\"small\\" part for me was across the front straps on my toes. I did go up one width but probably could have gotten something even wider. Trying to stretch it more by wearing socks with the shoe at home. Great tread on the bottom (not slippery at all on ballroom floors). The ball of the foot area is padded, but for long wedding wear, I reccommend adding a gel pad. Still, pretty happy with the purchase overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"very uncomfortable sandal","review":"The problem with this sandal was not in the sizing, it was just really uncomfortable.

Its feel good message is just a reminder of how white america can struggle through all of its problems and eventually end up with the beautiful wife and 2.5 kids behind a white picket fence with friendly neighboors. It is particularly disgusting when Stewart explores his own non-existence to find his wife to be a pathetic librarian that has no life to fill without being married.

It took the viewing public more than THIRTY years to appreciate this Frank Capra masterpiece.The name, James Stewart and the character he portrayed, George Bailey became synonymous.The supporting cast, with names like Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, H.B.warner, Ward Bond, Frank Faylen,Samuel S.

I know that it did not need to be done this way, so I'm curious why they made it so.

Hunter has a writing style and a such a grasp for the events, thoughts and feelings of Jacobites and Hanovarians of the time that you cannot help but be transported in time to view all occurrences practically in person. Culloden and the Last Clansman was enjoyable on so many levels that I have to recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading. If you are a history buff especially, you cannot miss this one.

There is a concept known as melody. Melody is a series of note choices which create a dialog and tell a story. Call and response, tension and release. Yngwie sounds like a hyperactive cocaine induced nightmare. the lightning fast mediocre technique of an adolecent which could \\"SHOW PROMISE\\" if, it weren't for his condition. I believe they give Ritalin to AD/HD disorder. Giving him a dose high enough might pose a health risk, although, It is a risk humanity deserves. The real sad part is not his awful playing, but, the droves of non-classically trained people who are fascinated by his garbage offerings. How sad that an ego so large is perplexed by what is generally considered the centerpiece of any musical composition.

His composition skills are incredible, with his guitar playing, it actually creates an atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Could You Hate This?!","review":"I've been reading the reviews for this album and would like to say to everyone who gave it a bad review, how dare you! How dare you say those thing about Yngwie! Saying he has no soul... He's the most soulful guitarist ever! Another thing that's constantly brought up is Jason Becker. No offense to all you Jason Becker fans, he's all right, but comparing Jason to Yngwie is like comparing Poison to KISS. They had one or too good songs but comepletly ruined the concept of wearing make up onstage that KISS had started. So I don't get to far of track I'd like to end this review by saying Yngwie is the greatest guitarist ever and to those who hate him, to hell with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is the, Neo-classical GOD","review":"Hie!If you are a guitarisst, and never heard about Yngwie Malmsteen, it's SAD... ;)This Record is extremely GOOD!!! The first song on this CD is called \\"Black Star\\", it's verry nice,much of his \\"trade mark\\" (Harmonian scales & all off Yngwies play-style). This CD is pure Malmsteen. I like the speed licks & all the incredible nice arpeggios that Yngwie use. For example the solo in \\"As Above, So Below\\", this is a verry níce diminished arpeggio with some nice scales ... And the song \\"Evil Eye\\" it's so damn nice... The intro is verry verry classical inspiation... And the solo is a nice Linear Line scale... If you don't have this Malmsteen album, what are you wating for?STAY TUNEDDANIEL"},{"rating":"2","title":"guitar players this is your cd","review":"the guitar in this album is so amazing and technical and beautiful and melodic all at the same time. trying to figure the solos out are pretty much next to impossible unless you got one of those things that slows the speed down. yngwie combines technique, theory, speed, and harmony all into one amazing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jittery altitudes","review":"2 1/2Brought down by its passionate tribute to all things corny in eighties metal, instrumental passages nonetheless can often transcend their cheesy confines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yngwie's Best of All Time!","review":"This is the quintessential guitar album. There are six instumentals here, eight tracks in all. This would be worth the price of admission for the six instrumental tracks alone. This album is that good!Yngwie Malmsteen exploded onto the rock scene with this album (after a few indy label albums with hand picked bands). His performance here earned him the title of guitar god as teenage \\"wanna be virtuosos\\" threw away their copies of Van Halen One, only to plug a Fender Strat into a Marshall amp and try to wail away to a new flavor of guitar rock.These cuts still sound fresh today. Yngwie was the neo-classical innovator. No other album, including his subsequent releases, have lived up to this one. If you enjoy classical music or great guitar, you have to buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got Yngwie?","review":"Malmsteen is an artist by any measure and this is a great example of his skill and finesse. I can't comment on his technique, but as an amateur admirer of guitar, it is truly remarkable what he does on this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"ORIGINAL RELEASE !","review":"Very original, it set the pattern for a lot o \\"copiers\\" to follow. It has a lot of instrumental tunes, very good, and the ones which features Scott Soto are great , also."},{"rating":"2","title":"The #1 Guitar God!!!!","review":"Yngwie is simply the best guitar player that exists, and Rising Force is simply my most favorite CD. Other guitar players such as Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Eric Johnson can't compare to the solo's of this guitar god! If you like the guitar players above, this is the CD for you! I consider \\"Far Beyond the Sun\\" to be the best guitar based song of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first cd and a solid favorite","review":"A couple of years ago I finally broke down and bought a cd player though I still loved vinyl.At a flea market I picked up this cd for a buck. It had no cover ,no case and I had no clue who the hell this guy was. Upon first listening my impression was \\" typical busy new band blah blah...\\" I listened again. And again. And again. Epiphany! Yet I was still so ignorant that I thought maybe this was some japanese bootleg of Deep Purple in disguise or something. The licks on this album remind me of Ritchie Blackmore in his heyday and the overall composition seems similar to something Jon Lord might compose. In fact some of the other titles in Yngwie's collection include cassical/rock combos. Obviously I am not a musician. I might not even know music but I know what I like . This guy can play his axe and that's the truth! I believe! Sadly,my cd is now damaged and I must get a new one . Farewell."},{"rating":"2","title":"This set a standard","review":"There was not a guitar player on the face of the GLOBE that didn't sit up and take notice when this was released 20+ years ago . No other guitar player is this fast and this clean . His use of baroque chord structures had never been done before . If you think you are a good guitar player , try this . The only weak spot is the pedestrian ( even by heavy metal standards ) lyrics . This is a landmark release ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best of.","review":"I will give this 4 stars because when it came out in 1984 it certainly was different. The compositions on this album are quite spectacular from a guitar playing point of view. Unfortunately I don't belive Yngwie actually progressed very far after this. In fact some of the tracks from his latest album are not as good as some of the compositions on this first album. Credit has to be given for his influence because when this album did come out, so many other speed pickers and sweepers followed soon afterwards. Shrapnel records have released an awful lot of these shredders, which unfortunatly always seem to play in the same key so thus sound the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking.","review":"A timeless album that drips with passion, it still holds up today over fifteen years later. Gypsy-flamenco metal? Vivaldi-rock? It gets no better than this, being the yardstick by which every virtuoso rock recording is judged.Weak spots: The lyrics. \\"Evil Eye\\" is overproduced a bit, as well; the live Alcatrazz version was quite something.Strong spots: Everything else, including the mix. If any album deserved one of those 24K gold \\"remasters\\", this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technique does NOT make good music","review":"I am a guitarist, and I can vouch for Malmsteen's astounding technique. However, that only takes you so far. The songs should come first, and the songwriting just isn't there. Endless solos get boring and old after a while. You can either play for other guitar players to show off how fast you can go wheedily wheedily whee up and down the fretboard, or you can write songs and solos that hit people in the gut and touch their hearts.In my opinion, Malmsteen had an overwhelmingly NEGATIVE influence on rock guitar in the 80's. It became a competition. So many players were worried about speed and technique rather than composition and playing from their souls. As another reviewer said, if you want emotional instrumental guitar music, pick up a Eric Johnson or a Joe Satriani cd instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major league bore","review":"That Mr. Malmsteen can play lots of notes in rapid succession is beyond dispute, so, on a strict reckoning of note per unit currency paid for this CD, you do very well. However, I could have done with fewer notes and some music. It would have been nice had Mr. M. thought to include some. But he didn't. Perhaps he can't. So, what you get, essentially, is one of those dreadful heavy metal solos prolonged for an entire CD. In the end, I couldn't finish this indigestible noise and sold it off at a loss ASAP. Approach with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste!","review":"This is one of the weakest albums i ever bought! the only half decent song is the one by THREE-6-MAFIA, and it's not their best. do not buy this! go buy Project Pat-Getty Green, a REAL album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conrad's War","review":"This book stinks.

I know it's for kids, but I love the Hamtaro cartoon and animation style so got it to get more into this and it worked perfectly. I enjoy the high quality illustrations and all the fun activities through out the book. If I was a kid I would have gone crazy about this one. It's as cool as the cartoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Big couldn't dodge the \\"grunge\\" bump","review":"The \\"bump\\" that lay \\"ahead\\" every skilled/unskilled, established/unestablished rock act in the early 1990s was \\"grunge.\\" Mr. Big, was a skilled band, who, like many others, tweaked their sound towards the grungier side. This album has a muddier sound, and the rockers have a moodier, \\"bluesier\\" feel. The ballads (they have one too many here) are rather flat. The musical originality that defined Lean Into It is absent. Just think about the mind-boggling, ear-pleasing guitar intro to the Green Tinted sixties Mind or the adrenalin inducing \\"Luck This Time.\\" Nothing like those on this record. With their next album \\"Hey Man\\" the band delved deeper into the abyss of grunge and got lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"BARELY WARM","review":"has the mildest heating effect you could ever have and legally call a blanket. terrible ,terrible product, stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"The product stopped working after 2 days of using it.

The wrench heads are made of a high quality material and the tool provides plenty of torque. This tool is perfect for the road/emergency because it eliminates extra weight and works great.

The book bought out many issues that people face in life on the reg. It showed how hard it could be in life finding out who you are regardless of your sexual preferences. I myself enjoyed the characters because each one had a different view of life. Kyle was my favorite, because he lived life to the fullest even when he was on his way out. He didn't try to hide how he felt, was very down to earth, and didn't care what anybody else thought. I give E. Lynn 3 thumbs up, keep them coming baby"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Read the Same Book as Everyone Else?","review":"I'm beginning to think I must have read a different book than everyone else. I'm not sure how anyone could give this book any kind of rave reviews. I've read some wretched literary endeavors in my time and this certainly ranks up there with the worst. Reading it was like trudging up a mountain through hundreds of feet of snow. By Chapter 4 I was ready to weep with boredom. The dialogue is hideously written. Honestly, my 6 year old could come up with more imaginative conversations than E. Lynn Harris. My money could certainly have been spent better elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"less average (2-2.5 stars)","review":"I can't say enuff 'bout this but I thought it was a novel that has to deal w/ life of something like from famous black authors of Richard Wright to Langston Hughes to Ralph Ellison or somethin like that. I believe it's a ok book even tho I don't read it very oftenly all the time 'cuz it deals w/ the situations between HIV/AIDS, sex and celibacy. First of all I never read a sex book in my life. I thought it was cool but it goes to tell you how to beware about the diffrence bout the good side vs. the bad side of sex. I'ma think I'll keep it 'round a lil longer or so. Good work E. Lynn Harris."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRYING A RIVER!","review":"Loved this book! Harris smoothly and deftly moves the narration between his main characters Raymond & Nicole. I was taken back a bit that the book alters the narration between the two charcters. It was amusing to see how each one spoke of a certain situation, but expressed subtle differences in how things played out. As a sequel, in my opinion, it surpasses its predecessor, Invisible Life. I was blown away by how much the characters had grown and changed. I was also completely engrossed in how they looked at certain situations and what the implications on their lives had been. Kudos to Mr Harris for being such a masterful story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading!!","review":"I was moved and captured by this book. I'm glad Raymond found true love, and I'm happy for Nicole too.

Keep up the great writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"BREATHTAKING","review":"This was one of those books that I couldn't put down. I was so into it I found myself reading it in traffic at red lights.

Lynn Harris has done a great job with this one. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-opener","review":"Just like Invisible Life, this book's most redeeming quality is its upfront look at homosexuality and the effect it has on not only the individual, but everyone around him (or her). And for a middle-class white mommy, Harris' books have been my personal education on the unique challenges faced by black homosexuals. However, the part I enjoyed most about the book was everything and anything to do with Kyle, best friend to main characters Raymond and Nicole. Kyle's character -- with his biting yet incredibly insightful and honest comments -- made the book fun to read. Quite often I felt for him and his mother more than I did the two main characters! However, in the end I was excited for Raymond and Nicole and was overcome with an almost \\"giddyness\\" as I drank in the romance and warm friendships portrayed in the book. It was a slow start (although not quite as slow as Invisible Life), but Harris wrapped me up in his story again for an enjoyable reading experience!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK THAT DEALS WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS GAY","review":"GREAT BOOK....I'D TO SEE E LYNN HARRIS WRITE A BOOK WHERE BASIL HENDERSON IS THE MAIN CHARACTER...I'M A GAY WOMAN, BUT I CAN CERTAINLY RELATE TO THE CHALLENGES HE FACES...MIA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously juvenile!","review":"I am truly stupefied that anyone found this book anything more than dry and pretentious.These characters are so underdeveloped and superficial I was able to read as a completely detached observer.The dialogue is contrived and stilted,and there is no unity in the narrative of the story:the chapters could well be excerpts from any of 100 different books...but let's at least be glad there aren't 100 other similar books out there. I sympathize with the author's sense of urgency in revealing the angst of the gay male of African origin,and that of AIDS sufferers, but an essay on the same would have been a more humane experience than this juvenile short story that E.

In all I was truly touched."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT","review":"The book is great. The way Harris describes the characters, you feel like you actually know them.

There are great video clips that are beautiful and sometimes funny, but do not enforce the topic being discuss. The coaches interviews are very good, but there are no graphics or data to support or illustrate what is being said, just endless ski videos and beauty shots mixed with the coach staring into the camera. For example, the coach talks about the heart and they show a vivid picture of a heart, but don't indicate anything in the picture related to the coaches comments.There is a lot of information in this video, but pulling meaning out of it and using it is not possible unless you already fully understand training concepts.The lack of organization in this video left me frustrated and unable to finish it.Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller never shipped item!","review":"I can't really comment on the quality of the product since I never got it!

His mixtape Sleeping Giant is good since it has a ton of guest mc's on it so you figure that one out. I just dont think that he can hold a album together all on his own. I've been listening Hiero crew since i was about 14, so i will give this album a pass. Avoid this cd at all cost! Just download track #7 The Dum Dum. Only dope joint on this one.

Winwood's voice sounds strained and a bit out of tune here, in a way he had never been with Spencer Davis, and fortunately bounced back from in Traffic and his later solo career. His main contribution here is his organ playing and some pretty decent duet guitar leads with Clapton (especially in \\"Had To Cry Today\\"--maybe that's what gave Clapton a taste for the duet work he later did with Duane Allman in Derek & the Dominos). For Clapton, this was the last time we were to hear his talent for extended jamming--from here on in, his vocals were what he focused on. As for Rick Grech, another reviewer dissed his guitar work on this page--maybe that's because he doesn't PLAY guitar here. He's the bassist on this set except for his violin work in \\"Sea Of Joy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Records Ever Made...","review":"I read that Eric Clapton hates it....well sorry, but I love it.

However, Presence Of The Lord is one classic piece with one of the best guitar solos of Eric Clapton's career. Can't Find My Way Home and Sea Of Joy are two other nice understated pieces. However, there is way too much limited material for this record to be worth anyhing more than a bargain bin purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Clapton release ever","review":"If you like Cream but are not too fond of Clapton's other work, this is an album you will like. Maybe it's Steve Winwood's influence that makes the difference. The music on this album is actually closer in overall feel to that of Traffic than Cream.

(In many ways it's an extension of material he was recording with Traffic)Clapton took a back seat but his contributions were not diminished in any way. It's practically the closest he has come to jazz-rock, aside of \\"Old Love\\" and the material on his most recent studio album, \\"Reptile\\". His solo on \\"Presence of the Lord\\" is alternatively savage and poignant, the famous break, an exercise in controlled aggression. I love the loose jazzy jam \\"Do what you like\\", where Clapton again excels. \\"Had to Cry Today\\" is a potent, but less ardent example of hard rock (compared to Cream) and the delicate \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" make this an outstanding set. This band had enormous potential, much of it unrealised, sadly.The expectations were simply too great, and the pressures on them as a money generating venture too extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bonus Tracks Question","review":"For the reviewer who asked about the \\"bonus tacks\\" titled Exchange And Mart and Spending All My Days, these tracks were actually demos for a Rick Grech solo album that was never released.

The highs are exaggerated, and the bass none existent. I usually buy the import because it is recorded better, but stay away from this one. Try the original or go with the the live concert.

As others have pointed out, the actual songs and outtakes are quite good, but the jams had me wondering what was going on. Clapton, especially, sounds somnambulent, with virtually no creative spark or fire in his playing at all. That isn't the case with the solos in the originally released material, so, what gives? Is there better stuff as yet unreleased? Frankly, a compilation of some of the better bootlegged recordings readily available on eBay would have been far more preferable for completists - some of it was obviously recorded from a sound source close to the stage, so cleaning it up would not have been that difficult. Oh, well...perhaps some other time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great","review":"When the LP was first released I ran out and bought it, when the CD was released I ran out and bought it. \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" will forever stick in my mind, \\"Well All Right\\" should've gotten more commercial exposure than it did. Overall a genuine piece of musical history, and we the music buying public were lucky to have this compilation of talents, even for a short period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great promise; too rushed","review":"The promise of this \\"supergroup\\" was never fully realized. Under tremendous pressure to produce an album, they actually produced five really good songs and almost one whole side (LP jargon there) of filler in \\"Do What You Like.\\" Considering the strength of the rest of the album, this obvious filler seemed like a slap in the face then, and seems even more so today. That's too bad. If they had been given the time to write and produce an entire album's worth of quality material, this album might have the same weight in Clapton's cannon as Layla. And that's really saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine Guitar","review":"Maybe Eric Clapton isn't God, but if you listento this album you will know where that claimcame from."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the top albums from this genre","review":"If you are a fan of the type of jazz / blues rock coming out of The SF Bay area during the late '60s and early '70s, then you probably already have this album. If you don't then this is certainly one you should have in your collection because it is among the best representatives from the tradition of folks like Cream, Traffic, Alman Bros., Grateful Dead, etc. It's got the creative lyrics, engaging rhythms, and the long jams that make this stuff such an interesting listen. It is truly one of the timeless ones. I only gave it four stars because, while very good, it is not among the best albums out there in the world. If compared simply to other albums within this genre, it should certainly receive five-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOUNDS LIKE SLUDGE","review":"The \\"Simply Vinyl\\" version of this album is a very bad example of one of the greatest albums ever recorded.

CANT FIND MY WAY BACK HOME,even if its falsetto vocals wear very thin, and PRESENCE OF THE LORD are two of the best songs of that time, and are still pretty good today, but the rest is mainly filler. Early Cream is much better, even though one can appreciate these guys were trying to do something new. Most of it doesn't stand up today though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind Faith","review":"It was a one hit wonder. \\"Can't find my way home\\" to me is the only good song but it was good enough to buy the album because I really like that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Spring classic, this time with spring hikes","review":"I love all the Spring hiking books - the 100 Classic hikes, the Alpines Lakes version, and so forth. This book, unlike the others, offers several lower altitude hikes that are accessible in April and May (depending on the winter's snowfall). I strongly recommend it if you're frustrated with looking for hikes for the \\"shoulder season.\\" The book has the usual good commentary, though I prefer Harvey Manning to Rick McGuire, and good pictures.My only complaint is the authors' recommendation in the forward that hikers not bring their dogs but instead strike out cross-country and off-trail if they wish to hike with a dog. The dog may not miss the views, but the people certainly will, and many hikers are not skilled / experienced enough to successfully and safely hike off-trail."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Washington guidebooks","review":"I'm in the midst of planning my first backpacking trip in Washington State this fall. Of all the many trail guides that I've picked up over the past month, this is my favorite. Rick deeply cares about the country that he's describing, and isn't afraid to speak out on the issues that matter to me. Knowing how he feels makes it easier for me to judge his opinions about a given trail. I've seen other guides that don't get around to mentioning heavy ORV or horse traffic on the trails that they cover - that's not the case with Rick. His writing, as mentioned in another rating, remind me a lot of Manning's. It's excellent, as are the photos by Ira Spring.Even if you don't plan to hike the Stevens Pass region, the book is still an excellent purchase because of the insightful comments regarding the Wild Sky movement. Keep 'em coming, Rick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"I've been waiting for the Allman Brothers to be offered here. In the 70's all of Long Island loved the Brothers!

The resulting music features strong singing and songwriting by Dicky Betts, as well as rolling keyboards by Chuck Leavelle, who had last played with the band on \\"Live From the Filmore\\" release. \\"Wasted Words\\" showcases Betts on slide guitar. The single, \\"Rambling Man\\" is still a Betts standard, with guitar leads contributed by Les Dudek. \\"Come And Go Blues\\" is a classic Allman's take on the blues. \\"Southbound\\" a tale of returning home for these Southern rockers, has great guitar and tight drumming. \\"Jessica\\" is an instrumental standard, and the often overlooked \\"Pony Boy\\" is lead by Betts's slide and dobro playing. This is not as powerful as some of the earlier Allman Brothers releases, but is still worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Digitally Remastered","review":"Product Dscription says \\"Digitally Remastered Album\\" and what I got was a Capricorn Classic Reissue,the sound it's no good, I wrote to Amazon about it, did not get any response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great allman bros. cd","review":"Had the album. this is about the 2nd cd. someone made off with the last one.

Happy to have added this one back into my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Allman Brothers Band's Best Album","review":"BROTHERS AND SISTERS is the Allman Brothers Band's best album ever. The dual losses of Duane Allman and Berry Oakley had forced the band to cut away the self-indulgence that had marred some of their earlier work, and the result is a bluesy Southern country-rock album that influenced not only later Southern bands such as the Outlaws, but also the later work of the Eagles and virtually every jam band since the late 80s. \\"Ramblin' Man\\", \\"Southbound\\", \\"Jessica\\", and \\"Wasted Words\\" are the standouts here, with \\"Come And Go Blues\\" following close behind. The other two songs aren't so great, but with five out of seven cuts being great, this is an album any rock fan must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"In spite of tragedy, the band played on","review":"Bass player Berry Oakley was killed in a motorcycle accident during the recording of this album. It wasn't the first death of an originating band member because Gregg Allman's brother Duane died in another bike accident prior to the release of the classic \\"Eat A Peach\\". \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" has, in spite of tragedy, also become one of the best in rock history. The Allman Brothers survived and released this gem when other bands may have packed it in (Zeppelin comes to mind with the death of Bonzo). Highlights on this disc include 'Wasted Words', 'Ramblin' Man', \\"Southbound' and 'Jessica'. The upbeat, country infused 'Pony Boy' ends the album in an upbeat way in spite of the tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic for just $1.99 !?!?!?!?","review":"I have this one on vinyl and have wanted the mp3s for some time.

The instruction for the leader or the follower isn't there. It's just watch and follow. You're not going to learn tango from a video anyway. You can have all the steps in the world and still be a beginner if you can't dance with a partner. And that can only happen with real people. Normally I would say get a video to supplement your class, but I'd skip this one. There isn't enough break down to know what you are doing or if you are doing it correctly.

Because despite the well described discrimination against the women in the book, those countries were the most receptive to female researchers. A telling commentary of the social mores of that time, even amongst the most educated and supposedly least prejudiced males - the faculty of the universities.Creese must have spent years delving into musty boxes of records.

This covers everything from basics to pro-level tips. 5 x doube sided DVD with this lowest price ... incredible! But, forget about the price because I'd like you to focus more on the QUALITY of the instructions. Wally Armstrong's unique and sometimes even queer instructions are based on firm logic. Ultimately, golf, a ball hitting game, is a matter of physics. He knows this point very well. But, more importantly, no other instructor can make your golf learning more enjoyable. This is just like a novel which might change your entire life. Wally is the most unforgettable teacher in my life.

I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read all the glowing reviews about this series I shelled out quite a bit to buy the videos and get them shipped to me in Australia. I shouldn't have bothered. The programmes are so disjointed and badly put together. (Eg, we hear about one colour, jump to two separate topics, come back to another colour five minutes later, jump to a completely separate topic, etc) The constant talking is SO grating, too. My toddler refuses to watch them and I too find them confusing and annoying. There's a bit of everything but not enough of anything, it's so poorly structured that I can't see how it could teach a child anything (I am an elementary school teacher) and in fact the jumping between topics could be counter-productive instead.

Several of the nonstick variety lost their coating within just a few uses. I then switched back to aluminum and stainless steel. Horrible results with each. This griddle is perfect. Even heating, no hot spots, just enough weight, comfortable handle, good balance, easy clean up. I took the precaution of following the manufacturer instructions regarding oiling it once before the first use, similar to treating cast iron, but you only have to do it once. I intend on using it for many types of food other than pancakes or crepes. The weight is appropriate for fast meat searing with the bonus of being able to put it in the oven at 350 degrees. What more could you ask for - terrific price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not heat up quickly. Not good for making Dosa's","review":"I bought this pan after reading excellent reviews.

Well it happened last week, and one of our dogs had their paw \`degloved' After a trip to the e-vet and 20+ staples, she is on the mend.

Extremely easy to clean. It's wide enough but a little too shallow (3\\" in depth) comparing to other 14\\" wok in the market. The bottom is very slippery on stove top. Make sure you hold the handle when you stir or turn the food.2/10/11 update: Very disappointed to find many scratches after 1 month. I use it with wooden utensil only and clean it with a sponge.

The heat spread is quite even.After 3 months of use I notice a thin line where the coating has given way but I think it is mostly due to my negligence (please do not scratch the surface too much even while using wooden spatulas).Furthermore, the capacity is most commendable- I could cook 10 large bell peppers and it still had space for atleast 5 more.It is slightly expensive but the quality is evident so it's acceptable.I'm giving it only 4 stars because it could have been better, if it had come with a lid (for this price).Overall- good product for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift!","review":"Mom swears by T Fal, so when she asked for a wok for Christmas, I thought this would be perfect.

However, if you use two hands to toss the food (stir-frying) this pan has NO traction on the stove. I have a regular gas stove and didn't think anything could slide on such a surface, but as soon as I went to toss the food, the pan went flying. I guess a little oil went over the side during the slide, and next thing I know I have flames flying like saganaki in a Greek restaurant! It was very scary. You almost need three hands to use it. Two to stir-fry, and one to hold the handle down while you do. The other drawback is that it doesn't come with a lid, and you're not likely to have one lying around that's big enough.If you can find a way to secure it while cooking, like surrounding it with big heavy pots so it can't move while cooking, it's a great pan. Otherwise, it is VERY dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt hold on stove","review":"Only gripe is that this is more suitable for induction heating.

Who wouldn't love this collection of sing-along songs that brighten your mood no matter when, or how often, you listen to them? Since Grease is also one of my all-time favorite movies, hearing the songs automatically makes me recall the particular scene they correlate with, and I invariably start smiling.Grease consists of many talented actors and actresses, most of whom could sing as well as they could act. Therefore, each song -- including numerous solos by John Travolta, Oliva Newton-John and Stockard Channing -- is a treat to listen to.If I were only allowed to bring one CD to the proverbial deserted island, Grease would probably be it!

You would think that the label would have corrected this but they didn't.The second disc is short (about 40 minutes) and just features alternate takes and remixes of the same songs.

As such, the door has probably settled over the years. I couldn't close mine at first and it was very difficult to do so for about a month. Once the weather warmed up, it conformed nicely.My only gripe was with the packaging. I ordered two and Amazon shipped each one separately in a gargantuan box.

It is easy to follow and the chapters stick to their subject. The author points out that Madison was a very private man- so there isn't much information about his private life. So the bulk of the book is about his political life- which was actually what I was more interested in. In regards to Madison, what I found most interesting about him was his views on property rights. An issue that seems to be in hot debate for modern times. Madison felt that this was a fundamental issue for personal liberty. p.227 \\"his major fear was that a government dominated by people holding only small amounts of property would enact legislation inimical to the just rights of the wealthier segments of society.\\" Seems we never learn from history and continue to force the same arguments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine book impossibly packaged","review":"I never thought I would write something like this, but it must be said. I buy hundreds of books a year and this work was unique. A fine book fatally flawed in its physical execution, and monumentally overpriced. Rakov, Amazon, and publishers take note. This shameful 'product' might have been acceptable even with its extravagent price were it not for the disgraceful binding that ran the text into the tightly bound spine. Books are meant to read, not wrestled. I had to return my copy because of this bit of publishing garbage - which cost me the postage.

Needless to say, I will not be buying another pair of these worthless jeans ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing!","review":"This product did not meet my expectation.

However, on the third wear of one of them, the fabric started ripping along the edge of the back left pocket. There is now an enormous hole in on the seat of the pants, rendering them unwearable. I knew these jeans were cheap, but I got them because I'm losing weight an planned on fitting into them for only a few months. That they delivered only a few days is extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanging out","review":"I've bought these at Walmart for a couple of years now. I don't know why I keep buying them. They all do the same thing after about maybe a month. First thing is a hold starts on the left side of the crotch. About the same time the material starts tearing on the right thigh. It looks cool and all if I was 20 but I'm not. It not a fashion thing with these it's just poor material. A few more washes and both holes are too big to get away with wearing in public.

I was able to sew them up again on one pair; but not on the other pair. The other pairs of jeans worked fine. These are thin light weight jeans not soft like the \\"Seven\\" (7 of Mankind ) jeans (Cairo) and they are not form fitting like the AG or \\"Seven\\" jeans; but for their low cost they are a good buy.

And you won't have to pay $65 dollars-that's when they're \\"on sale\\" at Dillard's or Banana Republic--for the same pair of jeans.

The first part, about the efforts of detective/co-author Keers to catch serial killer Bill Suff is not bad, but the second part, about Suff's life, rehashes many of the killings and incidents surrounding them in virtually the same words! And in the third part -- about the trial -- one of the incidents is repeated for a third time. What I found extremely annoying about this book was the use of square brackets -- [ ] -- within quotes to supposedly \\"clarify\\" what was said. By the book's end, many of these insertions (by the authors or by the editors?) have gone beyond clarification and amount to editorializing. There is at least one instance of brackets which are within the text of a descriptive paragraph -- not a quote!

Either the beats bore me to depression or his usual \\"BONE CRUSHING SUPREME\\" lyrical style became some weak off beat type of style. I actually was hoping that every track was going to be ill, but most of the tracks sounded like skits or melodys. Why doesnt he represent on his FIRST SOLO ALBUM like how he represents as a guest on his fellow Wu-member projects or the Wu-family albums??? I admit at least track 7 got my head bangin time to time...probably cause the Meth and Inspectah represented with there usual flow up in that piece.

In NY, I use the Bee Pollen from Amazon sold by Stakich Inc. It, so far, is not quite as fresh tasting, but still very good. Seeing that this is available in larger quantities at lower cost per unit, I decided to try a pound to see if I liked it first. It is yellow & grey in color & tastes like it's mixed with vinegar.

And the new original content sprinkled throughout isn't much better. It's not a surprise this is one of the harder to find Gamera movies.

It begins with the significance of the Kabaa and ends with the death of the Prophet whilst illuminating everything in between. This book is also broken down into several chapters allowing for an easy read.Even though this is a great source of Islamic knowledge, it may be a difficult read for some non-Muslim readers.

It does not come with a blade guard, so storing the tool is a little dicey as it must have its own area to prevent shorn off fingertips. The adjustments are made by a rotating bar under the blade area, and it sliced several sweet potatoes with no issue. The blade is now stained orange, which is purely cosmetic. The tool works very well for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made - broke easily","review":"Never having used or purchased a mandonline before, I was happy with this when i first got it although I agree that it is dangerous. My daughter and I both sliced our fingers a few times before we got the hang of it. The guard is not very good, but it's OKAY. The disappointment came because it broke so easily. We hand-wash it, and used it fairly often to slice onions and peppers in our salad. It does a nice job. Also does a nice job with cucumbers. BUT, the plastic edge broke on one side. I tried crazy glue and then epoxy. neither worked. We were still able to use it by holding it togeter with a rubber band and slicing gently. It was a pain. But then the other side cracked and broke as well.For $25 I think this is a rip-off. I would like to investigate sending it back to the manufacturer or distributor because it should not be falling apart so quickly.ND"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Broke!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The mandolin slicer fell apart the first time I used it. I'm glad it didn't cost too much and it wasn't worth the cost of the postage to return it. The blade was sharp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend - disappointed","review":"Always wanted a small mandolin to slice cucumbers, onions, etc quickly and evenly. This has a ceramic blade and seemed small and simple to use. Plus, the reviews were great. But there are a couple issues with it. 1) The hand guard is worthless. It does not grip anything. 2) while sharp, it slices way too thinly. I leave it on the biggest setting -- 3mm, but the slices are still too thin. The other 2 settings do not work. I now only use this if I want to slice cucumbers really quickly, even if they are too thin for my liking. I am surprised by all of the high ratings. I bought it for $19 though, so at least it was relatively inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!!!","review":"Ended up in the ER with the end of my finger cut off!

The guard is a bit of a fuss unless it is what is left of say flat cheese. The finger protector doesn't work so well with round or larger items. The round things want to roll, or the guard wants to roll over and not into the blade. This may take more practice but it beats taking a chance on scrapping fingers so I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, and very sharp!","review":"Please, please use the safety handle. I thought I was being careful enough, but I just sliced a chunk of my thumb off the other day. Ow!!!!Now for the review: This is a great tool. It is very self-explanatory and easy to use. The blade is very, very sharp. It makes beautiful, thin, elegant veggie slices for attractive presentation of your food. I love the tool, and I will never, never again forget to use the safety handle! I gave four stars instead of five because I would like it to be just a bit wider, to fit larger veggies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little slicer!","review":"This little guy does the job. Cucumbers, radishes, onions come out perfect in nanoseconds! It is easy to clean. I store it in the original packaging. You never need to touch the blade. And remember you don't have to get the very last slice. Use it for compost. It doesn't do tomatoes. Big deal. For the price you can't go wrong. You really need to ask --- how much of the fancy stuff do I really do or need."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well, slices are thin","review":"The other reviews are accurate -- its very sharp, cleans easily, and the hand guard doesn't work that great so you should buy some Kevlar gloves (I did). One thing I'd like to point out is that the slices you can make with this thing are thin; the thickest setting is about 1/8 of an inch. I prefer thicker slices for cucumbers and the like in salads, so this tool has been a bit of a disappointment to me. I also have an Oxo mandoline that works well, but its a bit of a pain to clean because so many parts snap off so that it can do various cuts. I wanted this simpler model that just slices (no julienning, etc.) so I could quickly slice a few things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tool, but use properly","review":"This is a wonderful tool. However, you need to be careful. The thing comes with a food holder. When you get down to a 2 or so inches of whatever you are slicing, switch to using the food holder. Do not say to yourself \\"I can get one more slice of onion before I get the food holder\\" That leads nicely to the ER. If you remember that, you and your mandolin will be very happy. It is a tool with a cutting blade, just like a power saw. Keep that in mind, and all will go well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the thickest setting works","review":"This mandoline slices TOO thin. It has four settings and even the thickest makes very thin slices. The thinner settings just tear foods like cucumbers and tomatoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Strong Enough to Last","review":"This mandoline worked pretty well for me for a couple of years. Then the plastic handle broke off and I could not use it anymore. If I do replace it I will definitely get a heavier-duty model. I say \\"if\\" because the utility of these slicers is roughly offset by the danger they pose to your fingers. That's because the pusher-thingee that they include is awkward to use most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for slicing truffles, and veggies in general","review":"We enjoy black truffles in the fall, from either Oregon or Italy when we can get them. Because I have a Kyocera ceramic chef's knife, which works great on vegetables in general, I expected this would work well on truffles. And it sure does! It's much better than the metal razor-edge slicer I used to use for truffles.The only downside is that the adjustment bar doesn't really fit perfectly on my unit. The 0.5mm setting ends up slicing nothing, and each of the higher setting (1,2,3mm) are basically a notch lower than stated. I'm not sure why. I also find it almost impossible to use the gripper thing, so I just hold the food (carefully!) in my fingers when slicing. Neither of those is a serious issue, but lower it by a star.If you want to slice vegetables very thinly, and especially truffles to go on pasta, risotto, etc., this is the thing to get. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for an inexpensive model","review":"I have had this for around a month. I have use it to slice potatoes and carrots so far. I think it works really well. The ceramic blade is extremely sharp. I am a little concerned that it will not hold up because it's plastic - but time will tell. So far - i think it's great, especially if you're not sure how much you're going to use it. It is very handy.I have had this sine 9/11/09. 3.5 yrs later, it is still totally fine. No quality issues at all. I would charaterize my usage as occasional. One consideration before purchasing would be the thickness of the slice you want. I never had a mandolin before this, so I had little to go on. This one will give you very thin to thin slices. It didn't really work for what I originally bought it for - Au gratin potatoes. But that's not really the mandolin's fault! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kyocera Adjustable Mandolin Slicer","review":"Pro's: The ease of use is amazing. I love the fact that it fits in the drawer and just needs to be pulled out of the draw to use. It is extremely sharp and cuts perfectly.

I have used mine for almost 1 year and have no major complaints, the only one being that Kyocera could have designed the guard to snap in place covering the blade for storage.

Love this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I read all the possible consumer reports and reviews in Amazon etc, and decided to get a Kyocera mandoline. I love it - find it very sharp and easy to use. It is not very wide, but wide enough e.g. for potatoes. Partially frozen summer sausage sliced well, sweet red peppers, cucumbers etc in a couple of seconds. I am planning to try the potato chips microwave recipe, which I found online. Kyocera is able to cut see through slices! By doing them myself, I can control the sodium level, add spices etc. If using the mandoline for veggies, I usually just rinse it. I have it on the kitchen wall, where it is very convenient to use from and it protects the cutting edge. Maybe I'll ask for the Kyocera Julienne mandoline for next Christmas : )In summary, like someone described it: 'Looks like a toy, works like a dream!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy Prep, but a Little Dangerous","review":"I got this mandoline as a present for my mom, who had been wanting a very basic mandoline for a long time. I hesitated for years because of how dangerous they were, but this model seemed easy to handle and I thought the safety guard would be perfect. We used the mandoline on Christmas day to slice potatoes and found that it made really quick work of a usually laborious task--but the guard was a huge hassle and didn't hold the potatoes well. As a result, we did most of the potatoes without the guard, which was not very safe considering how fast your hand is moving. We had the best results when we held the potato without the guard until we sliced half of it, then fit on the guard to finish the rest of the potato.I also hoped the slicing thicknesses would have been more diverse--they were all very thin.Overall, it is a great little gadget for someone who just wants to slice things quickly, but it would be much better if the safety guard was more usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview about mobile standards and markets","review":"The book is very structured and gives an excellent overview about all major mobile standards, technologies and markets (Europe,US and Japan).

Also, the marketer should DEFINITELY alert potential buyers that they will need an \\"industrial strength\\" pump to pump it up.

Yet, as Marjorie's life unfolds on the pages of this book, we fall in love with not only Marjorie, but the wonderful cast of characters who make up her life.Marjorie Morningstar should be listed as one of the greatest books of the past century and I urge anyone who is interested in great writing by a master craftsman to read this much-cherished novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big buildup...silly ending","review":"First let me say how much I enjoyed reading this book, until the final pages.

I loved it so much that I just had to own it. As fascinating as the adventures of the sexually \\"ambidextrous\\" Herculine are, the seemless interface of historical fact with historical fiction just rivets me to the page. Being 1/8 Seminole, and seeing a distant ancestor come to life on the printed page, was a little extra treat. If you are sympathetic to the plight of witches, these books are for you.

I heard Logan Mader was in a new band, and I was psyched to say the least, but when I hear this CD, I was all but in tears. The riffs are non-existent, something I was especially dissapointed by (it's Logan friggin' Mader for Christs sake!), the songs are just wanky drones, sounding more like Placebo than any decent music.

He loves following along w/ You Tube vids and making paper planes, hats, and boats. For the price, I figured we'd try it. What I found disappointing was that the instruction booklet is quite small and not very kid friendly. My nephew really enjoys reading and following directions on his own. Even when he enlisted the help of an adult, it just didn't hold his interest. The paper is great quality and does indeed have awesome decorations. The kit itself was pretty underwhelming. It is sheets of the decorative paper, loose in a box, with a very dry looking, small instruction book. Maybe if the instruction booklet were bigger and had some color pics?In the end, he's got some cool paper to use for other projects.

I saw Rod and the Faces around this time at the Boston Music Hall, and they rocked the rockers to the nth degree. But my favorite has to be the title song. He wrenched so much emotion out of his characters travails, it had this comfortable suburban boy in tears. And who would have the guts to put such an emotional and quirky song first up on a rock album today; a song that has NO DRUMS.Cut across shorty is my second favorite, then You're my girl, and Only a hobo.

This is an Australian film, filmed in Australia, with Australian actors, yet the characters are eating and mention \\"smores\\".

Side One, I must say since the record is so damn obscure, is a tour de force of moody, wickedly crafted rock 'n roll. You can see where a cat like Roland S. Howard got his chops listening to this. But the spirit of '79 is still alive in here. I played this straight up tonight after \\"London Calling\\" and it wasn't a tough move.

The 'postmodern' style in which it is filmed is really nothing more than self promotion. It's extremely annoying and distracting to the point of not being able to follow what's being said. Is there any real point to having three people involved in the speaking of the same sentence, other than to show how cutting edge the editors are? The only reason I bought this was because of D.A. Carson's name, but don't be fooled. The video is just about how avante garde and in tune with God's purpose for the church are the makers of the film. If only we had their spiritual discernment we could join them in looking down on the rest of the church. As it is, I think there is enough of that condescending, un-Christlike attitude already.

We resorted to tying it on with some heavy gauge wire, but even then the front side would blow up over the hood.I purchased this new car cover for him for Christmas. This car cover fits the car like a glove. We didn't need to use the ties that came with it, it just fits the car snugly enough that it does not come off. It is made of a heavy material that is waterproof, and after this winter (three blizzards!) it still looks brand new.

Now it's on iTunes and Spotify. And now I've been able to listen to it back to back I can say this ish is incredible. Mos Def is like the culmination of a decade of good NY hip-hop. BOBS is a masterstroke. As far as the 'Native Tongues' collective go for raw rhyming skill, no-one is as technical (or political) as this on the mic. The music is stripped down, jazz-influenced, but effective, owing a lot to Tribe Called Quest records post Midnight Marauders. Sure, it's sprawling and ambitious but there's really no wasted space here.The very last great hip-hop album of the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Breath Of Fresh Air","review":"In this time of fake rappers who sing about pointless things, one man I know I can count on is Mos Def. His lyrics are deep, and he tries to make a point and open up your eyes to issues that you may not know much about. His songs aren't about the beats, they are all about the lyrics, this is real hip-hop. For the most part Mos limits the guest appearances, but the few guests that do appear (Busta Rhymes, Talib Kweli, Q-Tip and a few others) make nice appearances.

This is a nice cd that does almost everything. He spits a little knowledge here, he puts in a nice sample there. Put it all together, and it adds up to money well spent. He even has the nerve to play some instruments (let's see how Snoop does with a piano staring back at HIM). I really dig the insturmental at the end of the cd.

Mos Def comes with hip hop, blues, jazz, and rock elements in this album that all blend brilliantly for a surprisingly diverse album. Most of the songs are of the hip-hop flavor, but on \\"Rock and Roll\\" Mos makes an interesting point about the music genre that the title mentions. In either case, one of hip hop's (and music as a whole) most talented artists offers a well rounded album that will make you bob your head, raise an eyebrow or two, and even pick up your air guitar.

It's quiet meditation is a nice change of pace from the glitz and generic big beats topping the charts right now... but more than once it has offended many of my white friends. Songs like Rockn'Roll seem to quietly point fingers at white musicians for being unoriginal. It is sad how the style began as a crossover between black and white artists now has dissolved into a pissing contest. It is sad that artists like RL Burnside get may not get their due. But the Rolling Stones have, on numerous occasions, shown their appreciation for the roots of rock (jamming with BB King, etc). . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIP HOP MUSIC","review":"It very well could be one of the best records ever made.

What I later learned was that Mos Def is a true Hip Hop genius. This CD really sums up what he is all about, his lyrical cunningness, and witty delivery on tracks like \\"Brooklyn\\", \\"New World Water\\" and \\"Ms Fat Booty\\". But the shining light comes in the form of a relaxing and somewhat abstract track entitled \\"Umi Says\\", which draws attention away from the essential hip hop beats which encompass the album, and focuses on a different style altogether. This maybe signals the direction that undeground Brooklyn artists like Mos Def are taking. The CD finishes with the stylish \\"Mathematics\\" produced by the ever famous DJ Premier and the instrumental \\"May-December\\". Overall, this CD has diversity, big hits and the odd track that takes a while to figure out but ultimately is rewarding if you give it time, pretty much like the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Its the M-O-S D-E-F-initely\\"","review":"The greatest rap talent since Rakim. No Joke. His skills aren't as immediately apparent as Nas or Jay-Z but that's because your listening to what he's saying, and he's got a lot to say. Also Mos can flip any style he likes and frequently does on this album (as well as singing, producing, and playing bass, and drums). This album's got styles by the miles, and manages to tackle a number of styles (incl. punk-rock(!?), club track, ballad, primo-track, and unclassifiable classics) without losing consistency. You can play this start to finish. This is the greatest single hip-hop album of the 90's. Only OutKast(Aquemini) comes close [with Nas(illmatic),Jay-Z(Reasonable Doubt),Rae&Ghost(Cuban Linx/Ironman),and Mobb Deep(The Infamous) all vying for a worthy but very distant third].

Prince Paul's Prince Among Thieves still is one of the most important conceptual pieces for hip hop in a long time. But for straight brilliance, Black on Both Sides shines bright. Mos plays the vibes, precussion, croons, shouts like a punk rocker, drops the coldest flow I've heard in a long time, and has insight to match it. He's a little more militant this album, which is good for a mind as sharp as his -- New World Water, Mathematics, and Rock and Roll are all incredible. But so is everything else...

I hope he comes out with a few more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of 1999","review":"I am really glad I bought this CD. I enjoy every song on the album. My favorites are \\"Umi Says\\", \\"New World Water\\", and \\"May-December\\", but each time I listen to the CD I listen to the entire album and I don't skip a song. This, The Roots' \\"Things Fall Apart\\", and Prince Paul's \\"A Prince Among Thieves\\" were the 3 best albums of 1999 and should be owned by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Original","review":"With all that gangsta hard-driving rap out there, it is nice to occasionally take a break and listen to someone who almost sounds old-school at times. The melodic voice chanting the raps over the great music below reminds me at times of groups like Arrested Development (not that the sounds are all that similar). And the lyrics have that same back to the earth appeal that Arrested Development does as well. I think one of my favorite songs is Rock 'N Roll which just has a great sound to it and a really catchy hook.

Their ballads, such as \\"Be Near Me\\" and \\"Ocean Blue,\\" wear well, but the rest is mostly noisy garbage and the four bonus remixes the CD adds just prolong the problem. \\"A to Z\\" is head-shakingly bad, and overall this is easily the worst thing Fry's ever involved himself with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on ABC, make another masterpiece!","review":"As ABC's third album, it didn't go too well with me and that's just my opinion.

Otherwise, save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated 80's Pop","review":"I was a teenager in the late 70's and early 80's and consider myself quite the connoisseur of new wave and early 80's pop. The singles \\"How To Be A Millionaire\\" and \\"Be Near Me\\" are worth the price of purchase for this CD. In my opinion, \\"How To Be A Millionaire\\" is a very underrated pop single from the early 80's and I don't understand why you don't hear it with all of the 80's retro going on now. You often hear \\"Be Near Me\\" in the 80's retro radio programming now. And then there is \\"So Hip It Hurts\\", a very campy but still very funky dance track that still makes me want to dance.ABC had a unique sound with the vocals of Martin Fry and Eden. And I think their work on this particular album has stood the test of time pretty well. Much more so than some 80's albums I've been giving a second listening to here of late."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of ABC's best albums just got better!","review":"Nice reissue package from ABC - sadly, this is only on import, but worth every penny.

I have had this CD for many years and remember being a child dancing around to this and their older sigles (on LP, 45 and 12\\"). I still enjoy the production quality and over all great sound. I think a good addition to this would be to get their greatest hits (Definitley ABC). The remix of Be Near Me is worth the purchase alone. As my partner said upon playing me the greatest hits, \\"I forgot they did all these fun songs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maturing era","review":"The Spring of 1985 brought a time of renaissance for the classic sound of 80's music. Not only was the decade thriving with the feeling of abundance and hope, the music began maturing into \\"grown-up synth\\". ABC led the way with this outstanding neo-funk album. To their surprise, they created an edgy pop/dance sound that addicted club goers.The flawless \\"Bear Near Me\\", with Martin Fry's near-perfect vocals, skyrocketed on to the charts and became an instant smash hit for weeks in the UK and Canada. The US was slow to warm to this new sound. It hit its peak at #9 on the pop charts in November of that year. Soon followed lesser behomeths \\"Vanity Kills\\" and \\"How To Be A Millionaire\\". Both songs contained themselves to Dance charts and clubs.The entire album resonates with this new sound. Edgy, fun and oh-so danceable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shy shredder","review":"Worked beautifully for the 1st several sheets, then quit!

We've been using it for a couple of months and are quite pleased with its performance. It is compact, efficiently shreds a number of pages at once, and accepts staples with no complaint. And, the basket's capacity is so large that it doesn't need to be emptied often! Some folks suggest using a plastic bag as a liner, but our trash removal company frequently sends out flyers requesting that no plastic bags be placed in recycle cans. When it's time to empty the basket, it's a breeze to simply remove it, turn it over, and toss its contents into a paper bag -- then place the bag in our recycle can.Highly, and definitely, recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowes DS-1 Shredder","review":"This is working well in our home.

I tried to tire this machine out but it has not stopped preforming after continued usage. This is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very capable home shredder","review":"This is the first shredder that I have purchased for use at home. We don't have extensive shredding needs, just the usual monthly bills, tax data, financial statements etc. The Fellowes DS-1 is very capable and handles my needs nicely. It is very quiet, and the wastebasket in front is great for other trash as well. The safety shutoff is very nice, especially with small children around. In any case, I keep the machine turned off. I was concerned that the sensor would be over or under sensitive. However I am extremely satisfied with its sensitivity settings, no misses and no startup problems. Also this shredder can easily handle CD DVDs etc, although the manual done not mention it anywhere. Overall 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little shredder","review":"This little guy is fast!

The step can is awesome because I can just step on it and it pops out. So it is very easy to take out the paper when the can is full. It takes a lot of paper to fill it up too. I shred all the junk mail, junk credit cards and all personal stuff etc... I've even forgotten to take out some paperclips and I had no problem. That was nice. The best part is the safty feature. As soon as your fingers get too close an orange light comes on and the shredder shuts off. I love this because I have my kids in my home office all the time. I do unplug it though incase they get the idea to shred any of my stuff when I'm out of my office.

The next day after shredding 3 pages it stopped. Never could get it to work again, like it was jammed. The blades were clear, the light was on and I could go in reverse only. I called Fellowes and they said it was a common problem with the plastic sensor in the middle of the slot on top. They said call Amazon and if they didn't replace to call them back and they would. I am boxing it up to send back to Amazon for a replacement. I did like it though while it was working and hope it was only a fluke.(Updated 2/8/08)Replacement shredder arrived. Worked long enough to shread 5 pieces of paper before it died again. Reverse only. Stay away from this product. Apparently something wrong with sensor as others have posted.

They said the unit has a 5 year warranty on the cutter head, but since the part appears to be a \\"stripper\\" that it's not covered.I bought a Fellowes product because I thought they were be bulletproof and stand by their product. I didn't expect metal pieces to fall out of the cutting head and have Fellows say that since I've had the shredder for more than the basic one year warranty, they won't cover it. I've had the unit for 4 years, almost to the day, and now pieces of metal start falling out of the cutter, and Fellowes says that's not covered by the 5 year cutter warranty. Very Strange. I'd spend the $100 on a better product next time.

I had this shredder for a little over two years when it started to fail. The motor would run but the blades wouldn't turn. I contacted the manufacturer, Fellowes. The helped diagnose the problem but the only replacement parts they had available is the metal basket. Seriously.Of course, before I threw it out, I took it apart to see exactly what had gone wrong. Stripped gears. Some metal gears looked fine, but I was surprised to see that the main drive gears were plastic. They had completely stripped, so the motor was no longer driving the blades. If this is a part of normal wear, they should have replacement parts. Not very happy that I had to throw away a $150 shredder because of a few dollars in plastic gears.Sorry Fellowes but that is not green and not customer friendly.

When I called Fellowes customer service, they said this unit was notorious for having issues with its sensor and that I shouldn't bother getting another...and then offered to \\"upgrade\\" me to a unit that costs half the price at Amazon.Also, take note: When I called Fellowes customer service, they were (I thought) helpful and sent a replacement...however, at the time I asked them whether I should just go through Amazon, and they discouraged me from doing so...yet now, when I'm stuck with a SECOND useless machine (just over Amazon's 30 days for return), they want me to pay shipping to return the unit in order to get my money back.Moral of the story: Don't get the DS-1.

Been using it for 10 days to catch up on bags full of paper and such. Seems quite sturdy. Has not jammed nor over-heated while I spend c.15 minutes at a time stuffing wads of paper with occasional staples and plastic into it. Love the design: the mesh can is not only sturdy and see-through to watch paper level, but the step-on edge easily allows it to be used as a waste basket without shredding. And just slides in and out -- I like simple.Extra bonus: my Corgi has become a devotee of shredding. She lays by it waiting for next use, and she advidly follows the paper going in the top to the snowfall of confetti into the can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shredder","review":"I've had this shredder for 2 years now and it's an excellent machine.For its size and price I've been very happy with the consistency of it's shredding.Only got jammed once or twice and that was probably more my fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"16 Months to Failure","review":"I purchased this shredder in Jan 2008 and ran it under very light conditions for 16 months. Mostly, it was used to shred bills, paystubs, and the occasional credit card entreaty.Recently, I was shredding a four sheet document when it started to clang and stopped working. Right now, the feeder no longer pushes the paper forward so the shredder no longer functions. Furthermore, it makes an awful racket every time the shredder turns on. Basically, the thing is toast. Extensive oiling has made no difference.Before the shredder failed, I had a few problems. It was easy to overfill the bin, so when you went to remove it, paper shreds went flying everywhere. But overall, it was a good machine -- til it failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Performer","review":"Have used this about a month and had no problems.

Although the motor and blades continued function, the paper sensor failed after one year of low to moderate use; therefore, the motor and blades will no longer activate. When the basket is removed to empty waste, invariably some of the shreds fall behind the basket which prevents the basket sensor from recognizing that the basket is in place. Before the sensor will recognize that the basket has been replaced, you must vacuum the inside of the unit. Since the basket is relatively small and requires frequent emptying, this can be quite inconvenient and time consuming. This model has a great sleek look but functions too poorly to receive a buy recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fellowes DS-1 Cross Cut Shredder","review":"After only 14 months and less than 1000 sheets of paper shredded, my shredder died. There appears to be a basic design fault with Fellowes shredders of this type where the paper trigger breaks and the whole shredder is useless. Perhaps their business model is to get you to buy another shredder every year plus to replace the broken one, but with a cost of over 12 cents per page shredded you have to ask yourself if another company isn't a better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Nothing","review":"I needed an upgrade for an old strip shredder, and ordered the Fellowes DS-1. The first one worked for a week, then quit dead. The manufacturer's customer support told me to trash it, and they would send out a new one; it never worked. Fellowes told me to trash the second one, and sent me a factory reconditioned unit.

I'm going to eat the cost and buy some other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I purchased this shredder for my mom and it died before 6 months was up.

This shredder even looks cheap when you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working within 4 weeks...","review":"Have used (at work & home) several shredders over the years including others made by Fellowes, with only one giving up after years of hard service. The DS-1 arrived a few weeks ago, very nice looking piece. However after using it one day to shred a few multi-sheet mailings (none over the recommended size), it made a horrible noise & hasn't worked since. No way to easily take it apart, but I'm guessing it stripped a gear since the motor runs but spins much faster now but nothing feeds through the shred gate and the cutter blades aren't turning.

It was the thought that if it lasted three years, it was a good shedder. To me, that is the only \\"Pro\\" to this model. It does not take more than 5 sheets well when it says it takes 11. It is VERY NOISY! I cannot run it when management is here and I have a lot of shredding to do. I would say I do a medium amount of shredding and my pile always outlasts the motor's time limit. The basket is very small and fills up VERY quickly, pulling it out to empty is extremely messy as the basked does not fit snuggly and the paper goes behind it no matter how hard you try to keep the basket in tightly. Additionally it is akward to turn over and empty into a bag. For the price there are a lot more machines that take more paper at a time, have much bigger baskets and are not as loud as this one. I would not recommend it for anything more than home use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - so far","review":"Out of the box it works great. I like the upright design. The pull out basket is nice, but it does leave a small mess...but nothing unexpected. It looks good, according to my Wife. I'll update this in a year and document it's performance.

I need to get used to the faster speed, if you feed the paper carelessly, it can bog down the motor. I recomment this unit for home use or small office use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have owned three different shredders. This one is big!

Nothing new is to be found here, and whatever is of any value is better presented in the (at least) equally readable but infinitely more scholarly and sober works of Aldred, Desroches-Noblecourt, and Reeves.

At times it might seem that he is leaving his main subject when he goes off into those areas but it becomes apparent that the background is needed to present why he feels Egypt's most well known (not necessarily greatest) ruler was murdered. A very good case is presented using not just historical and cultural reasons but also recent medical evidence although in the end this may be one of history's possibilities which may never be provable.

Presumably, Aye says to the man, \\"Here's your mace. The pharaoh's bedroom is that way. Hit him in the head -- but only one (1) time.\\"I suspect the phrase \\"...beat his skull into bloody pulp\\" would have been more likely to come up.Sounds more like a hunting accident or fall from a chariot, to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read with lots of info about royal life at the time","review":"A compulsory case, if one accepts the belief that the skull shows evidence of trauma.

Conger is half dressed in all of them but there are no fully nude photographs. The format for the book is small, about 6 inches by 6 inches. All the photographs are black and white.

He tells an intriguing tale of a Indo-European people called the Celts, closely related to the Italians. The Celt set of languages was also closely related to Latin, and the Celt history was one of constant expansion, and forced migration. Ultimately though, this book is flawed, because no one speaks for the Celt except the Celtic enemy. Because the Celts maintained all their governance, history and religion in a spoken language, their culture is essentially lost to us. What remains are Roman accounts of the Celts, and this is a book about Roman campaigns against the Celts.

It is an epic of dread: the fear of the unknown of what lies behind the grave. It is also a story of urgency and hope, that rationality, human cooperation and even love can conquer the darkness that is ready to consume us. The story is simple: a man discovers the exact date and time and horrible means of his death a few days later and there is not a doubt in his mind that he is going to die even as his loved ones and the police try to thwart the efforts of a criminal mind (or is it fate?) It is agonizing to read as we hope somehow that the condemned man will somehow elude his fate. We cheer for the dectectives and yet are appalled by them as single mindedly and doggedly pursue an unknown villian. And not one character is left unscathed at the end of this emotionally draining and ,yes, life-affirming tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great is Thy Faithfulness","review":"I was first introduced to John McDermott on the Irish Tenors DVD.

But Mitterrand's Madame Butterfly has changed all that. The performers in this production are not only great singers but great actors. The director puts an eye and an ear toward a more lyrical and personal rendition of this tragic romantic masterpiece. Mitterrand takes full advantage of the cinema while also making some subtle yet daring changes to the stage version, all to brilliant effect. It seems ironic to me that Madame Butterfly is now my favorite all-time musical. If only all the great operas could be cinematized so well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is a movie version of the opera, performed on a set on location, rather on a stage. It has a few quirks, as other reviewers have noted, but it is beautifully cast, beautifully acted, and beautifully performed. It is refreshing to see Asian singers cast in the Asian roles, even a Eurasian boy! It is also technically superb, in widescreen and with great sound. Overall, a gorgeous production."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long time coming.","review":"This was the first time I experienced an Opera in full. I was fifteen (ten years ago...) and it has stuck with me ever since. It was, for me, the perfect choice for an introduction into this art. Other versions I own can be garish in both sight and sound. This production was melodic and made me into a lover of Opera. Very well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madam Butterfly -- the movie","review":"The film rendition is beautiful, although visibly low budget. It is so difficult to translate the artificial settings of the opera to film, but this production succeeds very well. Cho cho San and Pinkerton are much more convincing in appearance than in most operatic productions, so I will probably be spoiled for any live productions in the future. The extra materials make it clear how their voices are so perfect throughout despite outdoor scenes and lots of wandering. Oh, the wonders of film! Yet, you are never aware of the lip-syncing.My only criticism of this film is in the editing. It was unfortunate that in the interest of dramatic continuity some of the original music was edited out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak soprano","review":"Very disappointed. The soprano was weak, voice lacked any power - esp. striking in the One Fine Day aria. Acting was stoic. I've seen this opera a lot, and this Butterfly didn't get off the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre performance of an excellent opera","review":"First, you should realize that this is not Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly. It is, as the titles say, a Mitterrand movie based on the Puccini opera. Unfortunately, the opera is much better than the movie.As other reviewers have mentioned, the fact that Butterfly's uncle (the priest) floats in the air is silly and detracts from the movie, as does the b&w; pictures during the humming chorus. Also, the interuption of the music for scene changes within the act is distracting - it reminds me of the interuptions on the old 78rpm records of operas.In addition to the problems such as those mentioned above, the singing was only mediocre, so I cannot recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clips of Nagasaki","review":"The voices are passable. Butterfly is no beauty. The dubbing in of scenes in black and white of that era to accompany one of the most beautiful interludes in opera is a sheer disaster.

I'm hoping a new Butterfly will be made without this idiotic dubbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST CIO CIO SAN EVER","review":"Ms. Ying Huang is so dull and old.

The book shows key Roman sites as they are now with an acetate overlay showing how they would have looked when they were built. The author does not indicate his source for these artists' conception of what the Roman buildings looked like; I presume they are based on written description and drawings of similiar Roman buildings, etc.If you are planning a trip to Rome, or have read Roman history and want a feel for what ancient Rome looked like, this is a great book to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable achievement","review":"It is a remarkable achievement to be able to maintain this reader's interest over a series of, so far, six books (Worldwar 1-4 and Colonization 1 & 2). Aside from some minor errors in details--for example, in Worldwar 4 a character who is in the Army worries that a friend of his might be sent to the brig (brig is a navy word;the correct Army term is stockade)--the interplay between aliens and humans, as well as the philosophy of the aliens is very well thought out. Basically, though, the story of alien monsters (bug-eyed, I might add) attacking Earth and being unprepared for human inventiveness has been done many times before, most notably by Eric Frank Russell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colonization: Down to Earth","review":"Do not bother wasting your time on this series. The initial three books related to the interruption of WWII were excellent and deserve a better follow up than the Colonization series. The Colonization series has no action and repeats the same thoughts and ideas of the characters over and over again. They are so boring that I am tempted to never read a Turdledove novel again. Tried to rate it as zero stars but that option was not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme More","review":"I've loved all the books in the series, this being no exception. Harry Turtledove manages to keep it concise. There is no spreading of the story line to unmangeable numbers of characters, no loose ends or distractions for me. There is a very uneasy truce happening between the lizards and the humans. But humans being humans are fractious and unable for the most part to work together. Notable exceptions occur and they make you want to cheer. Turtledove does an excellent job of representing human nature as it is and how it probably would still be in the face of hostile aliens. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Interested....I think","review":"Down To Earth was a good read, but lacking in military action. The cover is misleading in that I don't recall John Kennedy or Nikita Kruschev (and his shoe) even appearing in the story. (I realize that is probably done by the publisher rather than Turtledove)In fact, the whole book was a good read, but not a great/exciting one like the Worldwar series. Although the loose ends at the end of DTE have me ready to read the next book, it needs a lot more military strategy and action.I'm a little afraid Mr. Turtledove is straining to meet possible contract commitments to turn out a certain number of books rather than write the really good SF he is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"From WorldWar to WorldBore.","review":"The series gets very talky and devoid of action. The pluck and ingenuity employed by the humans in the WorldWar series has given way to ex-tough guy Sam Yeager wringing his hands and whining about the planet's would-be subjugators: \\"Lizards are people toooo!\\"Turtledove didn't seem to want to bother with writing out interesting battle scenes this time around, and he lazily skims over the big fight between the Third Reich and the Lizards. His tantalizing introduction of Ayatollah Khomeini in the last book continues to be a dud; apparently his role is little more than a walk-on.Shouldn't characters (JFK and Khrushchev) pictured on the cover of the book actually be mentioned somewhere in the text?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop!","review":"I am a real fan of Turtledove's books, but this series is flawed. Whereas the Worldwar-series was interesting in mixing WW2 with an alien-invasion scenario, the extended Colonisation-series seems to be just a drawn-out afterthought. Quite silly and after some time plainly boring. I stoped reading after 200 pages and I will neither continue nor buy any other book from this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another remarkable installment!","review":"This is the best sci fi series I've read. I marvel at Turtledove's vivid imagination and uncanny ability to characterize the lizards. I get so engrossed in his books that they seem utterly real to me. There are many characters in the book, some not so likeable as others, but I think he does a good job maintaining continuity. As fine as the characterization is, let's not forget this is primarily a work of plot, and the twists and turns do not disappoint. I hated to finish the book, because the wait for the next installment will seem so long. This is one series I hope continues for many more volumes! I'd appreciate any recommendations from other readers who love this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! Another Great Book!","review":"He has done it again! Down To Earth continues the Post World War Saga better than ever. The author's continued development of charcters makes you realize how mankind can adapt and prosper in any situation. I tend to \\"back read\\" DON'T! Let the events unfold as designed! In the past some have challenged the author to include maps with his books. In a way it is good that maps are not included - makes us draw back on our own history and knowledge... and appreciate the lure of the alternate history that Turtledove does so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and exciting","review":"An excellent addition to the worldwar/colonization saga that contionous the stroies of the characters while throwing some twists, opening new insights and ending with a rela big bang ( and I mean real big, read it and weep,weep that the sequal isn't out for another year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary system for increasing sales","review":"Direct, powerful, and easy to implement.Like a lot of great ideas, Schiffman's system seems obvious -- once you've used it for a while.

This hearty addition to sales literature shows you how to be more systematic as you generate prospects and devote your attention to the ones who are most likely to buy. Instead of just playing a numbers game, Schiffman emphasizes ratios, so you can zero in on your best clients while developing new prospects - since only a few leads become sales. The book's charts and examples illustrate its principles, although the quizzes after each chapter seem unnecessary.

I don't know what the reviewers from Boston and Washington thought they would find, but most of us don't live, breathe and eat politics. Nonetheless, we want to understand it and Michele has written a book that helps me understand, as well as inspires me to stay involved. As for the \\"sweeping generalizations\\" crack, isn't that what all books are? Besides, you couldn't have actually read the book if you missed the specific details and specific examples cited to back up the generalizations.

Better luck next time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-popping genre of an American Political future","review":"Ms. Mitchell walks you effortlessly through the seemingly endless tide of statistics and baby \\"booming\\" attitudes. She takes you out of the endless \\"spin\\" cycle by putting you inside the people running politics. She pummels assumed realities of the changing nature of generation-politics; bouncing from Capital Hill to the political evolution and involvement of young Americans; Mitchell convincingly shows the congruence of political thinking of 18-35ers. Her insiders view provides what could be the critical link to ending the political misunderstanding between the US and THEM of now separated political generations. This is a must for an early Xmas gift for your favorite politician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Like Yesterday","review":"If this is the future then I'm selling my stocks.

If the book itself is a standout for our generation, we really will settle for less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the Smoke and Mirrors, Please","review":"I despised this book. I felt it displayed two distinct and unhealthy tendencies: making what used to be called \\"good citizenship\\" seem a major innovation on the part of 18-to-35 year old \\"Gen X-ers,\\" and betraying an almost pathological hatred of older Baby Boomers. (Hey lady, we didn't ask to be born in record numbers!) Along with that goes a prose style that is \\"loopy\\" in both the literal and slang senses of the word: it buzzes round and round topics without really getting into them, and it employs too much slam-bang hyperbole.My advice to the author: CALM DOWN and realize that the metaphors you learned in video production don't automatically transfer to the printed page. You keep telling us and telling us that your generation has plenty to say, and I'm sure it does, but if it says so in print it will have to say so in a linear, sequential fashion.

Uh, doesn't that defeat the purpose of a clip-on book light?Then the light doesn't turn off when I snap it closed, and the batteries go dead within hours.

This book is absolutely dreadful. Unless you are a huge history buff, and I mean huge, this book is a waste of time, money, and energy. Ellis does a horrible job saying what he has to say. It takes him about 50 pages to make a point that can be done in 5. Don't read this book.

Now, I'm no author, much less one who has gotten a Pulitzer prize, but Ellis makes quite a few logical leaps, like a previously stated quote from the last chapter from Thomas Jefferson. I hold very little respect for my IB History of the Americas teacher who assigned this, and much less respect for Mr. Ellis himself.Sorry, but at least I finished it, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow read","review":"This book appears to be written for academia and peers.

I would sit down to read it and get bored 10 minutes later! There is no real structure in the book, which makes it harder to follow and read.The first 10 or so pages are somewhat interesting, but then my eyes start to fall asleep. The chapters are over 40 pages, so you can see why I had a hard time reading this. Also, there is no real action. It just keeps repeating boring history over and over again. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 was because the first 10 pages are decent.After reading it, I can say that I wasted a ton of time reading things I will never remember. I would have been better off going on wikipedia and researching the topics and reading summaries.Overall, DO NOT read this book if you do not have to! SOO DAMN BORING! NO Action! No Excitement! Barely any conspiracy or mystery! Just an all out bad book!Hopefully I helped you! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Overanalysis","review":"The events portrayed in this book were undoubtedly of tantamount importance to the formation of our government by the founders, butI doubt the founders themselves could have slogged through this tedious, overanalytic account of their actions. The author's ability to stretch the story beyond all human endurance to read it and stay interested is phenomenal. I hung on through chapter two, the end of at which point I realized that there are much better history books out there that are worth spending your time on. Read Mccullough's John Adams instead, it's well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great history; very readable","review":"Ellis provides an excellent introduction to the early history of the United States. By examining 6 of the pre-eminent figures in the creation and early leadership of the nation, readers get a feel for who these great minds were as people, rather than as the stuffy \\"founding fathers\\" of typical history books. They are exposed for all their inconsistencies, pettiness, quarrels, rivalries and vanities, making them human - and, to Ellis' credit, no less brilliant. A remarkable book and worthy of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I received my product before it was suppose to be here and it was in great shape. I was also able to track my package."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Founding Brothers Rock!!!","review":"This book contains chapters that describe slices of early American history, and the men involved, beginning with the Burr/Hamilton duel, and ending with the reconciliation of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson at the end of their lives.It's an excellent book and I was sorry when I finished it. The only flaw is that in some cases, particularly the duel, the author seems to beat the subject to death. Despite this, I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in the establishment of our nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"History at it's best","review":"I thought the book was fantastic. The essay regarding the duel between Hamilton and Burr was excellent. It kept me hooked for the rest of the book. Jefferson's behind the scenes manuevering with Madison and the resultant birth of the modern political party was fascinating. It helped me understand the reasons for the acrimony (much of it well deserved) between Jefferson and Adams for all those years. My favorite essay was \\"The Friendship\\" wherein both Jefferson and Adams resume their correspondence and friendships with one another. Adams rather poignantly writes in an earlier letter: \\"You and I ought not to die before We have explained ourselves to each other.\\" This is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in years. I highly recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in the American Revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquitely written and insightfully analyzed","review":"Ellis has done a superb job of analyzing the formation of the United States as a nation. Our founding fathers (and Mother, thank you Abigail) are shown in ways I wish our public schools would acknowledge to our children. They understood the enormity of what they had embarked on...this grand experiment of building a republic of divergent ideologies characterized by self-threatening limitations on centralized power. The magnanimous gestures of Washington, the carefully crafted political compromise, the moral courage, the perceptive foreign policy. If only for statesmen such as these today!Exquisitely written, Ellis has a first-rate novelist's ability to turn a phrase to delight those of us who prefer non-fiction. Highly recommended to all patriots and those whose lack an understanding of our nation's history - nay, our nation's meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I don't mind history rewritten as opinion as long as 1)It's acknowledged at the beginning and 2) it's cleverly written. This misses the mark on both. I had to struggle to make it though and to be honest, I'm not better for it on the other side.Take a pass on this for the most part. However, the section of the Hamilton Duel is well written and it's the only part(aside from a few sections on John and Abigail), that I recommend reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I have developed a fascination with some of the nations great men, and been reading books on them, curious to what makes them 'tick'.

In otherwords, short enough to read in a few days yet comprehensive enough to enable the reader understand that the founding of this country was nothing short of miraculous.I came away with and understanding of three enduring themes from the times. First, George Washington was truely outstanding and without his leadership there would likely be not be a United States today. Second, Thomas Jefferson was the first great politician that understood (although he would deny it) how to win elections (and that it is not always pretty). Finally, that slavery was so devisive that, without the \\"founding brothers\\" decision to sweep the issue under the rug it would have made the union of states impossible from the beginning.Joe"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"This is a great book and very informative for the length.

If you weed out his opinions and all the extraneous detail (like what type of fabric a certain person's petticoat is made of, or how many clouds were in the sky, hell I don't really remember) the book would be about 20 pages of useful information. He dances around the subject like he's trying to be Michael Jackson.This is not a biased review.

This is just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and repetitive","review":"Reading this book is like listening to an irate woman go off on you. The narrative keeps coming back to the same point over and over and over.Here's an example to illustrate what reading this book is like: While introducing an account to the duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, Ellis makes the point that a brief telling of the story would not convey all of its details or historical significance.Note that I just made that point in one sentence.Ellis requires several long, meandering sentences involving an actual example of a hypothetical brief account, merely to announce that he is about to offer a longer account of the duel. What a deplorable lack of compassion for the reader, not to mention a cruel waste of ink and trees. Just get to the point, I say. Also, who does Ellis imagine needs to be told that a short description of an event contains less information than a longer description?"},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"I chose to read this book out of interest in the subject matter.

Fine. I like stars. But. No one has mentioned (at least no one that I can see) how totally and utterly boring this book is. Now, this might be because I have to read it for Honors English, but I don't think it is.Unless you are a major history buff and can handle gems like this: It goes without saying that Alexander Hamilton's understanding of the issues raised by his fiscal program, and the Virginia-writ-large squadrons that were mobilizing south of the Potomac to oppose it, was blissfully free of all the Madisonian ambiguities.\\" And that was the first sentence I opened to.Just be warned, while this book might be good, it's boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Dull, Dreadfully Dull","review":"It's like Monty Python once said.He never uses one succinct sentence when 25 repetitive ones will do.

It's ghastly."},{"rating":"2","title":"They were human, after all!","review":"The study of American history constantly surprises me. Just when I think that I know enough about a certain period of our country's history, along comes a book that gives me a whole new perspective on it. This is one of those books. Like most Americans, I assumed that I had a pretty solid grasp on the \\"Founding Fathers\\" of the Revolution, but apparently I was wrong. Reading this work gave me a new appreciation of the innate political shrewdness of George Washington, the probity and sagacity of John Adams, and the inner contradictions of the mind of Thomas Jefferson. I grasped more fully the leading role Alexander Hamilton played in the 1790s, and received a much more moderate view of the character of Aaron Burr. This is an excellent work, and one which may be used as a standard against which future histories of the post-revolutionary period may be judged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I dont quite understand why anyone is buying this book. Lets completely forget about the fact that Joseph Ellis is going down in history as the guy who lied in a Pulitzer Prize winning book. (American Sphinx). He didnt have to embellish in it, the book was good without the lies. But lets forget that.This book is just left-over pieces that didnt make the cut into American Sphinx. Its the stories that were interesting, but dont really matter all that much and dont contribute to anyones understanding of history.This book was designed to make money only. It was put out quickly to catch the high tide of an american history movement. This book gets a zero rating from me. Ive read biographies on many of the historical figures of revolutionary America. This one was a waste. I suggest the recent John Adams, The Duel (hamiliton and burr), Washington - the indispensable man, and American Sphinx to get a) much better and more engaging writing and b) good history.PS. this is my first review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but concise","review":"This book attempts to cover the most notable / historic highlights our founding fathers. It is a good short read but lacks any substabtial details about America's founders. The book is notably mis-labeled, they were not founding \\"brothers\\", they hated each other! Can you imagine Dick Cheney or Al Gore dueling to the death over proposed Tax increases? I think not! The founders are far from the perfect icons and images we have of them today on our currency and the marble statues we see.

I was extremely disappointed. Ellis is an awful writer. He uses the same words and phrases over and over making the book even more tedious and boring. He never stays on topic adn manages to take every interesting point in the book and drag it out to the point that any interest he manages to spark is gone.Although the book does cover the \\"founding brothers\\" well it's just written poorly. Honestly i did learn things but im sure if I picked up another book out there covering similiar material, it would be presented in a more interesting and less rambling way. Anything would be better than this book. It took me an entire weekend just to get through one of the chapters, the book is that tedious.I dont suggest this book at all unless you are extremely interested in the topic and can manage to get over the horrible way it is written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much...","review":"Good work overall by the author but may be too much for the casual reader. It is quite evident that the author is a college professor by the lengthy prose and obvious insertion of the biggest and most complex word selections.

RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Founding Brothers","review":"When I was in Junior and Senior High School over 60 years ago we did not have only one specific history text book for each class because the teachers taught \\"History, as written, depends on the bias of the writer.\\".

We knew they were smart... We knew they were bold... But who knew they were so much fun?This book IS fun. Especially, if you're like me, and don't read history books for entertainment. Nothing brings history to life better than knowing who hated who, who was known for being a womanizer, who was a whiner, and who was a two-faced friend. And yet, with all these faults, Ellis never judges his subjects.I'd recommend this book for younger folks. I think this would be great for kids going into college who need an interesting refresher. Or for parents who want to make history more fun to discuss with their kids. It's not simplistic, but you don't have to know the members of Virginia's House of Burgesses to apprecaiate the info here.Decent buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book!","review":"it was a very annoying and boring book not worth my money or time! wouldn't recommend it to any one"},{"rating":"1","title":"I absolutly hated this book.","review":"This book came to me in outstanding condition but it was an awful read and I would have nevered paid what I did if I knew how awful the book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Revisionist History","review":"Ellis continues his attempt at reviling Thomas Jefferson (why??) along the lines of his Sphinx.

The authors writing style in the beginning of the book was horrible, in my opinion. It was too painful to continue so I quit. From the ratings, most seem to disagree with me.

It's really 6 mini-biographies with a unifying introduction. The result is, not only do you learn something about each fascinating individual, you also learn a great deal (as a by-product) about the fragile formation of our country. You also get an insight into why we are the country that we are today! Although it is evident that the author is an authority and has thoroughly researched the subject, the book is not heavy-handed academics! A pleasure to read and should be required high school material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A revealing title","review":"If you want to gain an understanding of the uncertainties surrounding the revolutionary generation as well as the relationships between and among the aptly titled founding brothers, you simply must read this book. The title is revealing because it because it foreshadows what I see as the major theme of the book. That is that these men were and are not some distant, sometimes foreboding fathers. They were young men with all the passions which were often virtues and also often faults. But it was first their devotion to a common cause that allowed them to all hang together rather than separately, to paraphrase Ben Franklin; and second their passion for the republic they created that allowed them to continue to hang together despite their political and personal differences. They were brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"This guy's writing style is horrible. He delibrately uses large words in order to make himself sound smart. I hate that. This man has made this part of history even more boring than it already is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hash job","review":"Ellis makes it clear from the start where his sympathies lie with the Revolutionary generation and he ambushes us with Abigail Adams for good measure. Of the six stories, only The Silence is revealing for Ellis' feeble attempt to portray the slavery debate as a South-against-South issue. He lavishes attention on a hillbilly from Georgia simply to whitewash a Virginian like Jefferson, who in fact held the same, if not worse, attitudes about his slaves (all conveniently ignored by Ellis). Hamilton was the closest as any of these founding brothers came to believing that blacks and whites were equal and his financial system doomed slavery in a way Adams and his fine rhetoric could never hope to, but he barely rates a mention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, unimaginably boring","review":"I dont know about you, but i had to read this for Honors History and I have never read a book so boring and uninteresting. This book i thought made no sense, and i had to force myself to read it. Dont read Founding Brothers and if you have to go online and find a summary for it. Really save yourself from the pain. I know some people may love this book, but usually you have to read it for school or something. This book doesnt appeal to the younger generation, like me. Therefore, i found it to be one of the worst books i have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"I had to read this book for high school (Economics, Legal Systems and Politics class), and let me tell you, this is the first book I've ever tried to read that I haven't been able to. It is impossible to read, and you'll find yourself falling asleep after every three sentences.

Ellis got us thinking about our origins. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Founding Fathers","review":"Great ideas in the book. At times it gets a little boring, but parts of it are wonderful. It is easy to see why it won the Pulizer, because it sheds new light on the difficult time after the 1787 Constitutional convention. We assume that everything was in place after the Convention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I only read after starting this book that Ellis lied about having served in Vietnam. But just from the tone of the book, I'm not surprised he lied about having been in combat. The tone of the book is so POMPOUS and PRETENTIOUS and AFFECTED and the writing so FLORID. Ellis is obviously a showboat. If he's so grand in his writing, I can see how he would be grand as a person, to the point of lying about military service to puff his image up. That this book won the Pulitzer Prize is nauseating. Michael Chabon's novel \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\\" won the Pultizer Prize for best novel, and it's a pompous, pretentious, affected, contrived, florid piece of gooey pap. The Pulitzer judges must love phonines and contrived writing. I think I'll steer clear of the books they vote for from here on out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Founding Brothers","review":"A wonderful insight into a few of the key men (and one woman) who banded together to form the nation, then provided the leadership to make it work. Learned a lot, gained perspective and depth of knowledge about the individuals and events and am impressed with Ellis' diserning wisdom about the umbilical cord that links the birth with present politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to introduce you to the era","review":"Ellis does a nice job on this one. Yes, he is a bit wordy, and you definately come away from this book with his strong opinions, but this book does a very nice job of introducing you to the revolutionary era. It is by no means comprehensive, and I don't think Ellis meant for it to be. But if you want to learn about the key personalities of the era, and use that as a starting point for learning more about these people, then this is a great way to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Book Report","review":"I needed to get a book(from a selected list) to read and write a report for a class. I didn't want to spend that much money and buy a brand new book from the book store, so I looked on here to see if I could find one. When I recieved it, I was expecting it to be maybe a little torn up and ratty. But I was pleasently suprised that it looked brand new...and it was like half the price than one at a book store! So I will definatley use Amazon again for when I need to purchase books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffocating","review":"While filled with interesting details, and factual opinions, Founding Brothers was a difficult read. Keep a Dictionary by you for this book! While descriptive (what some may call \\"big\\" words) are always a good idea, when strung together in a sentence that turns out to be the entire paragraph, and with little use of punctuation, they can be very hard to understand! Ellis definitely does not get an \\"A\\" for composition, but as far as content, he did a lot of research, and a good job overall. I definitely recommend it to U.S. history buffs who just can't get enough about the founders of this country. On the other hand, if you're looking for an interesting read, but don't want to have to read every sentence 20 times before you understand, I suggest trying a different book. It got 2 stars because of the difficulty encountered in reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good points, yet it bored me to tears...","review":"on average, i read about 12 pages per hour...which isnt very good for me because i am normally a very fast reader. the preface was a very horrile opening to the book because it wasnt interesting enough to excite the reader, even if they are very interested in this subject, like myself. once i got to the main chapters, i was a little more hopeful to read about some of the events that may have went on during our countries early beginning. i found that the author made very interesting points, yet his writing style was very tedious and extrememly hard to follow. he used run on sentences, repeated phrases,and got off topic. i must have read over the same sentences at least 4 times. in addition, i thought he over-analyzed some things. yet, if you are a historian who is very interested in this topic, then i would recommend it, otherwise, spare your self the time and effort that it takes to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"detailed account of our Founding Fathers","review":"I thought this was a great book. It gives the reader a detailed account of the tender care that the Founding Fathers showed for the new and immature country. This care was vital to the survival of the Country. The chapter entitled the Duel is the most interesting chapter in the book but although each chapter may go a little too long they are all worth reading. Much significance is put into the relationships of the founding fathers, especially Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and James Madison. Anyone interested in reading a detailed account of the birth of our country should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for someone with an interest in US history","review":"This book really opened my eyes to chapters in American history that I had long ago forgotten. It really brings some of the revolutionary era Americans to life. I particularly enjoyed the stories of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.This book is broken down into approximately eight different chapters, each one devoted to a particular aspect of the life of one of the revolutionary brothers.This book is a great book for someone who has an interest in American history or American politics but doesn't have the time or interest to invest on one of the larger books on the market. It really brings the revolutionary era to life. I gave my copy to a friend who still talks about how great it is. I bought another copy for my father for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"if only History books in school were like tihs","review":"An excellent history book - one that makes the men of the American Revolution come alive. History, in its truest and best form, is not merely about names, dates and events, but about the people behind the events. The Why's of history are best answered and understood when understanding the Who's that were behind the events. It not only gives us the best picture of history, but certainly the most interesting.Ellis's work on Washington was most poignant for me, opening up the stoic figure a bit more than I had ever experienced. Jefferson and Adams are brought alive as well, with the ebbs and tides of their lives and relationships brought before us as if they were just a few cousins away from our own family.If you love history, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"In-depth view of six historical events","review":"Through extensive research of personal letters and other accounts, Joseph Ellis has proven himself as one of the leading authorities of America's \\"Founding Fathers\\". Founding Brothers is written in an extraordinary way, and his comprehension of these historical events sometimes escapes my own feeble comprehension. Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A difficult read, but rewarding if you can manage through it","review":"Ellis's book Founding Brothers is by no means an easy read. The language is sophisticated and his style of writing is very unique, almost poetic. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of the well known revolutionaries, this book is amazing. The author elaborately describes a few key events in the U.S.'s history to thoroughly explain the whole era. If you can get through the long strings of difficult vocabulary and sometimes confusing metaphors, I would highly recommend this book for a greater account of the events that made our country what it is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Founding Brothers","review":"I have recently joined a book club at work. We decided to read fiction one month, non-fiction another month. Our first non-fiction was Founding Brothers. Most of us did not make it through the book. Those of us that did plow through it felt it was interesting, but the writing was more \\"text book\\", making it a difficult read. We were all amazed at what we learned about history (different than what we learned in school). I would repeat what another review said in that this is a book for those sincerely interested in history, and perhaps with a little more background than a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening stories about our founding fathers","review":"I found the book to be a great way to gain insight into our founding fathers. Instead of just relating facts about their deeds Ellis tells short stories which give us a background on these men.The reader learns what lead up to the Hamilton-Burr duel and why Jefferson and Adams went from friends to enemies and back to friends. His backgrounds on these characters lead me to a better understanding of all the founding fathers. This book is a worthwhile read and I recommend it to anyone who has interest in these men."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy to read book--engaging history","review":"This book is a treat for historians, history buffs, and people looking for light reading alike. I'm sure you may have heard some of the controversey surrounding Joe Ellis' false claims of service in Vietnam. Despite this deception, his work in this book is beyond reproach. Do not be discouraged by anything you might have heard, this is an accurate and engaging piece of historical commentary. The stories are rarely discussed, yet so important to American History. Ellis' analysis of the personalities of the American Founding Brothers are so interesting and insightful, you'll be enchanted from page one. My favorite chapter is the first, which discusses the fateful duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. It is a must read, even if your not a history buff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Founding Fathers","review":"Joseph Ellis has done a remarkable job at the condensing of, and granting expression to, the seven most influential men of the 1790's. The last two chapters, concerning largely the Adams Jefferson relationship are the strongest points of the book from two standpoints; granting life to the two icons, and excellent sholarly research. It's ease of reading allows the reader to gain insights into the personalities, and their corresponding idealogies, that shaped the emerging American ethic. This is a good combination of philosophical underpinnings, and humanity, that benefit anyone concerned with this critical period of American History. Thank you Mr. Ellis"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for busy people who want to know more about the US founding fathers","review":"I always wished to learn more about the history of America but did't have time to read the thick biographies. This book by Ellis is only 250 pages and covers the period of 1790-1800, the critical period shortly that followed the 1776 revolution. You will learn about Washington, Madison, Jefferson, Adams, Hamilton etc, all the major leaguers during the revolution. I enjoyed the part about the conflict between the Hamilton Federalists vs the Jefferson democrats.While I dont' know much about this topic, the author provided enough background and reasoning for any laymen to understand and enjoy the book.

There is no space left next to the computer for the charger in the bag, however there is plenty of other places to keep it. There is plenty of padding, and the divider can be placed between the the computer and the side for extra padding on one side if you have a 17-inch computer.

Many thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"The low point of Chaplin's career. His never-ending quest to be taken seriously led him to load his films with what he thought was SIGNIFICANCE. He thought that by making lots of badly written speeches he could make a serious statement about mankind's inhumanity.Sorry, Charlie. It takes a little more than mere speechifying. And if that wasn't bad enough, he is so busy working on the SIGNIFICANCE of the story that he forgets little things like character, plot, and even comedy. This is one of the least funny films ever made. The attempts at black humor remain attempts, as none of them ever gets off the ground.All in all, a travesty. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaplin Classic Deserves a Better DVD","review":"Warner must have fell asleep at the wheel with its DVD reissue of Charlie Chaplin's \\"Monsieur Verdoux.\\" The \\"remastered\\" print is dark, murky and virtually unwatchable.

This DVD should be taken off the market until Warner gets its act together."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are all Monsieur Verdoux","review":"This is one of Charlie Chaplin's masterpieces. He has all the silent movie gags in this dark comedy. I found myself sympathizing with Monsieur Verdoux because he is doing this for his family. The ends justify the means...... After all, we are all Helocks, aren't we? Americans claim to live in a \\"Christian\\" Nation and yet we start wars all over the world and justify it in our own minds. Wars for profit and for corporations: It's the American way. We are all hypocrites to each other and to ourselves. Charlie Chaplin's message is clear:\\"One murder, a villain, Million (murders), a hero.\\" But, do you have the guts to admit it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious, touching black comedy","review":"After the first few disappointing and poorly played minutes, the movie launches into a delicious as well as touching black comedy. Chaplin's character, Verdoux, is quite distinct from his Tramp character (except in one relatively brief sequence where Verdoux reacts in a stereotypically Tramp fashion) and the insights we gain into this new character as the story progresses lend unexpected depth to the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well illustrated and organized,easy to follow.","review":"Illustrations are excellent.Pages setup with easy to find info.and easy to understand text.I liked the short histories in forward.The only thing I didn't like were the amount of Herbs illustrated.

It is soooo much fun! And it's pretty darn easy too! Playing Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann is the best! They're the best fighters! But overall, Jack rocks! The special effects and the fighting in this game is over the top! It's awesome. It makes you feel like your in the game! What this game is about is that when Jack and Will are being hung for the mischeif and Jack explains what all happened in the first film (from his perspective). In this game, you can play solo or co-op (both ways are great). And when playing (both solo and co-op) there's always two people in the level with you. The combinations are either usually: Jack Sparrow & Will Turner or Jack Sparrow & Elizabeth Swann. I think Jack's pretty much in every awesome level!

The Ian Gillan Band and subsequent incarnations would turn out to be a far more interesting proposition than Deep Purple in so many ways, but Gillan just never found the same success and eventually returned to Purple.As for Amazon's listing above - the correct album track listing should be:1) Lay Me Down2) You Make Me Feel So Good3) Shame4) My Baby Loves Me5) Down The Road6) Child in Time7) Let It SlideDon't be misled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whassup???!!!","review":"What is wrong with Joan Wolf???

My guess is that it's a 1 to 5 ratio of fragrance to alcohol (at most).I have trusted in Amazon for a very long time and I have never questioned the quality of their products. So much so, that even though I read the numerous reviews that this product was a fake, I thought \\"no way - not Amazon\\", and ordered anyway.

It was terrible to find out that I had been duped. She knows her perfume & was able to show me several ways to see that this is a fake (only after I asked). One easy to see discrepancy between this product & the real thing is: if you look at the packaging in the lower left corner it says, \\"90ml e\\". the real perfume bottle should read, \\"e 90ml.\\" And it isn't just the packaging that is off with this product. The scent smells like Bright Crystal mixed with rubbing alcohol. Even I could smell the alcohol. So, if you are looking for a cheap imitation, this is it.

WILL NOT RECOMMEND, WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN, WILL TRY TO RETURN to vendor!Stick to the delicious Versense by Versace, J'adore by Dior, Romance by Ralph Lauren and the classic yet still wonderful First by Van Cleef & Arpels...New scents I'd recommend are the new Bulgari blue and the surprinsingly soft \\"New Tressor\\" by Lancome."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT REAL. just pay the full price at macy's","review":"BUMMED.I rarely buy perfume, it's a treat. i tried to save money, and I suffered for it. you cannot return perfume to Amazon.

Anyway, one of MY all-time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOrth it for the first track alone","review":"An interesting mix of a variety of styles. The first track is a riff heavy hard rock number, and the second is sort of a power ballad (I guess). After that the disc becomes more bluesy/countryish/lighthearted for a few songs, finally switching back to a more rock oriented number or two. The guitar and especially the singing (James Dio) really stand out. If you are a fan of modern hard rock/metal you *do* want to check out this classic group."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent post-Soviet film about post-Soviet Russia","review":"'Brother' isn't the best film about the Chechen war, but it is a good reflection of post-Soviet Russia. Danila, young, geeky-looking but street-smart military clerk is sent home after getting into trouble. He hears from his mother that his elder brother, Viktor in St. Petersburg, is doing well in business. Danila joins him and finds out that Viktor is in fact, a contract-killer. Soon Danila joins him in the trade and is drawn to the underworld... soon killing becomes natural to him... it's a simple plot, but shows the sad reality of post-Soviet Russia...Sergei Bodrov, the beloved young Russian actor (who sadly passed away in an accident) carries Danila's role out well. The music, mostly by Nautilus Pompilius, brings out the mood in the film.The sequel, Brother-2, is more entertaining, but much less realistic. There is plenty of nationalism and anti-Americanism there, but still worth to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"True or False","review":"While I have not seen any Duke Nukems rampaging through the streets of my town I can tell you this movie barely touches the surface.This movie's low budget means that the reality is not shaded by sfx.

Once you watched this, watch Brat 2 - better than any Die Hard I can tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional and different movie","review":"If you own any two russian movies, they need to be Brother and The Thief. Brother brings a unique feel that you cannot get from an American film. Even if you don't speak russian, you should more than enjoy the movie through subtitles. I highly reccommend it for all peoples of all countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest example of russian film I've ever seen","review":"Unlike the rest of the population, I found this movie to be nothing of what the reviews said it would be: Simplistic and underdeveloped plot, little to no character development (partly the script's fault, partly bad acting), and very little (and even that is very superficial) commentary on Russian society. The only redeeming value is given by the contrast of two supporting characters' impact on the main character. I've seen a good deal of modern Russian film, and this one is just a passing craze and should be viewed as such. If you want to watch really good Russian film, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dostoyevskian","review":"One of the most popular Russian films of recent years, Brother is now out on DVD in an official release with English subtitles. And these help, because Danila, the Dostoyevskian protagonist searching for fulfillment in post-Soviet Petersburg, has a tendency to mumble. Wonderfully acted, with a brooding mood worthy of St. Petersburg, this is a very entertaining, if violent, gangster film.

There he meets all sorts of people. He makes friends with a homeless German, with a female drugee, and he makes love to a married woman, who not only becomes his misterss, but whose husband also abuses her. He also likes music a lot too. See there's some redeming qualities right there!Well anways back to his brother, his brother isn't so innocent. His brother hires him to kill a Chechnian warlord for him. Well sooner or later, he kills mercifulessly the people sent by the Chechnian warlord.

Sergei Bodrov Jr. plays the part of a soldier returning from National Service (was is a boring office job or something somewhat more sinister).He seeks his elder brother only to find him enmeshed in a life of crime and murder. Our hero turns on a tough guy performance 'par excellence'. Balabanov's direction is taut and memorable. I particularly liked the 'fade to black' between sequences over the sudden 'quick as a blink' style so popular.This is not a film for the squeamish despite the absence of the vile graphic depictions in American films of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know what you are paying for","review":"Technical: 5 starsFor Russians: encoding is fineFor others: Did you really buy it?

The variations are also on an rare old recording by a Portuguese orchestra transfered to CD years ago, also a classic if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"This is the first time I bought a disc without ever hearing the music; doing so solely on the basis of reviews that I read here at Amazon. Well, I must thank all of the previous reviewers...the piece simply blew me away!It is thoughtful, expansive, joyous, and simply beautiful. I will say, however, that if your taste runs only to Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, and Beethoven...that perhaps you will not be that enthusiastic about this symphony.

Well, she sounds like she's got writer's block on this album.Not much else to say except a warning - never buy an album where more time, money and effort has gone into the artist's clothes, makeup and photography than the actual music on the disc.

Such as \\"Diary\\" for the most part it was a great 15 songs but 1 or 2 were'nt exactly the greatest but overall i would give this a 9 out of 10. 4 stars!

Songs like \\"Diary\\", \\"Dragon Days\\", and \\"If I Was Your Woman\\" are some of the albums gems. While songs like \\"You Don't Know My Name\\", and \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" will join tracks from her last album like \\"Fallen\\", as a staple of her unique sound. The more she matures, ventures out into different things, she will quickly develope a style, where music fans can say \\"That's Alicia\\"!My gripe are with the first three full tracks.

How dare anyone state that alica is \\"a complete fabrication of her label\\". We'll just put it like this.. I personally know that she is no other working than her own.. she writes and sings and also produces the music that blesses the airwaves in this era of death. Music is still hanging in there and no one has yet to pull the plug. Ms. Keys is one of the few still breathing life into this sorry industry today. Im sure that those who rate this as garbage are lost, because this CD is the farthest from garbage ive heard since her first release. Being a diverse fan but a huge R&B... she's exactly what is needed. Clothes, a voice and talent.

With Mellow tracks like Diary and Slow Down her true skills really shines .Overall it a pretty good cd though not one to run out and grab but USED.This cd does not break new ground for her thought.Maybe next time"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than the last album!","review":"I couldn't understand the hype when I first her first album, but this release certainly shows that she has grown. I must say her remake of \\"If I Was Your Woman\\" is my least favorite track, simply because I believe if you choose to cover a classic, you need to be able to improve it, and this is not an improvement.

I really like this cd. However, I only listen from track 5 (skip a song or two) to the very end of track 15. Tracks 1-4 have yet to grow on me.

It's very pop, more commercial, much less soulful, and the piano doesn't feature in the gorgeous way it did before.It seems a lot like the Tracy Chapman Syndrome to me...first great album by a down-to-earth, struggling, for-real artist expressing raw emotion, desires and needs...followed by average second album by a well-off, comfortable person who no longer has much to say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I fell in love with Keyes' voice when I first heard \\"Fallin'\\" and immediately bought her first CD. I enjoyed some of the music from it, and felt she showed enormous potential. This second CD is a real disappointment. The songs all have very similar themes: Songs in A Minor had much more variety. She needs to use her tremendous voice and talent to expand past the hum-drum, run-of -the-mill background beats and music. I really feel that she is settling for the sound or style of a mediocre singer and songwriter, when she could be so much more. She seems almost to ignore her classy, intelligent side, afraid to leave the comfort of her \\"street\\" attitude. I'd love to see her combine both. \\"Fallin'\\", I hope, won't be her only glorious hit. Here's hoping her next CD is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE HYPE","review":"I WAS NEVER REALLY A BIG ALICIA KEYS FAN, BUT I DO ENJOY SOME OF HER MUSIC.

After listening to it for a couple of days, we asked each other what we thought of our recent purchase...and we responded almost in unison...I'm not feeling it.If this was a first run movie, I would say wait for the video, or better yet, wait for it to premiere on network television."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is aight","review":"Compared to her first album and all the time off that Alicia took to be able to sit back and watch these bubble gum, naked girls with no vocal skills...well let's just say I have been waiting and hoping this album would blow them out of the water! You Don't Know My Name got me like whoa!!!!!!!!!!!!! & kept in anticipation for the other songs. When listening to this album I was not really impressed. Slow Down & When U Really Love Someone are a couple of songs that people might be like that is nice. If you are a fan just due to Alicia's piano skills just know that everything she plays on this album is sampled (not original) and the beats sound the same as her last album.

On the Karma track she is a dead ringer for JLo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring listen","review":"I thought this CD would be great after reading these reviews, but it's just your standard run-of-the-mill stuff. Nothing great. Her voice sounds strained on some songs, and her piano playing is very, very basic for such an \\"accomplished\\" musician. I can't say I understand the hype here.Many of these songs sound like a reworking of her previous tunes. I'm going to either exchange this CD or get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Review: Alicia Keys - Diary","review":"This album is bomb. Alicia has completely raised the bar for black women artists... actually all artists. She has garnered so much attention for herself and her music without ever over-exposing herself. The album is a true artistic masterpiece, yet it maintains that pop appeal. She has been getting great reviews everywhere I have looked, and I just saw today that Hitcooper.com chose her as their new artist pick, which is huge for Alicia. I would have to say my favorite song on the album is #6 - if i aint got you... but seriously the whole album is bomb. I really hope the record labels see that us listeners want more artists like Alicia, and less of the artists who can't even write their own songs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My future babymama","review":"This cd is very good and definitely worth purchasing. All the songs are nice, but my favorite has to be #7(DIARY). This is definitely a cd for \\"grown people\\". If you like REAL music then this is the cd for you. If you're in to that pop crap where half of the artists can't sing then go buy Britney's s***."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Soulful","review":"Now this cd makes sense. It is soooo soulful. Better than her first. Despite the haters, her singing is much better and the music is great (most of it reminds me of growing up in the 70's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE","review":"Diary of Alicia Keys was disappointing and waste of my money. I expected so much after listening to her single, \\"You Don't Know My Name\\". I was thinking that Alicia was going to set it off and really bring it. I thought the first CD,Songs in A Minor, was an OK CD, but did not live up to the hype. I think she is talented. Don't get me wrong, but on this cd she seems to be rambling and out of artistic steam. It seems as though she is trying to \\"be\\" so many things (neo-soulster, 70's soulster, and classical). She managed to pull it off on the first CD, but on The Diary, it doesn't seem natural. It's forced. She gets a gold star for \\"You Don't Know My Name\\". Maybe those that buy into the hype, and are not interesting in musical depth will enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums..EVER!","review":"I thought Alicia's first album,Songs in a Minor, was okay but I was BLOWN AWAY by her second album! Alicia added AMAZING uptempo numbers like Karma and Heartburn(which I felt should have been a single). Alicia's writing is good, but even better is the way she crafts her melodies. Every song is unique and memorable. My personal favorites were \\"Karma\\", \\"Heartburn\\",\\"Dragon Days\\", and \\"So Simple\\". \\"Nobody, Not Really\\" was an amazing interlude that I feel should have been a full song! Give this CD a listen because she has matured for the better since Songs in a Minor."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE","review":"Some dude gave her a 1 star review and called Alicia a sucka...he needs to get a dictionary or something...pass the 2nd grade...have your own opinion, but back it up.Diary is a pretty good CD...I don't listen to a lot of RnB, mostly just hip hop, but Alicia Keys stands out to all the Ciaras, Beyonces and Ashantis out there. Music-wise and personality wise. Her voice tops all those other artists with their synthesized voices and boring repetative club beats. She actually has musical talent other than singing (piano, duh)anyway, go out and get this album if you want a taste of real un-synthesized RnB"},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Star Only for the If I Ain't Got You Remix","review":"The If I Ain't Got You Remix where there is a jamming session on the Piano and some bass in the backround is the only good song to come from Alicia Keys since she hit the music scene. Seriously, what a horrible collection of music she has made. Boring \\"artsy\\" songs that could never qualify as REAL art. I would buy this CD just for that one remix, however, amazon didn't put track samples on this page and I don't know if that remix is on here... Even then probably I am not gonna pay the outrageous lowest price of $9 (at the time of this review) for just that 1 track. Can anyone who knows the version I'm talking about help me find that song Plz?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keys = A +","review":"The only thing I have to say is that this album is awesome. I can't stop listening to it. The album is good from beginning to end. From \\"Harlem's Nocture\\" to \\"Nobody Not Really\\", this album is hot. The bonus cd is a great addition as well. If you don't pick up this album, you will be missing out on something special. God Bless Alicia Keys!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SOULFUL","review":"This album is a soulful melody that just have me jamming from beginning to end and back again to the beginning. She has an old soul. My favorites now is her remake to \\"If I was your woman\\", \\"Diary\\", \\"Dragon Days\\", and of course \\"You don't know my name\\". She came back and let people know that she's not going to give it to us once. She hit it hard. I definitely recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as her debut but still worth it!","review":"I loved alicia keys'e first offering and predictably her second offering wasn't going to be as good.BUT don't fret for it is still a good album.More chilled out then her debut it's more slow jam oriented with more classical tones(particularly on 'karma')so some myabe dissapointed if they are looking for stunners like 'fallin' or 'a woman's worth'.Overall the best track is her new single 'you don't know my name' but there are also gems to be found in 'karma','if i was your woman','if i ain't got you','so simple'(very catchy babyish vocals)and 'slow down' with it's beautiful cascading bridges.I would recommend anyone 2buy this record.it's very nice 2listen to while chillin out and what goes without saying is ms.keys is an amazing artist with an amazing talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A home run!","review":"This is my first Alicia Keys CD and I have to say she hit a home run on this one. This CD is extremely soulful which I LOVE and I appreciate her freshness and I love her sound...she's very talented. There is a nice vibe about this CD that makes you just want to groove to it. I saw Alicia on an interview and I just love her attitude. She had some great things to say about life in general and I love how she carries herslf as a mature young lady...she's so young with on old soul. Alicia is a TRUE R&B artist and I look forward to hearing more great music from this soulful lady in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD","review":"This CD is fabulous, I love it from start to finish. I cannot recommend enough for the R&B lovers out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She May Have Experimented, But She Still Has It! Definately","review":"\\"The Diary Of Alicia Keyes\\" is a way of descriping her through her songs. I thought her first multi-platinum album did that, but this does too! I like Alicia Keyes cause she expresses herself, and doesn't sell records by acting like a pig/sleez!This is a great ablum and though she experimented, it did what she wanted it to do, tell her story through her music!The bonus DVD is also a great look into her. I love the album & the DVD. I think her next single should be \\"So Simple\\" or \\"Karma\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Girl Can Sing!!","review":"If you love Alicia Keys then this CD is for you! Every song that Mrs. Keys sings is amazing. She expresses herself through her music and uses her wonderful talent to do so. Her music is the best out there. This CD is really worth your $!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This is basically a weak rehash of Alicia's superior debut album. Several intros sound like intros on the first album and what the album is lacking is strong melodies! A great voice and talented piano player she is, but her songwriting skills leave to be desired. And lose the cheapo drum sounds and use a real drummer next time, please!There are no stand out tracks apart from You Don't know My Name, so I doubt the album will yield as many hits as the first one did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alicia's Diary a Magnificent Masterpiece","review":"Despite the transparent reviews from the \\"I'm too cool to like a popular artist, especially a beautiful one\\" crowd, this album is worthy of all the rave reviews and high praise. It's obvious that Ms.Keys took the time to make a meaningful album, sales be damned. If you want to find the one diamond among the rough, of all the albums out there today, pick up The Diary of Alicia Keys. Pure soul, pure heart, pure thought provoking lyrics that reach out to the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"She did it Again!","review":"i just want to say, the diary of alicia keys is off the hook. i recommend it 100%. the song \\"diary\\" featuring tony toni tone is one of the best songs along with the rest of course. it was vocally presented so well. also, the remake of \\"walk on by\\" is a great song. i also love the track \\"if i aint got you\\" its hot. the whole album is bananas, everyone should go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"go alicia!!","review":"now I don't have to be what some call \\"alicia worshipper\\" to say that I truly enjoyed this album from start to finish. Alicia showcased her talent for singing, songwriting and piano on this album much more so than she did on Songs in A Minor. She won 5 grammys for that album and I wasn't sure if she would get the grammys she deserved for this beautiful effort, but she did last night and deserved it!!!

DON'T GET ME WRONG THIS IS A TALENTED ARTIST, TOO BAD THEY DON'T LET IT BE KNOWN THROUGH HER REMAKES AND HER SLIGHT PIANO MELODIES AND RIFFS THAT SHE PLAYS OVER SAMPLE AFTER SAMPLE.

The CD got a great review in People magazine, and I rushed to buy it just to find out that it was an \\"average\\" work of art. Even a touch below average.

Message to the world: try listening to an album without watching the video first, you might not really like her music that much.Oh, one more thing: why in the world does she braid her hair in such irratic cornrows? You'd think she'd figure out how to cut a straight hedge. Oops, I forgot, she's more worried about her acne!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"um....how bout no?","review":"i guess i heard a completely different version of this cd from the reviews these other folk are giving it. this mess was ridiculously bad. i really like alicia and i think she's really talented. her singles are great, but her cds sound like they were thrown together by a 12 year old in a garage. come on now, there are only three songs on the cd that i can actually bear to listen to, and they are, \\"you dont know...\\" (obviously, that song it just too perfect), \\"if i aint got you\\", and that secrets one is pretty nice. otherwise, it's garbage.

Her first cd was much better, in my opinion. I am not even a fan of A.

I hate I wasted my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty Attitude","review":"The girl has a rude & condescending attitude. She thinks she is all that cause she can stroke a few keys.

I liked the first album better. I hate Alicia Keys, she aint' sexy she just got beauty to her face and all of her music videos are boring she never dances or anything. Beyonce' is a real artist and won 6 grammy's she is also hottttt in every way. Beyonce' isn't boring either.All alicia keys does is play the stupid piano.Beyonce' is just better than alicia."},{"rating":"2","title":"When I thought it couldn't possibly get any better...","review":"I, like several million other people worldwide, had the pleasure of partaking of Songs in A Minor. It was great. It was original. It's a classic. So when I purchased Diary of Alicia Keys the day it came out I knew it would be good. But I didn't know of the extent. This entire cd is THE BOMB. Every single song is amazing. If you don't get this cd you are missing out on some of the best music of the year and probably the year to come. You can't hate on pure talent. Alicia's voice is even better on this cd. It's fuller and you hear her effortlessly hitting notes we haven't heard her hit. GO GET IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"This is a very good record. Alicia's singing has made significant strides since \\"Songs in A Minor,\\" and the musicianship is still there in spades. There is no questioning the woman's talent.How is her songwriting? Nice. She basically writes about stuff that she knows; female empowering songs about respect and love. It would be silly to expect Stevie Wonder type songs about poverty or spirituality, that isn't the vibe she's on right now, at least with this record. She'll get there.This record solidifies Alicia as a major player and should set the stage for continued growth and exploration. I'm looking forward to the trip and will most definitely reserve a spot.Bravo Alicia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Her Best But Enjoyable to Say The Least!","review":"I liked the way the album flowed, but none of songs left a bullseye with me. I think that she needs to come more into her own and stay more orginal.(I want her just to go off on that piano and sing her ass off.) I want to remember a song not just remember a version. I read her diary and I'm still waiting to get to her secrets. We are still just scratching the surface. But its worth taking a look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a fan","review":"I love this CD. It is true some tracks sound a little familiar to her other album.

And that's all it was, \\"hype\\". I admire this young lady's persistence but now she needs to quit. I suprisingly got through the first 4 songs on the cd and could not tolerate it thereafter. I think she should stick with writing or producing because singing is not her field."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKED!","review":"This is WAY TOO OVERRATED just like some smart people think.

I think she's one of the best voices of the 2000's. She's also a lot deeper than most artists, which I like.That being said, if you are not a die hard Keys fan and love her for her straight up talent as a vocalist and pianist, you will probably hate this album. Most of her albums are about the same subjects, and a lot of critics find that boring. I still think it's better than trap music made by MySpace gangster fakers... but hey, to each their own.

If anyone ever doubted it before, this will make a believer out of them. While I really liked \\"Songs In A Minor,\\" this new album surpasses it in just about every way. I totally agree with other reviewers in that Alicia's voice has gotten so much better (not that it wasn't good before). This album shows that she can sing better than many singers twice, three times her age. It seems to come so naturally for her, never sounding forced. The music is simply great, well written and wonderfully performed. The production is just right and not overproduced. The bonus DVD is also great. By far one of the best albums to come out this year. A must-have for any fan of quality music. Even if you're not into R&B you'll probably like this, since Alicia is able to blend so many different styles of music into these songs. A fantastic listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the First!!

Blige's 'What's the 411' being the first) I've ever purchased where I like ALL the tracks!This is true R&B with a lot of heart and soul. Alicia is in a league of her own with this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Alica Keyes tops her first CD with her second release. The Diary of Alicia Keyes is an impressive CD filled with many great songs. Most CDs have a couple of good songs. This CD has many great songs. I was able to listen to the whole CD w/o skipping songs, which is a plus. My favorite are If I was Your Women, You Don't Know My Name, Diary, and If I Ain't Got You (my favorite ballad). In an age where record labels are emphacizing image over talent, it's refreshing to hear a beautiful record by a young, beautiful woman who does not use her body to get ahead...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alicia Keys has proved it","review":"This is the best work yet that Alicia Keys has produced for her fans, on this album she is deeper and has a fresher outlook on things I am very confident that this album will go far and wide with it's strong message.

So it was fun, but for a 19 hr car trip, it really didn't do a whole lot for us.

Susan Dunn is an exceptional soprano with a beautiful, powerful, flexible voice - what more could one ask for? Vincenzo La Scola is a good silvery-toned tenor with reliable high notes. Bruson's singing is touching as always. Dunn and La Scola are more of your 'stand and deliver'-type singers - not great actors, so with the lack of action in the opera, I do not give the video a full five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the information?","review":"I wanted to look into this system, but was not provided any information.

It's not too expensive but then again it's very heavy and large and not well designed at all. So If you want it to look good DO NOT BUY THIS.Another problem I had with my DV-115 is that the DVD's I play always have a \\"break\\" in them. This may be due to the changing layers but I feel there are often more \\"breaks\\" and at different moments in the disc.Also at regular intervals my players starts to slow down. The picture and sound slow down, become slurred and that isn't a problem with the discs because changing discs doesn't help at all.So WHEN it works it's a great (albeit quite large) system, but I can't rely on it to work properly..."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 2 years old and the DVD player is already dead","review":"I purchased this system in Jan. 2002.

But I've listened to the album many times now and I just don't get it. It really doesn't deserve all the fanfare, because so many other rock / punk bands do it much better. The album doesn't really blend well either, the songs are really disjointed like its a mix of two or three different bands. I was not impressed, would rather listen to Stone Roses, Blur or another band with some real skill or creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Oasis instead","review":"This album is not much of an album at all. It's scattered lyrics are so incoherent that they are a perfect compliment to the horrible instrumentation. This album is barely listenable, and it is far too dark for anyone who wishes to stay sane to listen to repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Manics album-without a doubt!","review":"This album is excellent. After 'The Holy Bible' and the dissapearance of Richey James, their chief lyric writer, the Manics developed a more poppy, less punky sound. This is the last punk rock album by the Welshmen, and it sees them at their very best. The themes on this album are extremely dark, exploring anoerexia, american imperialism, the holocaust etc in uncompromising fashion. But the music written by Bradfield and Moore(which is utterly captivating)prevents this album from becoming a kind of dark, goth-rock escapade. The best songs on this album are the ones which blend the lyrics and music perfectly. Examples of this are the opening track 'Yes', '4st 7lbs' and 'Die In The Summertime'. This album is not just a great sounding record, it is a great experience. Get this album, sit back and savour the Manics at their very best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A MASTERPICE","review":"so damn easy to cave in, man kills everythingso damn easy to cave in, man kills everythingso damn easy to cave in, man kills everythingso damn easy to cave in, man kills everythingand yes, there\`s too much white in the stars and stripes."},{"rating":"2","title":"power, corruption, and lies","review":"'the Holy Bible' is, lyrically, the most compelling and disturbing recording I've ever listened to. From the urgency and resignation of 'Yes', to the apathy and strength of '4st.7lb' - from the brutality and intellect of 'Faster' - this recording is stronger than Mensa, Miller, or Mailer.It's amazing that this record has ever seen the light of day.

My first exposure to MSP was Everything Must Go, a brilliant, beautiful album. I thought this one to be inferior. While I still prefer Everything, I have come to love this record. Desensitizing and polarizing at the same time, it is a relentless trip through the atrocities and tragedies of the world, past and present. By themselves, each song may come off as pseudo-political rantings by a sophomore band, but I don't think this album was ever meant to be heard a cut at a time. Together it blends into a powerful, disturbing and yet highly energizing and melodic triumph. I highly recommend this record. Give it some time.

It seems so many are filled with foul language, too much violence for the eyes to watch, or nudity that is usually uncalled for. I hate to think what watching this R-rated junk does for our psyche. On the other hand, we can watch the G-rated animations that seem to be the other end of the movie-watching spectrum.

Robbins makes Waiting for Godot and No Exit look like superficial rubbish. The hidden meanings in phrases such as \\"give me a good shake\\" can be directly linked, with the clarity one usially associates with the works of Beckett and Camus, to the plight of the Prolitariat in modern, corporate, America. Robbins also shows his unique grasp of the modern philosophical implications of mutidimentional string theory and quantum electrodinamics.

The collaboration with Jeff Lorber, Ain't No Stoppin is by far the best track on the CD. Change the World is a MUZAK rendition of the Eric Clapton award winner and represents the obligatory cover tune found on all smooth jazz cd's. The Next Level is Albright's saving grace and is reminicent of the straight ahead Gerald from his past efforts.

I feel he was a great genius. However, this seems to be less of a novel than a collection of his theological musings hurriedly injected into a thin \\"story.\\" I expect better than long rambling (and disjointed) musings on the nature of a \\"higher being.\\" Neither The Divine Invasion nor the Transmigration of Timothy Archer suffer from a lack of plot, despite being theosophical in nature, so it was with great anticipation that I purchased this book. A little more story, and little less discourse, could have made this into an interesting read. If you are a fan of Dick's, or good writing, try almost anything else by him, with the additional exception of \\"Mary and the Giant,\\" which is still better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get into it","review":"I really love PKD. A Scanner Darkly is one of my absolute favorite novels, and I've enjoyed everything else I've read by him (though some of his short fiction is a little weak), but I just couldn't get into this book because of the writing style. I get why he wrote the way he did, all disjointed and surreal/postmodernistic, since it is a story of mental illness, addiction, theology, paranoia, conspiracy, and philosophy. But I've never been able to get into this style of writing (I really tried to read Burroughs). I need more of a storyline or at least something more linear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhere between Vonnegut and Eco","review":"This is a very funny, strange, and thought-provoking book. Philip K. Dick's world is somewhere between those of Umberto Eco (there is a lot of theology here) and Kurt Vonnegut (surreal 1970s setting). The main character, with the unlikely name of Horselover Fat, is confronted with the fact that the universe is fundamentally irrational when a friend of his commits suicide. This flaw in the universe then proceeds to destroy Fat's sanity. He believes he has an encounter with god -- a perfect, gnostic god who exists outside of the flawed universe who has transmitted knowledge directly into his head by means of a pink laser.The ideal reader for this book should be a person who has studied theology at the college level, and who has an open mind. It is a very entertaining book with a lot of insight into our strange world, but it is by no means easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"The opening chapters of Valis represent some of Dick's finest writing, hands-down. If you read only that much of the book, it will still be worth the full price.This obliquely autobiographical journey synthesizes the marvelous introspections of a man better able to examine himself that most of us are, and what winds up on the page is a joy to witness. Dick's choice of dual/single narrator is effective and clever, predating many other authors' Postmodernist experiments along these lines, and Dick manages to wrap it around a poignant and heartfelt quest for meaning and redemption.For my money, the book is Dick's best, certainly the finest of the so-called Valis Trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolute page-turner","review":"amazing master of sarcasm and symbolism, blended with a host of themes and ideas that occasionally make sense. the first time through the book was less a intellectual exercise for me than it was an emotional one. i really enjoyed some of his other, more coherent novels such as flow my tears and 3 stigmata, but this is a jewel in its own way. read it and let pkd play with your mind for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong book description for Valis mass paper back","review":"When you look up the book under this listing, it is listed together with other print versions, which actully have three novels together but not this paperback! So you will end paying for one novel not three. Just keep that in mind! This is not to say that the actual novel Valis is ineed of PKD's best! It is just somewhat disingenious marketing either by Amazon or by the book seller, who does not specify the actual content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fish Can Not Carry Guns","review":"What this lackin plot it made up for in idea flow and comical instances. Especially funny yet powerful was the idea that Nixon was the head of some evil Empire and his real name was Ferris F. Fremont (sort of) and the forces of good were resonsible for dethroning the King. Kevin the cynical friend and his dead cat was hilarious. I agree it was a strange almost uncomprehendable tale but if you do put the effort into understanding it then the results will be satisfying. The end wasn't that great though. It left the door open for a sequal but he (PKD) should have at least made it look like he was going to shut the door, rather than not try at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT a book about madness, sadistic games, deception, pain","review":"This book is PKD's story based on gnostic Christianity, or at least attempt to combine SF genre and give some kind of explanation of time, space,philosophy, closer to science.I read it twice and enjoyed it, although some of the last events in the book require maximum attention !!!Although story is elusive, you must get this one, it makes you think, and gives you references to Greek classic philosophers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A seething, glitchy work of brilliance","review":"This is the best, and most unhinged, book Philip K Dick ever wrote. This is not a conventional story, but revolves around the philosophical musings of PKD, and includes excerpts from his Exegesis. Indeed, he wrote himself into the book as a character.To understand why the book is so insane, it helps to remember that PKD was on drugs and slowly losing his mind during this period of his life. Many of the events in VALIS are autobiographical (well from PKD's point of view, anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, philisophical intense, well written!","review":"This book is astounding, a mad search for humanity and a mans insanity. Written like no other book I have read, a must for Sci Fi fans. The book incorporates philosophy and religious mysticism into a science fiction novel, based on PKD's personal religious experience that haunted him the rest of his days. This book will make you think hard about the reality we inhabit and pose new questions you have never thought of before."},{"rating":"2","title":"We-ird","review":"This is about as close to an autobiography that we'll ever get from the famed author. He died not long after writing this \\"trilogy\\". VALIS is a book in which he is two characters, one an alter-ego that is only revealed after some time. Difficult to understand, this book serves as a primer for the real hardcore PKD fans.I gave it five because its probably his most important work. Not really science fiction in the literal sense. Its set in the modern world of the mid-70s when some (though how much we are not told) of these events actually transpired. How fictionalized is it? I don't know. How real did Philip K Dick think whatever happened to him was? I don't know.What I do know is that I read this book in one day, one sitting, and I couldn't do anything else until I got to the end. That is really rare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Picture Posted","review":"The cover for this book on the page would lead one to believe that it comes with two other works, and the book preview would lead you to believe the same.

Well, I should have listened to my little inner voice telling me \\"This is not your type of book.\\"The writing is excellent but the topic and characters are so odd that I quit after about 60 pages. The dialog between the two personalities inhabiting a single body grows very tiresome. Perhaps if you are REALLY into metaphysical ramblings you'll like this (it's very well done and actually a bit witty) but for me it just wasn't worth the investment in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Insane","review":"Smarties and good friends have recommended this book to me. However, halfway through it I had to simply give up and admit defeat. Nothing makes any sense, the characters are only warped peices of their true selves as seen by the main lunatic--er, character. The religious stuff was the most irreligious rambling I've ever run across, and it usurped the space in which a plot might have neatly fit. In short, I didn't get it, and I think I probably wouldn't want to anyway. This is not so much speculative fiction as it is something which causes you to speculate about whether it should even be called fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you might think","review":"I have read many books like this and it really isn't that good.

His writing is an easy read though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a story and not very interesting...","review":"VALIS is PKD's quasi-autobiographical crazy mystical science fiction speculations about God. This isn't a piece of fiction as much as it is a bunch of nonsensical fantasies about the nature of god pulled from nowhere. This work is nowhere near the quality of PKD's *actual* science fiction, and I don't recommend that anybody bother reading this book. Stick to the earlier stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh...","review":"That was my reaction, anyway. David Pringle (editor of Interzone) listed 6 (more than any other author)Dick novels in his book Science Fiction: the 100 Best Novels.

It makes perfect sense, and that sense is shallow.I dismiss it. Boring. I started it with hope that it would get interesting, which ebbed quickly. Old gnostic ideas set in modern California. If I were in this book I'd want to commit suicide too--just to get out of this book.

Magee succinctly summarizes some grand philosophical ideas while telling us about the philosophers themselves.The many illustrations and graphics help relate the philosophical ideas to works of art, to other disciplines (notably music and literature), and -- ultimately -- to our daily lives.Obviously, this book is not meant to be a comprehensive view of any philosopher or philosophical approach.

Lobster too undergoes transformation from steamed to extraordinary. The instructions are clear and precise and detailed notes/hints are provided as required.

For example, the spaetzle receipes which produce a dough so thick and dry that I find it impossible to push it through a colander!

It is a highly simplistic, broadbrush (to the point of being sloppy and slapdash) overview of Bridges' career in politics. It is shocking that a book about such a powerful congressional power broker could be so tedious, uninformative and, well, naive about the political process. It seems to be deliberately written for an elementary or high school reading level. How did Bridges become so powerful within the Senate? How did he rise to the top of the Republican congressional leadership? You won't find the answers to these questions in this book. If you are looking for a good book about politics, I would recommend any of Caro's books about Robert Moses or LBJ. The added ironic benefit is that, in a select few passages, Caro's third book about Johnson DOES contain some useful info about Styles Bridges. In a few sentences, Caro manages to tell us more about Bridges than this book does in over three hundred pages.

I understand that LOTR is the foundation on which contemporary fantasy stands, but c'mon, this is just a blatant rip-off. Shea and Flick are Frodo and Sam, Allanon is Gandalf, the Skull Lord is Sauron, etc. etc., but without the slightest degree of character development. I can't bring myself to care about any of these wooden characaters or the bland, lifeless way in which the generic story is playing out. Don't waste your time or money on this one.

While not nearly as deep as the ones in George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song Of Ice And Fire\\" series, the characters are memorable and charismatic nonetheless. There is plenty of action, and the some more suspenseful scenes are absolutely captivating. Contrary to the opinions of many, I think that the large number of pages (somewhere around 700) really adds to the epic scale of the plot.

As with all of the Shannara book, it has a fast pace story line that keeps you \\"on the edge of your seat\\". The ending of each book is simply a begining of a whole new story.

When they awake they smile and joke with each other congratulating themselves for their success and in the same paragraph Flick see's the obvious bitter disappointment in Shea. What???? All this happens and they are making smalltalk and kidding with each other like they were going out to see a movie??? I could never tell where the characters were at emotionally. After that I sludged through a couple more chapters but finally gave up.

If these books were nice little 200 page works of, they would be far more tolerable than the encyclopedia sized works of copy-cat garbage that they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sword of the Snooze","review":"When this book was new, my best friend recommended it to me.

If you like fantasy, I rate it five, but overall, I give it a four. It gets a little to crazy at times; fantas-tic. Y'know what I mean?

I could have cared less whether the characters lived or died.There was little motivation and internal dialogue between the characters. They all moved predictably. I think the only character I cared at all about was Rock Troll.Certainly subtlety is not one of Brook's strongpoints. This book plods. It does not flow.Please, I know good fantasy can be hard to come by but try Donaldson, or George R. R. Martin. Or in a slightly off subject arena, Robert Anton Wilson, but please for the sake of your mind, skip this book, unless you have a sofa without a 3 -inch leg.

I felt like weeping, but I thought maybe I would give it another shot. Bad idea. I got to page 10 and remembered why it was so terrible. Hackneyed prose, ludicrous dialogue, inept plot, and let's not even begin to talk about a lack of original ideas. If I could give it 0 stars, I would.If you have ever read a book by George RR Martin, Robin Hobb, Guy Gavriel Kay, R. Scott Bakker, or even Robert Jordan... avoid this book and this entire series like the Plague. Your brain will start bleeding at around page 20.How is this book still rated 4/5 stars on Amazon???

Having said that I can recognize its originality, it is the blueprint of fantasy. Everybody borrows or copies elements from these books; Harry Potter, anyone.But Brooks just blatantly copies LOTR, people, places, plot are just carbon copies of Tolkien's books. And he has written about twenty on the series!

It is LORD OF THE RINGS \\"LIGHT\\" people! The world isn't half as interesting, the characters are stiff and poorly written, and the plot is a cookie-cutter copy of LOTR. It's for people that can't get enough of Tolkien but have run out of his work to read, which apparently seems to be a significant portion of the population. But honestly, I would rather read the classic than a classical rip-off. All of you desiring more LOTR, check out \\"Bored of the Rings\\". It's hilarious, and you'll enjoy yourself much more than you will after having read \\"Sword of Shannara\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read this Book!!!","review":"If you are looking for some charming, well-written fantasy reads, this book is not for you. Frankly, it's pretty much a poorly-written version of Lord of the Rings with different character names and a sword instead of a ring. True, most fantasy is based somewhat on Tolkien, but Terry Brooks has stayed so true to the Feloowship that it's a bit hard to swallow. From a company consisting of all different (and magical) races, to the grey-bearded wizard who makes sporadic appearances, to the ill-disguised ring wraiths, this is a blatant rip off of superior books. If I were you, I'd buy a copy of Lord of the Rings and not waste my time on Terry Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"This was the first book I have ever read by Terry Brooks. I found it to be a rather boring read as his descriptions of places and things are quite long and unnecessarily involved.

I am planing to read the 2nd book in this trilogy just to give this author another chance, but honestly, I am not expecting much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I am an avid and usually not-too-picky fantasy/sci-fi reader, but this book was just awful. Terrible writing, mostly. Also terrible characterizations. And when the hero got \\"saved\\" from an impossible situation by his magic stone the second time, that was it for me - what, he was just going to pull his stone out every time there was a problem?

Comparing this to Tolkien is just...inexplicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored out of my mind!","review":"I read lots of books and enjoy most of them, and even the ones which aren't particularly good I at least have no problem reading all the way through. This one though, it was just not at all engaging to me. The characters display emotions they have no right having given the flatness and colorlessness of the novel overall. And this explanation makes sense to me, sorry if it sounds a bit obscure..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but boring","review":"I really didn't like this book, but not really for plot reasons. I don't care if somebody uses an old well-known plot, as long as he does it well. That is what made this book not enjoyable for me. I did get through all of it, but it took me a month (amazing for me, since I rarely take even a week to read the longest of books). Obviously some people think this book is wonderful, but it just didn't have that magical quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"(Reading Brooks And Tolkin)","review":"I have been reading Brooks and Tolkin for awile, and I see no diffrence in the too. I see Tolkin setting an image in peoples minds and watching what comes out of it.Brooks uses what I call a \\"fantasy Epic\\" way of writing.Brooks dosent elaborate on one point in the story, he keeps his readers wanting to know whats going to happen. He tells the story though the eyes of the characters and not as a comintator. Tolkin is the complete opposit of that. He'll sit and write about a small thing that has no use in the story exsept that it's there, and will right as someone who is telling a story around a fire place.I think Brooks has taken a world and added alittle extra in to it, so that people can get action drama and suspence all in one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Excellent Fantasy For All","review":"Brooks creates an wonderfuly textured world in which the characters really come alive.At first gance, the 700+ page novel might seem a bit daunting.The reader quickly realizes, however, that the pages fly by.The book takes you on an absorbing journey through wonderful lands and situations. Its only drawback may be the lack of unique characters.The protagonists are all so egar to be friendly with each other, and to do the right thing, that at times it becomes tedious when they all argue over who will risk thier lives and proceed first into a dangerous swamp.For a lesser author this would have meant a terrible read, Brooks, however, does not let us dwell on that.He keeps the pace moving with a tight narritive and plenty of action. The end result is an incedible book that will have readers begging for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Read this Story Before... Many Times.","review":"If you're a fan of fantasy writing, I guarantee you have read this story before. Worse, it was written in a manner that is difficult for me to appreciate.

This story was just too formulaic for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I always wondered about the first book. I saw it for years in the book stores and finally broke down and read it. I like his love for the genre, and he wrote better later. But this is almost unreadable. The angry conversations felt very forced and the luck at times was way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical and a copycat","review":"Having heard so many good things about the author Terry Brooks i was extemely eager and excited to read the Sword of Shannara. But then i did, and was completely dissapointed.And here is why:His introduction of most of his characters is decent, and i do point out,MOST of them.And only the intoduction is decent. All throughout the book, Brooks does not allow the reader to get to know his characters,he does not speak of them much(personalities, backrounds...information)or includes many conversations between them.Also, his story moves quickly, too quickly for the reader to keep up, and enjoy a good read.His writing style is very technical and cold,he prefers to be Terry Brooks telling the story, rather than having his characters telling and living it.As to the copycat mention, i spotted many similarities to lord of the rings, but that is something quite common in many science fiction writers i suppose.Similarities in both the plot and in the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the BEST!","review":"A book that expresses the themes of willpower and perserverence stronger than any other of the hundreds of books I have read! The symbolism and messages in this book are sure to make anyone think and to conjure forth every emotion from tragic sadness to tearjerking, triumphant happiness. The reference to illusion makes one really think about what is real, and the climax is sure to make one reflect on the interpretations of others upon them relative to that of their own. In my opinion, the BEST of the Shannara books, and THE BEST book I have ever read. Words cannot say enough about this epic tale which has immortally left its legacy upon me. If you never read another book in your life, read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why you should read this book","review":"this book is jam packed with adventure, mistery, and plenty of magic. terry brooks is a mast er of the art of literature as you will soon discover if you choose to read this book. once read you'll be HOOKED on the shannara series and won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"I'm one of the seven people who didn't like the Lord of the Rings, but I have to say, it's very clear to me why people who did would be unhappy with this sorry imitation.

Virtually every post-Tolkien fantasy cliche is taken out and waved around, as if in an attempt to mesmerize readers who are easily influenced by trickery and slight of hand.

All characters, places and situations from \\"Sword of Shannara\\" were stolen from Tolkien. Allannon is the copy of Gandalf, Shea is the copy of Frodo, Shady Vale is the copy of Shire... This list goes on and on and on and will never see the end. Thus the book contains nothing original - and that is why it is so boring. It's the shame for Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad form of Lord of the rings Deja-Vu","review":"Brooks world and plot completely resurrects Tolkein's Lord of the rings, with only minor differences (The Ringswraiths are copied 1:1 as skull bearers, for example). Unfortunately, Brooks naive writing keeps me detached from the characters, and makes me indifferent, although the plot do contain some catching elements. No Tolkein suspense or excitement here, and the 700+ of pages seem too much to take. Not to mention that all of Tolkein's drawbacks are present here (Shallow characters with almost no emotion except fear, unreal characters, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"This book was GREAT!

There is traitor amongst them and eventually the fellowship falls apart.

I struggled through about half of it before giving up. I have just no idea of how anyone could have the talent to make such a long book so absolutely devoid of any hint of fun. The characters aren't vivid, there aren't many confrontations, and when there are, the precious \\"elfstones\\" always save the day, Shea doing next to nothing. I don't see how such a third-class book got so popular. Please, readers, do NOT waste time on this poor excuse of a use for paper and ink!

Many people have mentioned that it is a LOTR ripoff, but I don't think so. It definitely has it's similarities, but so do so many books of the genre. No, my problem with it is that it's just plain boring. I simply don't care about the characters and found my mind wandering while reading it.Usually when I get this far in a book I finish it no matter what, just so the time already put into it isn't a waste, but not this time.Life's too short for bad fiction, and there's too many other good books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brooks Masterpiece","review":"This was the book that really got me hooked on Brooks.

Suspenseful, thrilling, and great storytelling. Efficient story-telling! Deep and rich as the Tolkien stuff is, it's just not all that accessible.

The pace is incredibly slow, beginning with a single plot line that never quite gets off the ground. There are no fresh ideas here (including several moments of unabashed borrowing from Tolkien), the characters are unexciting and the book never reaches an adult level.

Proceed cautiously if you read this, being warned that you are in for a rather mediocre experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminds me of another book...","review":"Well, Terry should be thankful that Tolkien published that famous trilogy. Ironically, I think when 'The Sword of Shannara' came out so did the animated movie of 'Lord of the Rings'. Basically, many people wished Tolkien had made his book a lot bigger and I think Terry capitalized on that.I was just hoping that this book would be unique and not a copy.Flick and Shea - Frodo and Sam...Skull Creature - Ringwraiths...That's just the tip of the iceburg[...]. It seemed like it was written by some 20 year old who read 'Lord of the Rings' a dozen times. However, I did like his character Creed who was a thief. That made me read on.Anyways, I hope the rest of his books are better.[...]. The book could have been 500 pages instead of 700 plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crow!!! Amuterish outing with no originality!","review":"Sword Of Shannara (SOS) was a dissapointment. At times I found Brooks' writing to be very strained and amuterish. Comparing it to LOTR? Hell no! LOTR is much better written, and it is original. Plus there is the detail involved in LOTR. SOS has little depth in this area. I have not read his other books, so I wouldn't know about them. If you want a good fantasy read, go read Lord Of The Rings, Wheel Of Time, Thomas Covenant The Unbeliever, Adventures of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and Sword of Truth (by Goodkind). Stay away from Shannara, you will only waste your time with it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!!","review":"Best book since Tokein(Not).

Even before reading LOTR, I noticed that Brooks tends to rehash the same plot in his Shannara books. Over and over, it was that same stupid Druid Fire that miracuously saves the happy elves and dwarves. It seemed that there was always that climactic battle at the end, where we already knew who was going to win. Oh, and always a dumb quest to retrieve something in the meantime. Brooks is the Puff Daddy of the fantasy world. He makes his living ripping off other people's works. When Brooks dies, I hope Tolkien beats him over the head as he enters the gates of heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"What looks like a Lord of the Rings Wanabe works.","review":"When I first started reading this book I thought it was a complete take on Lord of the Rings. There was enough difference here (like the world being in the future instead of the past, gnomes instead of Orcs) that it was somewhat different. But the Elves (a pair this time), dwarves and wizards are still there. Brooks made a successful franchise of this treatment, and it was a very good story in its own right. Still highly recommended in that it is an original story with great characters well worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I went looking for a new fantasy series - and I didn't find it","review":"If I have to sum up this book in one word, I would say: dreadful. I finished the book, but it was a struggle. It was not just that this book was a rehash of Lord of the Rings - it was a bad rehash. The writing was absolutely horrible. There may have been a decent 250 page novel somewhere in the book, but unfortunately it would be hard to find it in the 700 pages the author delivered. The characters are uninteresting (even the ones the author explicitly tells us are interesting), the plot \\"twists\\" can be seen from two hundred pages away, and the conclusion is just plain boring.Given how many books there are in the Shannara series, I can only assume the author's writing improved. I have no intention of finding out for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe okay for a ten yr old boy","review":"This book is maybe ok for a ten year old boy. I'm not saying read it if you're ten--I mean it seems like something a little boy would write. There is not one single female character in it, for one thing, which may give you some idea of its brash ignorance and immaturity. Otherwise, all else I can say is that every bit of plot or story in this book has been shamelessly plundered from other popular sci-fi/fantasy, especially LOTR (and even planet of the apes!!!). If you don't care, and just want some standard junk-food fantasy, then go for it.

I was, of course, greatly disappointed. I suppose I could've lived with the fact that this is a blatant ripoff of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" if it weren't so poorly written. The book is practically headache inducing. I actually didn't finish it (but I bet I can tell you how it ends).That said, I should add that this would probably be a really good book for teenagers, especially those who might have some trouble wading through Tolkien - the younger, the better. I just have a feeling that anyone who's read \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (or is into good writing) will have a lot of problems with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The start of something beautiful","review":"I must have read this book nearly half a dozen times!

I started reading and I began noticing that the story was a copy of Lord of the Rings. I was actually quite amused by it. The similarities are so blatantly obvious that it was funny. I stopped reading half way through and don't plan to finish.This book taught me an important lesson: Just because a book is \\"popular\\" doesn't mean it isn't garbage. If you are into fantasy or sci-fi literature it is usually wise to take the time to read multiple and varied reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Premise","review":"I definitely enjoyed reading the Sword of Shannara, even if it is similar to the Lord of the Rings. It had what I believe is the most interesting premise for a fantasy book, the most creative reason for fantasy reasons. Mr. Brooks tells that there was a nuclear war between man, which created incredible geographic upheaval. In this relatively secluded area, between the nuclear residue and evolutions and adaptations of people to survive the war's catastrophic effects, man has become Men, Dwarves, Gnomes, and Trolls. Elves are different but that doesn't really matter. Though the plot bears many similarities to LotR, it is nonetheless enjoyable and well written. I would also like to point out that the many following books in the series are very different from LotR in plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash by any other name","review":"Helpful pop culture analogies to help you decide whether Sword of Shannara is worth your hard-earned money:The Beatles is to the Monkees asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraPearl Jam is to The Calling asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraU2 is to Coldplay asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraGuiness is to Natty Light asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraSteak is to ground dog meat asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraGrand Theft Auto is to 187 Ride or Die asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraSonic the Hedgehog is to Crash Bandicoot asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraFinal Fantasy is to Legend of Dragoon asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraBasically: a pale, unfulfilling and ultimately insulting imitation - the fact that Brooks was lazy and evil enough to copy key characters and plot points from Tolkien verbatim is just icing on a cruddy cruddy cake.Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy","review":"Terry Brooks complitly copyed The Lord of the Rings series and this book is just a copy of another book.

Elfstones was incredibly paced and wrought with excitement. Sword, which is refrenced several times in Elfstones, really begins at a plodding pace. The book is slow beyond words and shows no signs of picking up the pace. I was seriously disappointed after I started reading it. In fact I actually put the novel down for a year before going back and trying to get through it. Once you get beyond the half way point things do pick up, they do become exciting, and it all becomes worthwhile. It just takes a little too long to do so. At 700 + pages I really want a tale, what you get is a primer for the tales to come. In truth, that is probably what made the Elfstones so fun, the world was fleshed out and Brooks had a plan. Read this more as an afterthought, get Elfstones first and then move into the rest of the series. You will get more out of the Sword in that manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooks vs Tolkien","review":"If you've read Tolkien then of course you're going to think Brooks pulled from him. It's so blatantly obvious that you'd have to be blind not to notice. However, this does not detract from Brooks' story. He still weaves a wonderful plot with excellent characters. His writing is much more modern than Tolkien's. The Lord of the Rings tends to get just a bit verbose. The english used is hard for some people to follow. Tolkien's story is absolutely amazing. Brooks' revamp with all the added twists is still phenomenal, however. Don't disregard \\"Sword of Shannara\\" simply because of it's similarities to The LoTR. You would be missing out on a wonderful story if you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be a kid again...","review":"Well, as Rich (dzrtnight@usa.net) points out:\\"I read both this and the Lord of the Rings series when I was 12, and I enjoyed this one book better than the LoTR series!\\"This is 100% true, and a good indication of how this book is. If you are 12, you will probably like this book. If you are not, well, it's a toss-up. You'll enjoy this if you haven't read much decent fantasy - if you thought the Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance books were good, you'll love this.

Make your judgement by the blithering idiots who defend this book, and buy another. A direct copy of Tolkien? An understatement, and anybody who tries to tell you otherwise simply does not know what they are talking about. It's paint-by-numbers Tolkien, and a bad job was done at that.Now, I'm told that Brooks has gotten better, and that the Shannara series is actually enjoyable now. Good for Brooks.

But all in all the last four hundred or so pages picked up speed and made up for everything lost in the beginning. The friendship between Shea, Flick, Hendel, Balinor and the Elven Brothers, as well as Allanon was shining true by the time the end of the book came.

I have been a fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings since I was in the third grade. It has been my absolutely favorite book since I first read it. Tolkien's touch was beautiful. And now, I had to read this book. It was odd. Allanon. How like he is to Gandalf. Everything exactly the same. Except for the important magic of skilled writing. They go to Culhaven or whatever. Just like Rivendell. What is Terry Brooks thinking of? People who say that story doesn't matter, even though it is obviously a copy of LoTR (anyone who is mature enough to really read must see it) I must say, who cares if the author is a great writer? Just writing doesn't make up a book. Story is important too. You can't just copy somebody else's wonderful story plot by plot and expect to be called a wonderful writer. If Terry Brooks was just a fan of LoTR, he should have been more subtle, at least, in getting ideas from it. Really, Christopher Tolkien should sue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype on this book...","review":"I haven't read any of Tolkien's books before so my reason for the low rating has nothing to do with it being a rip-off or whatever. I thought that this book was just pretty bad. The plot seemed lame and very generic. The characters were annoying. Shea is hardly a hero, even if he's portrayed as a reluctant one. Allanon is droll and Flick is just plain annoying. Half this book is filled with drawn-out descriptions of backgrounds.

It's as if someone gave an adolescent the Cliff's Notes to Lord of the Rings and told him to write a book based on it.

Besides the copying of the plot, the characters were not very in-depth. I would like to know more about them, but the author barely scratches the surface.

This was the perfect book for that 8th grade kid who sat through math class daydreaming of adventure. But would I still like it now that I'm all grown up and 'mature'? This is the question I asked myself as I recently decided to reread this old favorite. As it turns out, I still love this book.

It felt too much like a Tolkein ripoff to me, and was more amateurish than I'm used too. Terry Brooks has clearly matured since his first outing. Overall, it's a relatively nice book.

There are some charming, light hearted poems in this collection. While often funny, Chesterton's poems offer wisdom as well as a few laughs. Chesterton's fans will enjoy the book.

The maps where you go are Kejim_post, Kejim_base, Artus_mine, Artus_detention, Artus_topside, Valley, Yavin_temple, yavin_trial, Ns_streets, Ns_hideout, Ns_Starpad, Bespin_undercity, Bespin_streets, Bespin_platform, Cairn_bay, Cairn_assembly, Cairn_reactor, Cairn_dock1, Doom_detention, Doom_shields, Yavin_swamp, Yavin_canyon, Yavin_courtyard and Yavin_final. Desann is the most powerful enemy in the game that you will never get to grip him. Well Galak in his forcefield armor is a little hard to beat like Desann, you can't grip them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good if moded","review":"The game is so bad lucasarts should of stop the game from being sold. But when you mod the game it the best game in the world. The game needed 2 stars for how fun it is and for its overall but when moded the game is fun . So don't get the game for gc,xb and ps2 version's just get it for pc because that's the only one that you can mod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for some parts Frustrating for others","review":"This game is great. It has a great storyline and cunning characters. And while playing the game you feel like you're sitting back and watching a whole new starwars movie. But this game is not just action. There are buttons and control panels you have to push left and right. Manytimes I found myself going in circles, trying to find out what to do or how to do something. If you don't have some walkthrough to refer to while playing the game at some points you would think there are no possible ways to go on through the level. However, there are very good weapons, and the lightsaber and your force powers are easy and fun to use. Use lightning, throw your lightsaber at people. And once you have a lightsaber then incoming shots are automatically rebounded off your lightsaber without the click of a button. And on any level of difficulty it takes a very long time to beat the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jedi Knights Outcast II","review":"The powers are really cool and the lightsaber moves are sweet. You can cut peoples arms off and stuff. In decapataion mode you can slice thier heads off. The graphics for computer are O-K but once it comes out for X-Box they will be better. But of course there are going to be some new sweet games like Brute Force out."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the power of the FORCE","review":"Great game, good use of varying Force powers. Multi-player DEMANDS cablemodem-only to avoid lag. Even ISDN can't keep up, so beware. Only complaint: the bots are worthless & mindless.Spend the money - get the game. Spend the time, the difficulty of conquering is rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jedi Nighty night","review":"All I have to say bout this game is that it is fun for a couple hours once you get your lightsaber. There are some fun levels and special effects are great but.... now the con- no real replayability, once I finished it, which didn't take too long, I didn't want to play it again, and the multiplayer isn't much better than the first jedi game... I recommend waiting for Knights of the old republic to come out if you really want to lightsaber duel. Also Star Wars Galaxies is coming out in January and will be a great online RPG- with space wars and light saber battles."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it 0 stars I would!","review":"LucasArts STOLE MY MONEY!this is one of the worst games i've bought in 4 years. Although the graphics may be fancy thats about it. The game play is terrible, the levels are dry, and the animations are choppy (even on my P4 256ram!!!!). Its like the only thing they focused on was pretty still pictures to lure unsuspecting gamers with screan shots. This game is JUST NOT FUN!In addition to these problems there are hundreds of bugs in this version. I believe that they released this game way to early and I would not buy this product! Save your money and please stop supporting everything they stamp a star wars logo on!STARWARS stamped across the box cannot justify such a terrible game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This is the best action game i have seen in years.

I loved all the other Star Wars games but this one is different. The graphics a pretty bad and the frame rate tends to slow down quite a bit. I don't have a brand new computer but its not that old and has been upgraded a few times and the game is still bad. I can't even stand looking at the grapics and all the flaws it looks like a playstation 1 game almost. Now if you have a brand new...[expensive] computer than get the game other wise for get it. I can honestly say I am a huge Star Wars fan, but I played this game for like 3 mins or less and was sick of everything ex. the controls, the game play, the slow downs, and I could go on and on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Good Games Go Bad","review":"I have played the first jedi knight, and I thought that it was freakishly horrific. You other people don't have a clue what you are talking about, but I do. I have the PC Gamer magazine that talks about this game, and it looked pretty bad to me. Plus, I don't like the way Raven makes the game: it makes them (...), just like Elite Force. The Quake III engine is just as bad as everything else, so I am not too happy about the release of this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"This game is AWESOME! I don't really care that they took force destruction out that was in The first Jedi Knight game i give this 4 stars and not 5, sorry but the game was sweet, I just think the levels are too hard and I usually died to easily. The force also usually drains too fast, considering the level 3 lightning drains it almost instantly, Desann has an unlimited amount of force which really got me mad. I still say this game is the Best LucasArts game.

The gameplay is awesome, graphics are great, the dialog good, the weapons selection very good, the storyline excellent! There is nothing bad about this game. I played it for hours and hours when I was younger. I would still play now but sadly my old computer died and this game isn't compatible with Windows 7. That's my only complaint. Otherwise, the best game ever created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Game!","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful game. I've played it over and over again, and never got bored.You get to use the powers of the force to defeat many villains and increase your abilities. Eventually if you get good enough, you can take on large numbers of storm troopers with ease.The lightsaber battles are incredible. You feel like a real Jedi Knight. You get the chance to fire the guns of a starship, and to go into battle in an AT-ST, which is a lot of fun. There's also a time to act with stealth.This is one of those games that really strikes the right balance of combat, puzzles, graphics, and story.I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading Picture of Product","review":"So I really love this game. A lot of other people here will tell you the same thing. One of the best Star Wars games ever made. I really wanted to get a boxed copy of the game. The picture advertised here is very misleading. All I received was a jewel case and a cd of the game. I am not too upset as I purchased this at a price of five or so dollars, but still, the picture of the boxed copy should be changed. It may have been stated somewhere else that this was simply a jewel case and the cd, no manual, just a slip of paper that says Jedi Knight 2 on it. Disappointed with my purchase. *sigh* Oh well. Still a phenomenal game for anyone considering to play it and not just have a boxed copy on their shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"JK2, the best game ever made.","review":"This game is by far the best I've ever played. In addition to that, it also has no blood, a big bonus. The lightsaber moves are great, I'm still figuring out new ones! They include flips, rolls, wallwalking, even lightsaber THROWS! The graphics are the best yet, using the most advanced engine available (Quake 3). The force powers are simply amazing (Force choke, push, pull, lightning, absorb, force drain etc.) The AI technology is the best EVER. Single player is not the greatest just because you can't have a lightsaber and force powers right away, and the guns get tedious after a while, but the multiplayer more than makes up for it. Raven really outdid themselves this time. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"This game is an amazing game. Sure, the graphics aren't super great, but it has much more to it than most newer games. This game is one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"Man this game is great!I would recommend this game to anyone!This game has it all. If your a shooter they have 9 different guns! Including the classic stormtruper gun,the disrupter rifle (for all you snipers),Rocket launcher, and even the Wookie bowcaster. If your a demelition man they got trip mines,Thermal detinators (granades), and detonation packs.You just wanna go hack some baddies just whip out your lightsaber. They have awesome force powers that add strategy to the game like pull, lightning, and even grip (strangle). They have a fun single player game as well as a fun multiplayer game.Sojust to sum it up (for thoose lazy people) a great game to play if your a star wars fanatic or just a let me just hack kind of guy"},{"rating":"2","title":"looooong wait to load","review":"Overall the game is very good. But, if you get killed and reload where you saved, you'll be waiting a long time. My system is: Celeron 700mhz., 64mb Radeon video card, 192MB Ram. According to the system requirements, that is more than enough. I will be getting another 128MB of ram to see if that helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT NOW!!!","review":"I underestimated the power of this game....I thought it was going to be just another dull movie game....I was wrong...The force corrected me. Have you ever tried to imagine what a Jedi Battle will look like?....this game will take you right in the middle of a Jedi battle, lightsabers and FORCE powers included. Awesome movie like graphics and details. Plus several of the best gaming moments of your life!!! It is a bit long and Quake2 style but gradually you as you start mastering the Force it will deliver pure gamong pleasure!!! I will not spoil the surprises on all the cool stuff you get to blow up, throw, pull, and so on!! great FPS and TPS too. Multiplayer action is great as well!...Just buy it, my young Padawan learner!!!....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"Is it a Scarlatti recording, or just a faint approach of Chopin's music?

It was a musical form of experimentation for Wynette and her producer, Billy Sherrill, trying to find the right songs for her one of a kind voice (\\"the voice with the teadrop with in\\"). The collection contains her first single, a minor hit, \\"Apt. #9\\", and her second single, a major hit, the title track from the album. Wynette & Sherrill win sometimes with the likes of 'Send Me No Roses', 'The Phone Call' and a cover of Jeanne Seeley's 'Don't Touch Me' but fall a little short with 'I'm Not Mine To Give', 'I Would Easy' and a cover of Loretta Lynn's 'Dont Come Home A-Drinkin'. 'Almost Persuaded', a #1 hit for David Houston and a song Sherrill had all his acts record at one time or the other, is included. It is interesting to note that Tammy sings a cover of 'Walk Though This World With Me' ... the then-current song by her musical mentor and future partner, George Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD GREAT GUYS","review":"Kelly Migwell,Jason,and Shawn you guys are great and I love ya all ....this CD FREAKIN ROCKS!

I have always liked Miles Davis as I grew up in the 1960's and 1970's. I have started going back to his early recordings and I am amazed by how good his bands were and how well they were recorded. I like these 20-Bit recordings and I don't know the technical differences between these and 24-Bit recordings but these seem to sound better to me so I buy them when I am able. Someday I will probably start buying SACD's to really experience the masters of jazz as closely to being there as possible.

The progress of their efforts across the Indian landscape makes for fascinating reading.The amazing accomplishments of the Survey in the face of fever, tigers, and other resistance are highlighted in the book. The naming of Mount Everest is but an historical afterthought to the incredible saga of the Survey itself.This entertaining and highly readable book does touch on some of the social, political, and scientific ramifications of Survey - but only briefly. The narrative is driven by the progress and setbacks of the Survey itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Album ruined","review":"Having had the orginal album from release in the 80's I was keen to get a remastered copy on CD. Gosh, how dissapointing to find the awful version of the title track. The original vinyl version is so much better. Even worse is the closing track 'My Kingdom Come'. Towards the end of the track you can hear the tape slowing down, taking it out of key and sounding totally awful. I couldn't believe my ears so I dug out my original vinyl. No speed bend on this, vocals sound ace, and with the better version of the title track it sounds better in every respect. I doubt I'll play the 2003 remaster again - I'll copy the vinyl. Very, very dissapointing - a great album ruined!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Method to Our Madness","review":"This one is the most rocking of the studio albums released by the Lords. Starts strong with \\"Method to My Madness\\" and keeps the energy going throughout. With the exception of \\"When Blood Runs Cold\\" and, one of the bonus tracks, \\"A Gun Called Justice\\" it's a constant barrage of Stivs' strongest vocals and Brian James' best riffs. The inclusion of \\"Mind Warp\\" from the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\\" soundtrack makes up, a little, for the omission of \\"S.F.&T.\\" (my favorite song from the original vinyl pressing).

When I was little, it shocked my mother when he specifically requested the Statler Brothers Old/New Testament (which was released as a two album set at the time). I can remember listening to it with him and being impressed by my father's reaction - it actually would get him to talk about his beliefs and what he was taught in school as a child during the Depression in Philadelphia.As I was reading the track listing, I can still recall snippets of most of the songs. The music is quintessential Statler Brothers - the songs are masterful representations of the old stories of the Bible. Regardless of what you believe, or how strongly you may hold those beliefs, I highly recommend this CD, along with its New Testament counterpart.

Every classic style and sound of the disco era is captured here. The songs are masterfully executed in both composition and production.

Abbado adopts a measured tempo which allows the subtleties of Mahler's orchestration to emerge with great clarity. Although the initial movements are slow the work certainly does not drag. Of course Abbado is helped by having a superstar orchestra and excellent soloists who respond perfectly to his expert leadership. The symphony builds to an inexorable, spine tingling and shattering conclusion.Being able to see as well as hear the performance greatly enhances the experience of this uplifting music.

This event is a one-sided love for a girl just becoming a woman. In this story Turgenev presents us with alienation - 1850's Russian style.

DO NOT watch unless bound and gaged and with access to much distraction to prevent yourself from concentrating too much on the awfulness that lies within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off with her head !!!","review":"What a terrible film. Can someone please tell Natalie Portman that her 15 minutes were over a long time ago. Why does she keep trying the horrible fake British accent? It's almost as bad as Madonna's .... almost! And her acting, well it's about as bad as the accent. Scarlett Johansson isn't much better. Both of them are so out of their element it's frightening. As for the film, it's a total mess. It blows so fast through the historical events that you don't care one iota about any of the characters except maybe for the poor British actors in the film who had to go to their trailers every day and bang their heads against the wall trying to figure out how to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"This movie was absolutely horrible. It was also a very big letdown after waiting for it to come out and then watch. Where was Wolsey in this? He played such an integral part in the lives of Henry VIII and Anne. I think they mentioned his name once. The movie was choppy and did not flow at all. It seemed as if the script was the result of the good idea fairy gone bad. Too much cognac at a cigar bar is not what makes good script. If you want a much better movie see Anne of a Thousand Days with Richard Burton and Genevive Bujold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye Candy","review":"I bought this movie prior to seeing the Tudors which I recently bought and LOVE and way after Elizabeth. I know about poetic license but this pushed the envelope so far into make believe that I find it unwatchable now.The Tudors like Elizabeth both used poetic license BUT with superior writing and a stronger reference to history. Mary Boleyn was not the quiet, virginal (I don't want to go to court) girl portrayed in this film.Eric Bana is pure eye candy and the costumes are well done. After that there isn't much more to recommend this film. I did read the book and also found it to be poorly written fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very historically inaccurate, but beautiful","review":"What I liked about this movie is beautiful costumes, scenery, castles, etc. What I didn't, that many historical facts were missrepresented. Mary didn't visit her sister before her death; even though Anne was accused of incest, that was just a way for the king to marry his mistress with hopes to have a male heir. The king is shown as a guy overcome with passion for the evil calculating woman, but he had his motives for the male legite son in mind, when he anulled his marriage to marry Anne.And he married a few times after that too. Ironically, he did get his male heir, but he died too early to actually rule- even though officially he was a king for a while.To sum up- too much drama, too little historic truth, but lots of beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible depiction of a tremendously wonderful novel","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this movie. The direction was awful, and whoever wrote the screenplay should be highly ashamed of themselves. It does the book by Phillipa Greggory zero justice. The novel was wonderfully written, and I was really looking forward to seeing how the movie could portray the story. I recommend reading the book first, and perhaps even skipping the movie altogether. I believe with the right direction, production, and screenplay, this story could have been epic, for it is a partially true story, based on many recorded facts. Instead, we were served with a horrible depiction of a great novel. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AT ALL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...cheesy...poor casting choices","review":"Extremely bad....does not do justice to the well written book...Natalie Portman was miscast and delivered a terrible performance...but above all else...this movie held such a myopic, soap opera feel of the tudor times and did not have any court intrigue or players such as Wolsey, Duke of Norfolk...it was just like a love triangle, soap opera...terrible!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film if taken as a work of fiction","review":"I was a history major in college and was surprised by this storyline, or more surprised by people who believed it to be true. I haven't read the book but I took the movie as entertainment and a work of fiction and if judged by those standards you will love this beautiful, cunning tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST!","review":"This movie wasn't horrible, but I have seen other movies that depict this story much better, \\"Anne of The Thousand Days\\" for example. But this movie focused on Anne Boleyn, King Henry VIII and his relationship with both her and her sister, Mary. The acting wasn't that great, and if you want to see a truly OUTSTANDING Anne Boleyn performance, check out Natalie Dormer in Showtime's The Tudors!!! They should have picked HER for the role in this movie!! I went to see it because I love anything to do with the Tudor period, especially Henry VIII. But it is certainly not the best I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Boring & Trite.....","review":"I am glad that I didn't buy this movie and only saw it on dvd rental. The acting and costuming were great, but the story was boring & slow to watch if not predictable. We all know that Anne Boleyn was going to marry Henry VIII and be killed in the end by her own hubby. At least the parts in between could have been a tad more interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to smash my face with a rock","review":"Or better yet, smash the director's face. This movie was painful. Natatlie Portman was awful, the characters flat and lifeless, and even the movie's title makes me want to drift off to sleep. There is no reason to see this movie. Avoid it like a sledgehammer to the shins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this movie","review":"This movie played with history and the sisters motivations for doing what they did were muddy. While some of the actors were good (Scarlett Johanssen, Kristin Scott Thomas), the 2 main characters were not very believable. Hated Eric Bana as Henry VIII. He had no fire or passion and wasn't arrogant enough. And I just could not believe Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn. On the whole, skip it and watch The Tudors. Much better and in more depth rendition of same topic. Also, you could go back in time and rent/buy A Man For All Seasons if you really want to see Henry VIII (Peter O'Toole) and Thomas More (Paul Scofield) go at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Version","review":"None of the 3 principal characters had the gravitas to carry off their roles in my opinion. Especially Eric Bana. Normally I enjoy Eric Bana, but a Henry the VIII he is not.The other two girls (Portman, Johanssen) were only fair in their roles.The thing that really bugged me about this movie was the character of Mary Boleyn. In reality, she was not the meek, shy, virtuous girl portrayed by Scarlett Johanssen (the type of character she is not good at portraying anyway). Mary was a ribald character and was not at her sister's Anne's side faithfully thru all. In truth, the two sisters were not close.Too bad the film didn't choose to focus on the intense struggles between Rome and England, didn't go more into depth on Anne's fierce Protestant sympathies, and didn't delve into the remarkable personalities of Wolsey, Cromwell and Thomas More.This was more of a sentimental teenage version of the story (with major distortions) than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor representation","review":"This movie is inconsistent with any other history I have read or seen about Henry VIII and this period in England.The movie makes Mary out to be so innocent and timid when she is forced to go to the King's bed. Any others portray Mary as a wh*re in both the French Court and the English Court.The \\"Movie Tie-In\\" book by Gregory contains little to no similarities with the movie.The movie also makes very poor use of it's nearly 2 hours in providing any sort of in depth look into this period in Henry VIII's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn GirlThis movie may surprise you, if you have been watching the cable television series \\"The Tudors\\". It tells quite a different story of King Henry the VIII, and his wives. Eric Bana is very bland and uninteresting as the king, except at the moment when he turns his back on Mary Boleyn and his bastard son. Then, he finally shows some expression. Scarlet Johansson is excellent as Mary. Natalie Portman is great as Anne Boleyn, as equal to the task as Natalie Dormer on the series. I have to say the Jonathan Rhys Meyers makes a better Henry the VIII. The way the story plays out is interesting, and I will not spoil the ending. If you know the story of Henry the VIII, you know what happens to Anne Boleyn, anyway. It is a beautifully shot and costumed movie, and one worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stunk","review":"I usually like all things that have to do with the Tutors or Anne Boleyn, but this movie didn't cut it.Most of the characters were miscast for one.The way the story was told stunk.I read the book \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and enjoyed that, but this movie version was a waste.Guess after seeing \\"Anne of the Thousand Days\\" so many times, I am spoiled. That is the best Henry 8/Anne Boleyn movie ever.Only reason this movie gets 2 stars is the costumes and scenery were nice to look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"About what I expected...","review":"This movie was about what I expected of it - all hype and no substance. It was okay that it strayed from the book's plot, and the costumes were very good, but the story line and acting left a lot to be desired. It just doesn't show real passion in King Henry - for anything. Little to nothing is presented about Wolsey and the church, which would have given strength to the premise that the King went to the extent he did for Anne Boleyn. You just don't believe it. Johansson is nice, but Portman's acting is as flat as it was in Star Wars. I don't mind a different twist on a well known story, just make me believe it could happen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with others - disappointing","review":"I have to agree with many others on my disappointment with this movie, glad that I saw it on my trans-atlantic flight so didn't waste a dime.It did focus the most on Anne, especially towards the end. I really wanted to learn more about Mary because she seems to be the forgotten sister. I was watching with a friend and the timeline in the 2nd half of the movie went by so quickly that I had to explain most of the jumble of scenes that were happening...she had no idea what it all meant.Definitely not one that I will be adding to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A historical bodice ripper","review":"Over the years it seems like it has become a trend to cast popular american actresses as queens or european (mostly british) historical figures. The other boleyn girl is an example of this trend and succeeds on some levels and fails on others. The other boleyn girls deals with two close sisters who are torn apart by the ambitions of their father and uncle who come up with a plan to have one of them bed and become the mistress of the king whose relationship with his wife has gone downhill do to the fact she cant give him a son.Pros: The lovely cinematography enhances the feel of the film, The lovely costumes, The acting is great all the actors hit the right notes especially natalie portman as anne boleyn.Cons: The film lacks any scene were the characters are humane not just soap opera heros . The problem is the script .Ratings: 7.5/10 The other boleyn girl is very fast paced but lacks the dept of films like Marie Antoinette (2006) (yes I love this film so don't judge me !)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book turned Horrifying Film","review":"The book is a page turner that you don't want to put down or pull away from. It sucks you in, in an all encompassing way that's unforgettable. The film is something you want to run away from kicking and screaming. Another Hollywood disaster film based on an incredible book hoping to use the book as a launching pad to lure devoted fans of the book. Everyone from Scarlet Johansson to Natalie Portman to Eric Bana try to make due with the awful film but in the end, none of these fine actors can save this trainwreck of a poorly written adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time or money","review":"honestly watching this movie I felt like I was watching a feature length trailer for the actual movie.I got bored, so I turned it off, if you want a copy I'd happily sell you mine!The storyline is fragmented, neither Natalie nor Scarlett really excel in their characterisations; the supporting cast all appear (thankfully for their careers) anonymous.your money would be better spent on the DVD's of the SHO mini-series ...which we also had and enjoyed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine movie for cuddling with your sweetie","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is not an accurate historical lesson. It should not be viewed as fact. It is, however, entertaining. It has two beautiful women, an attractive man for them to fight over, and intrigue, manipulation, and power to spare.This movie is romantic and fanciful, and knowing what most people do about Henry VIII, it seems plausible. It tells the story of Mary and Anne Boleyn as they fight over the love of Henry VIII, and although much of it is obviously fictionalized, it's trashy soap opera-y fun.It's a perfect Valentine's Day movie for couples to enjoy together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the Book!","review":"I LOVE the book and all of the books by this author, however, in translating this story to the big screen, a lot of very pertinate details were lost. Also, the film makers changed the direction of the story and completely ignored some of the hard sort historicly based facts that make the book so addictive! My advice would be, if you've read the book DON'T watch the movie - you'll be dissapointed! If you haven't read the book, read it or watch the movie! As a piece in it's own right it is quite entertaining and the costumes, scenery and standard of acting are all really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent exciting DVD","review":"Enjoyed the DVD from start to exciting finish. It came on time and in condition shown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excelllent Reviews","review":"There is really nothing more I can say about the book nor the movie that hasn't already been said. I read the book, said I would never watch the movie. Well the movie came on public TV so I took a chance.I never pay attention to what the guide says about movies because I have found that many times my opinion differs. This time the guide said the movie was a soap opera. I should have paid attention to the guide. However I did watch the whole movie because I felt the challenge to try to remember what the book said so I could figure out what was going on in the movie.No to you purist this is not a review, but it is an expression of an opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly disappointed","review":"absolutely adored this book, and so upset with this movie. it skipped over so much, couldn't even come close to the depth of the book. can't believe that ms. gregory approved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Ok, Scarlett and Natalie were excellent and beautiful, obviously. The gowns were lustrous and winning. Everything else was horrid, honestly. Henry was flat and uninteresting, and the plot...oh my god. It was not only completely historically inaccurate, but this is a case where history is by far more interesting and sexy than the movie! How is that possible? Ask Hollywood...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Watch This Movie If You Read The Book","review":"If you have read the book this movie will be a huge disappointment, at least it was for me. I loved the book and held high hopes when the movie came out. It was the most awful movie adaption ever! Not only did they change the order of events they threw things in there that never even happened. Sure the movie was pretty, and the cast is great, but people who have read the book deserve better. I was ready to turn the movie off fourty minutes before the movie was due to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty movie but disappointing! Reaffirms why books trump movies.","review":"Despite a beautiful cast, lovely costumes, and pretty settings, this movie was disappointing. I read the book first and you should, too. If you have read it, please note that this movie does no justice to the book aside from giving you some idea of what those times may have been like. That said, I don't ever expect movies to be as good as books but this one takes the cake. Honestly, such a disappointment - they manage to put in maybe 1/3 of the storyline. It gets two stars for trying and for aesthetics. Otherwise, it sucks. I wanted to like this movie b/c I am a sucker for period pieces. Unfortunately, I think the Tudors (on Showtime) is doing more justice to this period and the book itself than this adaptation. Moving on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing adaptation of book","review":"What a disappointment this movie turned out to be!! I couldn't wait to purchase the DVD since I hadn't gotten to the movie theater to see it. I had found the book to be a fun read. The book was one of those stories that flowed easily and was enjoyable.The things that made the book so enjoyable (well drawn characters, a feeling of being \\"behind the scenes\\" to important historical events, well-paced storytelling) are completely lacking in the DVD version!!!If you are a fan of the book, or the Tudor series on cable, or if you are a history buff, this movie will completely disappoint you. The characters are so poorly brought to life. Dialog is wooden, as are the performances. Pivotal scenes are left out, while ridiculous new ones are added in. Even the costumes are pathetic!! If you've read the book, don't bother with the movie. If you haven't read the book, don't bother with the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointed","review":"I read the book so I just had to see the movie. They only vaguely resemble each other. The book is written from Mary's point of view, but the movie focused mostly on Anne. The plot of the movie (I use the term loosely) jumped around a lot and wouldn't have made sense to me if I hadn't read the book. I spent half my time while watching just filling in the gaps for my husband and daughter. They had not read the book and still felt this movie was a waste of a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This movie was TERRIBLE!!! I completely understand that it was historical fiction, and that is not what bothered me- my issue is that it was supposed to be based on the novel by Phillipa Gregory. I read the book just before seeing this movie and I do not think the two are connected AT ALL!!! I loved the book, but the movie was atrocious. I think the biggest issue was that they tried to turn a 660+ page book into a 2 hour movie- that just does not work. They skipped over too many important details (like that in the book Mary has 3 children by the King, and that Anne miscarries 3), and they changed too many more (in the book Anne and George do sleep together, and Anne conceives by George but miscarries the monstrocity that results). All-in-all, terrible script, terrible acting.. the only redeeming quality of this film is the constumes. Don't even waste your time- read the book instead, or watch The Tudors."},{"rating":"1","title":"And this was based on the novel in what way?","review":"The casting brilliant, the costuming obviously done in conjunction with the BBC, even the cinematography was superb, but it had NOTHING to do with Philipa Gregory's rather brilliant novelization of the most scintilating period of English history.I bought the film knowing that it would be at best a watered down version of the book, time constraints, ad nauseum, but I had hoped it would at least be coherant. It isn't.If one approaches the movie, forgetting that these people actually lived and changed the course of the Catholic Church in England, for a romantic escape, you should be well pleased. If you ARE familiar with the actual events; do NOT do this to yourself. An absolute waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"B for Boleyn or Betty?","review":"If you read the book then you are in for a huge disappointment. Anne is not played with half as much cunning as she is portrayed in the novel. The mother is something of a feminist and stands up for her children rather than plays a submissive woman. It is one thing to have so many historical inaccuracies but to have so many inaccuracies that relate to the novel as well is just ridiculous. Why make the crappy movie at all?The costumes are beautiful. The Americans trying to mingle with the British is okay. I also think it a bit funny that Anne's necklace is the same one that can sometimes be seen worn by America Ferrera's character on Ugly Betty. I'd rather watch Ugly Betty anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie buff","review":"very slow a true dud i asked my sister did she want it. i wanted it out of collection so bad i asked if i can pay her to pick it up. she did not thou sent it to her in the mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood run amok again","review":"If you have read the Philippa Gregory novel, watched \\"The Tudors\\" on Showtime, or know anything about Anne Boleyn, you will be throwing bricks at the screen within five minutes. Philippa Gregory tries to \\"fill in the gaps\\" in her novels, but essentially doesn't mess around with history. Hollywood, for some reason unbeknownst to me, cheerfully rewrites history to suit its own ideas of character development or conflict. Please. When you are dealing with one of the most compelling chapters in all history, you don't have to rewrite it!I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The acting was lackluster, the direction disjointed, and the pacing erratic. Please, Hollywood, if you can't do it right, leave it to A&E; or someone else who will actually tell the story right."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was better","review":"I will keep it short and simple. The movie was beautiful in its good acting and cinematogrophy, but the book is better by a longshot. Save your time for something better, SKIP THE MOVIE AND READ THE BOOK! The book is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"The only way this horrible movie could be more historically inaccurate is if they said it took place in another country with monkeys or something. The producers intend to show how women in a different era were debased for ambition. But with their historical inaccuracies they once again debase Anne Boleyn but on a much wider scale then Henry VIII could've dreamt. He was in reality a narcissist and serial adulterer who would kill or accuse a wife of anything to be rid of her. This movie claims a lot of the rumors he created about Anne were true and reported by people without machiavellian motivations. In the process they debase a woman who happened to be vaguely successful in her ambitions, while rewriting history to glorify women of the court who lived dark and petty lives. Phillipa Gregory and the producers should all get jobs at McDonalds. The product would be about the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book are still better than the movies","review":"I was extremely excited after reading Gregory's book that they were going to be making a movie. I was rather hopeful that they didnt butcher it. Honestly they didnt do such a horrible job.The costumes were amazing and very well done. I felt the cast was well-picked although no one seems to get King Henry right. This was my problem with the TV series \\"The Tudors\\". The movie was almosat historically correct and well realistically the script wasnt that bad. It could've been better,I wasnt disappointed with the movie.

The first time I watched it, I was shocked at how much they'd left out, and how fast the storyline moved forward. I would have rated it 3 stars if I hadn't watched it again.Original story aside, the movie is very well done and the costuming is beautiful. Who would have thought that I'd think Henry VIII is sexy? Nice choice of actor for that role. Watching it a second time, for those who haven't read the book, will allow you catch more of the subtleties (sp?) that explain the actions of the players. They're easy to miss on the first run through because you're following the broader storyline instead.Well worth watching (a couple times) but forget the book and just enjoy the movie for its own merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this....?!","review":"This was about the longest movie ever made, and there was no acting in it at all.

It even beats out \\"The Tudors\\" in it's inaccuracies and outright fictionalizations.They completely miss the mark on the time-line, the ages of the characters; they skim over important events, they portray main characters falsely - in short, they totally screw up this movie. If you are going to do an historical film, you should make it as true to history as possible.The historical truth of Henry VIII, Anne and Mary is much more compelling and fascinating than this tripe.

A better choice is Anne of the Thousand Days. The story is told with a far superior script, and cinematography. Richard Burton as King Henry VIII is outstanding.

I've seen better costumes on sale at the Halloween store. No one making this movie was interested in the facts.Anne, Mary, Henry, Katherine, how could they not be rolling in their graves? The accounts are there. I'm sorry that some people will actually believe that this is the way that it was. Books. Go read some books.

People often fail to realize that when they are watching a movie they should be watching for entertainment-for factual accounts, watch a documentary. Lord knows that there are plenty out there. I think all the characters were cast well, especially Norfolk. My only historical nitpicks are that: 1. Mary was the oldest (we think, for the most part) 2. Wolsey should have been in there and 3. They make it seem like he hated her from the moment he married her...even before. They could have at least waited until the first miscarriage.Lighten up, history buffs.Just one American's Opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"The other Boleyn girl","review":"In 2 hours nobody can really get the story as given in the book.Movie was about Henry's word of honor.

I used an ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING videographer, Maria Quiroga, whose name I got from the book. Quiroga's prices were TOTALLY OFF in the book, however, and Quiroga had never been contacted by the authors. She was surprised to see her name listed. The book also listed the Chemist's Club, which is a pretty little place, but too small for all but the smallest weddings.

Quite to the contrary this is a great game for anyone that enjoyed AOE. Manipulating the evil Galactic Empire to your own purposes is a lot of fun.The 'T'een rating may be deserved on this one as a \\"dying\\" character screams out in pain. Otherwise this is an enjoyable game.As a final note...Online players seem to be struggling with adapting to some changes to the game. Please be sure to update your game with a free patch to fix a few small problems before attempting to play on-line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really better than some people think","review":"I am amazed at how people say this is 'AOE:Star Wars'. Yes, SWGB is built on the AOE engine, but the additional features added significantly alter the 'physics' of gameplay from AOE. This is done by the addition of power cores, sheild generators, submarine and aerial warfare. Certainly there are many parallels, but to say it's the same old same old is not accurate. Additionaly, SWGB uses the updates found in the AOEII expansion pack, so you do not spend your time managing all resources- you can queue farms, workers begin working after building their structure, etc. Certainly there are differences, but that's just more handy for those of us who actually have a life and use video games as a diversion- it's a pleasure not to memorize new keyboard mappings, cost structures, etc.This game is certainly worth the money, but your significant other may not thank you for it (if they dig on spending time with you :) )!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game but could be better","review":"This is a solid RTS game. However it simply copies too much from AGE OF EMPIRES. I Like AOE but there are times when your playing the game and you will be thinking, 'Man they didn't change anything'. Contrary to popular belief the graphics are good. The different races they have are intersting, especially for a STAR WARS fan. However, there is one serious problem that also affected AOE. The problem is the races don't vary enough for long term playabilty. Sure they tweek the races here and there so that one may gather a certain resource faster or one has better pilots, but there is no real difference in the various troops from race to race. LISTEN UP RTS MANUFACTURERS ALL RTS GAMES SHOULD TAKE A CUE FROM STARCRAFT and take on the challenge of making the races truely distinct at every level but at the same time keeping them balanced. That is the only way to make a classic RTS game. This is solid game but it is no classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars plus AOEII - What can be better?","review":"I bought this game and it is incredible. I have fully enjoyed it so far. If you are familiar with AOEII, then this game will be easy for you. It is exciting to learn all the new technologies and units but more fun to see the civilizations come alive on the screen. The only down-side is that there are only currently 6 civs to play or fight against so your options are limited but I expect this to be increased with expansion packs in the future (I hope!!). However, the number of options for units, maps, and techs will keep your interest. Play style is identical to AOEII, graphics and sound are fine, and overall this game combines one of the best genres of games with one of the best sci-fi/fantasy worlds of all time. If you are a RTS gamer or a fan of Star Wars then this game is for you.

It was clearly made to be as similar to Age of Kings as possible. Yeah, it's pretty cool to select some Tie Fighters and tell them to attack, or to move around an At-At, but I'm sorry, Wookies, Naboo and Gungans are all lame. It suffers from all the same problems as Age Of Kings:- Really really slow action, where everything takes forever- Sound is really bad. It sounds sample from someone's VHS copy of Star Wars- Missions are boring- Too many units- So many resources that you spend all your time making drones to chop down trees.Additionally:- The graphics are sub-par. The color palletes for things are not right and there's a lot of dithering. It looks really bad.- Each \\"race\\" is essentially exactly the same as the others.

There really was only one problem. This would be that it is a total clone of Age of Empires 2. It is the AoE game engine set in a Star Wars galaxy. The units are exactly the same. For example, there is a unit in AoE that is called the ram, it is resitant to arrows and destroys buildings. In Star Wars there is a unit called a pummel. It is resitant to lasers and destroys sturctures. This sounds pretty similar, right? I suggest that you buy Age of Empires, and you love it, to buy this game. You should try AoE out first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Age of Empires 3???","review":"As an avid Star Wars fan I was extremely excited for the release of this game. I knew it would have some AOE flare based on the screen shots but I underestimated just how much flare it'd have. There's even a paragraph in the manual that addresses AOE players.

I wouldn't pay good money for this game. Like the editorial review says, the graphics are Outdated (EXTREMELY) and flat. I expect more from RTS games these days with folks like westwood setting the bar. This looks like a game you might have considered playing five years ago. I guess if you are a hardcore fan you'll enjoy this, but I found the downsides to the game too much to consider shelling out any clams for the game. Gameplay is somewhat poor. Sounds quality is cheesy and sounds like it was lifted from a bad HBO copy of A New Hope.The box looks sharp, but don't let it fool you, it isn't worth your time.

This is a classuc that you will want to read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Carol Channing and Marilyn Monroe: go to the source","review":"It's impossible to hear this title without thinking of the stage musical with Channing or the later film version of it with Monroe. But Loos's novel is one of the funniest books of the twentieth century, and was beloved by everyone from James Joyce to Santayana. It's all told from Lorelei Lee's diary as she conquers New York, London, Paris, and (hardest of all) the Philadelphia Main Line, entirely by dint of her charm and comeliness. Lorelei is no fool, and exploits the desires of the old men who meet her to get all the jewels and orchids she can dream of, but nonetheless she remains very much an innocent--which is the greatest wellspring of the book's appeal. And her cynical friend Dorothy's sidecomments (which Lorelei frequently quotes) are absolutely hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much of a fan","review":"I tried, I really did.

The only reasons to buy this CD are Paul McCartney, Carole King, and the Clientele, and you can probably get those songs on one of their recordigs.

The stitching is good (no holes or loose thread), material is strong & stretchy (comfortable), & my son loves it. The mask is a little hard to breathe thru, but, hey it's Spiderman, it's supposed to be close to your face. My son just lifts the mask up when he wants to.

The description claims they are for 11-14 but the packaging says 12-14. At any rate, this costume is so tight on him it's embarrassing even without using the spongey chest and abs insert. And he's a skinny kid. Also, the mask is made out of some type of spongey material. I think an elastic cloth would've been a better choice. He can't even wear the mask because he can't breath with it on and it smooshes his nose. If your child is maybe 9- or 10-years-old, this might be a good choice, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead battery","review":"Battery arrived in a thin plastic bag as a mailer. The battery had no bubble wrap. The package did have a \\"fragile\\" sticker on it. My hope is that an elephant didn't sit on it through the mail process.

This book is written for readers of Soldiers of Fortune who think the NRA is perhaps a little too left wing. Keep in mind it's basically a comic book, and you may enjoy the fast paced action.

Donna was nnecessary. Donna fired back at her critics with the silky, sleek, glamourous album: \\"I Remember Yesterday\\". Here there's swing and scat in the title track, girl group power in \\"Love's unkind\\" and \\"Back in Love Again \\"(a re-write from Donna's days at Oasis) and the funky drive of the belting tune \\"Black Lady\\". There are more surprises like the symphonic and sexy \\"Take Me\\", the memorable classic ballad \\"Can't We just Sit Down\\" and of course, that techno wonder; \\"I Feel Love\\". Yesterday will leave you with sweet memories of Summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Concept Album","review":"I really admire Donna Summer's releases, especially from 1975-1979. I Remember Yesterday is a good album that has Mrs. Summer reflecting on the various musical styles of the 20th centry. The first four songs are from the past while the other songs were the current soul and disco sounds of that particular time. I recommend this album. And I like the fact that I can purchase it as an mp3 for my cellphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FOOTBALL GAME OUT THERE!","review":"This is truly the best football game out there today. I wrote a review for NFL 2K5 which is another great title but this is better. This game has the best graphics for a football game to date. It also has some very nice touches. It has wonderful commentery and lots of stuff that makes the franchise mode a really cool experience. It has a nice online mode also. One of the coolest things to this game is the all new system that you can make your crowd cheer for you makeing a advantage for you. So homefield advantage does help. This game is definitly better then Madden 2005 from what I heard. Personally I rather pay 20 bucks for NFL 2K5 but if you have $50.00 do your self a favor and get this game instead of Madden 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"Optimism Central","review":"This game comes from a long line of excellent College Football games and promises to continue in that tradition while tweaking in some new features to keep the overall feel of the game collegiate while upping the entertainment value for the player.The matchup stick, which will allow users to see how different players match up with the opposition can allow the player to seek out mismatches and exploit opposing defenses -much like college coaches try to do.Obviously, until the game comes out, this review is as much a guess as anything else-but EA has consistently put out the best football games-and NCAA should follow in this vein. One thing I, as an LSU fan, am interested in seeing is who the game ranks #1, the AP Champion USC Trojans or the LSU Tigers, the BCS champs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Football Game To Date","review":"They just keep making this game better and better. Pure fun to play, NCAA 06 is the best football game (pro or college) to be made to date. You will literally find yourself playing for hours on end. Start a dynasty, place a season, create yourself and try to earn a scholarship and then try to bring home the Heisman. This is an excellent game that is a must own."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Disc Is Not This Game But A Movie","review":"I ordered this game as a Christmas gift and when my son went to play it, it is not the football game but a movie is on the disc instead. Has anyone else experienced this? The movie is, 13 Going On 30, and there is not a PS2 game on this disc. Needless to say I am trying to get my money back from the Amazon seller but this is extremely maddening. I do not understand how such a mistake could be made by the manufacturer and not caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game is Awesome!","review":"This game is amazing! The new features are way better than ever before! From the home-field advantage to the create a fan, this game has really improved over the year!

I am a big fan of the EA College Football series and expected 2005 to be an improved version of the 2004 game. Not the case. While EA has added cool new features (described in other reviews on this site), they made exiting parts of the game worse. Loads times are dramatically increased. The best offensive plays from the 2004 playbooks are not in the 2005 playbooks. Recruiting has been improved by new features and worsened by changes that have no apparent reason (perhaps so we'll feel were getting an entirely different game). The recruiting interface is dramatically worse (i.e. more cumbersome). My message to EA would be \\"we love EA college football, make it better not just different\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the Hype","review":"The last version of NCAA football that I owned was 2003 which was great. My friend called me and said how great the game was so I rented it. 2005 added a few items to the game since '03 then but lost a lot in the process. They added a large number of 1AA teams to the game which I like but the memory it used doing it hurt the rest of the game. The gameplay is awful. The varsity level which used to be a challenge in the past installments is a joke (I beat Syracyse with Rutgers 48 to nothing). The biggest issue with the game is that 70% of all passes are dropped. So making a big passing play is almost impossible. I found running the ball to be too easy and my D would always dominate the other team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game, But Don't Rush to Get It If You Have 2004","review":"The biggest reason to get newer additions of this game is updated rosters. As a huge OU fan, that makes it worth my money, but you won't notice any significant differences from last year's 'model.' That makes sense. EA shouldn't make any significant changes to a game that is already fantastic.A couple of interesting features:1. You can see individual matchups between players. This helps you with playcalling to focus on mismatches.2. You can alter the formations in your team's playbook, giving you different sets of plays to choose from. You can't choose the individual plays within the formation, but there are a ton of different formations available. This gives you a ton of playcalling choices.BOTTOM LINE: If you HAVE to have updated rosters (like I do!), buy the game. If you don't have the 2004 version, buy the game (the online component is a must have). Otherwise, I wouldn't put it at the top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best NCAA Title Yet","review":"I have only had this game for 24 hours and already I'm convinced that it is the best title in the EA NCAA franchise. I thought the same thing about last year's game too, but the new features this year blow 2004 away. I especially like the new hard tackle feature and the home field advantage. The controls are a little more difficult to master with some of the additions, but I don't think that needing in a little extra practice to grasp every little controller feature will upset anyone. The only downside is the voice talent. I guess the ESPN crew didn't want to spend as much time in the booth because some of the comments are plain-as-day taken from 2004. Other than that, this game is as good as they come."},{"rating":"2","title":"dude, sweet game, dude","review":"Whooaaaaaaa!!! What a great game! NCAA Football 2005 has home feild advantage, over 300 teams, and very good gameplay. I have played it. It is better than Madden dude. Dude, i love this game dude. Rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"needs some improvements","review":"there is one thing it must have in 2005 if I'm going to buy it.In Dynasty mode, when you create your schedule at the beginning of the year, you must play X number of games in your conference, and you can't change them. In 2003, Michigan did not play Penn State or Wisconsin. So, even if I play 20 years of Dystany football with Michigan, I can NEVER play against PSU or WI.I would also like to see being able to switch players' positions. If I have 8 guards rated at 99, and 2 centers at 50, I can't cut the centers and have one of the guards move over.And it would be cool to see Michigan run out of the tunnel, hitting the GO BLUE banner on the way out.New audio clips really needed to be added. I've played a lot of hours on 2004, and I'm really sick of hearing the same comments over and over and over again.Let's hope 2005 improve these areas, and I'll be happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poco: Crazy Eyes","review":"...audio quality not up to par....had forgotten the only songs I ever liked on the album were the last three....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Furay's Finale With Poco","review":"This was the fifth and final studio album to include founding member Richie Furay, who contributed only two songs: a nearly ten-minute tribute to Gram Parsons, \\"Crazy Eyes,\\" and the closing track, \\"Let's Dance Tonight.\\"The other band members continue to mature as songwriters. Rusty Young adds the bluegrass-flavored instrumental \\"Fools Gold.\\" Timothy B Schmidt offers the lovely ballad \\"Here We Go Again.\\" On his third album with the band, Paul Cotton has two songs: the country/rocker \\"Blue Water\\" and the hard-driving \\"A Right Along.\\" The album is rounded out with two covers: a lovely Gram Parsons ballad \\"Brass Buttons\\" and J.J. Cale's gorgeous \\"Magnolia.\\"Poco would continue to record for another ten years and even have a few hit singles after Furay's departure, but they were never as good without him. And, unfortunately, Furay's post-Poco career never really caught fire. As such, I've always treasured his work with Poco--it's among his best. RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poco's Best Album","review":"CRAZY EYES is Poco's finest recorded moment, period. It's basically a culmination of what the band had been working up to since forming in 1968, and, along with the Allman Brothers Band's BROTHERS AND SISTERS, the Marshall Tucker Band's first three albums, and the Outlaws anthology BEST OF THE OUTLAWS: GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES, one of the best country-rock albums of all time. The main problem that kept this album from selling well among country-rock fans is that the Allman Brothers Band's BROTHERS AND SISTERS and the Marshall Tucker Band's self-titled debut were getting all the attention in 1973 in country-rock circles, so this one got left out in the cold. That's unfortunate, since it's just as good as those two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Known Gem","review":"As innovative as the Byrds and with twice the talent of the Eagles, Poco remains one of rock's most underrated groups. Crazy Eyes is not as simple and sunny as some of their earlier classic country-rock albums, but the patient listener will be rewarded. Close your eyes and let Brass Buttons and Magnolia take you to deep bittersweet places in your heart. Timothy B Schmidt's voice is as smooth as ever on Here We Go Again, and Richie Furey shows again why he deserved to play along side Stills and Young in Buffalo Springfield. This album is impossible to categorize and is not for everyone but i'm still appreciating it after 25 yrs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnolia....favorite song ever recorded","review":"As a longtime lover of southern rock, the cut \\"Magnolia\\" is truely a southern experience.

In its day it was a groundbreaking exemplification of Southern Rock at it finest. Perhaps it is just that this music does not hold up that well over time. Perhaps it is that so many other groups have more successfully explored this genre since Poco. Maybe it is that this CD doesn't really display a mix that merits 5.1 re-release.

I found his treatment of African-Americans in the sport, the nascent development of a players' union, and the import of the Mexican League to be excellent. The greatest strength of his book, however, are the vignettes of players whose lives were changed, some positively, others cruelly by their war experiences. These men, especially those who did \\"not make it,\\" were crafted with great poignancy. I love baseball and found myself compelled by this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mid East Meets the Mid West in a Battle of Laughs","review":"What a riot!

Travelling abroad is ripe for comic attack as, I am sure, is putting together a basketball team in Saudi Arabi. It's too bad that the writer couldn't make any of the humor flow.

These are updated versions of 10 of his songs recorded in 1963. I love the new versions, and Breathless, without question, is much better than the original hit, faster and with more intensisty. Same is true for Great Balls, Shakin', and HS Confidential. Don't get me wrong, I like the originals too, but these remakes are a vital part of my collection.Actually, my mom got this album in 1963 and this is what I grew up listening too before I even knew the original versions, so maybe I'm a little partial.And be sure to get the 1989 Great Balls of Fire movie soundtrack for some more awesome remakes of his hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daewoo is BAD","review":"It was a wonderful set.Great price, great picture.

Pharoahe easily outshines Jigga and DMX and other more popular artists who came out with chart topping albums this year. I'd say that Pharoahe is just as conscious and clever as Mos Def is lyrically, but Pharoahe's music and style is just more high powered and bumping.

Well I'll start with the word amazing, for the way Pharoahe introduces in an amazing mix of lyrics and metaphors that runs circles around you're brain. Impressive, for the guest talent that Monch brings in from his fellow hip-hoper's Talib Kweli, Common & Shabaam Shadeeq to some of rap's finest talent such as Canibus, M.O.P., Busta Rhymes, Redman And Method Man.

I think, after having done a intervention on someone in my husband's family, the book oversimplifies the whole process. There are many issues that cropped up for us that the book did not cover.

The mast is a piece of cardboard you need to roll up. How exactly do you roll cardboard? The game is neat - the little pieces are nicely detailed. The board is a folded piece of paper (maybe this is where they should have used the cardboard) and the istuctions are to simplistic to follow (we added our own).

It was enough to keep me reading to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased, but a little unsatisfied..","review":"Over all I think it is well worth a read. Very enjoyable but for one thing. Toward the end, Mared starts to really annoy me. Through the whole book it seems as if Payton begs for her love and she just keeps throwing/pushing it away. For me the end would have been a bit more solid had she been made to \\"grovel\\" for more then two seconds. I know this sounds harsh but I think people will understand once they've read the book. To be honest, I hurt for Payton so much, that at certain points in the book I really believed he deserved better than Mared.So for me, it was a good read. But I perfer better balance of \\"power\\" with the two main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say it but this was awful!","review":"I was really looking forward to this one but I have to say that it is a complete letdown. The part that I especially did not like was at the end when the heroine goes to the city and leaves are hero behind. Anyway are heroine trys to catch herself a husband and it is not the main hero! So I just could not belive that she was actually in love with him I mean at the very end she is contemplating marrying a man who just wants some fun on the side.He announces his engagement to someone else and then our heroine sees that she is not going to get that one so then she runs back to the man with the broken heart! Please! this was so not a romance in my opinion she only got with the main hero becasue the other guy at the end announced his engagement. I felt so sorry for the guy I mean he is the second choice for God's sake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Toy of poor quality and playability.

But, the story itself to me was a little well whack. First, i read the whole book so I'm speaking on the overall book. To me Anya was portrayed to be strong but she put up with a lot of things and it made her look weak. Then, Neil he wanted everything. The only reason he even gave Dani up was because Anya FINALLY put her foot down and was like you can't see her at all. Dani had to come in the house half naked for her to even realize that. Then, the whole time Dani didn't realy hide the fact that she wanted Neil and Anya was like just dealing with it. I don't know maybe because I've never been married I dont' understand.

Then she goes on to try and give advice to the Dani and Vette, I'm thinking to myself how can you give advice and your situation is out of the ordinary. She's very passive. She not strong-willed in any way. She doesn't get \\"tired\\" of being used. This book was not realistc in any form. Even though there are situations where peole \\"deal\\" with certain things, but she never drew the line, it was one thing after the next. This book is really boring. It doesn't get you attention like it should. I'm going to go ahead and finish this book because I'm a avid reader. But I don't think I'll buy any of her books.

It was the best show I've ever seen. At the time, they didn't have a soundtrack. But then, about a month later, I received a CD that had four songs on it from the show in the mail. I knew that I had to get the whole soundtrack. I couldn't find it anywhere for about a year, and then I looked on Amazon.com and-there it was! This is the best CD I've ever gotten. It's very unusual because that I'd never seen (or heard) anything like this before. Now I go to school singing the songs, and my friends sing with me (at least the parts they know). I love Turtle and Mouse, the way they sing--they have such strong voices. The lyrics to every song are catchy and humorous, and are just happy. I would recommend this CD for everyone who likes catchy, jazzy, funny songs. You just gotta love Frog and Toad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"This CD has a permanent place in the pantheon of music everyone in our family enjoys and after a year we're still loving it. The music is a delight and lyrics clever. You don't need to see the musical to appreciate it. The songs tell the Frog and Toad stories so well anyone can enjoy them.

(I'm 65 and found it magical!) Although I sure it's better to see the show than just hear it, this cast recording captures the energy of the show quite well. Most importantly, the valuable message of the show comes through very well on this recording.

His book reflects a deep knowledge of sport in a manner which avoids the usual technical cravass that so many fencing writers fall into. The book is the only guide I know of that can allow a high school or college coach to develop a true group program. Historically, fencing has been largely been a matter of one-on-one instruction, and this has obviously been a problem for school or community programs. It is accessible and technically accurate. The comments on competitive fencing are extremely insightful and valuable to any level of fencer. While there are many approaches to fencing, Selberg's style is simple and effective - based on years of competitive experience and training with a number of European masters including the great Hungarian, George Piller."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE BLU RAY TRANSFER FOR TOTAL RECALL/T2 IS OK!","review":"I was really disappointed with the Blu ray transfer of Total Recall.

Her shading of the vocal line is one of a kind. Their dialogue together is so moving.Then there's Leonie Rysanek, brief perhaps, but that voice soars with freedom and richness.Von Karajan's youthful energy is in evident too.Listening to this recording one does wish it was attached to acts 1 & 2.

Documents can be saved as JPEG or, if preferred, PDF among other formats. Each are easy to use. The fax machine part of the printer is a little harder to use and I still haven't gotten the hang of receiving faxes, but sending faxes is a snap. Print quality is great.

Some of the parellels drawn on other events were never connected or explained. Like the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end the war there. A lot of the attempted recreations were also poorly done.

This wouldn't be the first time I've had such a problem with LucasArts games when they first come out.Not a bad game, but if you're looking at it, I'd recommend waiting for patches to come out and the price to drop some more. Otherwise, you're taking your chances with compatibility, etc.(Oh! Also, you definitely need a joystick or gamepad to play.

What an LP it was, and what a CD it is. After nearly forty years, such songs as \\"Ramblin' Boy\\", \\"The Last Thing On My Mind\\", and \\"Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound\\" remain classics. They're complemented by such fine songs as \\"Goin' To the Zoo\\" (one of the great songs ever written for children), \\"When Morning Breaks\\", and \\"I'm Bound For the Mountains and the Sea\\". Paxton has always written his share of topical/political songs, which, by their nature, don't age well; that's the case with \\"Daily News\\", \\"What Did You Learn In School Today?\\", and \\"A Rumblin' In the Land\\". The other songs, though, are as fresh today as they were in 1965, and the arrangements for guitar, bass, and either another guitar or a banjo are exquisite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book.","review":"I could not put this book down.

The subject matter fascinates me. but I just couldn't bear the stupidity of the writing. It feels like a TV documentary --- nothing is actually explained just as what it is. Instead everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, has to analogized and anthropomorphized. Nothing is ever simply stated if, instead, it can be presented in the form of an interview with another scientist.Look, if you enjoy science TV documentaries, maybe you'll love it. But if you can't stand stuff so dumbed down as not to be threatening to a 12 year old, give this a miss. Go read Sean Carroll's _Endless Forms Most Beautiful_, or Andrew Knoll's _Life on a Young Planet_, which are both fine examples of how to write popular science in a way that isn't irritating beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honest effort, but I wasn't into it.","review":"This cd was my least favorite by far. I do have all of their cds and I think they are great at what they do for sure, but for me, this cd only had about 3-4 songs that I liked, and out of those songs, none of them are my favorite Jam. songs. The cd is not bad, I just like the upper tempo, more layered songs more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"Jay Kay's lilting tenor and the band's funky dance grooves are as tight as they get on Space Cowboy. The best segment of this cd is probably the opening quartet of tracks. The Return of the Space Cowboy is a sweet opener, it's cool and melifluous, getting the listener in the mood. Stillness In Time is pretty different from anything I've heard by Jamiroquai before. It's really a beautiful track that's quite a surprise. Half the Man is amazing as well, probably my favorite song on the cd. Light Years is decent then it just blows up into this ridiculously funky hook that is really amazing. The cd looses steam a bit after these first 4 beauties, but it finishes up strong with tracks like Mr. Moon and Just Another Story. Fans of Jamiroquai should definately check this cd out. For people making a first encounter with Jamiroquai, I recommend their hit album, Traveling Without Moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAMIROQUAI DOES IT AGAIN!!!!","review":"Jamiroquai does it again. He delivers a strong puch with its hit single Space Cowboy. This cd expresses living free and attacking the days of the new. Jamiroquai is now though drifting out of the enviromental stuff that he strived for in Emergency on Planet Earth. Also another hit single Half the Man that breaks a heart of some lovers of Jason Kay. Buy this and complete your collection. Because this is a hard cd to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album with a nice vibe.","review":"As a child of the 70's, I missed the old school sound of Earth Wind and Fire and Stevie Wonder. I wondered whether anyone would be able to pick up where they left off. This album answered that question in the affirmative. With great grooves and Jay Kay's smooth vocals,and a surprising depth , this is a good buy for those who miss the old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say is: it just sucked..","review":"With the same funk-disco style, yet without rythem or tone, Return of the Space Cowboy is a total flop. Most of the songs are unintresting, and as one song finishes and another starts, it seems as though it is the same song repeating, yet it is not. The lyrics are boring and it appears that Kay almost adlibbed the entire album, his voice is in no way related to the beat, he just goes off on his own, as if he were singing alone without any instruments, and added the music later. This is one CD not to waste money on.. I find it hard even looking at it without wanting to throw it as hard as I possibly can at the wall. If it was not for the cool title and weird guy on the cover with a hat, as well as a cool name for the band, there would be no stars for this sucker. In fact, I find it hard to listen to Kay's voice on this CD, I can only respect his kick ass hat..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album lacks everything except mediocrity.","review":"Don't waste your time and money with this clowns.

I didn't give this CD much play when I first purchased it. It was just okay. Then I popped it in a few years later and WOW - I'm hearing grooves that I hadn't noticed before. Maybe I wasn't ready for it when it first came out. \\"Space Cowboy,\\" \\"Stillness In Time,\\" and - my favorite - \\"Mr. Moon\\" are outstanding. The beats, the instrumentation, everything is so good. I only wish Stu Zender and Toby Smith were still playing with the band. Their bass and keyboard playing, respectively, really makes this CD shine. This is by far their best effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the 70's and the 90's put together","review":"It's rare that music can make you get up and move, and stimulate the mind at the same time.Jamiroquai managed to do that on \\"Space Cowboy\\" in the tradition of the best disco/jazz/rock fusion of the 70's but layered with turntable sampling and youthful rock bounciness.The music is rich, eclectic but always powerful and fun.There is the same knowledgeable mix as in mid-70's soul jazz, of soulful melodies,twirling synths, jazzy vocal scats, exotic percussions, syncopated beats, flutes, sax,etc.We travel through Space, Brazil, the Amazon, we walk down funky alleys, bounce off a dancefloor and we finally smoothly lift off into another groovy expedition.One of the best works of the 90's.Good vibes for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing EVER!","review":"The title pretty much says it all.

And listen to the singer!","review":"Ya, ya, ya we all know that Yngwie is the boy genius who can never do wrong and be assured, if your a guitar freak, its probably Ynqwie's best metal album. BUT NO ONE EVER GIVES CREDIT FOR THE SINGERS HE WORKS WITH! Jeff Scott Soto kick ass in this album!!! This guy has pipes of steel!!! As a vocal coach, I can tell you this voice has technique, range, power and impact. The vocals on these tracks are just as impressive as the guitars. If you like strong rock singers that don't burp and growl, but fly to the sky with after burners blazing, buy it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's a Viking.......I guess????","review":"I was a big fan of Yngwie Malmsteen's third album \\"Trilogy\\" so I picked up his other acclaimed 80's disks. Of the first 3, I have to say \\"Marching Out\\" is the weakest. The songs are repetitive, and nothing really stands out on the disk except for the single \\"I'll See The Light Tonight\\". The rest of the disk features some decent guitar work, but it's almost like Malmsteen's guitar is wedged into songs where it doesn't really fit. Tunes like \\"Disciples of Hell\\", \\"Anguish and Fear\\" and \\"I Am A Viking\\" are just calling out for a slow, Black Sabbath like guitar track as opposed to Malmsteen's blisting hair-metal-esque style. There is plenty of talent here for sure, but it's not channeled in the right direction. \\"Trilogy\\" seemed to capture the band at the top of their game, and everything came together. \\"Marching Out\\" feels as if the band is still trying to find their sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as when I was a teen","review":"I loved this album...just as good as it was when I was a teen ager. Even my kids liked the guitar riffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARCHING OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"***** - FIVE STARS===================This is excellent. \\"Marching Out\\" has to be considered Malmsteen's greatest release. This is heavier than I remember it being, but then again, that was back when I had it on cassette in the 80's. The music on \\"Marching Out\\" has aged very well too. Even with today's Metal re-emergence, \\"Marching Out\\" should be a mandatory listen to the younger headbangers coming of age in my opinion. \\"Marching Out\\" is a vital piece of the early years in Metal. It's a classic, and it's as simple as that...Great stuff. This is where Malmsteen really shreads!!!...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very much looking forward to hearing this CD, but it was a very big disappointment.

If I had been shaving at the time, I would never have given up this razor.This was, without a doubt, the greatest shave of my life (well, maybe next to getting a straight shave with hot foaming cream and a neck massage). I had been using the Gillette Fusion and the Mach 3 before that. This blade puts those to shame. You will get a close shave with not nearly as much skin irritation.

I find those to be the best so far. Now however they might work well, but for the price? no its not really worth it. Thats the main reason i wanted to give the senor excel a try because i wanted to find a more affordable razor.

Who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer's Storybook Masterpiece","review":"Donna Summer ruled the dancefloor in the 70's, and this album is a prime example of why. Donna's work with Giorgio Moroder & Pete Bellotte was groundbreaking & Once Upon a Time is a trip through the synthesized world of disco music, with some powerful ballads as well. Anyone familiar with the \\" Now I Need You/ Working the Midnight Shift\\" medley will agree this is one of the most beautiful arrangements in disco music. True she doesn't display her vocal talents to their fullest potential in the danceable tracks, she still delivers a very srong performance overall. I HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone curious to experience the electronic disco sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Least Technical Review","review":"I'm writing from the heart on this one. I don't care for all of Ms. Summer's music and styles, but my mother adored this album when it came out in the late 70's. In listening to the songs on this CD, it brings every romantic notion a young girl dreamt of during the time the songs were hits. Ms. Summer's musical range is astounding and some of the emotion in her singing, quite moving.I highly recommend it, as well as her anthology CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAIRY TALE LOW","review":"This album is just about the cheesiest thing ever put on record. Now, I love Donna Summer but I think this is just about her worst album ever. When you set about to make a theme album and you purposely try to write songs about one topic it is painfully obvious and it sounds really forced. \\"I Love You\\" and \\"Rumour Has It\\" are the exceptions. While not her best work, they don't grate on your nerves like some of the other songs on this album do. You would do better to check out \\"Bad Girls\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", or \\"Cats Without Claws\\".Also the Quincy Jones produced \\"Donna Summer\\" is worth the price for the song \\"Protection\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban Cinderella Story is a smash hit--Summer's Best","review":"In 1977 Donna Summer's career was moving full speed ahead , and she took yet another direction with her next Casablanca album; \\"Once Upon A Time\\". The album tells a modern fairy tale about a little girl searching for love and identity. There are many memorable tunes here; \\"Say Something Nice\\", \\"Rumor has It\\" and the rich gospel-sounding ballad \\"A Man Like You\\" are just some of the musical gems . Moroder & Bellotte fuse operetta, soul and techno with Donna's sure fire powerful vocals for an unforgettable trip through a nostalgic never-never land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album; Lousy Arrangement","review":"It is a very close contest between \\"Once Upon A Time\\" and \\"Bad Girls\\" as Summer's best concept. Both feature driving rhythms, Summer's excellent vocals, masterful compositions by Morodor and Bellote, plus outstanding covers by photographer Francesco Scavullo.\\"Time,\\" though, is like a work of art as each song perfectly segues into the other in content and musical arrangement. The title cut, \\"Rumour Has It,\\" \\"Fairytale High,\\" \\"Faster and Faster to Nowhere,\\" and \\"Say Something Nice\\" are outstanding dance tracks. \\"Now I Need You\\" is a composition that seems like a blend of disco and New Age, a cut well before its time. The remaining songs are equally well done.Unfortunately, the CD does not feature the songs in their logical order which lessens the listening experience.For Summer fans and others, it is still a worthwhile investment. However, in this form, it is like a sideview of Mona Lisa, i.e., looked at from the WRONG perspective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Donna on a fairy tale high","review":"I first got Donna Summer's \\"Bad Girls\\" album in the early 1990s and was amazed by it instantly. It was, however, \\"Once Upon A Time\\" that I purchased as my second Donna album that made me a Donna Summer fan for real. The remaining reviews pretty much sum up how brilliant this concept album is, Bob Esty signed the musical arrangements which are simply excellent. Surprisingly, the singles \\"I Love You\\" & \\"Rumour Has It\\" only charted in the lower half of the US Top 40, although they did slightly better in the UK, reaching #10 & #21 respectively. Besides these two lovely tunes, the compelling, synthesized-gospel tune \\"Now I Need You\\" is the highlight of this album which may not contain many of Donna's most familiar disco tunes but certainly the very best produced cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one to buy!","review":"I couldn't stand Donna Summer and wanted to be able to authoritatively explain why, so I bought this album. I have never made such a complete about-face in my life. At the time of its release, it cut new ground musically, and Summer's voice is unbelievable! A concept album without peer, performed and produced by artists at the peak of their genius and inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the market","review":"Pick this one up, and you'll never look at the DeLorme one again.

It's like if the Dolphins won the Super Bowl this year and Dan Marino claimed he won a Super Bowl, just because he was once part of the team.

And after Moon died, so did the spirit of the Who.The lyrics on this album could have been penned by my 8 year old son.The label these guys are signed to is owned by TWEC, who also own FYE's and Where House music, the bane of existence to any self-respecting music buyer.

If you've let your knives go and they're quite dull, this SteelPro is NOT what you need. Get your knives sharpened, and then use the SteelPro to keep them that way...that's how a sharpening steel is meant to be used. I do have a Chef's Choice power sharpening station. It's a good sharpener, but too noisy and too inconvenient to use frequently. We use the SteelPro almost every time we use a cooking knife; we keep it right next to the knife rack, and give each blade a few strokes on each side before cutting or chopping. Since we started doing this, the knives have been in daily use and have stayed sharp. We do take good care of our knives, using appropriate cutting surfaces and storing them on a magnetic bar so they don't get dinged."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems to be an excellent product","review":"A professional knife guy from a renowned kitchen store sharpened our knives months ago and recommended we switch to this instead of the traditional steel that I was using due to the angle this product keeps your knife at while honing. Quality product at a decent price- I've used the classic steel and the Wusthoff brand that is similar but doesn't keep the knife at the 23 degree angle. I noticed an immediate difference after honing a couple of my Wusthoff Classic knives with this thing vice my traditional steel or the Wusthoff brand. This thing honed them faster than the other two and they certainly seemed sharper (although I know this doesn't sharpen). I recommend this to everybody who is looking for a honing instrument that gives great results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Product: Chef's Choice 470 SteelPro","review":"I always fall for these silly gadgets and was disappointed to put it mildly. I would rate it zero if I could. The 470 SteelPro is very light weight, doesn't adhere to a counter and dangerous to use--yes we read the instructions, but hate to say, this gimmick doesn't work. My husband, who always sharpens my knives, tried it too and he felt it was junk. Better off with our old-fashioned butchers knife sharpening steel. I will say that while using a butchers knife sharpening steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings.

As I investigated further, I discovered that the set had the ATSC digital receiver built in! Up to now, this seemed to be an option on all the sets I'd seen. I was told that the set was obtained for $1,600! This is 1/3 the price of the nearest equivelant product I'd found! Since then, I have found this set for as low as $999. A bargain at twice the price!

That it does. Plus the seven scents are subtle, delectable.Zum Body Lotions are 75% organic, rich with Shea butter, meadowfoam seed oil, organic aloe vera and jojoba. Sound good? Feels even better. It's not greasy and protects skin against dehydration.At the moment I'm pilfering Sandalwood-Citrus from my long suffering spouse. It's a delightful blend of woods and citrus - not too masculine, perfect for he and she. Next on my list is Lavender-Lemon, and a replacement bottle of Sandalwood-Citrus for him.

I say \\"unexpected\\" because of expectations created by the sour response of NY Times reviewer P.J. O'Rourke, who seemed more upset by Savan's swipes at the Bush Administration than by her keen analysis of contemporary language. Frankly, given Rumsfeld's response to the Iraqi insurgency (\\"stuff happens\\"), the political appropriation of popular slang seems like fair game for criticism. And anyone who enjoys the wordplay on shows from \\"The Simpsons\\" to \\"Seinfeld\\" won't be able to put this book down. Give it to your favorite Republicans for Christmas - and dare them not to laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hel-LO!","review":"I wanted to like this book more than I did, but I just found a lot of it to be, like, lame! Savan has some good points but she repeats herself so much, drowning every sentence in 'pop words' that offset other 'pop words' reminding her of even more 'pop words', that large parts of the book are a convoluted mess!Much of the ground has been covered elsewhere, in greater detail, and in less headache-inducing style!I did find some interesting nuggets, but had to skim through a lot of tedious material to get there.

Since then his books have diminished into little action and many detail of the characters struggling to deal with an item that happened at the beginning of the book. In this book you read about individual policemen, who may have little impact on the story, but you are treated to three or four pages detailing each individual's background. All in all this was one of his lesser efforts. But I will probably read the rest anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely no plot whatsoever","review":"After reading the reviews posted here, and the synopis of the novel, I thought \\"Why not, I'll try it\\". Don't waste your time. The shooting of a police officer was merely a lame excuse of a plot used to publish a novel that is a complete waste of time. There is no investigation of the shooting, no real man hunt, and the only moment of suspense lasted approximately two pages. Real police work may be frequently dull and routine, but I don't read fiction for dull and routine. The book is about as interesting as watching paint dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great series","review":"By a wonderful storyteller. I read The Corps series, and loved it, so could hardly wait to read Griffin's story about the Philadelphia Police Department. I found the same great, strong characters, and the same insider's look into the people that make up a big city's Police Department. I love Griffin's brand of storytelling that seems so real. And there is no shortage of action either in his books, and this book, the first in the Badge of Honor series, is no exception. The book starts with the killing of a senior Police Officer, and the action does not let up from there. I am sure there will be no end of heroics in the coming books either, and I can't wait to read them. Inspector Peter Wohl promises to be a strong and interesting character. Thanks Mr. Griffin for the hours of enjoyment that you provide for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Griffin","review":"W.E.B.Griffin has written many series covering Police, Military, and Espionage.

The author has used a real county with real circumstances, and has failed to use correct names for areas and businesses, and also has made it seem like the real story that happened here wasn't worth covering. We are not \\"hicks\\" as everyone might believe, and I think that instead of fictionalizing this account, it would have been much better to tell the real story, the one that survivors have to live with everyday in their minds and in their hearts. I feel that this has added insult to injury by taking a community that had been torn apart by something that was beyond human control, and again victimizing it and it's citizens by trivializing the whole event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raymond is Wonderful","review":"I just recently read this book, and in a matter of 3 days.

This book was so disappointing !! Although the storyline was facinating and had great potential, the writing style was atrocious - amateurish (like that of an 8th grade expressive writing class) superficial, and full of silly cliches \\"The party lasted until the wee hours of the morning,...\\" \\"When I looked up at him, my mouth dropped open.\\" \\"We tossed and rolled with each other until our bodies seemed to be intertwined.\\" etc. etc. ....give me a break !!

Did anyone else feel this way ?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I loved this book, I read it twice! I couldn't put the book down.

I think this portraits them better than the mass media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, Poor Writing.","review":"E. Lynn Harris has one thing to his credit with this sorry attempt at a novel- that is he is probably the first to openly explore gay and 'down low' sexuality in the Black American context. But that is all this and his other books offer. His characters are undeveloped, as is the novel's plot. Making what could have been a rather interesting novel, quite boring. His writing is completely void of any kind of intrigue, vivid description, or even distinct style. One wonders how such poor writing, could have ever been published. Thankfully, I have not bought any of his books- and I will never borrow or read another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"I heard such good things about Mr. Harris' books and this novel in particular. I read the first paragraph and was a little disappointed. The writing is very simple. But whatever. I knew what the book was about and I really wanted to read it so I kept going. I made it to chapter 3 or 4 and gave up. The writing style is too simple and the characters are very one dimensional. Eric J. Dickey writes so much better than E. Lynn Harris. You can see everything Mr. Dickey writes and feel every emotion. I really tried to like Invisible Life but I just could'nt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse of an invisible world","review":"Thanks to Harris for enlightening the world about a life that I knew nothing about - and delivering the message with a work of superb writing. The characters were strong, the dialogue was audible, and the plot was utterly engrossing. In addition, my eyes were opened to be more accepting of people who are different from me - or as Harris so eloquently displayed - not much different from me at all.I applaud Harris's first novel with my full support, and belief that the best is yet to come from this talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Greatness","review":"I've read all of E.Lynn Harris books, I have yet to read Abide with Me. But all of them have the same flow, and Basil Henderson of course. I hope Mr. Harris keeps up the great work he's doing with letting us heterosexuals know what it is to be gay and how it feels. I have learned alot from his books and I'm thankful for it. Keep up the great work, and keep on writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ill-written, but revelatory of an intriguing demi-monde.","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a black co-worker who found it eye-opening. I thought it very sad. The main character seems to have no understanding of the forces driving his life and only seems to awaken from his self-centered focus at the end, when another character dies, a victim of the thoughtlessness all around them. Even then, there is little thought for where his life is leading the main character. Instead, the novel is just a series of unimportant events over the years, mostly described in terms that are materialistic and on the surface, of interest only because so different from the lives of most people. A disappointing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes women think!","review":"E. Lynn Harris is one of the best authors I have read. He really know how to hook you to a story line. Even though he may have a 'soap opera' writing style, it works! This book really made me realize that many men are bisexual and that they don't bother to inform either partner. I will certainly be more aware of the activities the men in my life particpate in. I am not anti-gay, I just think no matter what you sexual orientation is, you should be monogomous. It is not okay for bisexuals to have 'a taste of' both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo, Bravo, Bravo!!!","review":"Mr. Harris, you are truly a talented writer. I'd first read (I cheated) 'If this world were mine'. But now that I read Invisible Life, I feel like I really cheated myself. This book was soo good! I commend you Mr. Harris. I cannot wait to collect the rest of the books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like it was written in a week...","review":"Mr. Harris should get at least two stars for effort. He tried. But he sacrificed the plot and important details for his descriptions. Some of them are very nice, some cliche. I think what needed attention was the fact that Raymond, after years of liking women, suddenly is attracted to men. More insight and more of his feelings were needed to make this 'transition' feel more real. It felt glossed over, as though Harris was in a hurry to finish the book. And his relationship with Nicole felt rushed--I think there needed to be more to it, so that I could actually feel something when it breaks down.If you want a better read of a confused homosexual boy, try Shyam Selvduari's Funny Boy. (Note to the reviewer from Georgia--God is LOVE. And it isn't up to you to judge. We ALL sin.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Read","review":"In my opinion, I think this book really power-points the key issues that bisexuals face in their relationships and lives. The author explains how people that you love reacts to your sexuality by thinking that it's a choice but is really the way you feel inside. And even though you have a different preferences than everyone else that doesn't mean that you are going to change who you are as a person. Let's just say that E. Lynne Harris can related to what others are feeling by making fictional caharacters so we can learn from it. That book really changed my life. I really want to Thank Mr. Harris for writing such a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in History","review":"This author is sensational.

There was no topic leave untouched from the explicted sex scene that left me breathless to the mugging that had my throat in a knot.

Not knowing anything about E. Lynn Harris or his writing, I took my girl's word and went out and purchased all of his books. Sad to say, but I could not be more unenthused.I suffered through this one and the thought of even attempting to read the sequels makes me sick. Objectively, the author writes well and if the whole world of bisexuality and homosexuality amuses you, this may be a good choice.As for me, there are too many other entertaining avenues that I can explore without trying to understand the complicated world of \\"in the closet\\".This is a bit too much for me.

It is certainly not enhanced by the terrible junior high school prose: insipid dialogue, cliches, hackneyed characters-- hardly an effort! The plot itself is short of atrocious. I hardly felt any sympathy for the main character, who is a male equivalent of \\"the other woman\\" and is selfish and an alcoholic. What's so annoying is that E. Lynn Harris tries his hardest to extract sympathy for him. Then to top it all off, he gives no resolution, leaving an unsatisfyed feeling in the end.

They are easy reads and somewhat amusing. The storylines are really good (gay African-American men are not what we usually thing about when we think of homosexuality), the characters have their moments, but the writing needs work. I will admitt that after reading the book I did go through a moment of thought and I looked at relationships a little differently. Maybe that is what Harris wanted and if that is the case he did it.I can't rate the book any higher because there are so many books that can make you look at life differently with a beautiful writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"He writes like Keanu Reeves acts","review":"The start of something aweful. please please get beyond what he writes about and demand the topic be expored by someone who can write. who can explore with vivid prose not a string of tired, simplistic cliches.

I swear I'm not making the following sentence up: \\"I reclined back in the seat and noticed that the bright yellow sun, ivory clouds and incandescent blue sky looked like a fried egg on an ocean-blue plate.\\" And there are plenty more arch sentences and odd descriptions like that throughout the book. More disturbing to me than the fact that Mr Harris' readers don't possess the critical faculties to recognize dreck is the fact that his first three books are peppered with homophobic language. Gays, other than the main character who's ostensibly wrestling with his bisexuality, are routinely referred to by the writer and his characters alike as sissies. Do yourself a favor, buy something by James Baldwin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My goal for this summer was to get to know E. Lynn Harris' work. Well perhaps I should've started with a later work of his because \\"Invisible Life\\", his first novel (if I'm not mistaken) was a total disappointment. Besides the fact that there were grammatical errors in the book (mispunctuations and misspellings), the characters were also underdeveloped and boring to say the least.

However, the storage box inside the shrink-wrap was so badly damaged, it was worthless for display and storage purposes. For a collection close to $100 in cost, we wanted the box, to keep the films together and to accompany the first boxed set on our shelf. We reordered twice from Amazon and found the same crunched and punctured box each time. A subsequent purchase via a major chain bookstore yielded the same result, causing this Chaplin-loving family to sit back and wait until the manufacturer wises up and takes better care with the next batch."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS!","review":"This great and very diverse collection deserves to be in your collection if you are a chaplin fan!! It includes 6 movies, a collection of shorts ('the chaplin revue', which has seven shorts that amazon's description forgot to mention) and one documentary on chaplin only available through this set, and while not all the films are masterpieces, this is $100 retail for 6 films, 7 shorts and the documentary (12 discs) while buying them separately would cost $175 retail minus the documentary! And although I know that not every film in the set will have mass appeal, if you are planning to buy 'city lights' separately from this collection with one other from here, go for the set instead. The value screams for itself: all these films are unique and what has been done to restore them is fabulous. Dont pass it up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original films","review":"Despite the availability of the original versions of these films, they opted to use versions edited later in Chaplin's career to make them more palatable for modern audiences of the resurgence crowd. While not as noticeable on some of the films, The Kid and Woman of Paris suffer greatly from editing and deleted scenes. To add insult to injury, it's not indicated on the packaging that you aren't getting the real versions.The plus side is, the restoration is really great. The films that aren't too hacked up are great to see this sharp. Again, I just wish the real versions could have gotten this treatment. Sadly, I assume this will be the definitive DVD release of these titles, and we won't be seeing the original films turn up anytime soon.Should you prefer the edited versions, this set would definitely be right up your alley, because as I said, the restoration is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"PLATINUM\\"?

I was not an instant fanatic but was very drawn to how great the band was as musicians and over the next few days found myself constantly listening to the band. I went and got Death Of A Dead Day a week about a week after it's release after failing to download it several times. I must say the album was well worth the the $12.

While they were certainly not flops when they came out, they never achieved the status and acclaim they deserved. Joe Walsh and Joe Vitale were there to add their ideas and play on every cut, and it sounds like a good time was had by all.In the late 70's, Ferguson, Walsh, and Vitale played on each others albums. The output of these three (essentially a supergroup) during that time was, in my opinion, some of the best music of the late 70's. Walsh's \\"But Seriously, Folks...\\" was one of those albums, and it is a classic. These albums are upbeat and fun, and they always lift my spirits. Recommending these to anyone who enjoys well written, straight-up rock 'n' roll, played by excellent musicians who are having a good time is a no-brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guilty pleasure","review":"This is kind of an embarassment to Jay Ferguson. Why? It is a total sell out to just make money.Jay was in Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne. These were cool groups. He is far from cool on this album (what a fruity looking picture on the cover. Nice hair do Jay!).Setting that aside, Thunder Island was big in its time and totally reminiscent of the early 80's. Babylon is a re working of a far grittier Jo Jo Gunne tune. SOulin is okThis is trying to cash in on the Jimmy Buffet vibe. But Jay was a legit rocker so it is hard to take seriously. Its like if Richie Blackmore sang in a barbershop quartet or Keith Moon sang Brill Building songs.It is unnatural but definetly a guilty pleasure.

Kevin Yost delivers two mixes in completely different veins: his \\"Everything and a Groove Mix\\" goes deep and dark, while his \\"Enlightenment Mix\\" is more familiar as his own work--mellow and jazzy (and with his trademark guitar).

Pepper-like 60s concept album from a famous band, that you've never heard of? The answer is simple... because it's mostly godawful. The same inadvertently hilarious attempt at seeming serious that made the Gibbs' acting in Sgt. Pepper a worldwide joke is on display here in galumphingly hamhanded and far too clearly enunciated lyrics on subjects like the circus and being lost at sea, set to lushly overblown orchestrations that would make an easy-listening station seem unplugged. All that could be forgiven as 60s naivete if the album were actually tuneful, but even the best-known song, Melody Fair, doesn't quite rise to the catchiness of Bee Gees hits like New York Mining Disaster 1941 or Massachusetts.

These are fairies everyone has seen before. Plus, the artwork itself it not terribly great, not something I'd want to imitate.For wing patterns and any other textures found in nature, I would go to the source itself instead of getting the info second-hand in a book like this. To study wing shapes and patterns, try A World Of Butterflies by Brian Cassie, et al; The Butterfly Handbook by Dr. Lee Miller; or Night Visions by Joseph Scheer, which has incredible close-ups of moths. The figures of the fairies themselves can be handled by learning simple figure drawing, and there are plenty of magazines and books with models in them to give you a reference. For beginners with a good eye, Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy by Christopher Hart is a good place to start.Focusing only on fairies will limit your artistic sensibility and talent. If you learn the parts, then you can create based on your own imagination and not on how someone else tells you things should look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The art was not as refined or advanced as I expected it to be. I bought this for my daughter, who is an artist and enjoys creating 'fantasy-style' art through various media. I hoped this might inspire her and give her ideas to advance her skills, but her own work is already much more advanced than the patterns in this book. She is interested in patterns for clay sculpture and wood-carving, as well as sketches and oil media, but the 2 dimensional sketches in this book don't really support more than a beginner's guide to sketching fairies. If you are a beginner in the art of drawing fairies, this is probably a good choice. If you are intermediate or advanced as an artist, I suggest you look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not High Caliber Art Work","review":"I agree with a couple of other reviewers that the art work in this book is not inspired, not is it particularly good. There are a lot of patterns in it, unfortunately they appear as though they came from a coloring book for children, only a very few are of a caliber that I would want to duplicate.

Many of the drawings are not perfect (the sewing fairy has her wing drawn in front of her hair on one side)and I would not rely on the fanciful descriptions about the fairies(to me anyway)they are mostly filler to get the feel for what you are working on. (If you want to learn about real fairy folklore I would suggest getting \\"Fairies\\" By Brian Froud or looking for a title on Irish fairy tales.)

The introduction of a steel lap guitar, a rollicking organ and tight percussion breathes new life into Dylan classics such as \\"Tombstone Blues\\", \\"All Along The Watchtower\\" and \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" as well as the only new song on the album, \\"Dignity\\".

In addition to being unplugged, he was also uninspired, unintelligible, underwhelmed, and unexciting. Dylan's rather high-pitched vocals did not do justice to his songs, and those songs--classic but tired warhorses like \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" and \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\"--needed more commitment from the singer than they received to offset the fact that they have appeared all too frequently on other live albums (including the dreary \\"Dylan and the Dead\\"). A lot of lesser performers racked up huge sales and launched comebacks through this venue, but Dylan fared less well. A more adventurous song selection might have helped (the seldom heard \\"Shooting Star\\" is the best cut here), but more inspired vocals would have helped even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better live Bob sets available","review":"Dylan's voice is just plain awful especially during 'Rainy Day Women'.

He has other trash trucks and loves them. This one arrived and was opened on his birthday. Although he was happy, I was disappointed. It was not heavy weight plastic, but rather flimsy and brittle. the biggest problems were that the two trash containers do not stay still on the back loader and fall off. they also don't fit in the flimsy slots where they are supposed to be attached to when lifting them for emptying. Also, the compactor is not like a real truck design but two red cheap plastic spiral screw-type mechanism that's totally un-realistic. Wish we didn't tear open the box, so that I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicole","review":"My boys (ages 3 and 5) were so excited for this garbage truck but now it just makes them cry.

It's a good thing too. Although the music is good and the girl has a good voice, her voice does not work with the music that they play. She'd be much better off doing a solo project with the music that can play alongside her. It's starts sounding like a rock band and then comes in her voice, which doesn't work for rock at all. I'm not saying that \\"nobody in their right mind would like this cd\\", I just didn't really like the combination they had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that gets inside your heart and soul forever.","review":"I have seen and heard a lot of musical history. I saw the Beatles in 1964, attended Woodstock in 1969, and since the early seventies had pretty much given up on finding any Music which moved me like the Music of my youth did. My wife turned me on to October Project in 1994 I have listened to both their albums perhaps hundreds of times and I even got a chance to hear them live about a year before they broke up. What my experience with October Project has been is I can honestly say that their Music is Music that gets inside your heart and soul forever. October Project, Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the first","review":"Lacking a song as gorgeous as \\"Paths of Desire,\\" as stirring as \\"Ariel,\\" or \\"Bury My Lovely,\\" the 2nd October Project album falls just short of the debut album's glory. But with songs like \\"Something More Than This,\\" \\"Deep As You Go\\" and \\"Johnny\\" this is somewhat of a minor quibble. I'd give this 4 and a half stars if Amazon would let me. The first one gets five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully More to Come!","review":"Great album with astonishing depth - lovely vocals intertwined with a richly arranged wall of sound. Pop this puppy along with the other October Project CD in the player, start up a fire and curl up with a good book. In the meantime, the starving artists of October Project are trying to get a new inititive called \\"November Project\\" off the ground. The MP3 site has posted two of their tunes that demonstrate much of their talent, along with a recount of their victimization by the MusicIndustrial Complex. I wish them luck and look forward to buying their next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, lush and lyrical, but should be sold with prozac","review":"I agree with all the positives that have been said about this undeniably beautiful album, but it is overwraught with apocalyptic neurosis. A few examples: \\"The world is falling apart / He's getting older / And there's a funeral in his heart;\\" \\"...where God has no image and man finds no grace;\\" \\"What dark time is coming / What dark time is here / The prophet emerges / In garments of fear.\\" And on like that.So, while lushly layered and beautifully instrumented, if one actually engages the message of the songs, the net result is quite depressing. And unlike with Toad the Wet Sprocket, which similarly carts an emotionally heavy wagon, there isn't a release through the inherent energy of the music. Similarly nuanced but less emotionally exhausting albums are Wild Colonials' \\"Fruit of Life,\\" Zero 7's \\"Simple Things\\" and Delerium's \\"Poem\\".Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, Chilling, Amazing!!!","review":"I really can't describe how much I love this CD!

Only ONE of the AV input port sets (1 video and 2 audio) were connected to the output AV ports. The other three AV ports were not connected at all in any switch position. I checked both with AV signal inputs and with a continuity tester. Three AV port sets were unconnected. I can understand one switch maybe having a problem, though switches are dead easy to build and test; but to have two switches defective is likely a design issue. So either the four position switch used was defective or the wiring to the switch was defective. Thus I can say from my two samples the product was designed defective. Both were returned (with many problems I might add)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little lamb with a lot to learn","review":"The entire video is non-verbal except for some baaa's and other barnyard animal noises, which is a pleasant change from all the other kid videos that yammer on constantly.Timmy is adorable. His friends are fun and playful, his teachers are very kind and patient and the lessons taught in each show are relative and appropriate to the life of a preschooler. What really struck a chord with me was the opening segment when the theme song (addictive!) is playing, Timmy hands his mom his pacifier before running off to join his friends as they head to school.My two-year-old son adores this DVD and laughs himself silly at certain parts. His favorite segment is one where Timmy accidentally knocks over his friends building blocks.

Written on company time, with each word approved by the Flacks of Redmond, it offer little insight. And when the book flap boasts the author speaks with \\"candor of a Microsoft VP\\" one can bet he didn't testify at the antitrust trial -- or maybe he did.

His gravely voice was unique then (it was long before Tom Waits) and Maggie May was one of the most superb rock songs in 1971. Losing You is a brilliant blend of rockin' funk, Milwaukee is a classic lament when the emotion was still real and Every Picture Tells A Story remains quite a tour de force. His version of Pinball Wizard is packed with power and You Wear It Well has stood the test of time very well. This is great value but to get all of Rod's best, one must invest in Best Of Volume 2 as well, for more masterpieces from those early days like Mandolin Wind and Reason To Believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"I see why people RAVE over early Stewart material!","review":"I decided to pick this up on remastered CD and I have to admit, this collection of early Rod Stewart material is simply rocking. I finally see what people are talking about when they RAVE about Rod's early material and how it reaches and touches them inside. So much soul and rock this guy has inside of him I just don't see any current artist doing this depth of work today.

The ambiance and Okie-isms are accurate and it is a fine trip. I really don't remember when Oklahoma car tags numerically denominated the county of issuance (as Iowa later and longer did) e.g. Oklahoma County as County #1 and Polk County as County #77. But I do have the now archaic trivia clogging my head of the two letter identifiers - greetings to all the folk out in Clinton and Weatherford! a/k/a CU (Custer County.)

There are a large number of typos throughout the text and, more importantly, the answers to the translation exercises consistently use the wrong verb tenses, thus making it very easy for the novice to 'learn' the wrong thing! Moreover, the supplementary readings use quite a number of vocabulary words that are never introduced anywhere in the book. While the reading exercises are fun practice for beginners, this book needs to go through another revision, with careful attention to grammatical consistency, before it can be recommended without qualification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latin Made Confusing!","review":"With scores of editorial oversights (tense mismatching, singular nouns translated as plural, etc.) this book is not only very confusing to the first-time Latin student, but also not worth spending your money on. A thorough editorial review would probably fix most of the problems, but since the last edition was published in 1992, it doesn't look like the publishing company cares too much.Publishing the book in this state is nothing short of a disservice to the public. I wasted my money on it. Don't you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latin Made Wrong","review":"This text is loaded with typographical errors, mistranslations, and inconsistencies. It does not explain important points accurately, so that if you depend on it alone for instruction in Latin, you will learn the language incorrectly. For instance, the authors never mark long vowels, which, in some cases, changes the meaning of a text. Translations are inconsistent; sometimes third person is translated \\"he\\" and sometimes it is \\"he, she or it\\". One exercise translates all present tense verbs in the past tense.Using this book is not merely frustrating; it's counterproductive. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errare humanum est, but this is ridiculous","review":"I think the other reviewers have adequately summarized many of the shortcomings of this book. Of the many things I could add, I will simply say that the book offers seven guidelines for the pronunciation of Church Latin: two are wrong, one is at best misleading, one is too vague to evaluate, and one manages to combine all three of these problems; of course, that leaves two that are correct. But you will probably want to spend your money on something with a higher batting average. Wheelock's is better in essentially every way; if your particular interest is Church Latin, Collins's \\"A Primer of Ecclesiastiacal Latin\\" is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latin Made Simple, Student Made Confused","review":"This being my first Latin text, I cannot vouch for its correctness in Latin context--although it seems by the other reviews that this book has some consistent shortcomings in that area. However, as a student of other foreign languages(Spanish, French, and Japanese previously), I can decidedly say that the presentation in this book is confusing at best. The beginning chapters are filled with \\"this is one way to do it\\" explanations that are later contradicted with the correct (?) method. Teaching someone how to do something incorrectly for the mere purpose of simplification is an absolutely useless practice which should be stopped immediately. I would NOT recommend using this book as a learning aid without a Latin-fluent companion to help \\"fix\\" the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auctor stultus est.","review":"Errata multa in libro sunt.Miserabile dictu, mihi necesse est reprobare librum istum.There are many errors in the book.Sad to say, I must repudiate the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste. There are much better books out there!","review":"This book was not Latin Made Simple, but Latin Made by Simpletons. Wrong information, and a terrible learning technique as well. Instead of this, go get yourself a copy of Lingua Latina: Pars I: Familia Romana, by Hans Orberg, and then move to Wheelock's Latin. Together, these two books will get you off the ground.Stop buying this dry, emotionless, ridiculous book regurgitated from the 60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a mess","review":"This really is a waste of time- buy a good Latin Dictionary, a Latin Grammar review chart, a good basic program-( Oxford, or Cambridge is good for younder students- Wheelock's is tedious but good, especially for older students,) and then supplement with some fun stuff like Latin Mythica or other great publications from Bolchazy-Carducci .

It is durable and fully-functional for little hands. The tote is not too heavy and there is enough room in the tote to add other tools. I was extremely happy that I selected this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teeny Tiny Tools","review":"My son truly enjoys gardening and the work that goes into it. We ordered this for him to actually use in the garden. Let's say that items in picture are not actual size. The tools are too small for a 5 year old to use. They are good quality and would stand the abuse, but they are small..in the 4 inch or less range. I would qualify this as a novelty item not a set of useful tools. I would simply buy tools and use the bag, but it wouldn't hold anything larger than the included items. This will become a gift to a 2 year old instead of what it was intended for.Be forewarned, these are too small for small hands and an adult wouldn't stand a chance of using them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doll-sized garden tote","review":"Rounded with tools, the tote is about 7\\" long.

Without even looking I knew the author was a New Yorker. Reading this book feels like listening to a narrative by someone in your family, describing the charm of your own home town to a young adult or out of towner. Of course this town is New York City-the very heart of the Christmas Spirit in the United States! This book gave me what I was looking for and so much more. As if the sheer sight of New York at Christmas isn't enough, the history and stories shared by the author has deepened my love of the Holidays, this sensational city and the people who experienced it in the past and in the years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well built","review":"The buttons are hard to press, and two front buttons broke off after pressing them a couple of times.

The Cunning Christie keeps you guessing until the end of the story and then picks the murderer as the last one you would expect.Another great book by Agatha Christie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Agatha Christie mystery","review":"This is another solid Hercule Poirot mystery, with more twists, turns, and red herrings than usual. I saw the play (also written by A.C.) before I read the book, so I knew who the killer was, but there were still plenty of surprises. The book only got four stars because, as another reviewer pointed out, A.C. crammed too many bad guys on one cruise ship -- a political assasin, a kleptomaniac, a jewel thief, a would-be killer, the real killer, etc. It was exciting, but not as \\"realistic\\" as Murder on the Orient Express and Murder of Roger Ackroyd.I'll promise you one thing about this book: Even if you figure out the identity of the killer, you'll never guess how it was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death on the Nile","review":"What can I say about Agatha Christie that hasn't already been said over all these years? Still entertaining, relevent, thrilling, and unexpected!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christe Little","review":"Death on the Nile was not Christe's finest work, or her most well crafted. The murder itself was wonderfully done, but the method in which the aforesaid murder was rather unlikely. The engineering of such a plan as the murder(s) carried out was not something a normal person, or, for that matter, most any person would be able to do effectively. Few, if any, human beings would have the mental stamina necessary to carry out murders. Several things were done by the murderer(s) that normal human beings are simply not capable of. I cannot give examples here without breaking to the reader the end of the novel, but I will say that such events as take place in the novel are hardly likely in the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Christie's Best!","review":"This is the first Christie book I have read in a while. I sure am glad that I did. This is one of the finest Christie mysteries, both for its marvellous use of atmosphere as well as its twisty, holding plot. This is an incredible mystery filled with local color and plenty of suspects to go around - the description of the splendors of Egypt is wonderful and the characters of all the passengers on board are well developed. Christie shifts the possibility of guilt like a kaleidescope, showing us in turn how almost every single passenger on the cruise had a plausible reason for wishing Linnet Doyle dead....the ending is a genuine shocker, yet completely believeable. You must read this book if you are a mystery lover, it will play havoc with all your notions about guilt and innocence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Review Refers to the Audio Version","review":"Though I think that David Suchet does well in his portrayal of Hercule Poirot in the TV show, he does an abominable job as the narrator of Death on the Nile. The voices with which he chose to endow some of the characters were ridiculous and ill-fitting. In particular, Colonel Race comes off sounding like a doofus with a speech impediment, which does not describe him at all. You'd think that Suchet or at least one other person had read The Man in the Brown Suit or Cards on the Table and gotten some idea of Race's character--and therefore what he might sound like when he spoke. Yeesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"I do feel a tad guilty about giving this book such a low mark.After all, Dame Christie was and is a legend and I do believe in the 30,s 40,s and 50,s her books were much better received.Maybe I am just too jaded.I hope not. The book is a nice quick read but it is boring and my wife(who only listened to a few hints) and I figured out the killer easily and quickly. And the effete little Periot is almost a farcical figure with his cute little sayings etc.When Mrs. Doyle says, \\"Why I haven't an enemy in the world,\\" near the beginning , you know she is, how you say, the \\"piece of toast>\\"Thats how cute little Hercules would have, how you say, said it.HE too often comes up with some really droll wonderful expression like, \\"Ah, life is so mysterious\\" or some such.The first, and how you say, the last of her books, I shall open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personally, I didn't see it coming","review":"I really enjoyed this book, even though I have only ever read Murder on the Orient Express and so am not a Agatha Christie fundi. We went for a holiday in Luxor, Egypt, and heard a lot about the film while we were there and so I ordered it on my kindle. I really enjoyed it, and kept thinking there would be an obvious, or else irritating ending, but I was completely surprised and amazed! Excellent plot! The only thing I should have done was keep a note of who all the characters were, because at the beginning it was really confusing who they all were and where they all fitted in. But all in all, I was impressed and happy that I ordered it. Am keen to see the movie now."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS","review":"Take a vacation. Where? How about Egypt? This is such a flawless mystery that it makes you smile. There is no end to the anticipation and wonder as Christie unwraps her ending like a delectable package.There is a sense of danger, evil, and suspicion as you course down this path of mystery. You are shocked while unexpected things fly out at you and cause you to shake your head at--how else should I put this--genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Christie book of all-time!","review":"Right after I finished reading this, I set the book down and thought, \\"Wow.\\" Christie's intelligence and superb writing style makes you think again. It's amazing how the people who aren't even suspected end up being the culprit. The plot was complex, spellbinding, and interesting. The whole idea of murder on a cruise was great, and Christie made it even greater. A must for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best.","review":"I've read a number of Agatha Christies, and this one is by far my favorite.The charactes are all three-dimensional. Even the smallest characters have a personality and emotions. The mystery is baffling, and quite challenging for those readers who try very hard to figure out the mystery. The addition of Colonel Johnny Race is a great one, and he's a good temporary replacement for Captain Hastings.The solution will blow you away. It's absolutely wonderful. A good mystery should leave you wide-eyed and thinking about the solution for a good while after reading it, and that's exactly what this one does. The solution is perfectly satisfying, unlike some other Agatha Christies (Cards On The Table, Sparkling Cyanide).This is one of the longer Agatha Christies, at 307 pages, but it's well-worth your time. I absolutely reccomend Death on the Nile to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denial On De Nile","review":"Agatha Christie's 16th Hercule Poirot mystery is one of her most well-known works. Originally published in 1937, \\"Death on the Nile\\" is a crisply written whodunit. A helpful floor diagram of each suspect's boat cabin is included. I read this over thirty years ago while in high school and either my subconscious dredged up the old information deep in the cobwebbed recesses of my mind or I'm getting a little smarter because, half-way through the book, I figured out who did it. Ms. Christie takes more time than usual developing the characters before murder ensues. With her clean writing style, over a dozen suspects and numerous red herrings, the author will keep most readers guessing until the very end. Simply a great, fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds your interest","review":"Interesting book.

I think before you buy this tape set, you may want to know that it's designed for long-term study, not as a last minute course in Italian. There are 35 lessons, and it's suggested that each lesson should be studied for 4-7 days. Also, the tape goes very fast and the Italian is spoken quickly, so it's difficult to match pronunciations. I tried to learn by listening in my car on the way to work, but it's difficult to do, unless I keep rewinding every few minutes and listen again. Although a little booklet is included, it's very small, but it helps to see how a word is spelled in italian. If I could do it over again, I would get something else, since I am trying to learn Italian QUICKLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can this have a 4 star rating?","review":"...if the previous reviews bash the product and give it 3 and 5 stars, respectively?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dialogue Loop","review":"I highly recommend this book. I read it in nearly one sitting. The structure of the book is Platonic dialogue/'My Dinner with Andre.' The conversations of five friends are the entirety of the book. It deals with complex philosophical ideas on economies and natural systems in a highly readable way. The book centers on the idea of biomimicry, in which natural phenomena are imitated (engineered) in such a way that using natural principles creates efficiency. Essentially it is the notion that there are basic principles to which all systems naturally adhere, and understanding those systems can help us frame economics more rationally and sustainably. Jacobs discusses notions of positive-feedback loops, negative-feedback stops, dynamic stability. All this within the idea that evolutionary processes, interdependencies, and natural tensions and tendencies are the basis of economic interaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to read with great insight","review":"This is my first exposure to Jane Jacobs.

A waste of a good title for what we long to know.","review":"Perhaps someone will write about the \\"Nature of Economies\\", and soon, and I pray that this title will be released for him or her. This book, however, is a ramble of mean observations, couched in an especially irritating format that makes one feel stupid, like an eavesdropper on a pitiable cocktail conversation. To really read this book, one needs only read the Epilogue, \\"Hiram was delighted to have Armbruster (sic) relieve him of the book.\\" The real writing and discovery is in the Notes, some twenty-five pages of them, in which the sense of economy is hinted at, but not at all consummated. Buy the book? Read the Notes. I got my copy at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not among her better effort","review":"Jane has written some wonderful books.

The gentle sounds of nature, soft human voice and musical notes all evolve in a round-robin fashion creating an upward spiraling support that lifts the consciousness, then gently rests, and then begins again to move up to the next level. The process continues for the entire length of the CD leaving you transformed.Although I compose music similar to this genre for my own personal use in spiritual growth, when I heard this for the first time I was blown away.

A book that preaches about evaluating and truly understanding cultures of all kinds should not allow for blindly opinionated segments in any instance. It is both derogatory and uneducated for such a thing to be allowed in this book. Because there is one instance of it there could very well be others. Teachers should read this text carefully before supplying it to unwitting students trying for form proper opinions of the world around them.

The scares are still a mix of quick shocks and slower, more psychological hits that linger. It's got everything that made the first season a success and more. It starts a little quirky, though, a little more supernatural than I prefer, but as the story elements come together around the characters the first few episodes gather explanations from later episodes - the intrigue hits you and you can't stop watching despite it's ugly, terrifying nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gothic Camp","review":"This second series is better than the first it seems to fall in place faster and is really well produced with great sets, costumes and atmosphere.

As soon as we got back I got into it. I wasn't aware that season 2 wasn't going to be a continuation of season 1 so I was a little disappointed at first.

Moreover, the twisted imagery of Catholic symbols, contorting them into icons of evil, turned my stomach. This is just another example of the hypocrisy of Hollywood writers that bigotry is wrong unless it aimed at a majority group such as Christians. Portrayal of other religious or groups in this manner would never be permitted to be aired, so why should this form of anti-Catholic bigotry be tolerated. Do not waste your money on this trash.

But there is not one heroic or sympathetic characters in the cast. They are each just selfish 'agenda driven' characters. And without a character aspiring for better, to defeat the horror, its just shock.Watch the first Season, watch the Walking Dead.As of now, I'm leaving the senseless disgust and mutilation of American Horror Story Season Two behind me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Season!","review":"Creativity!!!!!!!!!

Granted, I've only seen the first episode, and I'll probably give a couple more a chance once it comes out on Netflix, but I wouldn't pay extra to see them sooner. It seems, as is typical with many FX productions, that it has already quickly degraded from great suspense and out-of-the box writing, to nothing but gratuitous snippets and shock-and-awe sex moments that don't even need to be there for it to be great. I'm not being prudish in saying this by any means, it's just that it's not necessary and detracts and distracts from a show that otherwise had great potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"though it would be better","review":"I loved season one from the first episode to the last.

It was good, but not as good as the first season....looking forward to the next season :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully twisted and morbid!","review":"I was addicted to both season 1 and this season and I'm not a big tv show person. You grow to love or hate each character and I love how each season thus far incorporates such in depth story lines that keep you guessing and wanting more. Normally, shows that portray demon possessions and alien abductions seem ridiculous, but you really are taken in to their world and it feels mysteriously natural!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible ending to a good season","review":"After such a great season with so many twists ending it with an hour long interview was aweful.

It is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Mess","review":"I loved the first season of AHS so I was excited to see a second season.I'm not exactly sure what they were smoking or shooting up when they wrote this but it is a complete mess.So many story lines that you can't keep up with them. It's like they took 4 or 5 different ideas for this season and crammed them all into one big (and sorry to say this again) MESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Season 1","review":"And looking forward to Season 2 - One drawback - do not like the OPENing credits - all the flashing of gross pictures - It takes away from the great series.

Great acting and story-line - Alfred Hitchcock would agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first","review":"Put together very well, very hard to watch only one episode at a time.

I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such an innovative story!","review":"Season two is very different from season one, but equally as good. A must see for horror fans.Possession, aliens, corrupt nuns and priests and much more.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible series, Episode 10 is the best so far!","review":"I love the series as a whole. The Asylum is a great and interesting backdrop for anything scary and twisted. The show just keeps getting better and the surprises and twists are in every show! Well written, with no loop holes, the plot doesn't just roll on,it builds and develops with each new addition to the cast. New cases, both good and bad are added and the thought of some of this really happening in Asylums makes it feel real. You get such a great blend of science fiction, added on top of a typical ghost and horror movie, it's great. Add the fact it all takes place in an Asylum for the criminally insane and no wonder it's a hit! This last episode really got me more than the others and I cannot wait for the next episode and seasons! Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh those nuns","review":"It pushes boundaries of tv Good actors was surprised to see Jessica Lange in this type of drama also enjoyed her in 1st season"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked ?","review":"It might be hard to say you love this show but it certainly holds my interest and keeps me coming back for more!

I mean that in a good way. So much TV is regurgitated crap and this is so odd and fun. I like that it seems to be the same characters every season telling you a different horror story. Jessica Lange is by far the star of this show. So many good character though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsessed!","review":"Since we don't have a DVR, this was our only option for seeing last week's episode.

Jessica Lange and rest of casting are a cut above the rest out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm loving it","review":"Not as good as the first season of AHS, but still pretty awesome. There aren't many surprises, but the acting is outstanding, and the story is suitably horrifying. I'm going to be sad when the season is over (I'm on episode 10, so it may be over already)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good show.","review":"I think I like the first season a little better than the 2nd season here, but perhaps I only got used to the characters. I wasn't expecting a different plot, and characters for the 2nd season. This season takes place in an asylum, which seems like it could be creepier - however the first season seemed like they had a better edge on the creepy factor. Season 2 offers some of the actors to take on new characters and really show a range. It's hard to say much without spoilers.Zachary Quinto's new character for this season is better than his role in the first season. I'm looking forward to see what they do for season 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show!! Watched both seasons... Awesome!!","review":"Great and addictive show ... Love the actors and would recommend this to anyone.Great work again by Ryan Murphy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop watching","review":"Super suspenseful. Great acting. Jessica Lange is superb.Having the same cast as season 1, in different roles/characters also adds to to the show"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica Lange!","review":"Overall, I find this season's script not quite as smart or complex as the first five-star season, although the level of actors they've cast are equally astonishing, with some returning from Season One. But Jessica Lange (!!!) is genius whenever, wherever. She's mesmerizing, yet also knows when to cede to other actors. Her scenes with the superbly talented James Cromwell make watching a compulsion. Evan Peters and Zachary Quinto (from Season 1) are again terrific. Lily Rabe is delightfully kooky, moving from possessed by Mother Mary to possessed by Satan. Joseph Fiennes unfortunately has a small part. Regardless: Jessica Lange, Jessica Lange, Jessica Lange!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Asylums and Scary nuns are awesome","review":"I loved season 1 and they hooked me after the first episode in season 2.

That just isn't \\"entertainment\\" in my book. Now zombies, on the other hand...."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comparision to season 1","review":"I am on the 4th episode of Season 2, and so far I have been terribly disappointed. The storyline seems to be going nowhere, and I hate the demonic exorcist spin. Season 1 was interesting and full of surprises; it was bloody, yet very watchable. Season 2 is disgusting and stupid. You would think a show about an insane asylum would be interesting, but all season 2 consists of is sex and gore. That would be okay too if the show had a good plot. I can't believe the writers created such a terrible story line for an actress as amazing as Jessica Lange. She and Evan Peters are the only reason I am going to keep watching and pray it gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Bought it wanting to see what it's about and it's terrible. FX has never produced a lot of high quality programming, but this is filth.

The first episode - good - compelling characters and a sinister atmosphere at the asylum. The second episode - ok - I didn't like it as much as Episode One, but I chalked that up to character and story development. That takes time. The following episode(s) - horrible. Gratuitous images, torture porn, storyline that is offensive to almost every religion, race and sexual preference. I can't watch anymore, I'm sorry to report."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"I didn't see the episode. I had to ask for a credit.

Its very dark, bloody, tortuous. Where the first season was more about ghost, mystery, and haunted house.

But friends told me to come back into the fold, that the poor creatures in the woods surrounding the asylum were not, in fact, zombies, but something... different. So, I got on Amazon last week and watched all the episodes I had missed since October 31st. What can I say... I am enjoying the craziness, the eeriness, the edge-of-my-seat, sitting-and-watching-through-my-fingers nervousness, and I am sympathizing with characters and cringing at others, and hoping some get their comeuppance - I'm in for the long haul.

Scared and squirmy, but watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Horror Story review","review":"I'm addicted. Can't stop watching. It's definitely a must-see.

Jessica Lange is always very good. All the acting is rock solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first season","review":"Although I am still waiting to see how the whole story and all of the various angles and characters tie together, it is an entertaining, suspenseful, sick and twisted look at mental health care in the 60's and how barbaric it was then.

I love this season, and it is better then the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great show !!","review":"The acting is incredible and it borrows horror elements from other series and movies, including music.

The ghosts of the murder house was an amazing idea....nothing could top that. Except, perhaps an insane asylum....Some of it is cliche (mad doctor doing horrible experiments on the forgotten crazy person, the pious, judgmental nun, etc.), some of it just plain weird (an alien abduction?). There are some familiar faces but the characters are completely different.It's definitely entertaining but not perfect and often times confusing but once a week I can count on shuddering after the one hour creep fest and thank my stars that it's just pretend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Addicting.","review":"I'm an avid \\"scary things\\" enthusiast. My perfect night is a glass of wine and something shocking/thrilling/disturbing/violent to watch on TV with my fiance. American Horror Story (seasons 1 & 2) both managed to keep me hooked. When you think about it, the creators of this show have managed to create a ~12 hour horror movie with numerous subplots and twists. Some things might be a bit hokey, but it's a show based on things that have debatable existence. It's going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens and Nazis and Devils, oh my!","review":"This show consistently provides entertaining and twisted dark storylines. I love it!While the continuity isn't always great and the stories can be really convoluted, it was a great show. Season one, about the murder house, was just as entertaining.Jessica Lange and Evan Peters knocked it out of the park, just like in season one. Loved their characters. Sara Paulson brings her A-Game as Lana Winters, a character that I liked less and less over the length of the season, but still liked overall.Overall, strange, creepy, scary, gory, weird, musical fun. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I can't believe this show is on regular TV.

It was actually scary.Season 2. I watched 3 episodes and never went back. Unthinkable Rape, and severe torture, along with discusting characters. There is no way that many evil demented people would all work in one place without a caring sole in sight. It is not scary its discusting. I was severely disappointed. While Jessica Lang does a fantastic job of acting. I still could not watch this crap. I will not watch this season. . I love a good horror story but this is just filth. Bring back the creepy scary wonderful characters in season 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rara Avis of American Television","review":"Creators of American Horror Story are not afraid to break boundaries of what was previously believed to be allowed in the Prime Time television. Brilliant combination of true horror, character-driven plot, violence and sexual tension all at once. And in a absolutely unexpected turn, Season 2 not only dared to break free from Season 1 story line but was able to achieve one of the rarest things in the American television - be a better sequel then the original.Few of the actors from the Season 1 return but the story is completely unrelated and the actors are playing different characters. Jessica Lange is brilliant as always and this time she has a great antagonist in James Cromwell.This is the best horror series since X-Files and I dare to say that if the inventiveness of this series will not dry out, it will eventually eclipse it's spiritual predecessor."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally different than season 1, but great show","review":"Great show.

It was amazing. They introduced a new cast of characters, and an extremely chilling new location, and I seriously thought this was just as good as the season 1 premiere. It was horrifying, titillating, mesmerizing, suprisingly sexy, and such an engrossing story.If you're liked the first season, you'll love this.

I like this season, but am equally disturbed by it. Instead of last season's ghost story format, this season is twisted, bizarre, sadistic, and thoroughly enjoyable. But, that's only my opinion.

Your imagination plays a huge part in reading a scary story; AHS is imagining for me... and maybe beyond me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but still watching","review":"The storyline is weak and convoluted but there is enough to keep me watching (barely).

Season 1 was simple, a great haunted house story. Season 2 is chaotic, has too many story lines (alien abduction, serial killer, nazi style experimentation, satanic possession, catholic nun and priest crimes) and sometimes pushes the limit of good taste. It seems as though the writers gave up quality for quantity and it just didn't hold my attention the way the first season did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best horror show ever.","review":"If you like horror stories this one is it.

It was old then, and looks even older now. And yet, pushing letters around on a page is timeless. It's laughably low-tech and yet, utterly modern, all at the same time. Some of the tricks and techniques described are so profound and clever, they are reminiscent of calculus in how they demonstrate the power of the well-applied human mind.

It's hard to even crack a smile at the stupid happenings that go on during the show. This show isn't real life. It's like a whole bunch of former drug addicts that get together and yell a lot with audience applause everywhere throughout. By the way, this applause and laughter happens at all the wrong places. Think about when someone says something not funny when they're trying to be and you look at the person next to you with a really confused look.....this is \\"House of Payne\\". If you're looking for entertainment stick to Perry's movies, which are wonderful.

However, while its technical contents are accurate and in-depth, it fails to help readers to understand the topics so that people can one day pass the CCNP exam.The wording, organization are just odd. They're hard to read, and boring. If you can only last for merely 10 min. on these books, what is the purpose of buying them ?Those authors must be good engineers/instructors, but the editors failed big time to make these books good enough to justify the price tag.My 2 cents, buy some other CCNP books. They're better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Whodunit is a Superb Understatement!","review":"This one's a winner! A good friend recommended it years ago and it's taken me five years to find it. It starts slow and builds and builds and explodes!Brilliant performances by Dyan Cannon, James Mason, Richard Benjamin and Joan Hackett. Joan Hackett is one of those lost treasures who is an absolute delight in this picture.The climax is an unbelieveable twist that still packs a realistic punch 30 years after it's release. You'll watch it over and over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD looks great.","review":"I've always loved this film--a clever, sharp-tongued, and very satisfying puzzle--and I hung on to my old VHS copy for years just praying for a DVD to come out. Now it's out, and it looks great! I'm frankly not sure what the viewer from Michigan is talking about in chapter 18--if you mean the silhouette that moves right at the line (note I'm very carefully not giving any context) \\"let me get this over with,\\" that exact same thing *is* in the VHS version (you can just see less of it without the rest of the widescreen). It's not a mistake. I've been comparing my tape and DVD, and I'm entirely satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last of Shelia ia great!","review":"One of the best of its kind.

Great fun - a real brain-teaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful Thriller that Keeps You Guessing!!!","review":"After reading the reviews for \\"The Last of Sheila\\", I could not help but rent it immediately! Needless to say, the reviews did not disappoint - it met all my expectations and them some! Immediately after the first viewing, I just had to watch it twice more to catch all the clues I missed; as another viewer states, you catch something new every time. The commentary with Dick and Dyan (and an annoyingly inserted Raquel Welch) is delightful as well. This is just a cleverly written, simply wonderful Agatha Christie-esque thriller with the added bonus of a very 70s kitsch factor - do not let yourself miss \\"The Last of Sheila\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tale of Two Versions?","review":"The one star is for the dvd. This 'version' as I've read in the other reviews *IS NOT* the same as the VHS that I own. There is a HUGE flaw in Chapter 18 as the Michigan viewer stated. I am not entirely satisfied as others are with this mess.I bought my VHS from Amazon two years ago and my tape *do not* have the Chapter 18 mistake in it. So, there must be two versions - one mastered correctly and the mess with the mistake in Chapter 18. Warners needs to re-do this dvd without the mistakes that currently exists in this DVD.A great movie done an injustice."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GAME OF MURDER","review":"Directed by Herbert Ross (Steel Magnolias), LAST OF SHEILA (Warner) is an ingenious and witty thriller written by game players Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins (Psycho). It's set on a yacht cruising just off the French Riviera. The stellar cast includes James Mason, James Coburn, Dyan Cannon, Raquel Welch, Ian McShane, Joan Hackett and Richard Benjamim. The story revolves around the hit and run death of Sheila, wife of Hollywood mogul Coburn. He thinks his friends know more about her death than they have said. In an attempt to find the truth, he invites them for a holiday cruise and some game playing. For the home viewer, clues are everywhere and warrant a second viewing. Amusing, superficial, commentary is from Benjamin, Cannon and Welch, although it sounds like Welch's input was edited in after the fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Man's Agatha Christie","review":"Boy, am I ever out of step with the majority of your reviewers on this one. I would agree that the basic premise is a good one, similar to Ten Little Indians and such game-playing, cat-and-mouse type mysteries. However, this one is badly miscast and rather idiotic in parts. Richard Benjamin is a very appealing comedian and even can do a serious part now and then but he's really not the man for this role. Raquel Welsh is totally out of her league, Joan Hackett is wasted and I hardly know what Ian McShane (one of my current favorites) is even doing in this dog. Coburn and Mason are the only semi-bright lights in this, as befits their position as long-time pros. I found the elaborate plot so convoluted as to end up being silly and boring--and very talky. My advice: leave this to admirers of the 70's and watch Evil Under the Sun or some other well-done Christie mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems so far","review":"Pretty good cassette adapter. For home stereos, make sure the \\"this side up\\" side is facing the tape window of the stereo. The adapter has 4 cord exit points so you can change it depending on how your car stereo works. The sound is alright. Just keep the tape head clean and you shouldn't have too much distortion. There's a very faint humming noise when nothing is being played but I believe it's my cars stereo [I tried it in another car and the sound is A LOT better with no hums/distortion]. I think this adapter is very good just for MP3 players [or any other non-standard player for the car stereo].

Expecting an instrumental collection, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that Tyrell has an excellent voice and is a strong songwriter. The songs are well-crafted and are reminiscent of John Mellencamp (circa: Pink Houses and Cherry Bomb era), acoustic Neil Young, and even Bruce. Especially exquisite is Ste. Genevieve. Soozie Tyrell's first cd sounds like the work of a seasoned pro. If you are a fan of finely crafted music with excellent musicianship, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Would anyone pay attention to this record if she didn't play violin for Springsteen?

I'm the type that will avoid going to the doctor at all costs, and Allimax has kept me out of the doctor's office more than once.The time I suffered from a terrible case of mastitis but refused to take antibiotics while nursing my daughter, Allimax got rid of the infection when nothing else could. I'd had the infection for almost a week, trying everything I could think of. My dad recommended Allimax, and a day and a half later it was gone.I've also taken these capsules for sinus infections. My breast-fed daughter had an infection, too, and two days after I started taking these her infection was gone.I think you get the idea. I keep a box of these in my fridge at all times.

A page turner of high literary merit, accessible and intelligent. Fabulous craft and language, a most diabolical villain who drives even saints to wish him ill.Yes he is intelligent, arrogant, rough, caustic, poisonous, and evil, all to hide one tiny chink in his armor that nonetheless, one person manages to find.Read this book!

With an afterword by Annie Proulx and the recent success of Brokeback Mountain, this exceptional piece of western literature should now find the audience Thomas Savage so richly deserved in 1967. As restrained and sparing in language as its central antagonist, Phil Burbank, Savage has the uncanny gift of eloquence through omission, allowing the reader to read between the lines. I was captivated by his talent, and jolted by an entirely unexpected but immensely satisfying conclusion. This book has been five times optioned for film, yet never made. I doubt that will go on much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly boring!!!!!","review":"I am stunned by all of the wonderful reviews for this book.

Just so much of it was completely out of left field. Boring! Boring! Boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The equal of any writer","review":"Amazing find. Written with power and subtlety (with the exception of the first paragraph), The Power of the Dog is a thing of beauty. Savage's voice is unusual and evocative. His use of multiple points of view is masterful. His powerful, terse, descriptions put you in mind of Hemingway; his plotline of Cormac McCarthy - multiple threads, churning with emotion, weaving together toward a conclusion as sharp and final as the fall of a guillotine blade.So, how can Cormac McCarthy be a cultural phenomenon and Thomas Savage virtually unknown? \\"Fate requires\\" it, perhaps. But, if you are a serious reader, you owe it to yourself to acquire this edition, to read it, and to treasure it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost treasure rediscovered","review":"Thomas Savage's \\"Power of the Dog\\" is a re-discovered treasure of a novel. Like Beryl Markham's \\"West With the Night,\\" this book slipped into oblivion shortly after publication and never received literary accolades it deserved. When Annie Proulx wrote a new afterward for the book, contemporary readers took notice and Thomas Savage receives renewed recognition as an important American writer.\\"The Power of the Dog,\\" first published in 1967, contains seeds of a writing style that bears fruit in writers like Thomas McGuane, Annie Proulx, Jim Harrison and Mark Spragg.While the book is a \\"western\\" in setting, it broaches misogyny, misogamy and homosexuality, subjects seldom touched in writings about the west.Fascinating, darkly suspenseful and wholly satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Series","review":"I have just completed the last volume in the Lanny Budd series, having read the entire series over several years.

Jimmy Carter was definitely not the best president this country has ever had, but certainly not the worst. Being a republican you may think I would agree with this trash, but the hate is clouded by total lack of truth, and no one deserves that. Mr Carter has been a real humanitarian over the last twenty years in ways that no other President has even come close. He may have ego, but nowhere near as much as the author of this book. Everyone has a right to an opinion, but when it influences others to hate without truth then it is just liable.If this author wants to write about evil egomaniacle people he should be writing about GW Bush! at least there is a tremendous amount of accurate information to back up all of the illegal and unconstitutional actions this president has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carter's dislike for me is personal","review":"I was in Iran training the Imperial Iranian Air Force on the use and maintenance of a surface to air missile system known as the Improved Hawk.

I was broke. The Shah was doing a great job of bringing the country of Iran into the twentieth century and Carter undermined his effort. The results were what we have today. I believe that a strong Iran that was friendly to us, and they were then, would have given us the purchase to turn the tide of religious tyranny in the Mid East.

The thesis is cobbled together using a roughly accurate historical framework, but fails to historically support the assignment of motives, attributes contradictory rationales for actions taken, does not accurately portray the complexity of forces bearing on events of that time, and omits facts that fail to support the conclusions reached in the book While it is polished writing, its half-truth viscera will be appetizing only for those blinded by a feeble agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"right wing drivel","review":"This book would be funny if it was not so sad.

Neither he nor his staff had a clue on how to deal with the shenanigans they would find in the political maelstrom in the one place meant to make the lives of U.S. citizens better, but instead encourages and rewards personal gratification as a higher goal. His presidency could not survive such a selfish and greedy environment. Jimmy Carter has spent his life trying -- and succeeding -- in making his country, and the world, a better place.

This man would lie about anything and do anything to obtain personal power and acclaim. Since he chose to be a Democrat he has been blessed by a slavish media that refuses to report anything negative about this wretched dishonest cowardly individual. Whether he is praising Castro, trying to destroy the Olympics, supporting communism, or tearing down any chance black Americans might have of equality, Carter is one of the worst Presidents the US has ever had and one of the worst human beings to set foot in the Oval Office.

I switched to a gel cap in a different brand (with no taste and only one a day instead of four) and was very pleased with them. Now, in the middle of the second trimester I'm back to these awful pills because I hate to waste anything.

I have every single movie released on DVD. But I was way too old when Pokemon first came out (1998, I think?), and I'm definitely way too old now. But I can't help myself from buying these DVDs whenever they are released in the US. And it's not like the stories are any good, and I haven't played the games in years. But something about them makes me buy them every time they come out. Maybe it's because I already have them all and I just want to keep the collection going. It certainly can't be the story line. \\"Pokemon is distressed. Ash saves the world. Pika pika!\\" But as the Pokemon keep getting more and more ridiculous and more powerful and uglier, the characters keep getting more blah. I know this is a children's movie, but still, there can be a better storyline.By the way, anyone know when the next one comes out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but cheap","review":"This is a cute charm but the body snapped off after two days of wearing it.

I was less enthralled with the followupI'm Not Following You, but still hopeful.Collins has a good voice, intelligent lyrics, and an interesting singing style. Unfortunately, Doctor Syntax mostly doesn't make use of those strengths. The first half of the album is forgettable, meandering, and somewhat pointless. It's only in the last few songs (starting with Johnny Teardrop) that the album begins to pick up. 20 Years Too Late and It's a Funny Thing might have been good middle of the road songs on a stronger album, but here they're just too weak to hold up the entire album on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent--Must have book","review":"If you are considering owning a Vizsla this is a book you should have in your library of Vizsla books.

Deciding to go with 5 major colors (white, black, grey, blue, dark blue) not only makes the book seem dull and drab, it detracts from the reader the good content within.For anyone that uses Dreamweaver 8 on a daily basis this is a great reference guide but the layout editor could have done a much better job.

He has tackled a seemingly boring, stale and legalistic area that has been dismissed by our society. In the process, he has provided life to the the sins that mar our lives that originate from our brokenness by providing a path of hope and love. Throughout the book, you sense Randy's empathy as I laugh and cry at the many his personal incidents and stories. His ability to simplify a very complex and controversial topic made it real and applicable to my life, not an intellectual exercise. Rather than an academic treatise on the \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\", Randy weaved an enjoyable thought provoking book that impacted my walk with God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mmm comercialized hip-hop w/ reggea?

'If You Could See Me Now' is a little slow, but still a great song. There really is something in this CD for everyone. Reggae with Matisyahu, hip-hop with Booya T.R.I.B.E., and of course, P.O.D.'s own signature sounds. You'll pick up some Satellite, Payable On Death, even some Snuff the Punk.I recommend this album to anyone, 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid release by the boys, but not the greatest.","review":"Let me start of by saying that this is a great album. Actually, it's one of the more solid releases by P.O.D. It contains some of the best work done by them yet.Truth be told I kinda liked the direction they were going in their last full-length. When I heard this album I was happy yet disappointed that their rap influence had been added to the equation again. This is closer to the original P.O.D. that I was introduced to, but I thought their self-titled album was their best release thus far. I still do.Nevertheless, this is a great cd and i highly recommend it to avid fans of the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Time for a new P.O.D.

Of those 4, this is their 2nd best, behind \\"Sattelite\\". With 13 songs you get the same formula they always have. Some upbeat hard songs, some slower deeper ones and a few raggae sounding joints. Of the 13, 1 is a classic, 1 is almost a classic, 6 are good , 4 are ok and 1 I skip. Guests do vocals on 3 songs, unlike most rock albums. Not their best but a solid album and one I'd recommend for fans of the San Diego band.#1 - 7 (raggae like song -- f/ Matisyahu)#2 - 9 (tight beat)#3 - 7.5#4 - 10 (CLASSIC --deeper song)#5 - 7.5#6 - 9.5 (f/ Boo Yaa Tribe, Sick Jacken, Amy Terrin -- tight beat)#7 - 7#8 - 9 (harder upbeat song)#9 - 8.5 (nice beat)#10 - 8#11 - 5 (slower raggae type song -- f/ matisyahu)#12 - 8.5 (another upbeat one)#13 - 8.5 (nice beat)Check all my reviews"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened To POD?!?!","review":"I read a while back that Sonny said the next POD album would be their best. They failed big time.First the good: \\"Mistakes & Glories\\" and \\"Say Hello\\" are great songs with an agressive POD sound.Now the bad: The rest of the CD blows. The sound is weak and lame and the reggae music only add to the annoyance of this really bad effort.After their self titled album, they should have just left the music scene. This is just a horrible effort. To me, they sound like they are trying to reach into the pop music scene.I will end with this question: What's the next step in music for them? Probably an acoustic praise and worship CD. Goodbye For Now POD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little weak.","review":"P.O.D. definitely was thinking a bit more \\"mainstream.\\" Not a whole lot of \\"heavy\\" on this one.

After the great sound they had in their previous cd, i had great expectations for \\"Testify.\\" When i finally got my hands on the cd, i didn't know what to say. It was bad. They had a few good songs on it such as \\"Roots in Stereo\\", \\"This Time\\", and \\"Strength of my life\\" but other than those songs, the cd is pretty much worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I own Satellite, Payable On Death, and now Testify and I must say even after only listening to it for a day, Testify is their best album. Anyone who thinks that POD is done, you are incredibly wrong. This album is exactly a mix between the other two and I love it. They reach out to all genres in this one and I am very impressed. The best tracks are This Time and Goodbye For Now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good.","review":"I got this two days after it came out, listened to it twice on the same day, and liked what I heard. I kind of missed the style of their last album, and wasn't really sure about what this would sound like. I heard \\"Goodbye For Now\\", and liked it, but noticed that the rap was back in. I don't mind the rap at all though.They'll probably never be able to make another \\"Satellite\\", but this is a very good album. All the songs sound different and have different moods to them. I kinda wish the \\"On The Grind\\" song had more of Sonny in it though. That song kind of depresses me too. But it captures the essence of the streets and helps you see into Sonny's past, like when he was in a gang and doing drugs, and just trying to stay alive out there.The message of love and hope is still in there, and I'm glad about that. I was afraid this band would fade out, but they made a huge and impressive comeback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same P.O.D.-Fresh New Sound!!","review":"After following P.O.D. pretty relentlessly since they released \\"Southtown\\" I was very excited to see their new releases come to the shelves this week. With the addition of Jason Truby on guitar, I was unsure they could recapture the sound and drive of \\"Southtown\\" and \\"Satellite\\". \\"Payable on Death\\" was a good album, but it just didn't have a lot of hooks to keep the songs as memorable as I'm used to with these guys. After a couple of years off, they have partenered up with uber-producer Glen Ballard to bring out an album that not only showcases Jason Truby's talents but really helps keep P.O.D. from becoming too derivative in their genre. This is a great album with plenty of memorable hooks and so far is the first album of 2006 to really garner much of a nod from me. If you're a fan, you'll definitely be pleased with the update on their vibe and feel. They're still able to send a positive message through their music and put out viable sounds to match. Great release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD OF POD","review":"Im a fan of this band since their debut album The Fundamental Elements of Southtown a great album ,their follow up cd sattelite was a little dissapointment to me,payable of death was a great album .So I pick up this cd expecting great things and man this is the best cd to date.Overall 90/100best songs if you could see me now,roots in the stereo,mark my words"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD has heart","review":"I've been listening to this cd nonstop for 3 weeks now, which may say something about it.

To me, it is a mixture of all their previous works plus somehting new that I just can't describe--this disc is very addicting to say the least. I watched P.O.D the other night on Leno and when they performed, it gave me chills much like the time when I first heard 'ALIVE'. I think the last album was a little weak and that was expected with the changes they had gone through but please don't let that disuade you from getting this album.

They still have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll's Album of the Year","review":"Cheap Trick has been one of my favorite's for more than 25 years. Robin Zander's beguiling vocals have always been the hook. Nobody sings like this guy. Ever. Like many war-horse bands, they are oft criticized for a lack of recent material that compares with their early albums. Maybe that's because those early efforts were so damn good. In any case, Rockford shatters that assumption. Every track a classic. They performed at least six of the new songs when I saw them last summer, and they could have played them all. I have a new favorite song every time I hear \\"Rockford.\\" As good as their best material ever. Inventive, clever, beautiful. And those vocals. Zander has lost little range after all these years, and uses what he has to greater effect. I've seen Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Roger Daltrey and Steven Tyler. Zander is better. \\"Rockford\\" has him at him best."},{"rating":"2","title":"In 10 years, maybe 5 stars","review":"I tend to give five stars only if an album has aged well. \\"Rockford\\" certainly has that potential. What a great group of songs! All well composed, performed and with hooks that just grab you and won't let go.The unsung hero of Cheap Trick? Why, none other than Mr. Bun E. Carlos! Has a man ever played drums so perfectly as on this record? Never overplaying, a trait that he learned from the pop drumming master, Ringo Starr, but adding just enough chops to keep the rhythms from getting mundane. Bun E. drums his heart out on this one.And Robin Zander is over 50, smokes, and sounds like this? Sick!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate Power Pop","review":"Unlike most CT fans, I got into this band late in their career when I came across their underrated self-titled 1997 disc. I was disappointed with Special One, but Rockford is rock solid. Strong hooks and melodies, great songwriting, and the band sounds great. (My favorite tracks at the moment are Decaf, All those Years, and Perfect Stranger). I can't believe Zander's voice still sounds so great -- after 25+ years of almost constant touring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally underrated","review":"I admit to having a bias in favor of the boys from Rockford but this is really a tremendous effort.

Your fans know how relevant you are and will always be!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockford Rocks","review":"This is without a doubt one of Cheap Tricks greatest albums. This time they've got it. Once again this record proves that although most rock can seem formulaic great music smashes the formula within any genre. The songwriting is fantastic, the lyrics have great meaning within the band, everyone is playing with a ferver not heard in bands of this age in years. With the death of John Entwhistle of The Who the mantle of rock's greatest bass player who isn't Paul McCartney passes to Tom Petersson. As the only person on the planet to ever master the instrument he helped invent, the twelve string bass, his playing on this CD is majestic. If you only buy one CD this year make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back","review":"I can't stop listening to this CD. This is not only another great Cheap Trick CD, it's one of their best period. I can't believe that after all this time these guys can still keep me interested in them. One track after another they sound as catchy now as they did 20+ years ago. Their last couple of records were nothing to get overly excited about, but this one blows me away. Cheap Trick has always has been heavily influenced by the Beatles and you can certainly here it in Oh Clair. The Linda Perry (Four Non Blondes) Tune is one of the most memorable tunes on the CD. Dream the Night Away sounds like early Def Leppard you gotta love it. This CD it like a trip back in time for any CT fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product waited until installed before failing","review":"Purchased to replace a similar device from Southern Bell, it waited until I installed it before the screen froze.

It's a start and you can see as it goes on the characters developing. I'm almost halfway through and I can see Suzanne's character change to what we all remember her as, so savvy, not the typical housewife. One thing I do notice, the interaction and admiration between the husband and wife. As far as the other characters I am not too impressed, you see too much of the airline navigator/neighbor stopping by too much and too much of Jerry Robinson, the Dentist. It's usually Bob's patients that will generally make you laugh and I hope to see more of them in the upcoming seasons. I am not so happy with the way it was restored. The color seems very brown and the audio is terrible compared to most shows, but it is the 1st season. And as far as I can see, no great special features on this one.

There was poor Bob in his super wide ties and butt enhancing double vented sport coats that no one I knew could afford when the show debuted. Yep, Bob was funny, bumbling, and quite a bit selfish, but, better than that, the show was infested with hysterical characters. And, how could Carol dress like that if she had even one mirror in her apartment? No bad words or disgusting situations that are the apparent staples of modern programming. This is a good thing.
