Let's start by saying that Indochine was a total hit in Peru in late 80s and the main reason was the diffusion of this concert, which features the best songs from the first 5 years of the group (L'aventurier, Canary Bay, 3eme. Sexe...).If you have never listened to the group, you should first listen to this concert. Personally every time I listened to them, I feel transported to a magic world.

However, the Celt still reigns strong in Artorius (Arthur) and with Myrddin's (Merlin) help rises to the demands of kingship or in this case that of a count, and strives to put down the rebellious kinglets in his realm.Additionally,, Lancelot's and Guinevere's betrayal is skillfully and cleverly brought to light by Myrddin.Finallly, this book engaged some different methods of portraying the Arthurian Legend in an enchanting but totally believable way.

They keep the charcoal where it needs to be for the Indirect method and leave plenty of room for a drip pan in between. But even better, I often place them together when doing the Direct method to keep the charcoal confined to a more central location. That means I can use less charcoal and get concentrated heat when grilling just a couple of steaks or patties or veggies - using my large weber as if it were a small one. These are well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Save ur charcoal","review":"I've had mine for close to a year. They're dirty as hell, but they're still working great for me. They've held together better than I expected as well.These holders help make the cooking go faster and help you use less charcoal by keeping the coals close to the grate.You can fit three 1/2 lb burgers comfortably over each one of these, and they leave a largish-chicken-sized area in the middle of the grill clear for indirect cooking.Best of all is that when you're done, you'll have coals left over. Just close any bottom vents and put the cover on the grill. Your charcoal will soon die out, and you can reuse them the next time you grill. Just lift 'em out and dump the coals into ur favorite charcoal starter. By doing this I've saved as much money on charcoal as I spent on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"works well but there are better options","review":"The function of these work as expected.

Using tongs, I can even move the hot coals to a different location for better heat distribution when necessary. This was a nice upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber 9600 is a great item!","review":"Purchased the Weber 9600 to better control the heat for indirect cooking on the grill.

There are many different styles of hip-hop and this is conscious-minded hip-hop at it's best. The beats are great, the words are clear and easy to understand, the music positive and gratifying, the rhythm is solid.. all put together this album is definitely worth a listen.

Bottom line, these guys can spit! I was shocked, this is true hiphop. This kind of music gives hiphop a name. I like there kinda style, because they can spit complex lyrics and real rhymes.

I first thought this was an erotic thriller myself. But Vicki Mayerson's bitter revenge is totally different from Jennifer Lyons' dangerous seduction, so to say. Nonetheless, director Marc Grenier deserves all the credit in making this B-thriller surprisingly enjoyable. Pretty good screenplay and cinematography, plus some nice acting (oh yes, believe it or not) by Alexandra Paul (the Baywatch girl) and Michelle Johnson. Furthermore, since \\"Fallen Angel\\" aka \\"Revenge\\" has its plot based on the animosity of a young girl who survived a teenaged gang's careless prank, the flashbacks are well calculated to gradually unravel some dark secrets that lead to a dramatic and believable ending. Not a waste of time, compared to many senseless flicks that are labeled \\"thrillers\\" out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suspense at all! totally silly movie!!!!!","review":"This movie is nothing but a dull, dreadful, & boring piece of film. The killer (a lady) in the movie is so unbelievable in the the role, and the lead lady cop (a star from Baywatch), is totally out of place playing this kind of part!!!

Of course, to be fair, I do suppose you have to be something of a cat lover (or at least, live with cats) to understand her wit and humor -- in other words, the concept of two cats holding their owner's 1040 hostage for food might be lost on the uninitiated.The only negative thing I will say is that this particular volume, \\"My Cat's Not Fat, He's Just Big Boned\\", contains some of the same material as her earlier \\"Everything Here Is Mine\\", which is the only reason I gave it four stars and not five."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We All Have Our Dreams. In Ours, A Flock Of Finches Lose Their Way, Fly Into Our Kitchen, And Land In Our Bowls.\\"","review":"\\"Sylvia\\" is one of the most consistently witty cartoons around. It is funny, intelligent, preposterous, and frequently features cats (and occasionally dogs). Far from being mere loving pets, the cats in Hollander's comics have ulterior motives, excel at deception, and are capable of hypnotizing their owners.Several themes are recurrent, mostly dealing with various feline food obsessions, though early morning apologies for broken things (and missing dogs) are also featured prominently.These comics are subtle and sly; not everyone will grasp their nuance, but for those who appreciate subtle, sarcastic humor, or who just love cats, this is a great collection and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you think really hard.... you might get one of the jokes!","review":"I saw the cover of this book, and thought it would be a funny addition.

Anyone playing classical/exotic scales very,very fast in the '80s was labeled with that tag. Yeah, a couple songs remind you of YJM, but 'Tonight I Fly' and 'Secret Lover' is not even close. Bonnet on vocals just fits this album perfectly, blending with Chris' playing on every song. 'Rainbow' gets hacked-on, but I thought it was fitting considering Chris' tragic childhood; perhaps his Grandmother played this for him to make him smile (who knows..it has some righteous shredding in it throughout). Probably my favorite shred album (non-instrumental) of all-time. Maybe if YJM's 'Rising Force' had a better vocalist, I may say otherwise.

If you play (or attempt to play) guitar you have to hear this."},{"rating":"1","title":"How NOT to make an album","review":"I recently purchased \\"Stand in Line\\" solely based on Mr. Impellitteri's reputation as a speedy guitarist. Unfortunately, the bulk of his solo playing is buried due to poor mixing. What I can hear sounds fast, but very mechanical and uninspired.As with most shredders, comparisons to Yngwie are unavoidable. However, I hear more similarity in the songwriting than the soloing. The song structures, chord voicings, and even instrument tones are so Malmsteen-esque it's not funny.By far, the biggest disappointment to me was the inclusion of a 5+ minute cover of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" right in the middle of the album. While his interpretation of the classic tune was mildly interesting, it certainly didn't fit with the other material. I could see using it as a hidden track at the end, but that's about it. Why he chose to stick it smack dab in the middle is beyond me.If you're into shred-style guitar, I honestly feel you could do much better than \\"Stand in Line.\\" Sorry Chris."},{"rating":"1","title":"a product from the \\"music circus\\" days ...","review":"Chris had the most ridiculous hairdo and the speediest hands of all times and that's about it. Of course this and being dressed like half medieval half clown was part of the scene in those days. I call them the \\"music circus\\" (also Hair Band) days and they go from about 1984 on to the beginning of the nineties when grunge became the fashion. A lot of the music made during that period didn't stand the test of time because it takes a lot more than acrobat techniques and flashy outfits to make good music. This record is for speedsolo-freaks and Graham Bonnet-fans only, not for those looking for a catchy soul-moving metal classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colby's History","review":"I am a school media specialist and have only come across one original copy of this book which was at the local public library. It is a wealth of information on early New Hampshire, especially the the Indian tribes and pioneers of the era. Very hard to find, historical, little known historical material. The book has never been reprinted. If you are interested in early Indian history of the Northeast, then this is a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have on numerous occasions purchased Alfred Sung Forever.

The photos are a good as you'd expect from Ken Light, one of the best black and white photographers in the County. This is one of the poorest parts of the county with grinding economic conditions and yet these people are treated honestly and with great dignity. The moutain culture is largely unknown but is a greatly interesting part of our culture. This is a deeply touching book, a view of a often hidden people. I would highly recommend this to anyone interest in this part of the county, interested in the Appplachian culture or interested in great photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"BULL\\" Hollow?","review":"I am a native of McDowell County where many of these photographs were taken, and I cannot recall ever seeing people living in such squalor as was depicted in this book. I am surprised that the Lights were able to come up with so many photographs that represent the southern part of West Virginia in such a bad light. West Virginia does suffer from a depressed economy, but locations with the appalling conditions shown in these photos are not typical of the area. This must be a work of fiction. I hope people won't judge my beautiful state by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Fallacy!!!","review":"Having lived in southern West Virginia for nearly 50 years, I find this work to be insulting to the people of southern West Virginia. The Lights must have looked long and hard to find places with the appalling conditions that have been depicted in this book. Granted, the economy of West Virginia is not stellar, but the majority of its citizens and its communities are not represented in this book. Yes, this state has been shaped by its coal heritage, but it has not been destroyed by it. Southern West Virginia still struggles, but not to the extent implied in these photographs. Those seeking a more accurate portrayal of life in coal communities should look elsewhere, or, better yet, visit and see for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop journalism advocacy at its worst.","review":"While Light's pictures are moving and brilliantly taken, he uses his talent to make a second rate piece of agitprop.This book would have been an accurate representation of coal mining in Appalachia in the 1920's, but it is grossly misrepresenting of this way of life as it exists today and it plays off some of the worst stereotypes of Appalachia including toothless hillbillies and Klansmen. Contemporary coal mining is dangerous work, and always will be, but mineworkers are well paid highly trained individuals who take pride in their ability to survive lean times.Anyone interested in Appalachia should forego this piece of garbage, get in a car and go see it for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great saw","review":"I reviewed jet,grizzley,general,delta unisaw,laguna, and several other taiwan made saws. The powermatic was the winner. You can't go wrong with the 5 hp motor, fine machined table, steel machined crank locking knobs, bigger crank handles, rock solid fence. The saw came with a QA label showing arbor runnout, etc. I set it up in about 4 hrs and ran a machinist straight edge over the table. The saw measured out at .002 flatness, pretty good. You will need to buy a 10 ga wire, plug, etc to hook it up. The manual was clearly written. The saw has not been slowed down while cutting everything from ripping old hard oak to maple. Great piece of equipment. The only concern was the PM 66 had always used a 3VX belt to drive the pulleys and Amazon even advertised as such. However, when I received my saw it only has 2 belts and pulleys. This was very misleading in my view. Overall - good saw, but have had the saw for over a year and Amazon is still advertising the 3VX belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in town","review":"As a long time Joe Jackson fan, I find this an interesting recording. First, to go back and revisit a concept album for a second time in one career is a unique approach. He said on his website, that this was just another look at 24 hours in the life of new york city, 18 years later. Obviously he has a lot to say about the changes that have taken place over that time frame. I think the use of more vocalists, simply represents his view that the city is a diverse place and he needed different voices to reflect that. To me that one of the strong suits to this recording.I doubt you'll hear this on the radio, there are no standout singles except \\"stranger than you\\". And that sounds a little to much like the material for laughter and lust, Which was not his best effort. Still, Joe on a bad day is better than quite a lot of music out there, and I find this an enjoyable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort","review":"Like many Joe Jackson fans, I considered Night and Day to be among the artist's finest works and so, I bought this CD with high expectations. I am disappointed to report that my expectations were not met as this work, while good, simply does not capture the heart and soul like the first CD. It is a good album but not a great one.I did manage to see Mr. Jackson live on his last tour and he performed about half of this CD. It is much better live than on the CD but still fell a bit short.Skip this one and go out and buy Live in NYC instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Can Do Much Better Than This...","review":"This supposed \\"sequel\\" to his spectacular hit LP \\"Night and Day\\" (early '80s) lacks all the warmth and humor that made that earlier record such a success.Here, Jackson employes latin drum beats and urbane lyricism, similar at times to the style found on Night and Day. But this new album has a cold, calculated, brittle feeling to it. There is absolutely nothing here that can match the sleek ambience of \\"Steppin' Out\\" (from Night and Day) for example...I was very disappointed with this CD overall... fans of Joe Jackson should seek out the new Live In New York instead(energetic performances of many of his classics, plus a few surprises).Those who are interested in a good starting point for Joe Jackson should try the Hits collection, which has been re-mastered and contains 17 of the best songs from his career.But avoid this one (Night and Day II) at all costs... it's tired and wearisome and boring and simply does not represent this artist at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you think.","review":"I had to listen to this album a couple of times before it started to grow on me. This is usually the case with me and JJ's albums. Then I get to know them better and start to really like them. There are some really great songs on this album. Some I don't really care for, but hey! Take the good with the ugly right? One thing that I really like about Joe Jackson is that he never does the same thing all the time. Night and Day II is strange and beautiful indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"update on an original classic","review":"this cd lacks the commercial sucess of the first NIGHT and DAY album but it is certainly as brilliant.STRANGER THAN YOU is a great song should have been a hit describes NYC perfect.HAPPYLANDis facinating a little sarcastic even for joe jackson but a good song.good disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare and Beautiful Collection of Songs","review":"At first listen I was dissapointed and intimidated by NAD2. I saw a dark and moody place I was afraid to enter. As a JJ fan from the beginning, however, I figured Joe would make it worthwhile. After several listenings, I discovered a collection of gems that transcends his earlier works in insight and musical skill. Joe's musical experience comes to fruition in a collection of songs that trancends barriers. I love good classical music, but I'm grateful Joe has not turned his back on pop music. While the lyrics of NAD2 display no hope for the future, the music is entirely full of hope.Any music that reveals its worth in the first listening is probably too shallow to retain your interest for long. Spend the time with NAD2, and you will find songs that you'll likely be listening to for the rest of your life. NAD2 is not only a revealing collection of character tales, it's beautiful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"After a few listens, this is a masterpiece","review":"I've been a JJ fan for 15 years, but was underwhelmed by most of his 90's stuff. Then, we get the incredible symphony last year... and now this!On first listen, NDII is disjointed and strange. It's not \\"Blaze of Glory\\", or \\"Body and Soul\\", or \\"Night And Day\\". But on second listen... maybe it's the sweetness of \\"Love Got Lost\\", or the hook of \\"Dear Mom\\", but the album starts to lure you in. By the third or fourth listen, you finally get \\"Glamour and Pain\\", and the album matures. Much like JJ. I was disappointedthe first time I listened to this album. But now, I regard it as the best album of the last two years, period. And like \\"Blaze of Glory\\", I bet I'm still listening to it 13 years from now...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Joe, why!?","review":"Ouch- this album was a big disappointment to me! I'm a huge Joe Jackson fan (I think I have all his studio albums just about), but this one just goes nowhere fast! Pretentious operatic swells, contrived lyrics, instrumentation more at place on a Lite Rock station. It's really a big surprise for me- esp. since his \\"Live in NY\\" album he put out earlier that year is absolutely AMAZING! Joe and two other guys on stage, the essence of a live rock/jazz trio, and all the power and brilliance you come to expect from The Man! Oh well----every artist has to go off a navel-gazing tangent some time. Night and Day II was Jackson's turn to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every genius has a bad day","review":"I'm a huge JJ fan and can recommend many other JJ albums over this dud. I consider him to be a really gifted artist.There is one song, however, called Love Got Lost which is vintage Joe and is something you may want to buy by itself on Napster.Everything else is way below the quality of songwriting you'd expect from an artist of this caliber. This is one of his only albums where he has songs such as Dear Mom which is embarrassingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The differences between Night and Day and Night and Day II are day and night","review":"Jackson makes a play at mainstream attention again with this contrived sequel, imitating predecessor's high-minded and eclectic pop sensibilities, though loosing much of the soul which inhabited the original and appearing all the more pretentious for it- hearing Stepping Out \\"themed\\" not once but twice throughout is disheartening enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Despite reading the \\"Nice, but not Nice Enough\\" comment by one reviewer, I purchased this book and considered it for myself. I'm so glad I did. The reviewer misses the point. It's an architecture-oriented lifestyle book about the history of living in Malibu, not a technical book. Which explains why there are no floorplans. It's about the photos that take you thru each decade and each house, and they are gorgeous. The introductory text/concise house-specific texts are well-written and informative. The featured houses are mostly private, which explains why no addresses are provided. The 2 or 3 houses in the book that are open to the public are well known in this area, easily findable for those who have a yellow pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malibu","review":"I thought that the book was \\"outstanding\\" Particulary liked the history part and the progression of Malibu over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show Me The Way","review":"It's hard to put into words just how inspirational TARGET JOY was for me.

Hole would go onto display much greater music and this is really just the band in their beggining days, which makes it an interesting listen for a hole fan. There is creativity here, you can see the hole blueprint..the ideas are forming,but the band is still trying to come up with the music part(which can be described as a dark, brooding mess of grunge-punk, with disturbing, but not entirely bad lyrics) I would recomend for hole fans to pick this up to hear the band in their earliest incarnation...just dont expect to hear great music...step back into 1990 with the monster that was courtney and hole!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I dread dealing with people who have read this book!","review":"This book has too many mistakes, period.

It's rude to do so, of course, and it's annoying enough when the person doing the correcting is right, but it's doubly annoying when the person offering to \\"educate\\" you is wrong.This book is going to give a lot of these jackasses a false sense of legitimacy.

Room Noises is a breath of fresh air for music-lovers that are tired of music on radio waves nowdays. With 12 beautifully created songs, this CD is a hit, where Sherri and Stacy Dupree's bright voices intertwine melodically with the haunting guitars and keys. The lyrics are brilliantly written, deep and fantasy-like, with songs like Golly Sandra, in which a parent thinks about their regrets, or Telescope Eyes, a song about rejection. Room Noises is a must have for anyone who is looking for the next big thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's go far away to the humming meadow...","review":"This CD is amazing. Every song is different and unique. They sing about nature among other things. Room Noises is a perfect CD to slow dance to in the middle of nowhere.

Including single-released track 'Marvelous Things', this album is definitely one of the absolute best of the year. Eisley's whimsical lyrics, eerily perfect harmony, and mature musical-dynamics all come together in a magnificent blend of artistic expression. Their lyrics are simple yet come across as complex when heard along with the beautiful guitar and drum melodies. The hypnotic voices of the DuPree sisters harmonize incredibly, and hold a resemblance to that of Sixpence None the Richer's Leigh Nash. Eisley's \`Room Noises' is a must have record, surely acknowledgeable with \`Best Upcoming Artist' or even \`Album of the Year'. This band's future looks promising and bright, and brings hope of a new generation of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Addicting","review":"Eisley's first full length album, Room Noises, is a beautiful piece of work that deserves recognition as an instant classic. The melodious vocals and finger-tapping instrumentals work together to create music that you won't want to stop listening to. Two personal favorites of mine are \\"Telescope Eyes\\" and \\"Marvelous Things.\\" Both have the beat and lyrics that will stay stuck in your head for days, yet will never grow old. Eisley is full of promise and sure to become the next big hit. Find out why by listening to their new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Album Now","review":"When you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over, then you know you've got a good album.Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's \\"ahhs\\" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in perfect harmony. Every song has its moments of pure joy and satisfaction. It just makes you feel good.Simply put, its just good listening. Good music for the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Wow","review":"I just saw Eisley live at the Cat's Cradle in Carrboro, NC. I had never heard of them. Not to mention how fall-in-love-with-you beautiful the two singers are, their music is entrancing. I just heard that they are all sisters and a brother and a friend. They have such beautiful harmonies and are heartfelt singers, combined with a thumpin' rhythm section (here's where the guys pitch in) that I was really smitten with them and their sound.Check out these guys! And see 'em live if you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Noises Coming From My Room","review":"Wow. From beginning to end, wow. Eisley has succeeded in releasing a cd that captivated me from beginning to end, and not many bands can do that. Room Noises is a beautifully mind boggling album full of musical complexity. This is not your run of the mill band. They do their own thing, their own way, with their own unique beautiful sound. With the addition of a couple songs from the Laughing City Ep (Memories and Marvelous Things)this cd delivers. The music is just so together and seems like it just comes out naturally and flows along to create masterpeice. Stacy and Sherri's voices sound just as sweet and melodic as before and with catchy choruses and sweetly infectuous verses this cd will surely become a fan favorite for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD's Good, But...","review":"\\"Room Noises\\" (and all their other EPs, for that matter) makes Eisley sound fine, but have you seen the live clip on their website?

You may or may not think Moses wrote it, but his authorship is NOT \\"commonly accepted,\\" and for the book to say that it is is simply dishonest.). The section on Church History is basic Anti-Catholic screed, all about evil Popes with nary a word about the history of Protestants persecuting Catholics. Oh, and it also says that the Pope is the antiChrist.This may interest a few extremist fundamentalists, but no intelligent Christian would lend it an ounce of creedence.

But for under $8.00, it is an excellent deal and here is why: It will produce great grilled food with that real charcoal taste that is so lacking from gas grills, and it will last several years and many hundreds of uses if you keep it from getting wet.

Very versatile when covering multiple genres. Now, on to the coated snare head.I personally love the simplicity of a coated Powerstroke-3. I love how they are built to minimize overtones, and I find them very responsive at all stick heights.

Well, I was surprised by this novel. It is a mature and not the least dated telling of an imigrant girl's experiences growing up on the Nebraska plains in the late 1800's/early 1900s. It is more a series of short stories than an actual novel.Being told from some else's point of view besides Antonia's gives the book a wider scope.

It is a long, rambling character-and-setting study. The characters and setting are, I suppose, interesting enough.

Antonia's poverty stricken family are faced with bitter challenges along wirth the growing affection of Jim feels for the lovely Antonia.

My second reading was as interesting as my first reading at age 12 (approximately). Willa Cather writes with simple spare prose that transports you back to that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable read","review":"I did a term paper on the works of Willa Cather in high school; this novel one remains with me to this day. Cather's prose are magnificent; with just a few words she captures the loneliness and sadness of lost youth and prairie life. Don't be put off by comments about the slowness of the novel. This was written at a time when life moved at a much slower pace and television had yet to ruin our patience. Stephan King it's not, but given the chance, it will provide a reader with a very memorable and enjoyable experience. I highly recommend it. (And remember to, that's saying alot since I was forced to read it in high school!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"heart-warming story about life on the prairie","review":"Almost no plot, but a wonderful, enchanting read nevertheless. Loved everyone in this novel. Jake and Otto and Lena and Jim were all so real to me. The friendship that blossomed between Jim & Antonia was sweet w/o being too sappy. I'm surprised (actually not that surprised) that this moving piece of literature is rated as 4 stars while poorly-written drek like the Notebook gets higher ratings & bestsellerdom. To make the bucks, ya gotta cater to the mindless masses I guess. Read My Antonia!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not only a girl's book.","review":"Even though my teacher described it as a love story, it is not. I saw it as a true representation of the pioneers on their settlement of the Old West. I would recommend it for any person who would like to experience the feeling of being back on the farm in the early to late 1800s."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I'll start by saying I gave this book 2 stars because I would have felt awkward giving it one when so many people apparently think it is great. Those people aside, it deserves a one star rating, in my opinion. My chief complaint is that it is a formulaic and downright boring period piece. The love between the well-off American and the dirt poor foreign girl is a good example of uninspired writing. I found the characters stereotypical, the setting done to death and the plot (and I only use that word because I don't know what else to call it) simply doesn't go anywhere. But it's not all bad, at least Wick Cutter was interesting. In closing I would like to qualify this review by saying that I read a lot of books and there are only about two that I don't like and wouldn't recommend. It doesn't take much to please me; an interesting story, a fun character, a different style, all it takes is one redeeming feature for me to consider a book worthwhile. I find My Antonia a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a good book, but it had no plot!","review":"Sorry, but I don't think this book deserves it's place as an \\"American classic.\\" It is good, but not fabulous. It's strong point would be it's descriptions of nature, but the characters were disappointing. The end is a bit of a letdown as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Antonia lacked a griping story and plot","review":"I had to read this book for a school term paper (Women In Amreican Literature), and I found it to be rather boring. Of course, it could be because I had to compare it to books like The Awakening, and The Scarlet Letter... so it may just be that compard to the two of those, it seemed rather drab. However, I didn't expect any of these books to grab me...but the ones that did, can't even measure up to My Antonia. My Antonia just seemed so dull and it felt as though it was lacking something."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book so much I finnished it in two days!","review":"I'm an avid reader of the Classics and to tell you the truth I was not too enthusiastic about this one at first, but after the first chapter I was hooked. I found it facinating and wonterful how the story portrayed these hard working women of the past in an adoring way. It made me want to be the kind of woman that they were; strong, courageous, and determined. Not only were the characters amazing, but the way Willa Cather described the hard times of winter made me feel as if I were sitting out in the cold of Nebraska rather than my warm home. One line that I read will forever stay with me \\" it was as if we were being punnished for loving the loveliness of summer.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My Antonia","review":"Great timing...and the book was in great condition. Thanks for having a good product, what you see is what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Antonia","review":"Cather displays a relationship between to unlike souls, who make a connection that lasts forever. Even though Jim and Antonia never explore their relationship beyond a platonic level,I loved the ending. It was maybe not the ending that everyone would want but that is what made it an interesting read. Once I started reading the novel I could not put it down. Cather also hints but never really mentions how the women are the strong and independent women. There was a matriachy of sorts in Mrs. Shimereda which is unusual for the time period. I recommend the book for a raining day when you have a couple of hours to relax. It is an easy read and you won't be able to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want to like it, but I did!","review":"I had to read this novel for a class, and needless to say I was not looking forward to the task. Quickly, however, I became engrossed by the moving story of lost childhood bliss. Antonia takes a sad path but she remains one of the best written woman characters of all-time. Yes I'm a man, but I can admit I was touched by this novel, SO THERE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Antonia, Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I have purchased many copies of this edition to give as gifts to Cather grandchildren and friends because because the type is well spaced on bright paper, and the introduction and glossery give helpful information to beginning Cather readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major flaw from narrator","review":"I had to stop listening to this recording, as the narrator consistently mispronouces \\"Antonia.\\" He accents the 3rd syllable rather than the 1st syllable. Willa Cather even tells how the name should be pronounced in one of the early chapters (Chapter 3 I believe?). The Bohemian name \\"Antonia\\" places the accent on the first syllable, like the way we pronounce \\"Anthony\\" in English.So I'll actually read the book instead of listening to it, as I've heard raves about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book that I loved...","review":"My Antonia is droning and full of pointless imagry. Although I understand that is a \\"classic\\" novel, it really just put me to sleep. Endless descriptions of the seemingly endless prairie made the book much longer than it should be. Although the plot is good and Antonia and Jim's coming of age is something most people can relate to, the events portrayed seem to modern to be happening in Black Hawk, Nebraska-1890's. Everyone's story is that of personal success and happiness. There are no plot twists and turns to keep the book interesting and after reading this book I doubt that I will ever pick up another Willa Cather novel again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A high school girl's point of view.","review":"This book is like reading the diary of somone who has lead the most boring life imaginable. The imagery however is pretty good.

I can't belive i read the whole thing. Its a very slow, almost love story, with almost no plot at all. It is, however, very well written. Cather uses good words and expression in describing every character and ever situation, but that isn't neraly enough to make this an interesting book. Nice try, but not good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"My Antonia\\"","review":"Willa Cather's, \\"My Antonia,\\" is a brilliant book. It illustrates the warmth of a wonderful friendship. \\"My Antonia\\" takes you back to a desolate Nebraska where this beautiful friendship takes place.

It made me laugh and it also made me cry!I would definately recommend this book to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"found study guide helpful","review":"I found the study guide helpful with reading My Antonia. Each section of the book has its own summary at the back of the book. One could almost read the summary section only and understand the book, but I am not recommending that. I enjoyed the book overall and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read classic American literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Antonia","review":"A wonderful classic by Willa Cather which I somehow missed when I was young.

An unexpected twist at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring it'll make you cry!","review":"THIS BOOK HAS NO PLOT! Even my English teacher admitted it.

For me, it defines the word dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has good intentions...but fails","review":"\\"My Antonia\\" takes place during the mid 1800s on the Nebraska prarie and tells the story of the ever-changing relationship between Bohemian immigrant girl Antonia Shimerda and Jim (the books narrator).I was very dissapointed in the book. Willa Cather has good intentions trying to depict the landscape down to every last detail, but end up making her charming story hard to follow. I lost interest in the book qucikly. I also found it very dissapointing that Antonia does not play a more important role in the story... the main focus is on Jim about halfway through the book. Antonia is a far more interesting and complex character than Jim, and is more fun to read about. All things considered,it is not worth your time and effort to finish. However, if you are a huge history fan or are into westward expansion, you may enjoy \\"My Antonia\\" more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's most boring book","review":"I'm sorry I did not like this book at all. I do have to admit that the some of the discriptions were pretty good, but the book has no plot. This is one of these books that I wish I would have acted like I read, as I did with a few other books we had to read. So I only found one interesting part in the whole book and that was the wolve story with Peter and Pavel and that was it. I feel asleep reading it, and during class could barely keep my eyes open because it is like reading a text book, or a report on something. So reading it for most teenagers like myself is more like a tourture, a good idea for a punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it","review":"I had the audio version of this book...I couldn't get past disc one.

It had no point, no plot, and I hated it. It was so terrible. I only read for required reading for school. I will never read any of this woman's books again. It should be a crime to even call her an author. It should be a federal offense to call her a good author. I don't know how this book got published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good original replacement","review":"This is a exact replacement for the original insert. I wish I had bought a zero clearance insert instead. It's cheaper, has an opening that is just as big as you want, and fits perfectly. Still, the original does the job if you do not mind the large gap between the blades and the insert. The original is easy to adjust and fits as designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a pretty decent job","review":"These are fairly easy to use. Making sure the ground is nice and level is one of the most critical parts of using these and pays off in the end. At first I was disappointed that the bottom half of the mold is open and creates one continuous piece instead of individual pavers, but it saved on sand for the joints and made a stronger slab. It creates joints that only go down half way in the center of the mold and you can't tell any difference after you sand the joints anyway so it really isn't a big deal. Near the end of the project the molds started to arch a little. Wish the plastic would have been a little stronger, but that is about the only complaint. We are happy with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concrete mold","review":"The mold works great. I have used it to build a 20 foot sidewalk and not had any problems.

You know these guys. You care about these guys. You are these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Conclusion","review":"The Way Between Worlds provides an outstanding conclusion to this very long but very entertaining series. With the now standard lack of a good or evil side it's up to the reader to pick a hero to cheer on towards the final showdown. All of the questions asked but not answered in the earlier books will be resolved.Karen is probably the only character with no ambitions or secret motives or plans to rule the world, though she is now widely suspected of being Rulke's pawn. Most of the other characters spend the book fighting for personal or racial gain, and their motives can't really be critised. Other fantasy novels have played up the 'no true good or evil' but this one is the first to pull it off without any exception. The usual story of pulling a super villain out of nowhere and banding the former enemies together to save the day doesn't make an appearance here."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly inspiring stuff","review":"I love this series. Why? Because it is a truly thoughtful and thought provoking epic. Wonderfully absent are the hollow minor characters and largely irrelevant plot twists that so plague the masses of fantasy tales available. From page 1, through 4 volumes to the paragraph, a masterful story is being told. Unlike so many authors, Irvine uses subplots to enrich and enhance the events and characters of the main story, rather than simply as a diversion from it, poorly tied together. And, refreshingly, these worlds explored are lovingly crafted in immense detail, and the history, evolution and cultures of these worlds are as interesting as the story itself, rather than functioning simply as an arena for the action.

It is an extremely boring read.The book focuses on the sources of information used by historians as much as the history itself.

This book is full of typographical errors (a problem when learning and using formulas), and also computational errors (in both this book and the accompanying study guide). The language is also either confusing or oversimplified, depending on which chapter you are reading.It gives only the VERY, VERY basest of knowledge regarding statistics; it serves best as a rarely referred to supplement to other stats books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Signing Time Vol 2","review":"My 1 year-old loves this!

Most videos won't keep my 18-month-old's attention because she has a much harder time connecting spoken language with what is going on on the video.

I think she likes all the moving objects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I loved volume 1 so it was a no brainer to get volume 2.

I like it a lot better than the Baby Einstein signing video."},{"rating":"1","title":"for older babies","review":"I started the \\"My First Signs\\" from Baby Einstein at around 5 months, and my baby loves it. He watched it every day for a long time. But I get sick of the same thing over and over, and the later Baby Einstein videos with sign language don't really teach babies the signs--there is not enough reinforcement. So I looked around for another series and bought this DVD and a \\"My Baby Can Talk\\" at the same time. This DVD was not interesting to my 8-month-old. He likes the \\"My Baby Can Talk,\\" but this one spends too long on one idea to hold his attention.

Since Celine is not working this year, Sony decided to release this CD, but there's nothing very new.

I hope the other volumes of this collection are better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Gift For any Celine fan","review":"I saw Celine Dion in concert and belive me she is the real thing. This cd is a prefect thing becuase it gives us (Americans) a chance to hear some of her other songs in different languages. I enjoy all of the tracks (old and new) especially the duets. Whether curling up with a good book or trying to sleep this cd is perfect for background music. It has a mix of some of Celine's best songs- mostly slower and very beautiful.

I bought it because well...it's Celine, and I adore her. BUT...why did she release this cd besides to make some money during her absence? I mean' C'mon! Where's volume 2 or 3? Are we going to get them, or are we just stuck with this volume 1 with VERY RANDOM songs on it?

This CD is missing some her other BIG hits like her song Call The Man, and All By Myself (English Version!), Treat Her Like A Lady! Well, and the song Us isn't a hit, nor is the other song Seduces Me. The only good songs that I really love on her are Where Does My Heart Beat Now?, Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore, Be The Man, and That's The Way It Is. May be for those who don't have this album should skip this album and buy her new one instead. Sorry Celine!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not half bad","review":"I like about half of the songs on this album. Por Que tu maimes Encore is an incredible performance, both in English and in French. The Power of the Dream is both beautiful and inspirational. I can't say Where Does my Heart beat now is a favorite of mine. Tell Him is a nice, slow duet with Celine and Barbra. I really like \\"Us\\" and That's the way it is, another upbeat inspirational song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Compilation","review":"Celine's latest release has a better selection of songs than her previous greatest hits album. This Collector's Series Volume 1 (which leads one to believe that there will be more volumes) combines several of Celine's international hits (not released on All the Way) with some fantastic tracks from her previous releases, and three songs previously unavailable in the U.S. (\\"Amar Aciendo Al Amor\\", \\"Be The Man\\",and \\"Sola Otra Vez\\"). Another rare track on the album, \\"The Power of The Dream,\\" the inspiring theme for the 1996 Olympics, was avaible in the U.S. only on the CD single of Celine's hit \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now.\\" This is a wonderful album which helps devoted fans appreciate Celine's brilliant career, especially by showing her ability for languages (she sings in English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Japanese on the album)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two greatest hits retrospectives--and still no \\"Think Twice\\"","review":"While I continue to enjoy Celine's music, it's baffling that neither of her retrospectives released in the US contain \\"Think Twice\\"--the single that made Celine Dion the megastar that she is around the world (especially in the UK and Australia). Why is that?Also, why bother with a Vol.3? Celine Dion has only released 5 full-length English language studio CDs...it does not justify rereleasing and repackaging all that material again and again.A bit of a letdown, but oh well, the true fans will lap it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real BEST OF","review":"TELL HIM, US, SEDUCES ME..For me this CD is the real BEST OF.

Most pictures are connected well to the text, except for the earliest cars where one is uncertain which car is being pictured. More disappointing are the data appendices on most cars. These have inconsistent information and formatting. For some cars the balancing speed, accelerations and decelerations are given, but not the motors' horsepower. For other cars, the motor horsepower's are given, but not the other data. The most troubling inconsistency is the various values given for the balancing speed of the BMT Standards throughout the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE CLASSICS","review":"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT THE PRODUCT CONDITION CAME JUST AS DESCRIBED; AS WELL THE MOVIE PLAYS GREAT.

These are poorly edited, and ill printed on crummy paper. Additionally, the collection happens to have a number of stories that are printed twice, and to omit several of HPL's not so minor stories. A publisher who gives this kind of treatment to a writer and to his customers doesn't deserve your money.If you like HPL, or just want to discover his works, do yourself and the publishing industry a favor, get your book somewhere else, there are some better collections and omnibuses around waiting for the more discriminating reader"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovecraft exposes darkness like no other","review":"I must say that The Lurking Fear has to be the most entertaining collection of Lovecraft's short stories I've come across yet. He had such a gift. The gift to open up people's minds to new things, strange things, things you don't want to imagine. From The Unnamable to From Beyond to The White Ship, each story exposes the universe of intrigue and mysticism Lovecraft created. Although the characters are only there to represent the ideas Lovecraft exposes, it is still a wonderful read and I suggest it to any open minds or people who just like mind twisters like these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first look","review":"This is the first HP Lovecraft book I bought, and it provided a wonderful introduction to the author.

Medical degrees do NOT make the person. This Dr. was a horrible medical practitioner in every way. From lack of diagnosis to cutting and pasting of other doctors reports rather then performing the tests she was paid well over 500.00 for. I don't mean tests such as MRI and such. She totally dismissed me as a person and a patient. It was only after an MRI Brain damage and atrophy was seen from the motor vehicle accident. A test she could have ordered and something she SHOULD have picked up on with accurate skills testing as another doctor did. I would not waste your money on her books. Her personality and \\"skills\\" with my case were negligent in every way. I PAID her for help and instead was dismissed and was considered malinger in her opinion. It is my opinion her books are not to help you or care about you as to sell books.

So much of it is common sense, I found myself immediately bored and wondering why I was spending my time pushing through it. I can't tell you how many times I screamed, \\"Get to the point!\\". I think the reviewer celeste said it best. This book may have been good with a much better (i.e. firmer) editor involved, but the author was given too much leeway.

In this age of left-brain worship, it's critical that someone with Dr. Schulz's qualifications gives us a treatise on why the right brain should be celebrated for its powers, and why its \\"messages\\" should be heeded more. Yet this book winds up being a treatise on Dr. Schulz, on how dazzling she finds her own intuitive powers, to an almost maddening degree. The reader is repeatedly told that awakening intuition is important, but is never, in this longwinded book, given the tools to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better borrowed than bought","review":"Without question sections of this book are intriguing and well-written, medical research is cited to support the role of intuition, and it reinforces the importance of knowing yourself and making healthy decisions. In the end, however, I was disappointed and irritated with this book. It is far too long, more than a little repetitive, condescending at times, and overly simplistic. In addition, there are several occasions when the text reads more like an autobiography of the author's numerous illnesses/ailments than an exploration of the importance of the mind/body connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What garbage!","review":"Had I not already eaten from the rotten fruit of \\"knowledge\\" of this book, I'd demand my money back. But alas, having read it, I'd feel to guilty. This book is a complete disappointment. One would expect a book on intuition written by an M.D./Ph.D to have some grounding in SCIENCE.

Scant scripture references. The terms he uses like \\"revival\\" (even though he tries his best to define what he means and \\"fill\\" are very vague. His references to \\"peace of Christ\\" are wrong and misguided. I am a Bible-believing Christian who loves the Lord, but seriously thinks that this is pointing believers in the wrong way.

This is THE book. After our group went through the book and the study guide, we grew deeper in our walk with Christ together. It had a significant effect on our connectedness as a group of men.You have heard some concerns that Roy's message of the cross is works based, but I believe that he is discussing the process of sanctification and not salvation.I continue to hear from men of the life changing effects of reading this book.

Very haunting melodies, you will hear its echoes in the strangest ways during your work day; catch these moments to calm the stress, for they are melancholic, mesmerizing imprints and melodic taunts of your mind... urging you to relax. The lyrics are.... pretty, ethereal and zen. (I'm searching for other albums from Marcome!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes","review":"I purchased this last year for myself and haven't had much chance to use it until this Thanksgiving. I have used some of the hints and recipes. I used the oyster dressing recipe for the first time and everyone says it was the best we ever had. We all loved it, but it did take such a long time to prepare....it would have helped if I had some good old stale New Orleans french bread to make crumbs! I used the creole seasoning on the turkey and it was delicious. Since then, I used it (just a bit) on a steak and it was really good, too. There are more recipes I plan to use. For the most part: you can't be in much of a hurry while cooking, but OMG, it is so worth the effort. I recommend this book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More a collection of anectodes than a guide book","review":"This book is more a collection of climbing history and anectodes than a profound guide book. In particular for easier climbs (less than 5.9) the technical route description is usually less than 2 sentences. Consistent information on wall height, number of pitches, typical climbing times, rock quality and necessary gear are missing completely. Only for some routes (mostly rated 5.10a or higher or very popular ascents in the Mt. Whitney range) handdrawn topos are provided that let you guess some of the details in advance. The only valuable information available for EVERY route is a photo of the mountain with the line of ascent.In case of a third edition the authors should familiarize with international standards. A more formal approach will prevent neglecting the large number of climbs that they have NOT done by themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet 60-9100 Ready to Cut sanding belt","review":"This is a high quality product.

Which songs are my favourite? Well, that tends to change with my mood...there is no way to categorize the music: it is whimsical, quirky, light, yet has sinuous threads of slick darkness glinting all through it...a result perhaps of the tensions that supposedly arose from differences between Eno and Cale. Listen to The Backroom to see what I mean. If there were differences, then that tension only served to hone the fine edges a little better.

Not only his work as a producer, but his work as an artist as well. I dare say that some of his records (Before and After Science, Here Come the Warm Jets, etc.) are just as good, if not better, than some of the records for other bands that he has produced. But that is not the case on Wrong Way Up. In fact if I were to make a list of the worst records I have ever owned this may even make it to the number one spot. I could go on and on describing why I don't like it (boring songs, no melody, unenthusiastic vocals, etc.) but then I would have to write a novel and waste more time than this atrocious record possibly could. Do not be deceived that because this is a collaboration between two talented people that the product is good. It is not!

The daggers shown going between them on the cover tends to bear this out.As does the music, which is an uncomfortable mix of Enoisms and Caleisms, with very little middle ground. The tension is palpable, and beyond the curiosity value of their feud, very little of musical interest survives the tension.

The songs are synth-pop perfected. While Cale often hovers around this territory, it's been many years and releases since Eno has sounded this structured and melodic. That said, this isn't exactly a Beach Boys album. Both of these artists are talented musicians, and the diversity of sounds and magnificent arrangements really push the songs over the top.

For me, Manowar will always be about battle, conflict and victory. And this albums first song, Blood of my Enemies shows what Manowar is really capable of (even though it still pales in comparison to songs from Kings of Metal and on). The rest of the album comes across as much of an extension of Into Glory Ride. Rushed, chaotic songs that sound horrible. There is no power, no majesty to these songs, and while it is most likely worth listening to just to hear Eric Adams vocals, if you're not a die hard Manowar fan like me who has to have every single recording, don't bother with this...

I would never play this CD during a massage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detaching the World Vol 1","review":"I purchased this CD based on the reviews alone,In comparison to other meditation Cd's I own; this CD ranks far below.The music is in my opinion anything but relaxing.Not suitable for meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warren Duff","review":"I love this cd, and play it regularly, both when doing exercise and for relaxing. What I like especially is its refraining from any abrupt, or extreme, changes in mood. If I have refrained from giving it the full five stars it is simply because I would have preferred the disc to have limited itself to one long cut, in this case the first, rather than several. For my taste variety wasn't necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off-putting Sythesized Sound","review":"I was dissapointed in this CD after reading so many wonderful reviews of it. I found the heavy reliance on an almost avant garde synthesized sound to very unrelaxing and actually tension producing. Most CDs now allow you to preview the tracks, this one did not, and of course CDs are nonreturnable so I am stuck with something I can not listen to. Learn from my lesson and never buy a CD if you can't preview the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Atmosphere","review":"When I use this music for a massage session, I am able to be exactly in the moment. My thoughts go away, my healing intentions grow deeper and I am totally present. I feel things change in my hands - muscles melt, layers of tension disappear and I am connected to my client with so much love. Time escapes and nothing else matters because the atmosphere is so full of peace. After the session, even after the music has stopped, I can still hear it playing. I feel like it purifies me. This CD is true art made with a lot of love. I highly recomend this CD to all that want to find peace of mind. I've used it for not only massage sessions but even to exercise to and as background music as I paint. It's a must have CD for all!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conclusion misses the point","review":"The message young children need to have reinforced is that it's okay to be angry but not okay to act-out that anger. This message gets lost at the end of the book.Rather than reinforce this message in the books conclusion, the author ends with \\"it's okay to be angry sometimes , but it feels good to stop being angry,too.\\" I think the final message should read something like this: \\"But it's never Okay to shout or hit someone because you feel angry\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"generic record, generic review","review":"This cd is so bad, I will make my effort to this review equally so.

Can't this dude make up his own stuff or does he like making a career of ripping off others people's work. On this album he strikes again ripping off Warren Zevon note for note. Someone should remind this dude that his 10 minutes of fame ran out like last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comes up short","review":"In the pantheon of Southern rock, including bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, Bad Co., and many others, Kid Rock does not compare. His song, \`\`Sweet Home Alabama's'' most identifiable hook is a sample of Warren Zevon's intro to \`\`Werevolves of London.'' Kid Rock's song is intended as a paean to Skynyrd's song of the same name. But it is repetitive and trite. Skynyrd's song took a controversial stand, defending George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama in the 60's, from Neil Young criticism in his song \`\`Southern Man.'' In comparison, Kid Rock's song is essentially bubble gum music for wanna be rednecks (like him). Zevon also has a song, \`\`Play it All Night Long,'' which is tangentially about Skynyrd's, \`\`Sweet Home,'' and far better than Mr. Rock's. Young, Skynyrd and Zevon may have had political differences, but their music at least rocked. In comparison, Kid Rock sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Kidding, right?","review":"I admit I had unjustified high expectations. Too much live video, too many Citizen Soldier showings.

I hope he will do another rap album, but he better not stop making albums like this either. I love every song.

He (and his band) used to have a hard rock edge. Now he has a Grammy nomination for a Pop performance. Kid Rock completely changed genres after the death of nu-metal. Fans of nu-metal would often fuel sales of many hard rock bands such as Fuel, Kid Rock, Salica, and so on. The death of nu-metal impacted hard rock and many artists didn't make it. I guess Kid Rock (and Saliva) decided to go Pop. This album sounds more like his modern releases and I really don't think that Kid Rock fans (from back in the late 1990's) are going to like this album. Modern radio rock/pop fans will love this album as it fits right in with EVERYTHING that is getting released these days.I wouldn't spend the $3.99 on this album as I am a Kid Rock fan of old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid Pop","review":"What a wet lettuce this turned out to be. After the glorious power of the metal rap and hip hop on his earlier CDs, this is a collection of country and western, and soft pop rock that wouldn't look out of place on a Foreigner album. Hugely disappointing. Get back in the groove Kid Rock. I'll cetainly take a listen before I commit my cash again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good...","review":"I am a big Kid Rock fan; however, I was very disappointed with this album. It is obvious that he is trying to pay respects to his heroes while solidifying his own spot in the rock and roll world. However, it just ends up sounding like he is copying those who came before him. There are a couple of decent songs, and some with decent lyrics, but nothing that stands out or has the punch of any of his hit singles. Skip this one and go back to his earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid Rock-\\"Searching For A Career\\" Tonight On VH1 @ 8 PM.","review":"Contrived rock for the masses and dreck at that.

It has a bit of every style he's ever recorded. I really liked his self titled album from 2003 because it showed a softer side of Kid Rock. This one has great sounds and he sings his butt off.

Kid Rocks adolescent boasting and posturing gets tiresome. The songs that are non ripoffs are the weaker ones on the album, showing the amount of creativity, originality, and talent put into this album- not much.The only thing I will give Kid Crock credit for is he tends to put on a good live show, but that cant cover for mediocre(at best), uninspired music. It's a sad reflection on our culture when throwaway albums like this are lauded as being excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Kid, all the time","review":"I am a fan and love all styles of Kid Rock music, but this is the strongest showcase of Kid Rock's musical talent, bringing his voice to the forefront with much more rock and quite a bit of the southern rock gender.

It starts with a car rolling down the street and guys fighting out of nowhere. Then his car rolls up in slow motion and he gets out in slow mo with smoke coming out his mouth, lol. Then the camera zooms in on him flicking his cigar, lmao. And when the first strum of the guitar comes fireworks and lights come on behind him, funny stuff.

It takes quite a bit of force to insert and remove hard drives from the drive cage. A wire for the LED light attaches to a header on the circuit board. As a result when you open up the enclosure to take the drive out, it's easy to accidentally yank the wire for the LED out of place and bend some pins.

However, as instructional material without any sheet music or tab, it falls well short expectations. The \\"instruction\\" apparently consists of video of Randy's left hand as he plays each piece slowly - this is really good, but without any sheet music to go along with the DVD, the student is required to follow along trying to mimic what Randy's doing. This could have been a great instructional tool had sheet music been included.All of this, of course, just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor craftsmanship","review":"I was very disappointed in this product.

The only annoying thing is she usually doesn't grab it until I have turned the lights down to get her to calm down for bed and then she holds it up towards the light and cries until I get up, turn the light back on and hold it to the light to make it glow. I never knew the ears and toes glowed though until I read the description, maybe I just didn't pay attention. But I always focused the light on the nose and tummy so I will have to try the ears and feet next time. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby signing","review":"My 2 1/2 year old loves to watch this and I find my 5 month old watching a little also.

She LOVES it! She's picked up more signs in the short time we've had this video, than with just her and I signing over the last several months. She loves to see the other babies/toddlers signing and the songs are great. It's also very short (about 20 minutes), so it's just the perfect length for little ones (not too much TV time!).

I was hoping it would be instuctional for me, in terms of introducing and effective implementation of signs. It's just a sing along. So if you are looking for a simple children's show demonstrating about 20 words, your typical repetitions and simple songs, it's o.k. However, if I were to do this over I would just look up the signs from an online website and demonstrated them to my child myself, saving the extra bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left wanting more...","review":"The DVD itself is good, but you only learn about 20 or so signs, which is not enough to justify the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babies Should not Wach Videos According to the American Pediatric Association","review":"Babies Should not Wach Videos According to the American Pediatric Association.

I have been a Sign Language Interpreter for over 10 years and am utterly impressed with how engaging it is. My daughter is 19 months old and is currently a signer not a talker. She is less frustrated because she can now communicate her needs to us. She even puts the signs she learned from this video into whole sentences and can answer my questions! Very exciting!!!

My daughter is mesmerized and signs along with them pretty often. The songs are sort of annoying to my ears, and sometimes get stuck in my head; however, my husband and I have both learned a few signs from watching these Signing Time videos with our munchkin.

I love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Learn Signing","review":"My 18 month old Grandson attended signing classes when he was 8-10 months old and had a few signs in his vocabulary. I rented Baby Signing Time and we had a great time picking up more signs for words he already knew like cat, milk, water, etc., and putting signs to these familiar words made it more interesting for him. The process of presenting the new word signs by the adult female first is clear and easy to understand then presenting the same information by children is captivating for him. The categories for food, pets, nature, feelings, etc., makes this a very comprehensive signing program. I will purchase this DVD eventually to add to our library of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parent Participation","review":"This is my first signing time video, and my daughter is 10 months old. Much to my surprise, as my daughter's first DVD, my daughter *does not* watch the TV when this video is on because she doesn't understand TV yet (probably a good thing), so this experience has really been about me learning the songs and the signs, and then singing the songs with her and doing the signs with her -- which is probably the most effective approach anyway. Only down side: I don't think the cartoons add anything to this video. The kids doing signs is very valuable -- it helps to see that not all kids get every sign as clear as a parent will, but that it doesn't matter!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is a little too bouncy and catchy my head cannot rest","review":"The songs are just average but the music is way too catchy that it is in our head all day. My hubby basically doesn't like to play this DVD said he doesn't like the songs. The \\"Mom has a Mom\\" songs is so bouncy that i can jump and sing all day that my head cannot rest. But my baby likes the DVD so much she starts smiling even screaming with joy when she sees the frog comes out :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 17 mo old loves this!","review":"I bought this after my doctor recommended it. I had purchased a book to teach some signs to my daughter, but this was so much better. Took her a few times to get interested in it, but once she did she now insists on watching it multiple times a day. She picked up the signs very quickly (as did I). I would recommend this to all parents who want to improve communication with their baby.

He has been watching these videos for about 2 months now and loves them. He hasn't started signing back yet, but he does recognize some signs when we use them. He is always entranced by the kids and sometimes it does look like he is trying to imitate them. I highly recommend these dvd's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful.","review":"This was a good intro to signing and the signs that were chosen were very helpful. This made for a good signing foundation. We also liked the 2nd volume. I have to say it taught me more than my son, but allowed me, in turn, to teach him. It only works well if you use the signs in everyday speech."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grandson and I love this DVD!","review":"Great DVD! My grandson (6mos old) and I love this DVD. I also bought I can sign by Baby First TV but we like this one better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start for learning sign language.","review":"My kids & I love this video! We've tried two other signing videos that were okay, but this one is much better. It is fun to watch even for adults. The music is great and they show you practical uses for the signs. We learned a lot more from this video than from the other two we have. I can't vouch for how it is with babies because my youngest is 5 and has autism. We bought this for him because he isn't talking. He loves to watch this video and he is learning the signs also. He would watch it constantly if we let him. Baby Signing Time is a mixture of live action and cartoons. There is a lady named Rachel who shows all the signs then they have little kids signing them after her. There are a couple of animated characters to keep it fun. A great video to learn sign language with your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spastic. More hyperactive entertainment than education","review":"I bought this after borrowing the original (before it was remade) Signing Time from the library. (Rachel in her red sweater with long hair.) I loved the original Signing Time. It was educational, calm and still entertaining. I got Baby Signing Time thinking it would be similar, but with signs more specific for a baby. But, Baby Signing Time is distracting and spastic. The signs are buried under so much extraneous movement, color, scene-shifts, music, etc, that the video's educational value is questionable.This is the hyperactive, short-attention-span-encouraging, cutesy stuff that I did not want to expose my child to.I much preferred the low-budget, real people, original Signing Time. Unfortunately, I don't know if it's even possible to get that anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES this dvd","review":"We have not seen the regular signing time dvd's so I can't say whether this one is better or worse than those. All I know is my 16 month old son loves this dvd. He enjoys the little cartoons, the songs and watching all the other babies do the signs. I don't allow him to watch much tv and none of the shows he has watched before held his interest for long anyway. With this DVD he will watch it from start to finish. I think he would watch it a few times through if I let him! He begs to watch this every day and gets sooo excited if I offer to put it on.I would really reccomend this to anyone who wants to try signing with their baby. We had already been signing some words (please, more and milk) when we bought the dvd and he has learned four new signs (food, banana, fish, hurt) since we've been watching.We have the second baby signing time as well but this one is his favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"I haven't seen the original version of this DVD - I hope it's as good as other reviewers have said.

I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great examples for babies","review":"My son (3 months old) loves this dvd. i put it on for him if i have to get something done around the house because he gets sucked right in as soon as the music starts to play. i watched it the first couple of times with him so i would know what the signs were that he was learning and i was very impressed with how interactive they made it. the teacher sings the whole time as she teaches and then they show several examples of babies and toddlers doing each sign so your child can really get the hang of what its supposed to look like. my son can already do the signs for milk and drink :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"best baby entertainer we own","review":"I am the mother of six-month old twins and we have watched baby signing time every other night since they were three months old. When this show is on, nothing can distract them, which isn't true of any other media we've exposed them to. They don't do the signs yet but I've been using them along with the appropriate songs (\\"Eat, eat, it's time to eat... and \\"diaper dance\\") and when I do this their eyes light up. Hopefully with understanding. We'll find out soon. But if nothing else, the fact that they LOVE this DVD makes it worth it the time to me. They don't like any of the Baby Einstein series and mildly care for Teletubbies. This they love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon, This is Just Silly","review":"Who does online rentals to learn sign language? You need to sell the video on Instant Video!

A great way to spend quaility time with your little one and for you both to learn something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy and Entertaining!","review":"We received this DVD as a Christmas gift for our 4 month old daughter. She's been watching it over a month now several times a week and seems to really enjoy it! The songs are easy to learn and the signs are demonstrated Rachel, other babies, and parents.

Thanks Baby Signing Time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Baby Video!","review":"We rented at least two dozen videos for our 9 month old daughter- we wanted something educational and short. I don't think tv is good for a baby this little but occasionally you need 30 minutes to get ready for dinner and a video works really well sometimes. This series is the only one she will actually sit and watch. She makes the \\"signing\\" sign anytime the tv goes on and claps and giggles when the video turns on. She now signs milk, more, signing, and eat pretty consistently. I think the songs are catchy, she loves seeing the other babies and the animals. She even learned saying \\"cat\\" from the video.She likes the original signing time as well but not NEARLY as much as this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful DVD for all!","review":"My grandson has Autism. I bought this to help me learn to sign with him. I know American Sign Language but it is too formal to use with a child. This has been so helpful he now asks \\"Baby Sign Time\\" and does all the signs. I have through the years used this with infants, toddlers and other diabled children. All the children love this. The singing with the signing and the simplicity makes this the best tool I have found! I will continue to use this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great title with few flaws","review":"My baby is only four months as of this writing so really isn't old enough to fully appreciate the video, but he does sit still and remain engaged for a baby-sized section. I like that the signs are repeated often and think that the music adds to the experience (even though the songs are annoying). My main gripe is that the myriad of different children demonstrating the sign are often doing it incorrectly, and are all doing it incorrectly in different ways. So there is no consistency when a sign is being demonstrated, except by the instructor. I feel this could be confusing for a child learning to do a sign properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The Mud is very light, and easy to work with.

But this episode was actually fun,with plenty of colorful characters (the Red Baron, Anthony Fokker, Hermann Goehring)and good-looking men in pretty uniforms pulling off bad accents. As usual, Indy is completely upstaged by the famous real-life characters he comes across, which is one of the series' major faults. Cheesey,but fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is the only Young Indiana Jones film I've seen but it certainly does the series justice. A good adventure and strong characters.

Both halves are adventurous, funny and reckless in true Indiana Jones fashion. Sean Patrick Flanery continues to be great in the title role, and the portrayals of Manfred von Richthofen, Anthony Fokker and Charles Nungusser are colorful and well done.I particularily enjoyed the second half with Indy's first go at espionage. Indy isn't the most deft of spies...he's actually rather bad at it. But of course he's got that remarkable luck on his side, so he always manages to come out on top, more or less. In this one you're always looking forward to what he's going to come up with next, which is classic Indy.The ending also comes with a proper bang, and is not inconclusive like some others in the series are wont to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"On The Upswing","review":"This early EP compilation captures Ride on their upswing.

(Guy has an orange shirt.) I found and bought it. I cannot say that I like all the songs. There are three in a row that I do not care much for; However, overall, I do like this DVD.The Singin' With the Saints song is fun, and there is another song that touched me so much that it made me cry. Now, I am not a Western fan and never bought a Roy Acuff record in my life, but I know who he was. and heard him sing when I was growning up. Gloria tells a little story about him, which is followed by Jake Hess with a related song, and it is a beautiful thing to watch. The song is titled: \\"I Know Where I Am.\\" It could not be lovlier.So, in spite of the skipping I may do in the future, I will be listening to this DVD many times more. I definitely recommend it.

Praise is given where praise is due and Vincent calls King on a few instances where it is due. In the end, the book is an invaluable encapsulation of the entire epic and leaves the reader to evaluate the value of King's sprawling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...reads like Cliffnotes","review":"If you're looking for something extra in the Dark Tower world, you won't find it here.

It's also tedious reading with all the footnotes. Yuck. The Concordance book is MUCH better. Also, the writing here is kind of awkward in places.

Only when I read on the internet that others were having this problem, did we realize that it was the machine. This is not funny. It is so specifically a cat sound, I believe these drives have been sabotaged with a virus, or something like that, by someone thinking it funny. It's not.

Once you sing these songs you just can't stop. They are fun, interesting, and informative. Having these qualities in a sing-along of thirteen original songs is pretty special.

It's not even as good a story as you'd expect from Niven and Pournelle (who the hell's Michael Flynn?). What this book is is a wonderful, loving sendup of all that is godawful about fans, written by two (or possibly three) authors who clearly love fandom, and can parody gently these irriating, irritating people. Sure all the in-jokes are fun, but the most fun is pointing at each character and going, \\"Omigod, I know someone *just like that*.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Underground Trekkies","review":"I love the premise of the book- what happens when environmentalists get crazy and start an ice age, but the authors, all three great, could have done so much better. The idea that a bunch of underground science fiction fans being hunted by the government are helping the \\"space people\\" in the midst of Luddite oppression is just assinine. If you are not a hard-core science fiction buff, with enough knowledge of the genre to be able to sweep the category on the game show Jeopardy, don't bother reading this book. Like their real-world counterparts, most of the characters in this book are a bunch of weenies, and the obscure references to sci-fi of the past are tedious and sleep-inducing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I saw this book was Pournelle/Nevin collaboration I immediately bought it. I was most disappointed with it. The plot was incredibly predictable, the story line was incredibly unrealistic.Very disappointing from these 2 excellent writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you are hard core SF fan","review":"I grew up reading SF, it was all I did. I was one of those \\"nerdy\\" kids and didn't really fit in with the \\"in\\" crowd. I can identify with the premise that someone who is a computer nerd/D&D type could rescue some astronauts and save the day. Having said that, I think the only way you could identify with this book is if you fall into that category. Further more, the anti-Green rants are completely out of control. If this is some kind of humor, I don't get it. I should be the target audience for this book, and I thought it was the worst SF novel I'd read in several years. Perhaps if you go to all the SF Cons and live SF/fantasy, then maybe this would appeal to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"How are the mighty fallen","review":"I've heard people say that this book is good and funny if you're a SF fan. Well, all I can say is that I've been an SF fan for over 40 years and I was nauseated by this book. The chances are slim that anyone who's not a fan would ever hear of this piece of garbage, but on the off chance that they did, I would hope they might consider that being an SF fan used to be a badge of honor. Nowadays it apparently just means you're a Rush Limbaugh dittohead with a light saber. Honestly, we're not all as braindead as this book would have you believe. This is probably the most insulting, ignorant, and wrongheaded novel I've ever read.Help save the Earth and burn this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are the authors insane?","review":"It's interesting to try to guess what bug got under these guys to make them write such a ridiculously biased diatribe against the environmental movement. I can't believe any responsible publisher would allow a book to be printed that encourages people to burn more fossil fuel in order to save the world! Was this all supposed to be some kind of joke? If so, it's way over my head!There was one funny part. I laughed out loud when the \\"good guys\\" win because all those nasty Greenpeace people are afraid of computers. What a laugh.This was was nothing but a waste of trees. I suggest burning it and help the authors save the world.Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the premise would lead you to believe...","review":"Ok, the thought of outlaw astronauts being hidden from the government by sci-fi fans just sounds silly. Let's just get that out in the open right now. Despite this, the book works. I rated it as a five, but I'm part of the target audience for the book. It plays heavily on the \\"Fen vs. Mundanes\\" feelings that is common amongst those of us who've been picked on for being sci-fi fans. It tends to run a little heavy on tyhe fannish slang, but is still readable despite that. Like the astronauts on the run, the reader will pick up on the meanings as they go along. All in all, a good read, especially if you're a hardcore sci-fi fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!","review":"I bought this book on the basis of the author's name. I've been reading Larry Niven for 20 years and have come to expect quality hard science fiction with interesting plot lines. This book was a real disappointment. Against my better judgement, I kept reading hoping for the story to develop. It never happened. The plot in this book is a series of barely connected vignettes written solely to stroke the egos of some superweirdos that attend science fiction conventions. The atrocious writing made me doubt that the book was even written by Larry Niven. Money spent on this book might as well have been dropped into a black hole"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy. It is free online.","review":"I disliked this so much that I stopped buying anything from Larry Niven for a long time. After I bought it, I found out it was available for free online.

I wouldn't even call this hard science fiction anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous self-indulgent sci-fi fan fantasy","review":"I was excited by the first pages of this book - sounded like an interesting premise (abrupt climate change causing an ice age, small orbiting communities trying to survive despite hostile earth nations). But within thirty pages the book went from interesting future history to adolescent fantasy. Science fiction fans as an oppressed minority? Give me a break. Niven et al have taken a good idea and ruined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not by Niven and Pournelle","review":"Badly written and unbelievable, this is the worst book to have these two guys' names on it since Footfall. This time Science Fiction FANS save the world. Clearly this was submitted for publication by a fan who attends conventions and Niven and Pournelle decided to capitalize on the fawning adulation of convention kids by helping to get it published. That'd be okay if it was a good story or good writing or a good idea but it's not any of those things. If you like books that suggest that it's important to go to SF conventions and that such people are special because they do, then this book is for you. If you want good fiction in your Science Fiction...stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"This is the first book in a long time that I haven't been able to tolerantly finish. The beginning had promise and then it turned into something akin to masturbatory fan fiction. Maybe this is an homage to the fans who go to the cons, but it wasn't worth my time at the end of the day. This should have been a mimeographed stack of sheets held together with brads and distributed at a con's merch room as a useful kindling alternative. It shouldn't have been published by a reputable publishing house. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly reccomended","review":"Not being a member of \\"fandom\\", I can truly say that this book was a joy to read. Granted, I didn't get all the in-ref's, however I loved the book.

The story's designed to please faithful sf followers, and is all the more enjoyable for those who know anything about SF fandom. The trio told an audience at the 1991 World Science Fiction Convention that the characters in this novel were composites of 130 fans they knew. Niven and Pournelle caricatured their friends at the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society (including myself -- \\"Mike Glider\\") and Flynn based his contributions on fans he knew on the East Coast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining novel written for the fans.","review":"This novel is written as if Niven and company took suggestions from fans on what they would do in a \\"what if\\" situation. The authors then filled in the center with a tasty center.Light novel that is great for the fan who has been to just one or two sci fi conventions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fandom against modern day luddites","review":"Modern day luddites obsessed with political correctness and,say it quietly, power have led to the world falling fast intobarbarism and ironically environmental disaster. The books plot is a chance to revel in SF fandom, even if like me you're a newcomer and deliver more than a few blows to the self righteous \\"green\\" movement. For me though the most intriguing part though is the Phoenix, could it exist if so could Gary or Ann Hudson mail me so we can build it NOW.

Absolutely leaves you wanting more; which is why there's a II and a III. Doesn't paint a bad picture of DOING drugs necessarily like other drug movies, but paints a picture of the stressors that can be involved with DEALING.

'Getting Away With It' can be described as tasteful when one compares it to the bulk of early '90s dance-pop (do \\"Smash\\" or \\"C&C Music Factory\\" ring any bells?). 'Get the Message' has the advantage of having a great video, and despite the fact that the lyrics have the crappiness factor of many New Order songs, the music is first-rate. The rest of the album has its bright points ('Idiot Country', etc.), but they don't match up to the power of the two singles. Still, given the time period, this could be remembered as one of the sharpest pop releases of the early '90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of New Order Side Projects","review":"The early '90's found New Order at a crossroads. They hadn't had a release since 1989's \\"Technique,\\" and the various members were off doing side projects. Bass player Peter Hook formed Revenge, and had one rather forgettable release. The husband and wife team of Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris formed The Other Two and had one rather fluffy release. Bernard Sumner joined with Neil Tenant and Johnny Marr and formed the Blind Faith of their day and released this gem. So many good songs, playing on the strengths that the three brought--my fave was \\"Some Distant Memory,\\" the second-to-last track. \\"Idiot Country,\\" \\"Tighten Up\\" and \\"Getting Away With It\\" were also outstanding. New Order's 1993 release \\"Republic\\" proved that Sumner would have been better off seeing how far Electronic could go instead of regrouping New Order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combination of many talents all in one........","review":"This is Electronics first album.

New Order's Bernard Sumner,the Smith's Johnny Marr, Pet Shop Boys's Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe formed togather and made a MASTERPIECE OF ART. This albums is nothing less than perfect. Every song is a smash. \\"Idiot Country\\" and \\"Tighten Up\\" shows Johnny Marr's talent in full affect. \\"Reality\\" really touched me the very first time I heard it and has Bernald's voice at its peak. \\"The Patience of the Saint\\" and \\"Getting Away With It\\" shows the magnificent coordination of the voice of Neil and Bernald as they perform togather. This album shows the progress of synth-pop and new-wave sound to a new level. There is a mixture of songs that have more electronica and others with more acoustics and guitars.There is a varity for us all in this great album.Also check out other albums by Electronic..\\"Raise the Pressure\\" and \\"Twisted Tenderness\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best debut albums of the 90s","review":"I heard \\"Getting Away With It\\" when it first came out late in 1989. I was spellbound. I thought it was one of the best singles of the decade, and add that to the fact that the two key members were from two of my favorite bands (New Order and Smiths) was a big bonus, seeing them do well outside their groups. However, I didn't pick up the album until just recently. I had heard \\"Get The Message\\" and liked it but had a fear that the rest of the album wouldn't match up to \\"Getting Away With It\\". I was wrong. The whole album is excellent, with the weak tracks being \\"Patience of a Saint\\" and maybe \\"Try All You Want\\", and even they're pretty good. I love \\"Gangster\\", \\"Feel Every Beat\\" and especially \\"Some Distant Memory\\" with that poignant outro with the oboe and synths. Outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisite album","review":"I owned the cassette for this album some years ago and saw the group when they opened for Depeche Mode in 1990 but I only recently bought the cd. The album is just as great a listen now as it was then. So tight, clean and sharp is the combination of Sumner and Marr, of guitar and keyboard, that one can't help but thoroughly enjoy this album. Neil Tennant's addition on \\"Patience\\" and \\"Getting Away\\" fits right in and is also quite enjoyable. While \\"Getting Away With It\\" was the hit and first recognizable song, I can easily say that I enjoy \\"Reality\\", \\"Tighten Up\\" and \\"Get The Message\\" just as much if not more so. That said, songs like \\"Gangster\\", \\"Some Distant Memory\\", \\"Try All You Want\\", \\"Feel Every Beat\\" and even \\"Soviet\\" are no slouches. Start to finish, this is a great buy and worthy of every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of its kind","review":"For those of us disillusioned with the current crop of \\"pop\\" Electronic is a classicly synth pop band that hits all the right notes.

Chicago's 21st album was the worst album to me, easily the worst I've heard from them. The album sounds so boring, and the performances sound so uninspiring. Even the Diane Warren-written song sounds lousy, typical of her sappy ballad pap! There's not one memorable song on here, compared to classics like If You Leave Me Now, Love Me Tomorrow or others. Don't hear a lot of their famous horns, only keyboards and pop songs. And Ron Nevison produced this overproduced, overwrought fluff?

Over the last 15 years, our family has owned an Irish Setter, Lab, and Standard Poodle. We bought several books to start researching other breeds prior to beginning a search for a new dog. In the preface of this book, it says that the authors of the book have surveyed breeders and owners of the breeds and they trust that the contributors have been candid and realistic. Well they weren't. Do you think the breeders and owners might have been a little partial to their respective breeds???

I have looked at many breed books and this is my absolute favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than reviews suggest; background knowlege useful","review":"While the writing is from time to time over the top, the book is very enjoyable. What I appreciate most about the book is its treatment of the actual philosophy behind the development of the algorithm. This apparently is what many previous reviewers dislike. They might be used to books like Men of Mathematics or The Lady Tasting Tea - books that merely provide a brief description of the development of the topic accompanied by some life facts of the developers. Hence, this book is more of a philosophy book than a history book. And for those of us who would rather read a philosophy book than a history book, this book is a breath of fresh air. Reading of the book is helped, however, by a background in both logic and mathematics.

I'm not sure what the point of this is. The two great ideas (calculus and algorithm) don't entirely work for me, but still, it's a nice piece of history with a zany cast of logicians. As for the Berlinkski character, with his digressions and hyper-prose, these literary devices are not pointless, but a disussion of them would be a different review.Also, I think that the section on Church and his lambda calculus was a distraction, a homage to his thesis asviser, even though Church was admittedly a great logician.Finally, I would have liked to have seen a little more on the need for mathematical certainly and the larger \\"modernist\\" context."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointed Reader","review":"Save your money!

Berlinski seems much more concerned about drawing attention to himself as \\"the brilliant writer\\" than about explaining his subject matter with clarity.After all, where did the algorithm come from? A major source may have been cook-books, getting a major boost from Charles Babbage, the symbolic logic of Frege, and finally Turing and the actual realization of the computer.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Affected prose and poor explaination","review":"David Berlinkski has done for algorithms what he had previously done for the caluculus; that is, he has taken a bare minimum of technical explaination and buried it in thick, affected, barely readable prose. And as with his calculus book, he is wading into waters where far more skilled writers have gone before.Like the calculus book, this will appeal to readers who don't really want to be troubled by detail, and who like the idea of reading about science without actually having to deal with the difficult notions. It may also appeal to those who don't mind the confusing narrative and who will appreciate the scattershot style and pointless asides.I have to admit I couldn't finish this book.

Unfortunately, the work-like the Tour of the Calculus before it-is marred by the author's stylistic excesses. Berlinski is a notorious over writer. He never met an adjective he didn't like. His historic fantasies simply don't advance the story. To wit: \\"The duke of Brunswick, his issue destined for the British throne but his attention fatally diverted by his screaming bladder, waggles his pink palms, rises rapidly from his sea, and without a word scuttles down the long library corridor of the massive wooden double doors, where, after pulling at the red tasseled bell rope, he waits in an agony of impatience for a footman to appear.\\"There are similar passages on most every page. Don't editors edit any more? Harold Ross would have cut this book to shreds. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent ideas, buried under bad prose","review":"Berlinski gathered the right set of ideas for this subject, and he explains them in thorough detail. In particular, I found the level of detail for Godel's, Church's, and Turing's work to be very informative, e.g. this was the first time I saw Godel's encoding scheme explained well enough for me to see just how it works.However, the prose in this book was so bad that I just couldn't finish it. While it was good that he stayed away from a dry textbook style, the style he ended up with was better suited for a romance novel than a technical history. In addition to the prose style itself, the book is littered with fictional asides that are meant to illustrate subtle points but end up being a distraction. It seems that the author was trying to create both a good technical history and a work of art, but in the end he failed at both."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book didnt even make a good doorstop.","review":"When reading this piece of literary filth, keep in mind that \\"The 300 Year Journey\\" will feel like 300 years.

KNBR's antenna is scarcely 15 miles from AT&T Park, and their local broadcast radius is about 100 miles, so it's fair to say that the Jensen radio failed to perform its most basic function. Luckily I had my backup radio, an 1980s vintage Sony Walkman. It's bulky, but it picked up KNBR very clearly, no matter where I held the radio.

However, the movie spends almost no time explaining what they are, how they work and why they are using them instead of something more futuristic.If you like Sci-fi horror action movies, then you may have come to the right place.

He says honey is a terrible substance, but if anyone would know it would be David Wolfe, the world's formost authority on raw and he thinks it's fine. Also S.

I followed the regimen for slowly starting to introduce foods again, and quickly gained twice the amount of weight that I had lost, which I've been struggling to lose ever since. 3 years later, I'm still having far more trouble regulating my weight than before the cleanse. I suspect that my body went into starvation mode and never quite recovered. In addition, my teeth became extremely sensitive, which is most likely a result of all the acid and sugar from the lemon juice and organic grade B maple syrup.

I only write about weight loss because I know that people do it for this reason sometimes. Of course you will lose weight, you are only drinking a fluid. I also had major cravings throughout and really had to work hard to control my urge to eat unhealthy after coming off this.

But the explanations and claims this book makes are ridiculous. The author claims that there are no such thing as disease-causing bacteria and viruses.

All that sugar(maple syrup) acid (lemons) and cayenne (red pepper) can't be good inflamatory healing regimen. I'm thinking that true healing practitioners would treat patients with techniques and methods that are more holistic and pain free while going through the healing process.If you're really thinking of cleansing and/or detoxing your system, try adding bran, vegetables and a little fruit to your daily diet, especially bran.

Why not do a real fast and give your pancreas a rest too? I don't think this lemon/maple syrup fast is a healthy thing to do, although I do believe a true water fast is good for you.

Buy it - you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the two scariest movies I've ever seen","review":"This movie was terrifying. The only other movie I've ever seen that really scared me was \\"Sixth Sense\\". The sounds of the pony coming over the moors and getting stuck, the interior scenes of the bedroom, all so real and terrifying. Don't watch this movie when you are home alone!!Absolutely the best horror movie I've ever watched."},{"rating":"2","title":"hear ye hear ye","review":"Just to let you know--I just ordered this for $12 on Amazon and there are some other sites on the web where it is selling for $12.99.

I first saw this several years ago on television and was immediately impressed with it. There are still parts of it that I haven't seen because I knew that I would never be able to get to sleep that night, and in spite of my efforts, pillow over my head, changing channels (thank God for the remote), I still couldn't. The hatred in her face, the Woman in Black's, will, send chills through you. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Woman Is Dull","review":"Read so many great reviews of this film -- it's SO scary, they said. Finally tracked down a copy of the DVD. Now, I absolutely love horror films, everything from the old giallos by the likes of Mario Bava and Dario Argento, to the Friday the 13th and similar francises, and on to The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Evil Dead and all the other GREAT horror films of our time. But The Woman in Black is not among them. It is slow, tedious, and incredibly dull. I warn any of you that are thinking of spending good money on a copy of this to wait until it shows up on television or in your video store or something. You'll be glad you did when you come to the end of this flick and find yourself yawning instead of screaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"After hearing so much about it and reading the glowing reviews of it here, I finally broke down and purchased this disc. I was all set to be scared, or creeped out, or something.....anything! I was severely disappointed on all counts. I had heard that it starts off slow (which it does, trust me), but that it works up to a tense climax. I watched and watched and watched, waiting for something to happen. My eyes kept looking back and forth at the running time on the DVD player, thinking \\"something has got to happen in the last 45 minutes...ok, in the last 30 minutes...well maybe the last 10\\", but it never does. There are plenty of moments when it could've been really creepy, but naturally this being a made for TV film, it cops out. The \\"woman\\" is in it for a total of about 5 minutes. After watching it I had the same disgusted feeling I had after watching the Blair Witch Project. I knew I should've bought The Changeling instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry,,, but it's the worst horror movie i have seen","review":"i saw the movie... and it is not scared at all... if you wanna talk about scared movie for ghost you can watch \\"Evil Dead\\" for example.

This movie was exactly what was promised by other reviewers...It scared the daylights out of me! The story is wonderful, the atmosphere brilliant, the score...chilling. I enjoyed the pace of the film, and found myself astounded that I was terrified by the end. I don't get scared often, but this one floored me! Ranks up there with The Haunting (1963). If you enjoy Ghost Stories...this one will knock your socks off!

There are a few corny moments but over all it is a very well done - medium budget - british horror film. But use the term 'horror' lightly... there's no 'pumkin head' running around stabbing obnoxious teens in this one...its scarier than that. Although the ending was a little strange, its worth the watch, especially late at night...with not too many people around...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scariest movie ever made.","review":"I haven't even seen this movie for a couple years - I was telling a friend about it, and started getting chills and looking over my shoulder. There is no movie scarier that this one. The final scene with the boat has got to be one of the best filmed, morbid, freaky, scary, and every other word ending with y scenes of all time. I watched this movie from underneath a blanket with a pillow over my head. It's best to watch this movie in the summer with the sun out sometime just after breakfast so you have time to get over it before the night comes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope you enjoy this!","review":"Hi it's me - Christopher Cone.

You'd be wrong.This book also left a bad replacement theology taste in my mouth. Mr. Stott is thoroughly British...his overuse of the word \\"Palestine\\" proved that.I recently saw a copy of the Hardback with color photos...I think I'd rather have bought that one.For an alternative, Chuck Missler's \\"Learn the Bible in 24 Hours\\" is a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"great show, easy streaming!","review":"one of the best shows, quality visual and audio, and easy streaming! plus, it's accessible from any comp with your amazon account, i.e. no extra storage needed for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!","review":"I am one of the biggest fan's of Friends in the whole world , i am right now trying to collect them all , i have so far season 3 and 4, they are very very funny, but season 5 i have to say is probably one of the worst.

I watched about 5 episodes and found that the jokes are not funny at all. Only dull and unoriginal lines, which could have been guessed, therefore making them not funny.Ever wonder how come none of these characters ever have their own stand up show? if someone is not funny at all, s/he doesn't want to make a fool of her/himself trying a stand-up.What happened to America sense of humor? The show is not funny. 2-stars for the story, o-star for the humor. 4-stars for DVD menu: average 2-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have seen a lot better ones","review":"I give it a star comparatively to other sitcoms. I have seen other sitcoms which are far better and funnier than the Friends. This should be categorized as soap opera instead of comedy. No punch lines, jokes are flat and pretentious. 'if' laugh track can be turned off separately, the episodes fall short of being a comedy. Laugh tracks put in there are just to induce viewers to laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, they're back!","review":"Season after season, more proof that some people will watch any piece of junk! Season after season, these bozos (oh, sorry, they call it \\"Friends\\") become more and more obnoxious and boring.

Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Last of the truly great friends seasons","review":"The fifth season which aired in 1998 - 1999 is truly the last funniest seasons before the cast got too \\"30- something.\\" It is the last season in which the dynamic within the cast is funny and enthusiastic. It seems the season that follow the 5th season are too underdeveloped and the jokes aim to the lowest common factor. Buy this season, and consider your friends collection complete. Watching the remaining seasons is like watching paint dry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!!!","review":"What can I say? Can't wait until they are released... Another season of friends, another season of laughing... If you don't like laughing and are not open minded, then this is not for you. Oh, and i forgot, a great price for the new season!!! (If you liked seasons 1-4, then you'll love this one...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"This season has, what I feel, is the best episode of Friends, ever. The One In Vegas is fabulous. All of the characters have something going on, and all of their situations come together in hilairious form.

The is definitely the one must-have season."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the best show EVER!","review":"The people @ Warner Bros. know what they're doing.

So much went on... Joey finding out about Chandler and Monica because of the hotel in Atlantic City calling Joey about the eyelash curler left in the hotel room and then Monica asks Rachel for one.One of the funniest moments was:'Atleast I got to see Donald Trump waiting by an elevator''Oh yeah at the Taj Mehal he has his own private elevator, a glass elevator, made by Otis Elevators, and they usually don't do glass''What kinds of things do you KNOW?'anyway, its great to pull out on a rainy weekend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Friends is great","review":"Freinds is the greatest show. The fifth season is one the greatest seasons ever. This is when it starts getting really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have to Admit...","review":"I have to admit that this season is where the show went downhill, BUT thats only because we are comparing it to itself in the past. You also have to admit that Friends is a great show, just not as good as it once was, I don't know about you but Friends continues to make me laugh and is better than most comedies out there right now. Don't skip out on this set if you're a true fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book ...so read it","review":"Edgar Allan is a good book.It's a touching story about a young african american boy trying to have a good family.I liked this book. It made me think twice about how african americns were treated back then. I thought that the book was something that I would have my little brother read when he gets older.This book showed me many things about life in general.

I got this album is the midst of a series of similar purchases, and it quickly rose to the top of the pile. If you're the type who likes to download a sample song before buying, I'd recommend as stand out tracks Sword Chant and Lost in Despair.For those of you who already have the original release, the Battery cover is cool but may or may not be worth a new purchase.

As weird as this act might seem, I felt as though I had hit the proverbial jackpot with a little blind stab in the dark with this one. Heck how many times do you come across great things by pure coincidence? Not a lot! but I can personally say I've been blessed with a few (Venom's 3CD Box Set - only 1000 were made! - and Agathodaimon\`s early works) But with that aside, this album is a memorable piece of work that will never cease to satisfy me. It's cleverly balanced in tempo and atmosphere to the point of making one lust for more.Upon picking up in rhythm it also delivers a robust punch in both, harmonics and vocals. The icing on the cake however is the last track (in my case and being a digipack) is a Metallica cover of Battery. Very impressive!Try checking out their official site, for further info on the band and whatnot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item","review":"This was purchased for my 3 year old daughter (small).

Mine lasted for less than ten uses playing DVD movies before the digital audio completely failed and the VCR audio was bleeding over into the tuner audio. The top of the unit was too hot to leave my hand on it for any length of time.

My favorite parts had to be the material from the Third Age- who wouldn't thrill at reading detailed dialogue of the rivalry between Gandalf & Saruman, or how Bilbo actually got chosen for his adventure, & Thorin's disdain about the whole thing.

For example, \\"of tuor and his coming to gondolin 25\\" is inserted into the middle of a sentence at location 356 of 9703. I've had this same problem with other LOTR Kindle books by this publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kindle version, not the book...","review":"I enjoyed the tales in this book very much, more on a \\"4 3/4 star\\" level, but this \\"e-version\\" of the book through the Kindle application on an iPad suffers from some minor problems. Reading it wasn't difficult, but (like another book I recently purchased by Tolkien for the Kindle applications through iOS and Androird) things like spelling, links to footnotes and the general layout occasionally annoyed me. Since I had never read this book in physical form I decided to give it a try, but I think I'd have rather added hardcover editions of the books to my small library instead of the digital copy. The errors in this edition were slightly annoying, but it is quite possible that an actual Kindle may not have had the same problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"This is one of the most underrated of Tolkien's books. It actually contains lots of interesting tales about Middle-earth, including one or two \\"outtakes\\" from the Lord of the Rings. A must have for Tolkien's fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is good.","review":"I have read the Hobbit and I really loved that book. When I started reading the Unfinished Tales I couldn't stop reading until I ended the book. For the people who have never read the works of Tolkien, this might be a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fulfilling tales.","review":"A rich supplement to the marvellous stories of The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings. Gives the fuller tale of the events in Middle-earth. An essential book in any Tolkien lovers' bookshelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuor and Turin are my favorites","review":"This book has much more additional information on Middle earth.I loved the intertwined stories of Tuor and Turin and the fate/doom upon them and their families. Another book from Tolkien's writings that gives the middle earth lover the goods that they want.Get this book and read it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful to dip into","review":"If you love the Tolkien universe and thirst for more about your favourite characters and the mythology of Middle Earth, you won't regret this purchase. Unfinished to varying degrees, there are stories that must have helped Tolkien flesh out the characters and story in his own mind (glimpses of Gandalf), earlier tales of the world, and interesting notes to help the reader understand the snippets.On the other hand, it is certainly not a novel, and readers seeking *Finished* tales should try The Book of Lost Tales or one of the volumes on the history of Middle Earth edited by Christopher Tolkien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"An elegantly fantastic read! I continue to marvel at Tolkien's myth-making abilities. Like the Silmarillion -- which incidently I enjoyed even more than LOTR -- The Unfinished Tales read like the best of First Testament biblical literature. A true epic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Unfinished tales is a hodge-podge of stuff. There are bits and piecesof lots of things, and it is not all fiction. You get notes, backstory,comments, the odd essay type piece of writing, and other stuff. Youreally want to be a pretty hardcore Tolkien type to want to buy this,rather than borrow to flip through. A lot of people will find it verydull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished Tales of Numenor & Middle Earth","review":"It seems this is only a retitled version of Unfinished Tales.Which naturally recieved 5 Stars.

While each glass was beautiful (although quite larger and not at all dainty as I was anticipating) and adequately bubble wrapped for shipping, they were not packaged in a Waterford crystal box... or even a small plain cardboard gift box. The description lists that the item is \\"Gift boxed with care leaflet.\\" There was no care leaflet, either. Each glass arrived in a separate amazon.com shipping box (approximate dimensions were 4.5\\" x 12\\" x 16.5\\") and surrounded with a ton of bubble wrap!!!! If you are purchasing the glasses for yourself, this might be ok. If you are purchasing them as a gift, you may want to consider purchasing presentable packaging so it doesn't look like you bought the glasses at an auction or estate sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"Ming Ho Siu, the reviewer who gave Maxim Vengerov, a Russian Jewish violinist 3 stars for his interpretation of the Concerto for Violin & Orchestra in D minor, opus 47 by Jean Sibelius was right on point. Vengerov had utterly failed to capture the expanse of Finland's landscape. Leonidas Kavakos' recording, also available on Amazon, is an antidote for your ears to Vengerov's dreadful sounding performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artistic genius walks among us!","review":"I am absolutely stupified by this stunning performance. Beautiful and as emotionally involving as any performance I have ever heard. I really don't know if there is a more meaningful or important recording. Vengerov's is both a technical and musical genius without equal. No one compares!The sound of his instrument and the depth of feeling he draws from it is, likewise, the best I have ever heard. Again, no one compares!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxim Performance","review":"Incredible performance. Great video. Great audio. Except for Vengerov's ugly coat this DVD is perfect. Check out his encore of Ysaye's third violin sonata. It really brought the house down. You can see his musical evolution here compared with his other DVD performance of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto done 7 years earlier. Also interesting to see Placido Domingo filling in as conductor while Daniel Barenboim performs the DaFalla piano concerto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good seller, ho-hum product","review":"The first rainstick I received had spilled its contents all over the inside of the mailing box. When I contacted the seller, they sent another one out right away and told me they didn't need the first one back. The second stick arrived and works fine, but it is a very short rainstorm, which I guess could be remedied by buying a larger stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"long battery life!","review":"Bought this with my new Cannon SX1 IS because I didn't want to be buying double A batteries all the time. After the first charge, I took over 300 pictures and about 10 video over three weeks before needing to change the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product, but pricey","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful product if you don't mind the fairly high price. If you've done any research, you already know that there are similar products available for less. I own the Canon PowerShot S5 IS and it (and other Canon cameras) run on any brand of AA batteries.These batteries do seem to have a very long life in between charges. Occasionally I won't have any other choice but to purchase regular batteries when I'm out and I'm desperate and it always seems like they die much more quickly than when I have the Canon batteries in the camera.Bottom line: I'm very happy with these batteries and you will be too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charger & Batteriers for Canon CBK4-300","review":"Not happy with this product.

I would reccomend to anybody who uses their camera a lot"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Around Good Product","review":"This is an all around good charger / battery set. The batteries charge pretty quickly (all four batteries are done overnight and charging just two batteries decreases the charging time even more). Once the batteries are charged they last in my camera much longer than the store bought batteries I had previously.The only think that I don't really like about the charger is that while charging and when done the unit produces a rather loud buzzing sound. If the device it in a quiet room it needs to be unplugged when charging is finished.All around this is a good product and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good batteries, BUT get very HOT when charging.","review":"These batteries are perfect for my Canon A620, what I don't like, is the fact they get so VERY HOT when they're charging that I can't hold them in my hand, nor install them in my camera until they cool down first.I called Canon and asked them why this happens, and I couldn't get a straight answer from anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh Battery's","review":"I go through a lot of battery's for my camera, and other remote control things I have....The battery life is not very long and I have to continue to recharge a lot....Other battery chargers worked better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Batteries","review":"I have noticed an over all performance upgrade in my Canon A630 since purchasing these batteries. They last a long time and the Camera operates faster all together. The lag time has reduced in between photos trememndously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitively a must, if you own a Canon PowerShot","review":"If you own a Canon PowerShot digital camara this item is a must. Power consumption is quite high in this devices, specially if you like to go on a field trip with it. Charger is quite fast (4 hours for the package). It definitively improves the camera's shooting time frame. It s good advice to always have a spare battery to avoid missing those irrecuperable moments.On the other hand, I tried other rechargeable batteries but they didn't fit the holes of the camera. Canon's batteries cost a little more than other brands. Other chargers do work faster. However, Canon's dedicated batteries do have an impact in the camera's performance.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the \\"quick charge\\" slots!!","review":"We purchased this for our Canon for when we were going on vacation - that way we could charge one set while we used the other for the day.1. We NEVER got a full-day's use out of these batteries, even when we used both sets.2. There are (4) slots on the charger, but (2) of the slots are \\"quick charge\\" slots:The batteries are charged quickly, but NOT TO FULL CAPACITY!!!! (The slots are markedon the inside of each battery slot. I used a silver marker to remind myself which slotwas which so I could AVOID the \\"quick charge\\".)In the end, we bought regular batteries as back-ups to the rechargeables - which defeats the very purpose of rechargeable batteries!!Very disappointing.We will be researching better alternatives to this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agrivation saver!","review":"These rechargable batteries and charging unit have saved me untold agrivation from dead or untimely battery failure. One of the worst was needing to take a last picture or two and have the batteries die in the camera and no new ones available.If you take pictures with modern high power consuming cameras with big memories, you will need one of these. This kind of agrivation will be a thing of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon Battery Charger Pack","review":"I bought this item for $40 online and then found out my Canon Camera didnt need a Cannon brand charger and I could have bought one for $10 instead. In total I spent for this charger which included the shipping and handling. Not worth it. Go to another store and by one for $10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but mighty","review":"I am so glad that I bought this when I bought my new Canon camera. It is amazingly portable and packable and does a quick job of recharging the batteries.

It is not just pleasant to use but also adds body to my thin lank hair and gives the curls a gentle bounce. Can be used to freshen hair between washes too. I've used it for 20 years and being able to buy on-line is important as in the UK and Israel its distribution is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"pump bottle defective, cannot get product out","review":"I have been using Potion 9 for several years. I like it that it can protect hair (allegedly) and functions like hair gel which holds curves just enough. My review is about their new package, the pump bottle. I must have gotten a defective one as I was not able to pump anything out. I called the customer service number on the bottle to ask for a replacement. After being transferred 5 times, talking to 5 live people one after another, I finally got the number of Sabastian Professional Satisfaction Guarantee department (1-877-NO-RISK-9). Problem is the guarantee is for 60-days after purchase, and mine already elapsed. Eventually I had to take the whole pump mechanism apart and fish the product out through a hole in order to use it.For those who buy this at local stores, make sure the bottle works before walking out of the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I've been using Potion 9 on my semi-straight long hair for about 8 years.

I use this along with Frizz-Ease Finishing Cream when the humidity is high, to make my hair silky and shiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable at all","review":"We've had this puzzle for about a month. My 3 year old son loves it and plays with it daily. Almost immediately the board holding the puzzle began to warp. That is okay, since he can use it without the board. BUT, in the last week, two of the pieces have broken. The ends where the puzzle pieces connect seem to be very brittle. We've glued it and he's still able to use it, but it won't be long before it ends up in the trash. We have several other (smaller) wooden puzzles by M&D, so I was really surprised to see the poor quality in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 year old loves it","review":"I love the Melissa & Doug puzzles because they are sturdy & colorful, my nephew has fun putting it all together on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"I bought this puzzle to use in my classroom.

I'd recommend it if your child likes puzzles, its a good one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable","review":"Out of the box, most of the pieces were coming apart. The pieces are made out of plywood (or some similar engineered wood product) and it seems that not enough glue was used in manufacturing them.

Very disappointed in M&D!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces are breaking the first day","review":"I purchased this puzzle for my 4 year old daughter and while she may love it, I don't.Apparently the picture is glued to the wooden pieces and within an hour it started peeling/flaking away. I super glued it back, but as we've played with it more pieces kept peeling apart. I love Melissa and Doug products but I'm diappointed in the quality of this puzzle. Maybe it's a fluke with mine, but if I had to do it again I wouldn't have purchased it. It's impossible to tell a 4 year old to gently break apart the very study pieces so that they don't rip the picture off."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this puzzle!","review":"My daughter absolutely loves this puzzle!

Very detailed and insightful. However, having an interest in psychology, I was looking forward to that chapter. Turns out to be nearly entirely based on Freudian Psychology and ignores most of the work in the field in the 70+ years since his death. The chapter also lumps homosexuals in with \\"fetishists, devotees of S&M\\" and \\"perverts of all stripes\\" and describes how the lot will probably never be happy considering the compounding of neuroses. I just thought the entire chapter was extremely dated considering it was supposedly updated in 2006 and contains references to modern day personalities (Jim Carrey, Daniel Day-Lewis, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Has Got To Be A Better General Knowledge Book Than This","review":"Not an absolutely horrible book.

It has a very large diameter, so you will want a powerful table mounted router to spin this thing! I used a 3.25 horsepower Hitachi with variable speed and ran it on the next to lowest speed setting.The finish was very good. I did minimal sanding on the resultant panel and they look great.Take very thin cuts.

There is no secret what are the traits of the few orders which are flourishing and are attracting the young: religious habit, corporate apostolate, common prayer, fidelity to the magisterium. Blinded by ideology, however, Sister Sandy insists that the orders are actually in great shape. This is simply denying the quick death of women's active orders and the need for real reform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a treasure","review":"This is a very strange book. Religious orders in the United States, especially active orders of women, are dead. They are dead demographically and spiritually.

The ability to pull-off a 70's Genesis sound ala \\"Nursery Crime\\" or a \\"Foxtrot\\" is a compliment rather than a criticism. Start with this and then move on to \\"J'Ai Pollette D'Arnu\\", \\"Ever\\" and then \\"Subterranea\\". You can see how the band matures over the years. Fun to see live too....if you get the chance.

All I can say from experience is using them as a handy maintenance man, they have been perfect. The batteries still charge like the day I bought them! The quality is extremely sturdy, made for heavy duty jobs. In my opinion the brand is by far the best on the market. You will definitely get your monies worth. Thinking that buying a cheaper brand will save you money isn't realistic because you will have to replace them much sooner than if you just bought a good brand in the first place.

Bringing Up Baby costars the always delicious Cary Grant. You will love Kate's comedic timing on this one. Last but least, the classic The Philadelphia Story.

Night on the Flint River : An Accidental Journey in Knowing God is Roberta Bondi's experience of just such an event. she has a powerful way of relating lifes misadventures as ways of connecting with the divine. Some would call this a \\"fox-hole confession\\", however, Bondi reflects on what happens when someone is already a believer, and feels they have come close to death. Is coming close to death a time of fear or a time of intense spiritual growth?

I truly feel clean and refreshed after each use of this product. Another important feature about this product is the fact that the manufactures have not attempted to improve the product.

Instead of running 3 miles during one week then 4 miles the next, try 3 miles, then 3.5 miles while keeping the other routines as the previous week. THe same goes with swimming.I stayed on a week routine until I can do everything I am suppose to before moving to the next week.

It also has great information for those who are interested in becoming SEALs, including contact information for recruiters/motivators. The dvd shows you how to do everything and I find it a good way to stretch.

You should already be a strong swimmer to be able to accomplish the amount of swimming prescribed.3. You'd better have plenty of time available to work out. Workouts like:Run 3 miles.

I feel it's much more beneficial for students to flat out learn hiragana/katakana/kanji at the beginning than trying to go through romaji. Several of the advanced students I know who started out with the \\"Jordan\\" method still cling far more to the romaji than is necessary and it is a hinderance to their learning.

The series waits far too long to introduce standard Japanese writing and insist on students focusing on word stress, which varies depending on dialect anyway! Many of the lexical items that appear in the series are also inappropriate for beginners. If you want to waste time learning a mostly useless system of romanization instead of learning to read normal Japanese text, then buy this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Textbook","review":"This has to be one of the worst textbooks and worst ways of learning a language.

I got a steal of a deal, and couldn't be happier with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for an update, and an eBook version.","review":"Lots of good information, but, it's hard to find. This book's main purpose would be for use in class, I think - in class when the teachers give assignments it's almost always so hard to find what section they're talking about (unless it's a particular \\"CC\\").Another glaring problem is the use of the obsolete romanization system. This makes the book so unpleasant to use. Every single time I see \\"si\\" instead of \\"shi\\" or \\"zyu\\" instead of \\"ju\\" it's annoying and distracting. Makes it almost impossible to study productively. If I had an eBook at least I could correct the romanization without too much trouble.Add a \\"section number\\"* to every SP, Drill, etc., update the romanization, and update the book to reflect modern times then it will get 4 - 5 stars.* What I mean is, instead of: Lesson 4, Part B, SP A, 3 - 4 it would be : Section 4.7 problems 3 - 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive Study Program","review":"Armed with the information contained in this three-volume series, as well as quality instruction at a university, I spent 15 months in Japan and can honestly say that nothing contained in JSL was inaccurate. The dialogues were completely authentic, the numerous drill sections provide the necessary amount of accurate models, helping the learner to develop a sense of \\"what sounds appropriate\\" in Japanese. JSL treats Japanese language as a way of acting in Japanese society, enabling the learner to express him/herself in a way that is culturally acceptable. I cannot recommend this series enough- there is simply no better textbook out there. One word of advice: Use the tapes and videos religiously! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst text books I have ever seen","review":"My main problem with this series (besides the outdated vocab, and HORRID conversation tapes) is the way it keeps the student stuck on reading English. She goes out of her way to not make a connection with English, but in doing so spends way too much time talking about the grammar in English. It is difficult for students to understand, and those I've known who have only studied on JSL and then go to Japan have a incredibly hard time. There is a large gap between what is taught in JSL and what is actually useful in a conversation.As far as the romaji goes, her system of romaji makes perfect sense. However, if used in an intro college course that does not have a lot of student-teacher interaction, it leads to horrible pronunciation.Japanese: The \\"Spoken\\" Language does next to nothing in preparing students to actually speak the Japanese language."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Way to Learn Japanese","review":"The Jordan system of learning Japanese has it's fair share of supporters, but anyone who has truly made Japanese an important part of their life understands why this book is not only unhelpful, but counterproductive. This system works entirely in romaji (roman characters), preventing the learner from seeing the language from a native perspective and retarding understanding of Japanese writing systems. As if that weren't bad enough, in place of the standard method of romanization Jordan has created her own, which is both confusing and unnecessary. It uses \\"core conversations\\" to simulate speaking in the language, but provides the learner with no ability whatsoever in creating original sentences. Do not buy this book! A much better choice for the beginning Japanese student is the \\"Genki\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never hated anything more than I hate this book","review":"I'm in the third year of this program and I watch my class continue to struggle everyday with even the simplest grammar. The emphasis is on memorizing conversations, which is completely worthless unless everyone in Japan asks you the same questions regarding the convience of your subway stop and the availablity of certain types of pens. One may also find it rather absurd that they will learn the kanji for hospital director and economics before dog or window. Note also that the word \\"table\\" is not introduced until the middle of the second volume. The material is poorly organized, hard to find, and absolutely chart-less. Worst of all, our the Japanese teaching assistants (native speakers mind you) chuckle at how out of date the material is and tell us that the only people who talk like this are old rich women and elevator operators. Run away from this teaching method while you still can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egypt Exposed? They Must Have Left That Part Out","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this video. I have watched a few of Bauval's lectures and interviews online, but this conversation with him, doesn't even share the amount of information you find free on YouTube.If you had never heard of the man, possibly, it would be worth some amount of money, but NOT for the price Reality Films is selling it for. I was expecting what the title suggests...\\"Egypt Exposed: The True Origins of Civilization,\\" but it didn't expose anything at all. Actually, if I'd known what I'd be receiving, I would not have ordered this video. It's listed as a documentary, but that's a matter of opinion. He tells about his background and how he became interested in the subject matter of the Pyramids. That isn't an expose as far as I'm concerned.There's nothing new here, and it was a waste of time and money. A huge rip-off in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT","review":"A disclaimer: I know the Rev. Gary Cox, PhD, from a couple of seminars on Christian Theology and Church History that he taught locally, and I happen to believe that he is a great human being. So, I may be biased, but... I think his book is a must-read--especially for members of main-line protestant churches who are feeling a little queasy about what's being passed off as \\"Christianity\\" in the national media these days (and for members of fundamentalist churches who may be beginning to question what they are being told from the pulpit week after week). The book is a quick read, the writing is very clear, clean, and crisp.

Ginsberg is overrated. This in itself is not catastrophic, but he has also exercised too great an influence on other poets, who have mistaken, as Strunk and White would say, spontaneity for genius. I have seen \\"Howl\\" praised by one reviewer as \\"the ONLY brilliant American poem in existence,\\" apparently forgetful that there was once a book called \\"Leaves of Grass,\\" among others; which shows that the grounds on which Ginsberg is praised are often too filmsy to offer real support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allan Disgustingberg","review":"This just in: William S. Burroughs was the only beat writer with any talent at all and, ironically, if you were to ask your average college type for the names of beat writers Burroughs wouldn't even come to their pot-headed mind. Allan Disgustingberg, alias Allan No-talent, was a very successful literary fraud. He was even able to blindside Burroughs, who was a literary genius, into thinking he was a real hairway to steven, er, stairway to heaven. And this is most astonishing since, if you've ever seen a picture of Allan Disgustingberg, you know that he was about as sexy as my uncle Abe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"I find Ginsberg's poetry to be extraordinarily coarse, ugly, and narcissistic. The ubiquitous references to homo-erotic themes gets really old, and frankly I just don't quite get what the big deal is with this guy. Sure, it's always been fashionable among some people to be into the Beats and all that, but how many people have actually sat down and tried to read this stuff? Ginsberg is probably the most overrated poet in the history of this country, and maybe the planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Ginsberg's startling, erratic genius is on display in this alternately inspiring and exasperating volume. I give it 5 stars because Ginsberg MUST be read and appreciated; the man changed the face of poetry, as well as pop culture, holding enormous influence over Bob Dylan, who would reinvent rock and roll and help inspire a cultural revolution. Why Ginsberg was not awarded a Nobel is astonishing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vast and great compendium of Ginsberg's writing","review":"This might be the first life-changing book I encountered (Warhol, Borges and Nabokov would come later) - I actually (astonishingly, in retrospect) stumbled across both Ginsberg - this collection - and Ferlinghetti in the library of a North Carolina high school in 1986. I kept this book checked out for most of the school year, gradually committing vast chunks of it to memory.Ginsberg was raw, real, more than willing to be a mess in life and in literature, which is exceptionally humanizing, and the poems are, and always will be this vast something from the depths of the collective American unconscious - \\"Howl\\" and \\"Kaddish\\" most famously, but in less well-known, but no less wonderful pieces like \\"Wichita Vortex Sutra\\" as well.Fans of Ginsberg (or of the beat movement in general) will already know much of this, but this collection is much more than that - some of the most vital American writing of the 20th century.-David Alston"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.

I was expecting a follow-up to the very promising BURN. I was sorely disappointed. This album was very underwhelming, to say the least. With the exception of the songs STORMBRINGER, & SOLDIER OF FORTUNE, this album is probably the weakest Purple album with Richie Blackmore in the line-up. This is also the last studio recording of Purple with Blackmore in the band before splitting with them & forming Rainbow. Blackmore's guitar work is probably very muted in this release. It sounded like he didn't give a damn in this album. Gone was the passion & fire that was present in the early Purple albums. Too bad, really. STORMBRINGER was a massive letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring just like Burn","review":"Never again will I buy another Deep Purple Album with Coverdale.

It's like The Doobie Brothers meets Steppenwolf, but if that's what you like it's a great album.There's a lot of use of gospel/soul back-up singers and funky organ music, akin to Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstitious\\".The standout tracks are:-\\"Stormbringer\\": The most straight ahead rocker on the album.-\\"Holy Man\\": A slower verse that kicks into an upbeat chorus.-\\"Lady Double Dealer\\": Heavy on the organ with a pulsing guitar riff.-\\"You Can't Do It Right\\": Very, Doobie-esque, gospel/rock sound.-\\"Soldier of Fortune\\": Slow ballad about a lonely wanderer.5 out of 9 tracks?

There are timeless songs contained on it, and overall I think as C.D's go this one has a significant amount of great tracks, which compared to some which have two or three at best is rare.It's a shame it gets compared to other Purple stuff, as it was a departure. The Hughes influence really comes through and you can track this influence back to his days in Trapeze, and yes I believe Blackmore said it wasn't for him and left.Zepplin certainly had numerous departures from their traditional 'sound', usually sucessfully, however some loyal fans saw these as not as good, just because it was a departure.The more influence and style the more the band can grow, and if not maybe the band has gone as far as it can...At the end of the day, this is one of the best C.D's around, it just so happens to be Deep Purple, enjoy it for what it is, not other stuff Purple has produced"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stormbringer Brings it","review":"My review for Deep Purple's \\"Burn\\" would say the same as for this album.

This disc is horrible. If one needs an example of Deep Purple, nearly any other album will do a much more accurate representation. Not that this is not the original band in \\"Coverdale\\" form, they just seem to have gotten full of themselves and dropped this goose egg into the listener's birthday cake. This sounds like an overly-orchestrated attempt to sell out, put out the 'pop'. Coverdale is not to blame as is easily heard on the \\"Burn\\" disc, \\"Stormbringer\\" has no direction and is executed without conviction. The production quality is just as uneven. A track-by-track analysis is not possible as one track will poison an attitude for any other track. Just don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not DP's best, but a good album anyway!","review":"Classic Heavy Metal purists consider that \\"B crews\\" on bands like Deep Purple, can damage the musical purity of the band. This happened when David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes were called in to replace DP's Ian Gillan in vocals, and the amazing Roger Glover in the bass guitar (who also played in previous album, \\"Burn\\".)Usaully considered as a \\"Make a new record, guys!\\" product from the pressure of their music producers (Warner Bros. in the U.S.) back in 1974, the album has some interesting tracks as the title one (\\"Stormbringer\\"), as well as \\"Hold On\\", \\"Lady Double Dealer\\", \\"High Ball Shooter\\" (with an excellent keyboard playing from Jon Lord), on which David Coverdale certainly shows to be a superb Rock singer...

I could't wait to hear it becuase I had already heard Burn and Machine Head. I was, as you will be too, disappointed. This album deserves the 2 stars I rate it and nothing more other than the killer album cover of the stormbringer and the tornado. Compared to Burn, Stormbringer is lame and gutless. The sound is muffled and neither Coverdale nor Hughes sound as strong as they do on Burn. Blackmore sounds bored.If you like Burn, then don't get this album. Others give it a high rating because they love DP, as I do. Unfortunately, this album is not one of the better ones.

Meanwhile, in her curious, willful way, Rachael falls in love with Jim. The \\"broken bubble\\" of the title refers to a minor incident in which one Thisbe Holt rolls around naked inside a plastic bubble at a convention of optometrists, who end up filling it with junk and smashing it.

The appeal to one's own sense of tragic glory that one sees in the Cheever's characters is supremely effective.

Then there are the rest, which are a notch below. Some are boring, some are unsatisfying, and some just flat out go on too long and don't know when to end. Still, when taken as a whole, these stories provide a fascinating glimpse into the lives of those living in the East coast after the second World War, urban and suburban, rich and poor, successful and unsuccessful.As Cheever notes in his fascinating introduction, reading these stories is sometimes like taking a glimpse into a lost and vanished world.

I think that this has happened with John Cheever, from the retrospective praise of his work to our fascination with his bisexuality and persistent alcoholism. Indeed, his personal demons are far more interesting than his prose.While I read isolated stories in mags and liked them, reading them in a lump like this makes his weaknesses seem very plain indeed. His stories almost all revolve around a common plot: things in the suburbs don't turn out the way we want, and most often, a lot of alcohol does little to soften the blow of deteriorating reliationships, alienated children, and nothing to do in retirement.

So, if you are a true Devo fan, you probably kept your vinyl copies of their excellent first two albums, but being an idiot, I didn't, which leaves me quite satisfied with the trip through memory lane. Still, I would have liked to have \\"Praying Hands\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunate Title","review":"_Greatest_Misses_ is prolly THE best Devo compilation there is...presumably, the album title comes from the fact that none of these songs ever came close to making the Big Time, in spite of the fact that these are actually some of their FINEST work!

I'm not usually a fan of \\"best of\\" CDs - and I'd suggest getting Devo's first 3 CDs because they are about as good as you can get for late 70's/early 80's punk/new wave. But this has a couple of really great alternate versions (the Booji Boy mixes) that breathe new life into these great songs. I think for those songs alone it's worth the $10 I paid for it. I also enjoyed listening to \\"Speed Racer\\" - glad to have that one without having to buy \\"Oh No, It's Devo\\" (I think that's what it's from)- which isn't so hot. Mark Mothersbaugh & Jerry C - those guys are geniuses and will someday will be recognized as the pioneers that they are.

The serious collector will already have the original 45s. But having them in one spot is very pleasant, and gives a glimpse of Devo's roots. A copy of this CD fills out your Devo collection with what you may have missed out on. And as the title implies these songs are worth a second look.The use of the Parental Advisory Label refers to the lyrics and subject matter of the British B side, \\"Penetration In The Centrefold\\". Two other songs here that first saw release in England are \\"Mechanical Man\\" and \\"Be Stiff\\".Greatest Misses pulls together songs that really represent the spirit and concepts of Devo."},{"rating":"1","title":"good choice for the meek","review":"If you're anxious to dive into Devo but don't want to shell out 30 bucks for Pioneers Who Got Scalped and/or are VERY skeptical, buy either this or Greatest Hits first. This album is supposed to be composed of Devo's \\"dirtier\\" songs, complete with un-necessary explicit lyrics sticker. However, more then half of it is songs lifted off of \\"Duty Now For The Future\\"! If you buy both that and Q&A, you pretty much have the majority of Greatest Misses. The only real reason to get this is for the classic Penetration In The Centerfold (only found on the Infinite Zero re-release of Duty Now, which is damn near impossible to find.) Bottom line: stay away unless you're first causally getting into Devo or if you're a diehard spud collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called the worst of Devo","review":"The title says it all.

Billy has certainly mastered the art of catching the big ones, but it also comes at a price - Fishing is 1st - everything else, I mean everything else comes after. Catching 2,500 fish with a rod during a slow season was mind boggling to me, I had to do the math twice and was sure there was an extra zero in the numbers, but low and behold this guy is a true master of the species.It was an inspiration to read and even got me up in the middle of the nite to go for the cows under a full moon and a high tide - I got skunked and humbled.A great gift with some terrific photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are You Willing To Learn?","review":"For a Striper fisherman, this is a GREAT book for those needing to review their fishing techniques and to check if their fishing equipment are up to standard.

I was obsessed with having everything match; this high chair is why that thought process may not be the best when choosing items for a new baby/infants. The highchair is decent enough, but I have found that the cover does keep coming off and I would like something more sturdy for my active 5 month old who will get much more active before he's out of a high chair. That is why I will either move this high chair to my mom's house or sell it, but I am DEFINITELY purchasing another for our everyday use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cheap high chair","review":"We ordered this chair for a cheap version while living abroad, and planned on purchasing a wooden version when we move back home. However, it's been great, and I may just wait and see how it holds up before buying a second. The only things I don't like are: the leaning aspect of the seat back feels a little cheap, as if it may get out of place easily. Also, the tray has a tendency to pop off easily, so you have to make sure you've put it in place. The tray is almost impossible to maneuver with one hand, but that is 90% of high chairs. Lastly, the \\"fabric\\" part of the seat is a bit big and things get under it easily. I have to check under it regularly to ensure nothing gets left in there.Other than that, it's great. It's very lightweight, has a cute pattern, and is super easy to clean. The belt has tons of room for bigger/older babies. I also like the slide-out tray for feeding, so little fingers can't get into the food. Overall, great product for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good High Chair","review":"I liked this high chair from the pictures online and when I got it, I was pleased that it looked exactly the same as in the pictures. I love the patchwork cow print of the seat (I have the pack 'n play and the swing also from this collection). The seat cushion, however, is a little too loose. It should have a couple more reinforcement elastics on the upper back somewhere. It is really easy to clean (seat, cushion, tray, everything), the tray clicks into place nice and tight, and it's relatively sturdy overall. I don't think it's worth the price, though, which is why I'm only giving this chair 4 stars (well, that and the loose seat cushion). I love that the chair is simple...those newfangled high chairs are just a waste. The recline feature was nice for when my son was in the early stages of spoon feeding, but it's a silly feature for anything after that so we haven't used it since he was 4 months old and we won't use that feature again, probably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco Highchair Review","review":"This highchair is great for any little person.

We have twin granddaughters that we see frequently so needed something sturdy. The chair does not fold for storage, has a wide footprint so adults & children trip over the legs and the seat cover does not attach securely. The chair is all molded plastic and cleans up easily.I don't like that the chair doesn't adjust in height to use at the dinner table or lower to the floor. My chairs are going on the next garage sale and I've ordered two folding compact chairs. My advice-don't waste your money unless you are on very tight budget. Some of the advantages of the more expensive ones are well worth it. I wish I had spent a little more the first time instead of learning the hard way now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Highchair","review":"The best feature of this chair is the wide tray.

The Graco Easy Highchair met our needs perfectly. Without a steep price tag, this chair offers all the features we needed. It was pretty easy to assemble and quite easy to use and super simple to keep clean. I also like that it has a large tray with an additional pull-out tray for me, and multiple tray compartments for my baby to use. The buckle is also very functional, and I can get my baby in and out of the chair quickly without a lot of fuss. This is not the fanciest chair on the market, but it might be the best bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and cute","review":"This item loses a star for not having much padding in the seat and for taking up a lot of space.

There's a bad-boy character based on a few of the players who were ultimately cut from (or quit) the team prior to the Olympics, and then there's the good guy, based on Karch Kiraly. The actors unfortunately had no idea how to play volleyball, and it showed. (Monroe Clark's final set looked pristine compared to some of these... attempts)The actor playing the guy based on Kiraly was also a tad shorter than most real players, and so they had to use a mini trampoline to boost him up to a height where he could be a \\"Spiker\\".

Having seen this opera live many times, I knew I just had to have it permanently on DVD. This performance is not the performance to own, not for me anyhow. I could not get beyond the horrible 'ugliness' of the production, the sets, the costumes, the 'darkness' which permeated this entire production, and the very odd way the production was put together. Having said that, I thus could not appreciate the vocal performances and now realize that I will play this DVD solely for the vocal performance without watching the screen. This performance at the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin is just plain 'ugly' to watch. Vocally it is quite lovely, if only to watch the magnificence of soprano Dorothea Roschmann, a superb Susanna, and Emily Magee who was a lovely Countess.

I've read a million articles on dovetailing, and though many are good, this is certainly the best. Why? Kirby explains everything from stance to starting a kerf correctly. Really, if you can cut a straight line I think you can cut a dovetail, but cutting a straight line is very hard to do and Kirby addresses alot of that. The exercises seem sound and I cannot wait to try them.

I'll admit that I'm a pins first kind of person but was willing to be objective.Obviously only my opinion, but it's just too technical for something that isn't nearly as complicated and \\"magical\\" as some would like to have you belive. I almost resited the former mentoned book on sharpening when I saw Kirby was the author, but that one I found indespensible - go figure.

This book only DEFINES phrases such as: \\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\\" but NEVER explains the ORIGINS of each phrase. Since most everyone knows the definition of phrases such as \\"Just what the doctor ordered\\" defining it is seems almost pointless. Want to look up a cliche about being sick(for instance)? Think again, each 'cliche' is listed ONLY alphabetically and can not easily cross-referenced by subject matter giving it ZERO practical application to the modern writer or researcher.For those seeking deeper understanding of cliches, you'd best look elsewhere.

In the discussions about loss of biodiversity and the dominance of mass production agriculture, I felt like I was being presented with a call to action. I'd considered vegetarianism off and on for some time (for nutritional reasons) and this book gave me the impetus to finally follow through.

The JWIN is not plug and play and presented quite a bit of static, the Griffin could not muster the volume, as was the case with the Kensington, and the Edge was just a P.O.S., with no stereo transmission, and a battery door that would not close. My test was specifically for transmission to a Panasonic Boom box, used while on vacation. In both N.J. and N.C., the MITO performed well, with little static, and plenty of volume for those late night jam sessions after the kids and wives were asleep.

We however, are not able to do the writing lessons. Our four year old does not have the fine motor needed for the difficult tasks of writing lower case a and s. We spent a lot of time on the writing lessons, with little success. We will continue our summer quest for reading, and leave the writing for later. I do love the parent scripted instruction, and think it works well with our child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far less than adequate","review":"I have tried several books and software to teach my children. This book was my least favorite. The idea is good but that is all. Nearly everything in it is poorly done. The text does not need to be so distorted. The lessons are painful in their insistence on doing it according to the script. I would like to meet the person who can get the child through the instructional drivel. The stories are cute but always too long. This is a book with major flaws and is not for younger kids. If you have a child who is less than enthusiastic to learn to read, he will hate this overly regimented, artificial approach. I discovered another book - The Reading Lesson, used and liked it very much. Similar approach but what a difference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok book, but hopefully you can find better","review":"This book did help my son learn to read somewhat, but he was by no means a \\"reader\\" when we were done with it, and we had to supplement with other things to get him really reading. The system taught is so specific to the DISTAR program that you can't really quit in the middle if it isn't working for you. ALso, the lessons are dreadfully boring, and were painful to get through, for both my son and for me. We had to promse a trip to 6 flags to him to motivate him to finish it!

Not really!","review":"I got this book to help my 5 year old learn to read.I think the concept is good, but he really didn't respond well to the drilling each day. He lost interest really fast. I think, as a previous educator, it may be an okay outline to use, but must be used in conjunction with other resources that grab the child's attention. Understanding that a word is made up of several sounds and learning to blend them is a necessary skill, but repetitious drill alone just didn't work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't even TRY to teach your child before you have this book","review":"I tried to teach my 4-year-old to read for so long before this book was recommended to me. I knew my daughter had the capacity, I just didn't know how to teach her. We would both get so frustrated and upset.This book walks you though step-by-step. It is 100% no-fail. It takes you by the hand and leads you through everything. There is good reason for the parent's part being scripted out. It eliminates any confusion for the child and makes sure you go at the right pace.As for using in conjunction with Bob's books, I discourage you from trying that. The sounds are not learned in the same order and I've found that my daughter tries to guess what a word is based on the picture, rather than sounding out the word in the sentence. \\"Teach Your Child to Read...\\" is more than enough to help your child without Bob's Books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading program","review":"What an excellent system - we have a 4 year old son who recently began this \\"program\\" (my wife and I take turns providing the lessons before bedtime) and the progress has been great. We initally tried to \\"teach\\" reading via the Bob books but for whatever reason, they just did not resonate. I believe its the structure of this program - the fairly short lessons (under 20 minutes), gradual progresson, and notable progress for the student - that makes it a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're prepared - it's smooth sailing!","review":"When I first tried this book with my preschool aged son he wasn't ready because he wasn't prepared - he had a hard time remembering the letters and only felt frustrated - as did I. We stopped and just spent more time with letter familiarity - videos, games, letters on the fridge - and this time he has been flying through the lessons with ease. I felt so much anxiety about teaching him to read but I didn't realize that it would be simple as long as I gave more attention to the preparation. I now know that teaching my next two boys how to read will be simple because I know that it's all about the preparing them to be ready!

She had a great time going through the lessons- and, the biggest surprise of all- so did I!

I can only credit the foundation that this book taught for that success!I'm working with her younger sister now, and she loves it just as much. I even bribed her to eat all her dinner one night by offering to let her have another lesson after we finished. :D Our little boy (age 2 1/2) will sit at the table and try to mimic what my current 4-year old is doing.

After only 28 lessons she is starting to really get the hang of the process, and can sound out all of the words presented to her in each lesson.

My child and I both liked the stories which do not use any slang or made-up words like other beginning readers. Pictures with engaging questions are fun and not distracting.

I personally prefer a \\"workbook\\" type of layout so not only it will help me simplify presentation to my child but also I can readily work from the material with my child without much time spent in preparation.

It's not worth your time or money! If you notice the author is completely against all public school teachers saying they use only the whole language approach.

Clearly the author doesn't have a clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"If at first it doesn't work, try again later.","review":"The first times my daughter and I tried this book, she said she hated it. Getting her to lesson 50 was a lot of work, so I put the book down for a few months. When we picked it up again it was so easy. I had her go quickly though three lessons a day until we got back to lesson 50, now we do one lesson a day. I think its a breeze because I found a reward she loves. Every day after her lesson I read a chapter of Patrica Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles (Princesses, dragons, magic, what more could a little girl want). Now she begs for her lesson everyday, and can read almost word she sees. Her brothes run to watch her read when she gets to the story part.

I bought it when she was 4 and by the end of preschool she was reading at a kindergarten level. When she stared Kindergarten, her teacher moved her to 1st grade reading. The lesson are so simple and only 20 minutes long. The other great thing is that my daughter didn't feel any pressure coming from the lessons. I know that teaching your child to read can be very difficult and the child may feel the pressure of learning how to read and then shut down. So, we'd try to do a lesson a day but if she wasn't interesting in the lesson, then we'd pick out a bob book or some other easy reader to work with for 20 minutes. That way we still did some kind of reading every day to maintain the routine but diversified a bit to maintain her interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Great book!

Alas, it is too cumbersome, too clumsy. With all the advances in publishing and software technology this primitive and tedious book should be retired. After buying the 100 lessons and trying to use it, I went back to see parents' reviews. It's hard to believe that any parent can finish the book.

I bought the book when she announced to me that she wanted to learn how to read. She has always had a good attention span so the 10-15 minute lessons are not too taxing for her, The lesson plans are clear and simple to follow and each lesson builds on the previous one in a logical progression. My daughter is now successfully and excitedly reading simple passages. Despite the lack of colorful pictures or visual graphics in the book, my daughter does not protest but requests for \\"reading lesson\\" i do think and i make it a point to keep our 1 on 1 positive and encouraging.

It's perfect for teaching children to read. Just 10 minutes a day with your child, and by lesson 85 they're usually reading on the 5th grade level. The only drawback is this book does not teach such side-topics as grammar, spelling or handwriting....you have to pursue those separately. But for teaching reading, this book can not be beat. I homeschooled for 19 years and used this book to teach 3 of my 4 children to read. I bought it recently to tutor someone else's child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I found this book to be a very good way to help my son learn to read. It is also an excellent way for a father to bond with his child. Both my son and I enjoyed the time together. One thing the author does not address is that all children learn at different speeds and that you shouldn't get frustrated if they do not learn as fast as the book says they can learn. We started the first time at the age of 4. My son did fine with the sounds, but was not able to do the writing. After about lesson 30 I was seriously frustrated with him on his writing and ultimately I forced him to give up. We put the book away for a year, and one day when he was 5 he brought the book back to me and said \\"daddy please teach me to read again.\\" We were able to complete all 100 lessons before he turned 6 and I found a different way to teach him to write. My son is now 7 and just finished 1st grade in the top 3 readers of his class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your kid -- not for mine","review":"The Bob Books have been a way more fun and successful path to early reading for my daughter. I suppose this book would work if your goal were to teach a kid methodically how to read. Therefore it might be good for kids who are having trouble learning to read in school. However, if your kid is in kindergarten or younger, there's no need to rush them. Books with real words, such as Bob Books (and of course there are others, but those are the ones we're using), are so much more fun for my daughter, and I suspect for most kids. At an early age, fun seems more important than drills like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the reluctant learner","review":"I bought this book after reading the glowing recommendations. The process used is indeed thorough, but BORING! My child is ADD and a kinesthetic learner. She was bored, literally to tears (so was I!). I could not get her past lesson six. For me, it was a waste of money. If your child needs auditory and/or visual stimulation to encourage him or her, this is not the book for you. Also, it introduces an alternative spelling method that ultimately must be unlearned. This was too much for my already reluctant and frustrated six-year-old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure what I would have done without this book!","review":"I homeschool and my 4 year old is reading like a champ! I have to admit somewhere in the middle he lost some of the motivation towards this book-it IS 100 lessons! I changed my approach from doing it everyday. Also, if he did well with the first reading I didn't automatically have him read the passages twice. With some incentives, including an I Can Read Party he stuck with it and is now an excited and proud reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 year old loves it!!","review":"Love this Book! My 3 year old boy ( he will be 4 in 2 months) does really well with holding still for the 15 minutes it takes to get through the lesson. I let him pick out a bunch of different stickers so that when he completes his lesson he gets to choose a sticker to put on the page. My dad used this book to teach me how to read when I was four and also used stickers as a reward for a job well done. I looked forward to my reading lesson with my dad everyday and now my little boy and I have that to look forward to everyday as well! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"Easy to use, easy to follow. I am using it with my 5 year old and my 3 year old and they are both doing great with the program. Everything you need to know is right there in the book. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for parents and teachers!","review":"This book is excellent. I used the same program teaching first graders in an elementary school, as well. It is easy to follow and easy for the children to learn. The children feel great satisfaction in their newly learned reading skills! I recommend it to all parents and teachers alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Effective","review":"I am aware of the whole language/phonics debate that has been raging for years. The fact is, you can't argue with success. I have taught many children to read using the methods in this book. I have tracked their progress. Not one of my students, some of whom are in upper elementary school, seems to be negatively affected. One former student was tested by his school and found to be reading on an eighth-grade level.(He was in kindergarten at the time.)I taught my own two daughters to read using DISTAR. My older daughter tested out at a third grade reading level near the beginning of first grade. She is an honor roll student. My younger daughter hasn't been tested, butone of her whole language reading teachers tells me that she is one of the most advanced kids in all the kindergarten classes, which have nearly 300 kids. Of all the reading programs I have tried, thisone has proven, time and again, to be the most effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Teaching Aid","review":"My child is 6 years old and is reading below 1st grade level. Her school uses the basic whole language approach. Even though she was learning, her progress was very slow. I noticed that her pronunciation of certain sounds was incorrect. Now after having completed the first 30 lessons of this book, she is more able to sound out words she is unsure of and is now reading Level 1 readers with less hesitation and more confidence. My daughter sometimes complained that the lessons were too boring and at those times it was hard to hold her attention. I would like to suggest adding more interesting stories and games to the next edition of this book. I would like to know if there are any similar books in the area of math."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"This book is great! It was recommended to me by a teacher who uses it for her own children. We began using this book when my child was 3.5 yrs old and finished 12 months later. We took our time finishing the book and took last summer off from doing the lessons. It is time consuming but teaching a child to read does take time. Now my child is 4.5 yrs old and is reading her sister's 2nd grade books and decoding words like interrupted. I recommend this phonics based program to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever for teaching reading.","review":"Taught my oldest son how to read with this book when he was 4 1/2. Lent the book out and never got it back. Now youngest son needs it. Got here in record time and in better shape than stated. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for teaching reading","review":"I used this book with my oldest and am now using it with my two youngest. It is a very good system for teaching reading without all the workbooks and game pieces that you get with other systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good reading program, but not a phonics curriculum","review":"I used this book to teach my 4-year old to read. It \\"works\\" but it teaches a blend of phonics and whole language techniques. This left my daughter doing a lot of guessing rather than reading. I noticed that she could \\"read\\" during the lessons, but to see the same words out of context, she did not know how to sound out the words properly. I have had to find another curriculum that is purely phonics and back track a bit to ensure that she knows how to read well. I will choose another reading curriculum such as \\"Explode the Code\\" or \\"Sing, Spell, Read, and Write\\" to teach my other two children how to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Scripted","review":"Teaching Your Child to read should move at their pace, on their time table, at their comfort and confidence level. I have been teaching young children for 7 years and there is no pre-scripted way to teach every child to read. It's like Potty Training. We all look for some \\"magic technique\\", but every child is different. Some will pick it up quickly and some will need more help and encouragement. The only thing I like is the idea of setting aside time every day to work on reading, no matter what. But what you work on that day should be based on your child's needs and attention span, not what the book tells you. Listen to your child, not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my son","review":"My son is going through kindergarden again. The main reason, he can't read. I thought this book would help. He was easily bored with it. After the first two days with it, he wants nothing to do with it. It is sooo slow to begin. I thought if I skipped through some of the begininng it would not be so boring to him. I was wrong. We are now going to try BOB books. (Which he wanted to try in the first place.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teach your child to read in 100 easy lessons","review":"The book is good, but it would be easier to use if there was a video tape or casette tape to go with it. I have a child who is almost 8 yrs. old, is in 1st grade. He doesn't decode letters or numbers at all. I believe the book would help him tremendously, but know that a video tape or cassette tape along with the book would benefit him greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book is too wordy and \\"busy\\"","review":"I think the book is too wordy. The pages too confusing. I also cannot find a page where each orthographic sign is explained. I find forinstance no explanation for the sign under \\"c\\" on page 97 is explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I tried reading it but it's too complicated. Flash cards work better. Just read with your child- can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets the basics wrong--how can the rest be good?","review":"Any native speaker of English worth his salt knows that \\"t-h-e\\" is pronounced \\"thee\\" before a vowel sound (thee [the] apple, thee [the] hour), and \\"thuh\\" before a consonant sound (thuh [the] pear), and that \\"a\\" is, almost without exception, pronounced \\"uh\\" (\\"uh\\" [a] pear). \\"A\\" is only pronounced \\"ay\\" when stressing the word itself, or stressing the singular (\\"ay\\" [a] pear, not _several_ pears). (Both of these are very, very rare in actual usage.) For example, on p. 143, the authors write \\"the cat...\\" There is a long mark over the \\"e\\" on \\"the\\" before cat. The authors should have learned this when they were children learning to read. If I were to teach someone to read with this volume, I would have to scour the book for mistakes first, a very time-consuming task. I do not recommend this book by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"This book is not at all what I was expecting. As far as how well it works, I don't know. When I first got it and opened in up I was so disappointed that I put it up on the shelf and still have yet to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeschooler loves Reading Lessons","review":"My daughter and I are thoroughly enjoying the lessons. Amazon has included a lot of the intro information that explains why this is a great system.Anyway, my daughter turns four in a couple of weeks and we've done 30 of the lessons. She is learning so fast and we're both excited about it. She loves to sit down for school time when we do our Reading Lesson followed by Math. This book makes it easy for parents and I think it is even better than just phonics. I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to teach someone to read!The added exercises they suggest sound great, too. It has been fun so far, and I'm so proud of her (and of me!). This book tells you exactly what to do and how to do it. I just wish they had beginner books out with the same Orthography in them. THAT would be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love 100 easy lessons","review":"I have just finished with my 4 1/2 year old and I am blown away by his success. My son was pretty advanced already and knew all of his sounds, and even so, this was a struggle for him. Around lesson 70 it finally clicked and he zoomed through the rest of the book. If your child isn't ready, wait a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"When your child is ready....","review":"When your child is ready to start learning to read I really recommend this book. My first son sailed through this book early. My second son is taking his time but he is still learning very well. Each child is sooo different that you just have to pay close attention to see if they are truly ready. No matter what, remember that learning is truly enjoyable. You are setting the example that they will follow all through life. So have fun. Cuddle on the couch and make learning to read so much fun together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Working great, just added fun flash cards","review":"I have a 3 1/2 year old that already knows his letter sounds. Since starting this book I have already noticed his confidence in reading becoming stronger! (lesson 36 now) I am very impressed.... However, I have taken the letter sounds and words and made flash cards for him to read from. This helps him focus and have fun with it. Next we will read the new words for the lesson and the interesting story. He loves the funny picture he gets to see after he successfully reads the story. I gave it a 4 because they should suggest fun flash cards to keep the younger ones interested. I Also made a chart from 1-100 that he gets to put a star on once complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons","review":"This book is great. I am doing it with my 4 year old and the progression is logical and appropriate for her age. It gives wonderful parent tips to aid the learning process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything it promises","review":"This book is everything it claims to be and more. I checked this book out of the local library to decide whether or not to purchase it. Within the first day my 4-year-old was reading a few simple words. I could not believe it! Once he got the general concept the first few words came really easily. I am so proud of him and he is so proud and excited. He does not get frustrated by the lessons, they are clear and concise, getting to the point before he loses interest. I am now purchasing this book to complete the lessons with my 4-year-old, and for my 3-year-old, and when our infant reaches an appropriate age, we will use it with her also. What a wonderful learning tool. I can't say enough about it. Get this book if you are looking for an easy method to teaching your child to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book delivers!!","review":"I am using this book with my 5 year old twin boys. We are sailing along and the boys love it!! They feel so proud when they read the \\"stories\\". We cover the accompanying picture until after they have read the sentences. They get excited about taking my hand away from the picture after they have read about it. We homeschool and this book gives me all the confidence I was searching for in my endeavor to teach reading. Great book. It WORKS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I started this book on my 4.5 year old child a couple of weeks ago. We are only on lesson 13 and he is picking up on it very quickly. I am so pleased with the progress he has made in such a short time! I homeschool him and he looks forward to that part of our day. He grabs the book and says, \\"Mommy, it's time to do our reading lesson!\\" My goal was for him to be reading well by the time he turned 5 and we are on track to do just that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Teaching Aid!","review":"This has been a real godsend for my 6 year old daughter. She did well in Kindergarten, but when she read books she memorized and recited what she knew each page said. She could read some words, but was loosing the joy of reading as she struggled to make words out. After a few moments of struggling, she was ready to move on to something else.My wife found this book in our local library and kept checking it out to work with my daughter over this summer. The techniques it's taught her have been outstanding. She looks forward to her nightly lesson and reminds us if we forget. She's gotten so excited because she can now truly read many of the books she'd only memorized before. She looks at the words in books and sounds them out using what she's learned. It's been a real treat to let her read a bedtime story to us! This should be in every parents collection. I'm now buyng one to keep and using it with my 3 year old when he's ready!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She was ready to read - and now she does!","review":"My daughter is 4 and can now read thanks to this brilliant book! She is VERY much a \\"do it myself\\" child so this book is perfect for her. We go at her pace - we are on lesson 54 and she can read so many words now. She has fun trying to sound out words. At night we read together and it's so much fun to watch the world of books open up for her as she reads to me. I plan to \\"teach\\" my son to read using this same method when he is ready! I cannot recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"We've only gotten to lesson 20 but I already see results in my 5 year old.

I plan on useing this book next year with my now 4 year old and eventually with my now 1 year old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The teaching method is very effective and really works!!!","review":"In about 6-8 months, our son was reading at a much higher level, his spelling was excellent, he excelled in phonetically sounding out words and it happened all right before our eyes. He actually enjoyed doing the lessons so much that he begged us to continue. But according to the instructions, you keep the sessions short and leave them asking for more. The instructions were very clear so that anyone could take this book and teach their child to read. The illustrations are funny and make the experience more enjoyable. It is like a fun game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money.","review":"As an ESL teacher of ten years I know a lot about teaching children. However when I had a daughter of my own I wanted to make sure that I had the best possible materials and approaches to teach her to read. Because of its high reviews and sales figures I purchased \\"Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons\\" by Phyllis Haddox. As soon as it arrived and I opened it I regretted my decision to buy this book. It should be titled \\"How to Make Teaching Your Child to Read as Difficult and Boring as Humanly Possible.\\" Anyone who wants to teach their child to read should forget about this book and its useless program. If you want your child to learn to read, teach him or her some phonics, buy the \\"Bob Book\\" series and jump right in and begin reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Confusing!","review":"I found this book confusing and my dd did too. I thought I would help my dd along in her reading with some phonics basics and I couldn't do it with this book. I think my dd is way too advanced for this book but may be fine with children who aren't reading yet. She knows all her basic letter sounds and is already reading simple books with little help, like 'Dick and Jane'. She just needs work on the harder phonics stuff. I am sure this book does 'the hard stuff' but I couldn't get past the first few pages to see if it did. This book just wasn't for us. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"I had high hopes for this book. Since the title says \\"Easy\\" in it. It was not kid friendly or mom friendly. It was hard to use with the small, uninteresting print. The different symbols were confusing and my child was turned off to it right away and dreaded \\"reading\\" lessons to my Dismay. I have since purchased, \\"Mommy, Teach me to Read\\" and have had a ton more success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be more Tedious and Boring","review":"I bought 100 Easy Lessons because I knew that it was a popular book. I am convinced that its popularity is a result of people not really knowing that there are other options to learn reading in a systematic way. It is the most tedious excercise in minutae I have ever experienced. RUN from this book! We've heard good things about \\"Explode the Code\\" as a systematic approach to learning to read. We'll give that a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book.","review":"The book is so very easy to follow, not only for my daughter but for me as well. It also takes very little time to do each day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons","review":"Excellent teaching tool to use with children. It is better than how the schools teach it since you are holding the letter sounds and not pausing inbetween each letter, the child is able to figure out the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great place to start!","review":"I have some experience with literacy, but none with initial reading instruction. I'm using this book with my soon-to-be five-year-old. He loves it. There are a couple of the exercises that are not intuitive, but with a little adaption, he is getting it. He was reading words in a week, and by the end of the second week, he was reading simple sentences. I'm pleased with his progress, and this was exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"We are about 25 lessons along and I can't believe the progress!

She's having a great time and is very excited for every lesson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too rigid for some kids","review":"I bought this book on reading the recommendations here, and I was very disappointed. My experience was similar to that of another reviewer in that the lessons became grueling and frustrating for both me and my son. I remain open-minded about the weird orthography, but the approach requires kids (mine is 4) to perform on command, turning what might be a fun time into a chore. I finally gave up after a particularly bad session in which we both became frustrated and angry. The method in this book repeatedly puts the child \\"on the spot\\" and for some children, like mine, the pressure is just too great.I'm sure this would be a fine method for some children, but I'm not sure how one would determine in advance how it would work for a particular child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Happy Learner = A Happy Teacher","review":"I bought this book for my five-year-old son who was having a difficult time with the program his older sister used. HE LOVES THIS METHOD! Although he still starts almost every lesson with, \\"Not reading!\\", he giggles throughout the session and is experiencing great success. His engagement is the most encouraging thing. I would recommend this book without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great curriculum!","review":"I am a homeschool mom and was a special education teacher. This method is easy to follow. The lessons and activities are brief and keep the instruction moving. My oldest daughter moved through the curriculum quickly. She liked it when she could be the teacher. She was so proud that after only a few weeks she could read short sentences. It improved her reading proficiency very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT! (for me)","review":"I would recommend 100 Easy Lessons to anyone with a small childI learned to read from this book myself when I was around 5 years of age. This book made learning to read a positive experience because it was fun and easy. I believe that learning through this book is the reason that I love reading and excelled in school.My older syblings, who did not get the advantage of this book also believe that it made the difference.I am going to use this book in a few years when my own daughter is ready to learn to read. I will also be getting my friends and family copies of this book for their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally some progress!!!","review":"I have been homeschooling for 7 years, and have used many different books and curriculum. This is so easy to use!! I feel like my active 6 year old boy is finally advancing with his reading skills. We abandoned our previous program, and started from the beginning. He quickly advanced through the lessons, because he already knew some of the material. We are at lesson 52 and do 2 lessons a day. We skip the writing part because we do another writing program. We have a chart on the wall for motivation. He puts a star on the chart for each lesson he does. After 5 lessons, he tapes a \\"paper\\" dollar on the chart. When he is finished, he will have $20! He is up to $10 now, and is very excited to see his progress on the wall. I HIGHLY recommend this program to anyone who wants to help their child read better and quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plan!","review":"I am currently using this to teach my 3.5 yr old son to read and he is really enjoying the lessons. He has already progressed to being able to sound out a few easy words and should be reading on a 3rd grade level by the end of the summer.

This book is not recommended for a child that has trouble focusing on one thing for longer than 15 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Teaching Tool","review":"This is a great teaching tool. My daughter has a few learning disabilities and we thought she wouldn't ever learn to read. I had tried several programs and nothing worked; until I found this book.

I am so happy and thankful that this program is out there for parents like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I love this book. But you do have to work at your child's pace. My son has learned so much. He gets so excited when he learns a new sound and recognizes the new letter. It is also great because you don't have to worry about what to say. It tells you exactly what to say and how to present the lesson. I do recommend reviewing it before teaching each lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marny G","review":"I bought this book for my son when he was four. It has made him become a very advanced reader. He was at a second grade reading level in Kindergarten. Now that he is in the third grade he reads books at a Junior High School level. I can not say enought about this book. My son also does extremely well on spelling tests and I believe it's because he learned to read at such an early age with this book. I highly recommend this book to teach children to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just a \\"get started\\"....","review":"Although I've had success with this book, most people think this is a complete phonics program...it's not. It is a GREAT way to get your child \\"off and running\\" with reading. If your child has had difficulty with any other phonics program, use this to get them to start reading and then integrate back into your other program if you're happy with it. Most aren't structured to get them started reading, just to continue with reading. This book gets your child started and builds confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful for parents trying to teach their children","review":"This book is not child friendly nor parent friendly. It is extremely difficult to follow, and even when I followed it step by step, the steps were so boring that my child lost interest almost immediately. I had hoped this would be a text that would a text that would facilitate reading in a fun way, but it is definitely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"I am glad I didn't spend a penny on this book because it was given to me. I am giving it a 2 star because I know I can find something useful in it after all it has a million and one pages. There are so many reading programs out there. Every parent and every child will like different things and find success at it. That being said, some may really like this style, I don't personally. I like Leap Frog videos, Leap Pad ( discontinued but great!), Hooked on Phonics ( the ones with the DVD not the CD Rom versions), other phonics videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, inconsistent, confusing,","review":"In a few words, I found this book very inconsistent and confusing. Sight words are ignored completely. Too many funny symbols that could have been dealt with just one type. There is text that you are supposed to follow(the parent part) which is rather useless. I kept getting sidetracked by my daughter while trying to read it they way they suggest. Why all this regimentation? The pages are intimidating for a child. The stories in most cases are too long for child just starting out. There are better books out there. Look for them. I dont suggest this book, as you wont finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I wonder how so many people liked this book?! I guess if you want to teach sight reading, it may work. We needed a phonics book, as my kids were trying to sound out words and this book \\"skips\\" over letters. You know what I mean if you look inside it. Much better is \\"Phonics Pathways\\" for teaching to read and has fun and easy games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated.","review":"The book is definitely not what I thought it would be. It was too hard to follow along and I definitely couldn't get my son to sit with me for 5 minutes let alone 15 minutes. The workbooks you find in Walgreens for PreK work a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"I bought the Your Baby Can Read package and I was surprise to learn that it does not teach children phonics... This book actually teach children to read. It's just realy dry reading. I have enjoyed reading it. Now, I will need to practice the teaching techniques that's described in this book--that's the hard part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"My 4 year old son is now on lesson 18 and looks forward to each lesson. He was hooked after lesson 1. It is so easy for them to learn. As long as you follow exactly what the book says you can't go wrong. I have highly recommended this book to all my friends and give the same recommendation to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schools should use this method!!!!!","review":"Yes, I will agree with other reviewers of the book... it IS boring, for the both the child and the parent, but that is only because the author has made reading sooooo easy! Learning to read can be very frustrating and subsequently children are turned off to reading. This book makes it anything but frustrating! The step by step method is so simple. By the 20th lesson my daughter was so excited to sit down and do it because she COULD READ! Which is very exciting for any child. I HIGHLY recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Experience!","review":"I had a wonderful time working with my four-year-old using this book. The lessons were simple to teach and very logical. They truly took only 15-20 minutes each. She learned very thoroughly how to sound out words. My daughter enjoyed learning to write her letters as well. And she loved to go back and \\"teach\\" me the lessons.A year later, 6 months after finishing the 100 lessons, she entered kindergarten and could already read. Her reading skills continued to increase since she had a strong phonics foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for ADHD and Developmentally Delayed Kids","review":"My ADHD son reached the second grade by memorizing books and faking reading. This book was the only thing I found that helped him to truly connect letters with their sounds. With this book he learned how to sound out words for the first time. This book allowed my son a success in reading he had never experienced before. The lessons are short and easy for a parent to follow. By breaking down words sound by sound it allows dyxlexic, developmentally delayed and other challenged beginners quick success. I highly recommend it for any frustrated parent whose child needs to master these basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for parents who don't know where to start.","review":"For a parent with an education degree behind them, i would say this book is not very interesting.For those who are at a loss where to start with learning letters, phonemes and words - this book it good.It spells out what to do every step of the way.For us - I read it, and could see that we had done all those sort of things already. Yet, I could also see the benefit. If I was starting reading from the beginning with someone, i think this program is a good one to work through.Teach your child to read in 20 lessons... is much less 'busy' on the page, and so i think the sort that someone who already knows how to teach reading will find more helpful.However, this course leaves nothing to chance. They have thought of every concept quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best so far","review":"My three year old is on lesson 30. I've recently decided to cut the lessons in half. I'm teaching him to read because he knows the letters and sounds. It's just an appropriate next step. This book isn't easy for a three year old, but he is learning to read. We are considering starting over at the beginning to put the wind back into his sails. It's exciting to learn to read. He sometimes says \\"Thank you mommy for teaching me to read.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Well structured, but boring","review":"We liked the program, at first. But now (lesson 41) it's such a chore that we're taking time off from it, going back to more mommy read-alouds, and looking for something a little more enjoyable for my 5-year-old. Either a new curriculum or I revamp this one with some creativity. I like the layout and the consistent building of sounds, as well as the easy-to-follow teacher instructions. BUT... we just started a math program, too, and I realized how much more she's enjoying that, with its variety of approaches to the repetitive activity. There are lots of different ways to practice counting to five - there have to be more creative ways to practice our sounds and simple words, right?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"My 5 year old begged me to teach her to read this past year. I started her with a boxed curriculum and she hated it! A friend recommended this book to us and it made such a difference. My only complaint is that it is scripted and dry. However, with a little creativity (we typed the stories up and made books, made games out of the word practice, supplemented with the other curric and easy readers from the library, etc.)we made it fun. She just completed the book and I feel she is ahead of the game going into 1st grade. She is confident and loves to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to help you child learn to read","review":"Very easy and quick lessons to teach your child to read. The books provides the instruction that you need to give to your child to help them learn. My son was really wanting to read at age 4 and he could read some, but after I purchased this book I really noticed his reading skills improve. He is in kindergarten now and in the highest reading level in his class."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's a READER!","review":"I want to start by saying that this program should not be used by a child who already knows how to read and is having trouble...it's used to actually teach a child to read by the assumption that they are not familiar with sounds. That said, my child was reading words in less than 30 days using this book. He could easily finish a Dr. Seuss book with little/no help at all. His eyes actually glowed with the excitement of a new sound being introduced and it became fun for both of us to see his progress. You have to be consistent with the lessons but what I like about it is that it tells you (the parent) EXACTLY what to say while instructing your child. I can tell you as a parent that if you are willing to take the 20 minutes a day and use this book, your child will be reading in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and easy way to teach your child to read","review":"We are going at a slow pace, but this book really works.

Although it's well made, the three-wheel set-up is unstable, and the saw will tilt with a fairly light touch. The swiveling wheel does not have a swivel lock, so even when everything is locked down, the saw will still shift unexpectedly. I drilled and tapped holes for heavy eye-bolts in the corners opposite the fixed wheels. The eye-bolts form outriggers that steady the saw and compensate for any uneveness in the floor. This is something that the maker should have provided. I'd recommend instead the Grizzly Shop-Fox mobile base which has four wheels and outriggers and costs less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat Material","review":"Good songs, but What Hits released in 1992 contains every one of these songs plus more.

The tang snapped off with a very light jolt within 15-20 min of use roughing in a piece of wood (this time includes two breaks to touch up the edge with a hone). Since the tool set was used a few minutes before breaking, per Amazon's return policy, it can't e returned despite being a faulty tool.Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set of tools for a beginner","review":"I just recently got into wood turning and I enjoy it very much to say the least. The PSI 6 piece HSS turning set is a good addition to my shop.Pros: Includes the basics for all of the basic turning needs. Handles feel sturdy and are connected to the blade well. Blades are holding strong so far. Hold an edge well. Easy to grind a new edge with a grinder.Cons: Case is very cheap feeling. It came with a giant gash on the top of it, and to be nit picky, the hinges are on the wrong side. My Gouge blade seemed to be warped slightly. (I dont know if it is to be that way or if its defective.)Overall, the few minor problems are outweighed by its pros. It is a good set, includes all that youd need to get going, they feel sturdy and hold an edge well.

It's that special feeling you only get once in a blue moon when you hear or feel something that is truly enamoring. Featuring Birds will undoubtedly give you that feeling.

But after repeated play, the album doesn't seem to have the backbone that it once did. Maybe it's the overexposure...The album kicks of with a bang: 'Our Happiness is Guaranteed.' This is a sonic masterpiece: dissonance and a frantic backbeat. This momentous opening is follwed by an equally stunning 'I Never Want to See You Again.' This might be the follow up to 'In the First Place' from R&B. The band explores more sonic possibilities: rich acoustic guitars, 'fruity' organs, and crisp guitars--even backwards guitar on 'Tomorrow You'll Hide.' The second highlight of this album might be the wistful 'You F--ked Yourself.' This is Dylan's 'Idiot Wind' retold through an overexposure to Daniel Johnston.The album closes with an interesting sonic collage: 'Only Success Can Fail Me Now.' And you never want this song to end.

For real songs about relationships listen to Afghan Whigs or Sebadoh or, the best band in the world for that sort of thing, The Wedding Present. The music here is also EXTREMELY limited and boring (which makes sense since it's a two piece of drums and keyboard).

I see other similar products ranging above $50 up to $200. It's a great buy if you don't have to wear them all the time.The material is thick and they fit comfortably.

A lot of the artwork was 'fuzzy' to see. Almost like a camera that was out of focus. The meanings in the lwb were hardly helpful for the minors and the lwb did state that this deck is for experts. Overall a good deck but be prepared for some graphic nudity and perhaps some almost gorey pics. No I don't go for the swords being a bright red fire suit and I don't buy into the staves being such a dreary air suit.

The saw went together easily and is stable for a contractor saw but I still added additional bolts to the fence for rigidity.

However, like so many, he took a wrong turn in the second half of the book toward a future fulfillment. Many commentaries and books on eschatology fall into this error because of the failure to understand that the new covenant was fully manifest after the destruction of the temple in 70 AD. Saying that, \\"its full manifestation has been deferred,\\" pg 105, is the same as saying that Christ work is incomplete, which is not a biblical teaching. I would recommend the book to Christians who want a better understanding of the church and Israel but be careful not to be led down the \\"second coming\\" will complete everything teaching.

The first half of the book did keep me interested but always wanting for more, more about him & his wife and a lot less about Max Frisch et al. I was also put-off by his constant references to himself and how important he was.

Sorry folks, I just could not enjoy this story at all. Even given the medieval time frame and the heroine's plight; this story was creepy and demoralizing. Granted, some of the \\"love\\" scenes were hot, but they're supposed to be in a romance novel. The hero is mean spirited and I was never convinced that he loved Rowena. I have no complaints with the author's writing skills, but the whole concept of this story is one that should be passed by."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just wrong...","review":"I haven't been able to finish this book.

I don't understand how people find this book to be \\"Johanna Lindsey's best\\". Personally I don't see how rape between the hero and heroine can be romantic...there is nothing romantic about this book so far, and personally I don't know how it will turn out to be romantic in the end. If I had to rate Johanna Lindsey by this single book alone, I simply would convince anyone who reads her to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"unpleasant reading experience","review":"Do not mistake this book for a romance novel. It isn't.I agree with the other bad reviews. This book reads like a study of stockholm syndrome. The main problem is that the lead male character is such a jerk!!! If you like your men overbearing to the point of slavery, then you might enjoy this. Seriously, he would make a good villian in another book. Also, if you are thinking about getting into BSDM reads, this might actually be a good transition read.However, if you like the cliche romance novel hero who is overpowering, yet redeemingly charming in some way, you will HATE this book. Warrick has no redeeming qualities. He is so bent on revenge that he become single minded with it. It was an unpleasant reading experience for me. I like romance novels, but I don't like rape and I don't like slavery. I also don't like when sex somehow wipes the slate clean, making horrible behavior forgiveable. Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've read every book by Johanna Lindsey and this one is perhaps one of my least favorites. I have nothing against bondage, when its done willingly. There was nothing realistic about this book and the characters were not very likeable. Torrid sex, forced or unforced, is not why I pick of a romance book, its the interplay between characters, sex should be a natural and exciting product of their relationship. What little relationship is demonstrated between the characters in this book is shallow at best and I did not find it entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Lindsey!","review":"I know some objected to the beginning with what Rowena did to Warrick,but it was the times. All in all it's one of my favorite of her books. Lots of steamy love scenes. I recommend this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the best","review":"There is not much romance in this book. It's all about sex. I was disapointed with this book. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind steamy sex scenes but I like for there to be a romantic plot going on also. Don't read this book unless you only want to read about sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best to skip it","review":"This book brought back horrifying memories of Lindsey's earlier work, A Pirates Love. Not only is it not interesting, but it's hard to believe that the characters like, let alone love each other. It's not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not a 5 star!","review":"I guess my first reason for holding back on a top rating would be the subject matter - it no way offended me - how Warwick was raped at the beginning but seeing the male have that done to him just goes against what I personally enjoy in a romantic book. The way he deals with Rowena afterward however I did feel was justified and her response was intriguing. Books of this time period are not often my favorite so it takes a good writer like Lindsey to bring me into the story - and she is such an amazing writer that I often feel the depths in her books - no matter the time period. These characters were so true to the period and I loved how she was able to show a tenderness in the fierce Warwick even though he was a ruthless man of the period. Rowena was a good balance for Warwick and it was wonderful watching the love develop between these two in spite of their circumstances!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definate thirller keeps you guessing to the last page","review":"if you're tired of fairy tales that you know would never take place in real life then this book is for you.

She will be forced to marry an old man and when an hier is not produced her greedy step brother finds a man at the locall inn and forces Rowena to rape him. Her step brother makes the mistake of picking the wrong man. how wrong? well his worst enimy, Warrick. Rowena fears that her step brother will kill him so she lets him go. Warrick come back to her and makes her pay dearly for what she did to him. What Rowenda refuses to tell him costs her dearly. Now she finds her self in Warrick's dungin and carrying his cild! Johanna Lindsey is a ginous. this book keeps you wondering what will happen to the last page. this is definatly no fairy tale but a situation that you can extually imagin happening long ago! A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only INSANE people rate this below 5 stars!!!","review":"This is my absolute most favorite book ever written! Anyone who would give this book a rating lower than a 5 is completely insane!!! Anyhow those who rated this with 1 star need to get a life and stop criticizing a great book! Yeah, the whole idea of rape is disgusting, but the book in it's entirety is beautifully written and challenges a very creative and OPEN mind! Some people just need to lighten up a bit and give this book the chance it so highly deserves. I give Johanna Lindsey all the praise she deserves for writing this masterpiece!!! For all those closed-minded people out there...maybe you should just quit reading books altogether or keep your negative opinions to yourself!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike Anything You've Ever Read Before...","review":"Loved it from start to finish.

I've read every Johanna Lindsey at least twice if not more, even this one...I think I've given it three chances. Yes, it does seem to grow on me after such a time BUT I still find it incredibly absurd. Granted, most of Lindseys are...and I love so many...but this one really does take the cake for being quite unbelievable. I just found the whole concept of her tying him up to 'have her way with him' and him gaining revenge in the same manner ridiculous. Not Johanna's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance?","review":"This was not romantic!!! I can't believe the good reviews this got. There is nothing romantic about rape, revenge and cruelty. The heroine did wrong, but the so called hero really went overboard punishing her. Theres no tender feelings ever revealed. Everyone else is excused and rewarded for their part in the deceit and abuse. Rowena is reviled, humiliated, and threatened with physical abuse at every turn. That is in addition to his unwanted forced sexual attacks. It's enough to make anyone swoon. How romantic!!!! REALLY! Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"body tingling","review":"This is the first time I read her novel. It is very original and the chemistry between the two characters was sizzling.

I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal!","review":"This is the first Johanna Lindsey novel I've read, and it will probably be the last. I didn't find anything \\"romantic\\" about this book. It was absolutely horrific! A young virgin is forced to rape a man, because her evil step-brother is holding her mother hostage. Then, when the man she rapes is freed, he kidnaps her, and proceeds to get his \\"revenge.\\" Of course, the young virgin never TELLS him she had to do it or her mother would have been killed. Oh, no! THAT would be unacceptable! ARRGH! This book made me want to scream in frustration! I don't read romances exclusively, but I do like them as an escape once in awhile. Torrid sex is fine; but enduring two forms of rape to save your mother's life is not sexy. I'd pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Sick Stuff","review":"I really like Johanna Lindsey's books in general but was horrified by the content of this S&M B&D rip off. I have never put a book in the trash but that is where I put Prisoner. The \\"hero\\" of the book tortures a pregnant woman... holds her captive in a dungeon, subjects her to humiliation and bondage then shows her no trust or love when he professes to have fallen in love with her. The darkest thing is she takes him back and forgives all under the guise of ... Oh it only means that he loves me.... Sounds like battered Women's Syndrome to me! This is a DONT READ. Try some of her other books like savage Thunder or Angel if you want a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!","review":"I'm a huge JL fan, but her mind must have been in the gutter when she wrote this one. How anyone can find this book tolerable is beyond me. The characters were bitter, and there was nothing at all sexy or romantic about these forced love scenes. A total disgrace. It took no imagination on JL's part to create this one because there was absolutely no plot to speak of. Rape is rape and is never ever justified.One thing about JL - at times she goes too far in making the main male character an absolute pig. Warrick is certainly that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent!","review":"I didn't enjoy this book. What attracted me to this book in the first place was the synopsis, so I decided to read it. I was so disappointed! There were too many violent and sexual scenes, but I forced myself to finish the book anyway. I prefer a story with more romance than violence and sex. I have to say that, overall, I like books by Johanna Lindsey. I suggest reading \\"Hearts Aflame\\" by Johanna Lindsey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical romance","review":"This is why you read a Johanna Lindsey book - it has all the drama and romance you expect to find.

The Aquaduo appears to be a bit better in construction; certainly the valves make virtually no noise, unlike the Raindrips. It is also quite large: my faucet is mounted low and the included quick-connects left no room for me to attach the hose. They also have a very narrow passage that restricts water volume. Without them, you are left with a non-standard sized outlet, so I replaced them with brass adapters from H@me Dep@t. Programming is a bit odd, as other reviewers have noted, but it's not impossible; works fine for the basic programming I need. I took another reviewer's advice and covered the Aquaduo with a ziplock bag left open at the bottom.

Nope, everything has to be done up to midnight.Eventually got it working - two pipes, each one once a day for 3 hours (95% of all users will want this type of simple programming) - push the buttons a total of 124 times to achieve this!And then there is this little piece of advice: make sue it is in the shade... direct sunlight overheats it and it fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving \\"dual timer\\"","review":"I purchased two units of this \\"dual timer\\" since its review was good.

The display on the Claber is easy to read and the setting mode does not change in a wink of a second so you have time to set the timer to the correct setting. The Clabber settings worked as I programed them. The threads are well defined on the faucet and hose connections so it was easy to attach (even to a faucet I need to almost stand on my head to attach to the faucet since it is sitting under a deck).

This was my first Pentax...and the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, minor nuances","review":"Great value; dependable product. Shake reduction causes longer delay in snapping the shutter, but can be easily turned off if it's bothersome. No direct viewfinder, like on other Pentax cameras, so the LCD screen must be used to frame the shot. Nice, new recharge tray makes it easy to charge battery...now, if they just combined it with a computer USB port for downloading, that would be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I purchased this camera as the first and only digital camera I have owned. I did a lot of research and found that this one had all the features I wanted +, and it was at a really excellent price. It arrived quite fast and I was able to begin using it almost immediately. I love the ability to do some manipulation of the pictures after taken, and being able to load them into my computer and do further adjustment as I want. This camera has lived up to my expectations and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little travel camera","review":"If your looking for lots of features, excellent image quality, small compact pocket design - this is the camera - with anti-shake and movie mode - big bright screen, the only thing missing is a small viewfinder - but it's not totaly necessary.

Light weight and loaded with fun features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Features BUT FAULTY CCD sensor","review":"I really like this Camera, HOWEVER, the CCD had a dead spot on it from Day one, it's visible in the same place on all darkish pictures/video as a bright white pixel visible on all media, whether it's the camera's LCD, viewed on a PC screen, a TV or even prints. VERY annoying.I am still waiting for feedback from Pentax after a week.

I'm going to file a complaint with the consumer protection agency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This camera is ok, but not great.It takes sooo long from the time of the flash to the actual time of the picture, your subject has already moved and you miss that great shot!!I took the camera to Walt Disney World and out of 3500-4000 photos only 10 or so were good shots and those were of things that didnt move!! (like the castle) The shots that you actually get are good quality but I like to take a lot of pic's and I dont have time to waste with making sure everyone stands still for 2-3 seconds (or more) after the flash!I am saving money right now to buy the Canon EOS Rebel XTi. It will take 8-10 pic's in the same time as the Pentax A10's 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera Great Price","review":"Good Zoom properties and antishake works really well.

It does take crisp photos but it take way too long to flash and the subjects have to stand still long. I would not recommend it for sporting events or indoors or night shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Camera ever!","review":"Keeps intermittently turns off. Sometimes stays off days at a time.

It is easy to operate, offers an amazing array of options and small and light enough to carry in my purse all the time, so I am ready for any photo opportunity. I have recommended to anyone who is looking for a great camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"my husband loves this band","review":"I bought this for my husband.

If you are interested in showing your Boxer, this is THE book for you! Approximately 70% of the content is in regards to preparing, rearing and showing a championship Boxer. Great pictures display a complete range of gorgeous, beautiful boxers from fawn to brindle, cropped & floppy ears, of all ages and physiques."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Baby Cookbook, Tasty and Nutritious Meals for the Whole","review":"This book is awful. Just about every recipe requires shopping at a specialty store for ingredients. Also a good portion of the book is taken up with the diary of the author's daughters first 2 years of eating which wasn't very informative. If you are looking for simple, typical supermarket ingredient recipes look someplace else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend this unless your child will eat anything","review":"I was so disappointed with this book. When I flipped to the recipe section, there really wasn't anything my children would eat in there. Stelline, sturgeon, \\"arabian stew\\", carrot raita, bulgur pilaf, asparagus omelette? Who eats this? I wouldn't even make these recipes for myself! There was also a heavy indian flair (curried foods) through the recipes. I'm sorry, but this just isn't for kids. And then there's the 50 pages of diary about her daughter's life in the middle of the book. How does this fit in?I was looking for a book that would provide quick, easy to fix, nutritious meals that my kids would eat. I don't have time to shop in specialty stores for hard-to-find items. This would be a good book for a stay at home parent who has time on their hands to do all the specialty shopping. But for working parents who are looking for a quick, easy meal to make with items on the pantry shelf, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"I was looking for a book on preparing homemade baby food that was easy to read, straight forward and had simple recipes. This isn't it!I was very disappointed in this book. The chapters are not well organized and the recipes are far from simple. I found myself getting lost in the pages as well the ingredient lists. The recipes were unrealistic for our family. They are time consuming and the ingredients are not things we usually purchase (ie Lamb). The diary in the middle of the book which documents the feeding of their child from 6 months to 2 years old is completely out of place and a waste of space. Overall the book is not 'user friendly' and I would not waste my money on it.I would recommend \\"Mommy Made and Daddy too!\\" as a more pratical resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against medical advice!","review":"As a practicing family physician, with a spouse who is a nurse, I was shocked at the advice given in this book. Many of the recommended dietary additions go completely against the accepted standards of the American Academy of Pediatrics. For example, whole milk and cottage cheese are recommended by the authors at a far too early age. I returned it immediately and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this book!","review":"I am glad that I received \\"Mommy Made and Daddy Too\\" before this book, or I may have actually taken Knight's advice on how to feed an infant. It seems that she introduces foods too fast (i'm not a doctor). Something very disturbing is that from 6 mos to 12 mos she writes \\"each meal should be accompanied by nursing, formula, or milk\\". I have seen nowhere else that cow's milk is acceptable three times a day instead of formula or nursing. I also didn't like the diary. It wasn't a true diary in that you didn't learn how she introduced foods to her daughter. Instead you saw a meal every now and then and something about how she taught her daughter to sleep in her crib by letting her cry herself to sleep. Not my kind of mothering all around!! I also question whether many toddlers would eat cold avocado soup or shrimp with almonds."},{"rating":"1","title":"The recipes are not for an everyday mom like me!","review":"I found that in order to create some of the recipes listed in the book I would have to make a special trip to the market. I found the recipes eccentric and not at all what I was looking for. I was expecting a book that contained healthy, easy recipes for an everyday mom like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Williams Brothers, Harmony Hotel","review":"I've been a fan of Andy and David Williams for 26 years now and I still love their music. I love Can't Cry Hard Enough, Broken Things, Love Is The Language among so many others. I can truly say that they've never composed a song that I didn't like. David has a clear, soulful voice, stong with compassionate lyrics that go right to my heart. Their sweet harmonies complete the songs. God bless you both to help me see through the dark and feel with my heart. Bravo to the Williams Brothers! May we hear from them for many more years to come. Love from LJ.If anyone can give me any information about them, please e-mail me. Thanks with all my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only own ten CD's, this should be one.","review":"I have the MEET ANDY AND DAVID album from the 70's and was curious of how they were doing 20 years later. It is probably my most played CD of hundreds. I have bought several as gifts for family and friends. If you want a relaxing, enjoyable CD, this is the one to own. The messages and harmonies are inspiring and relaxing. The whole CD is addicting from the first play."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Williams brothers music","review":"I have been a fan of Andy and Davd Williams since I was 9 years old.

Incase you are reading this Andy and David thank you so much for your music. Love from Clare"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, but very cool...","review":"This album is not what you'd think 80s music to be. It is definitely off-beat and unlike anything else in my 80s CD collection. However, it is excellent music (if a bit simplistic), that will catch your ear and demand repeated listenings. Their follow-up album, \\"Song\\", just wasn't as good and suffered from a lack of creativity compared to \\"Life's Hard and Then You Die\\". This disc, however, is recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DRIVING AWAY FROM HOME","review":"It was in 1986 on the french TV. Those 2 guys seemed so different and when i listened 2 their first album it was like the first time i saw the most beautiful girl ...magical moment. their 2 albums are wonderful and you have to buy this incredible english music"},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I say","review":"I bought my first \\"life's hard and then you die\\" in 1995, in Munich. It certainly is one of the best CD's in my collection. Since then I found anouther copy here in Johannesburg and immediatly bought it for a friend, all I knew was that the CD had been out of print for a few years. Check out \\"ed's funky diner\\" great track. a magnificant album! good to see that almost 42 000 copies have been sold through Amazon.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have loved this one for decades...","review":"I can't imagine why this album didn't have far more success back in the day. It was one of my favorites of the 80's, and remains a favorite in 2007. I still have the LP, but updating to the CD was long overdue. There's lots of great fun and deep feeling here ... treat yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever made.","review":"I am quite pleased to see that there are others in the world aware of the existence of this disc as it is unlike anything that came before or after. Genius. As per usual, A&M did a dreadful job of promoting them and Song did not even receive a domestic U.S. release. One can only hope they intend to return with more music at some point. Until then, buy two - one for you and another for someone you love. Or like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book if you can get it","review":"As a huge baseball fan and avid reader of sports books, I was a little skeptical about the quality of this book when I found it at an estate sale. I bought it anyway, and started reading it when I got home. I read the entire book that evening, and read it twice the following day. It is that hilariously funny, and very well written. I can't say enough good things about this book. Mr. Perry's description of his home life, and characterizations of the umpires he would become intimate with over the years are wonderful. This book rates as the best biography of a baseball player ever. Nowhere is humor and readability combined with the history and making of great ballplayers. Get this book and read it, and I should add, no baseball book I have read deserves another printing more than \\"Me and the Spitter\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hurler Who Saved Baseball In Cleveland","review":"The autobiography of Gaylord Perry was published when he was winning games for the dreadful Cleveland teams in the 1970s. Perry was a fan favorite and basically the major gate attraction in the cavernous Cleveland Municipal Stadium.As an aside, I wonder what the fate of the club would have been without Perry. There were rumors abound that the franchise was destined to be sold to business interests in New Orleans due to fan apathy.The book is an honest look at his life on and off the field. There was a growing market for baseball books \\"written\\" by players during this era, with a focus on - of course - the New York Yankees.If you are interested in this period of baseball - and want to get away from the Bronx Zoo - then Me and the Spitter is your diamond gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful","review":"Maybe this isn't representative of Madredeus' work, but it is a beautiful album. The vocals are still as stunning with an interesting mix of electronic sounds. I began to like Madredeus' other albums after hearing this one because no amount of remixing can take away the beautiful, haunting quality of many of their songs, and this album only seems to enhance them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Madredeus","review":"I absolutely love Madredeus, so of course as soon as their new album came out I bought it sight unseen. Boy was I ever disappointed when I got it home. The whole foundation of Madredeus, that they have nurtured over the years, is their unique acoustic style and old-world charm. In this album, that history comes tumbling down in a cacophony of clips and snips of noise. The succulent voice of Teresa Salgueiro is savagely mutilated by a lifeless machine, and all that remains of the beauty of this group is their name, which in my eyes is now woefully tarnished. If you love Madredeus, do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS CD! Perhaps the poor sales will send them a message to never do this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"This single is so cool. What makes it cool is that it has the Music Video for So Real on it.The Tracks are 1)So Real 2)Candy (Wade Robson Remix) 3)Not Too Young 4)So Real (Wade Robson Remix) 5)So Real Music Video (Video Clip) Weblinks Are Also Included!!Go & Buy it it's worth every Penny!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"So Real\\" Is Very Spunky","review":"Yes. I was disappointed when I discovered that the single, \\"So Real\\", was only going to be released in Australia. It's a good Pop song & is the title-track of Mandy's first CD. The lyrics are cute (even though they are corny at the same time) & are catchy to mainly pre-teens & younger teens. However, it's easy to tell they're written by adults. Even though Mandy's voice is full of youth in this song, it showed her explosive talent. Beautiful tune & amazing harmonies & adlibs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uugggghhhhhh........","review":"Yuck! Okay, so 'Candy' was kinda catchy. Big deal! Mandy Moore can't sing worth anything and I'd take Christina Agulera's music over her any day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loves Planet of Love","review":"I have been wanting this album for years and I'm really glad it is finally available again. Any fan of Jim Lauderdale will love this earlier album, and listen to it again and again. Some of these songs are the first ones I heard from Mr Lauderdale, and I've been enjoying his music ever since. You won't be disappointed, except for wanting it to have been a longer album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Fooling Around","review":"Not technically a debut (seePoint of No Return), this was still Lauderdale's first published album. While later albums were better (seePretty Close to the TruthandEvery Second Counts), this is still a great album. Different from anything else (though with some similarity to producer Rodney Crowell's best work), this album showcased Lauderdale's terrific songwriting skills (well recognized by more successful singers), as well as his own strong vocal ability.\\"The King of Broken Hearts\\" is just a great song (and not at all the schlocky country standard treatment the title suggests), and \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\\" is a more up-tempo close second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party Up Here With DMX","review":"stop!, drop!, open up shop!!!!!!!!!!!! this single is super hot, party up has smooth rap beats combined with defined rap lyrics, a definate winner!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hype and slammin.","review":"I may not like explicit lyrics, but when it comes to clean versions, radio edits, and instrumentals, i am definitely all for it.

Had to purchase valcrow first thing. Luckily, I owe a sewing machine, but even with that I spent 2 additional hours sewing by hand to make it somewhat work.

The LP varies from Skacore to Hardcore and is awesome from start to finish. Ska Wars, Cousin Cleotis and The Neverlution stand out. I've seen them 3 times, and can't get enough of them - well worth a listen of you're into anything to do with ska."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic tale of trans-continental redemption","review":"The plot is like one of the great Victorian novels, although mainly set in Australia and Thailand. It's not at all subtle, but with a storyline that takes in an illegitimate daughter, drug-smuggling, Japanese treatment of prisoners of war, and Thai executions of criminals, and Australian 1980s TV production values, what can you expect?I have to say that this two-DVD set is a lot longer than the version I saw on the BBC in the early 1990s, which was broadcast over two evenings.The other surprise for me is the fairly appalling synthesizer soundtrack. Clearly I had been so gripped by the storyline that I didn't notice the music on first viewing.For most Britons, this was their first glimpse of Nicole Kidman. Even then, the ambition of the actress shone through.And finally, I suspect that, if Bangkok Hilton hadn't been made, the plot of Bridget Jones Two would have taken a different turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must see","review":"a must see for all nicole-kidman-fans. weird miniserie from the time when nobody knew her outside australia, when she was young, fresh and totally overtalented and yet untouched by cosmetic surgery. still very 80ies, worst soundtrack on earth, otherwise a rare jewel in kidman's portfolio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Food","review":"Being a person with Type 2 diabetes, I have to eat whole grains.

Boredom set in every time I picked it up. I felt Kay was not a sympathetic character, I found her to be a very weak minded character. This abuse began before her marriage, and there was no one holding a gun to her head to marry him. She had money, family and friends who would have supported her in not marrying him.The actual story takes what seems like years to get to. Too wordy and drawn out. The entire story could have been told in about 50 pages...however this story didn't even become remotely interesting until about page 50.As a Criminal Justice major and advocate for battered women, I've never encountered a woman so non-assertive. If you'd like to rewrite the story, I'd love to help you by making it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is an undiscovered classic","review":"If you as a hard rock fan have ANY serious interest in the galloping Iron Maiden/Helloween/early Queensryche sound, this is going to be the most fantastic c.d. you ever purchase. Song after song of well-produced, perfectly executed material. A Bruce Dickenson-styled vocalist, blazing Yngwie superfast (yet melodic) leads, and wonderful harmonies - strength, power and beauty. A shame this Danish band broke up a few years ago (wonder why their final c.d. is not sold - could be it was not as popular, and it certainly wasn't as good as this). \\"Vague Visions\\" is Jackal's masterpiece, produced by Eric Greif, and you should grab it while it is still on offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"If you loved \\"Blues on the Bayou\\" you'll love this: same band for the most part (B.B.'s touring band), same idea (stripped-down, \\"live\\" sounding disc produced by B.B. and featuring mostly new songs), generous track selection, energetic playing. B.B. may be past his prime in both playing and singing, but it hardly matters. This is a strong set with committed, passionate music. While a contemporary like John Lee Hooker is mostly coasting, playing the same songs over and over and relying on guests, B.B.'s approach is marvelously encouraging. \\"I Got to Leave This Woman\\" gets the disc off to a sensational start. \\"Don't Go No Farther\\" and a couple of B.B.'s own songs are nice. When he sings, on A.C. Reed's \\"I'm in the Wrong Business\\": \\"I'm in the wrong business, swear I ain't lyin', I stay hungry, broke all the time,\\" you have trouble believing him. You're just fine, B.B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...","review":"Let me start this by saying I love B.B. King. I have about 8 of his recordings. Blues on the Bayue is better in my opinion though. Why? Better songs, less bad notes, better feel. I like these two that he did his self and they do have a good night club sound, I just thought he needed to spend a little more time on the recording as well as material. Some of the lines were cliche....Dave"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of the arrangements","review":"As pointed out by another reviewer there is a lot of use of the thumb hooking over the top of the guitar. If your hand isn't big enough or your guitar has a wide/thick neck, you will have to end up rewriting the fingering for almost every tune. Actually even when the thumb isn't used, I'm still not a big fan of the suggested fingerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand adventures!","review":"Mid-level adventures abound in the forest kingdom. This compilation of modules set in the kingdom of Cormyr are wonderfully layed out. They have been so put together that one could play them in any orde, or leave out any one of their choosing and still feel as though everything was accomplished. They draw on all the skills needed to survive, deductive, martial and diplomatic. A wonderful product, I hope to see more of this quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"DTS doesn't mean quad","review":"I agree with Mario Yrun's excellent review. This DTS CD is much worse than the original stereo LP. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking - the original stereo version is now on CD!","review":"I have to agree with some of the other reviews here. I'd be willing to bet this is the old quad mix, as others have suggested (this album was released in the heyday of quadraphonic sound back in the 70s), so it still has some value to hardcore Edgar fans (like me). But beyond that, this 5.1 (4.0?) mix is a disappointing version of an otherwise classic recording.But the good news is, the original stereo version is now available right here at Amazon.com (among other places) as a Japanese import from Sony Music, and it sounds wonderful! Woo Hoo! So keep searching (ASIN: B00005ULH5) - it's here somewhere, and it's worth the search! What a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible 5.1 mix","review":"Of all DTS 5.1 encoded CD's, this is by far the worst. There is no center channel or subwoofer signal...my guess is that, rather than remixing a 5.1 CD from an original 40 track master, this was cheaply lifted from an 70's era \\"quadraphonic\\" recording. As most 5.1 systems have small satellites for the four corner speakers, they can't handle bass at all. An incredible disappointment, the sound is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"DTS- Not clearly marked","review":"I opened this product before realizing it was DTS and wouldn't play for me- a rip-off as fas as I'm concerned. These types of CDs should be VERY CLEARLY MARKED so there is no mistake about what the customer is buying. I was, and am, very unhappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best planning tool to have for Oahu!","review":"If you are planning a trip to Honolulu/Waikiki or the rest of the island of Oahu, throw away all your other maps. This is the only one you will need. Pick the attraction you would like to visit and this map will tell you where to catch the bus, the number of the bus, where to get off the bus, how to get to the attraction once you leave the bus, and where to catch the bus for your return trip. Only a human personal guide could be better. The map is easy to read and packed full of information. I highly recommend it for your trip to Oahu as it will save you valuable time in planning your sightseeing. Michael Brien also has maps for other major cities of the world with the same easy to follow direction, please check them out too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation","review":"This item has been wrongly labeled as a paperback book. It should be better labeled as a map. And as a map it is extremely overpriced.

I was not amused when I received this item in the mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"A map, NOT a book","review":"I also felt misled by the way this map was marketed. As a map, it is probably a good one as some of the reviewers that used it indicated. It is NOT a book. It is priced like one and I feel ripped-off. When it came, I couldn't even remember ordering something like it and couldn't understand why I would have paid such an exorbitant price for a map. Coming back to the Amazon site to research how this error occurred, I realized that the error was not on my part. I paid for a BOOK because it was presented as such. I got a MAP, not the sales pitch that was given for the product. A product may be good, but if it is misrepresented, you feel that you have been sold a bill of goods. It is not a guide as one thinks of guides, but rather a tourist map."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Brein's Guide to Honolulu & Oahu By the Bus","review":"What a waste of money!

I'm a RW buff and hardly ever, and never in school's histroy books was this subject touched upon and to me it really had an astounding effect on the war. I didn't know that people in the 13 states feared for their lives when the British offered freedom to the slaves if they joined up with them. And then after the long war, slave owners came up from the south looking for them and dragging them out of bed. The story was to the point with a lot of interesting personal stories. I think this book should be put in all schools and this side of history should not be avoided. I suspected Jefferson was a jerk long ago and this confirms it even more. All these leaders of our country spouting words of liberty and owning hundreds of slaves. How could they have thought it was part of God's plan and design? ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I purchased one of these regulators when I installed a new compressor. It lasted about 9 months and then the inadequate plastic design simply failed. If you use one of these regulators, you can't leave any pressure on the plastic housing inards (when not in use) because it will fatigue and then shatter apart. I found pieces spread all over my garage where the compressor is installed. And when it breaks, the spring, etc from inside the knob go flying all over the place. There are many other reviews else-where that describe the same situation. This regulator should not be sold until the design is corrected.If you look at the plastic threaded ring, as you can see in the picture, it does nothing. I am not sure but maybe its suppose to have a lip that helps to hold the knob base to the metal housing, but the design doesn't permit that. The result is the internal spring constantly puts pressure on a plastic part that can not bear the stress over any length of time, then it breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice regulator","review":"Well made regulator that works well.

I have adjusted it maybe 5 times. About a week ago the pressure started creeping up on it's own and the over pressure release would continually hiss. I have verified that the gauge itself is fine. The regulator is what has failed after less than a year of just sitting there doing nothing.Additionally, this is one of those units that you have to overadjust if you set the pressure too high. What I mean by that is that if you happen to pass the mark for the pressure you want, you can to turn it counterclockwise a good 5-10 turns before the pressure actually starts to drop, then turn it back up again to get the pressure you were after. That's a pretty minor thing though... just something to be aware of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Cheap","review":"This is actually a Kobalt 221016 3/8(or is it campbell making kobalt... whatever)I've gone through a couple now (I was swapping out parts)but I'm going to have to bite the bullet and tear my air plumbingapart and put in something decent.One exploded - one leaked - two fracturedI'm going to try the Ingersoll Rand R37231-600-VSUpdate: The photo changes depending on the day of the week I guess.I reviewed the H7273, but today the photo is of the mini-regulator.Probably be something different tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fit Fujitsu Lifebook N6010, but not exact fit.","review":"It's work. but not exact fit.

It took 3 months of riding to get my first flat, which is awesome. However, I then got 2 flats (front and rear) in the same day. Front due to 2-3 glass shards completely embedded in the rubber, which I'm pretty diligent about checking for so they couldn't have taken long to work their way in, and the rear due to the rubber actually being split/cut perpendicular to the circumference of the tire.

I had hoped Derman would generate enthusiasm for applying previously known concepts (physics) to a new field (at least finance was once new to him), but instead got one long monologue.

What is very clear is that by any classical standard Carter may be a committed Christian but he is no evangelical. His beliefs include: Homosexual practice is acceptable (p.187), Biblical inerrancy is ridiculous (p.197-8), Reinhold Niebuhr and Soren Kierkegaard are his favorite theologians, Mormons are Christian, evolution is not up for debate....A pretty helpful book for political junkies needing to know more about Carter, but not as helpful as an inspirational aid for Christians.I probably would have given it 3 stars if I hadn't gone into it with higher hopes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great","review":"This book has something for everyone -- for people in crisis, it offers warmth and guidance and understanding.

I think progressive Christians will find this book speaks to them in their attempts to reconcile a very real faith with an outward-looking and inclusive world-view. Being engaged in left-wing causes does NOT require abandoning religious faith, and we need more men and women to assert that there IS a religious left, too. In fact, for many, religious faith is the inspiration that leads us into politics.

Living Faith provides us with a personal example of how our leaders should govern with compassion and love and refraining from passing judgement. Going to church, doesn't make one a Christian.

If you're going to be reading Japanese competently, you're going to have to read font this small, and smaller, in the real world. Japanese use small font sometimes.The only gripe I have with these cards is the romanji. I actually would prefer to just read the kana. The romanji is a distraction and hindrance, in my opinion. I know the kana, and if I did not, I would get kana flashcards, learn the kana, and then use these.I have actually whited out the romanji on my cards.

Today's female vocalists could learn a thing or two from this ballad princess who doesn't have to go up and down the scales fifty times to show emotion. Just listen to \\"When He Shines\\" or \\"Almost Over You\\" and the great \\"You Could Have Been With Me\\". This song has a great build and gives Mariah Carey a run for her money. Included is Sheena's US debut single \\"Morning Train\\" all the way through the funky \\"Do It For Love\\". Check out a voice that is sorely missed in todays pop world.

So if you live some place with a lot of rain or humidity then definitely get a bigger better filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This filter works good for my shop compressor.

I know that it has worked for me. Way to go Dragonstar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another notable mention for E. Lynn!","review":"Another notable mention for E. Lynn! The story centers around a magazine called Bling Bling, which is run by an black man with a questionable past. Then, there is Zola; the chief editor of the magazine who isn't sure about whether she'll be giving love a try. E. Lynn brings back some old favorites like Raymond, who is on retainer as an attorney, living all alone in New York, and exploring a new type of \\"friendship\\" with Basil. After an objectional article on Yancey is published, Zola and Raymond get into a fierce battle. The story ends with Raymond and Zola each finally geting what and who they want. There are also appearances by Nicole, Jared, Kirby, Moms, Pops, and Trent, characters from previous literary works from E. Lynn. You'll really enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Harris Does It Again!

Each book carries its own tone of being an African American, educated, homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual, male, female... I can't wait for his next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"I started off madly in love with this series. The characters were well written, and even if they were not always likeable, they were at least all well defined. With the last two books, however, I feel like each book is nothing more than groundwork for the next one. And unfortunately, I am getting more and more disillusioned, to the point where his next book will not be an automatic purchase. E. Lynn, please, ditch Basil already, and Yancy, and go back to the full character development and plotlines that hooked me in the first place!!!

For some reason Raymond seemed a bit too wishy-washy.The story-line with Zola wasn't that interesting either. The only interesting thing going on with her was a bit of the drama from the relationship with her sister and ex.The ending also left me very dry. There was this buildup on Raymond/Zola and their work situation with Bling Bling, The boss' family background, the situation with Ava and Yancey and everything seemed to get nicely wrapped up in the end in about 2-3 pages - no character development at all.At the end, Davis does a complete 180 and behaves completely out of character and the book doesn't even attempt to explain/develop it!?!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book is simply awesome!

Lynn Harris has given us a truly entertaining novel. I finished reading the book in two days. I could'nt put this page turner down. His next novel can't come out soon enough for me. I am really glad that their is an author out there that is not afraid to address real issues. I would recomend this book to anyone that loves drama because there is plenty of it in this book. Mr Harris introduces a few new characters as well as some of the older one's from his previous novels such as Raymond Tyler Jr and Basil Henderson. Go out and get this book. You will not be disappointed. Keep em comin E Lynn Harris. I will always be fan of your work.

It's as if I hit a wall, and couldn't go any further.I like a book that has a story. Beginning, middle, end. I have a writing book that says you should only have ONE main character. This book broke that rule right off. First you're reading about one character, then you're reading about another one...there's no structure. I'm afraid I just can't handle episodic writing. It's as if Lynn Harris was writing a script for a soap opera instead of a novel.I own two books by E. Lynn Harris: his first, Invisible Life, and this one. The first was the best by a long shot. While it's interesting how some of the characters from that first novel had evolved...they alone couldn't hold my interest in this book. Sorry, Mr. Harris, maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm","review":"E. Lynn Harris books are usually a lot of fun, but his latest is hampered by corny dialogue and shallow characters. In fact, Harris seems more interested in describing their glittery social lives (and steamy sex lives) than showing us what really makes them tick. The references to Sept. 11 don't add much depth to the story and the ending is ridiculously contrived. If there's a sequel, I hope he puts more thought and heart into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Love got to do with it!","review":"I have loved E. lyyn Harris since I first started reading him.

Everything in this book is so predictable...Being a writer takes a whole lot more time and thought than being an AUTHOR. Seems like this author and most of the other... authors of late appear to copy the scripts of the...daytime soap operas, then place the scripts in novel form...Just because you have a desktop publishing system in the second vacant room at your home does NOT make you a true writer or self-published for that matter.

It was drawn out and so boring, I skipped and skimmed through the last few chapters so that I could finish it. Wish this time I had borrowed it from the library instead of purchasing it, I wouldn't felt so bad about it. Just wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment of My Own","review":"As a long time fan of the works of E. Lynn Harris, I must say I am throughly disappointed. The thready, weak plots were satiated with predictability; the novel (in its entirety) lacked realism. Previously introduced characters existed to no purpose, and brought no identifiable edge to the story. The new characters proved to be shallow and uninteresting. A futile attempt at rehashing sad, real-life events (9/11, Aaliyah's death) left me ultimately bored and a bit puzzled at their ill-placed presence in the story. The \\"hurried\\" appeal of the writing style suggests the lack of thought and effort denoted to the compilation of such a farce. The novel leaves much to be desired in comparison to Mr. Harris's previous novels. To the even remotely interested: Proceed with lowered expectations. Better yet, it wouldn't be a bad idea to just wait for its paperback release. This novel will wreak havoc on the inquisitive mind in search of true literary entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Love Of My Own - Average At Best","review":"I rushed out to purchase A Love Of My Own in hopes that it would be an interesting page-turner. Unfortunately, it was not. As I read through this bland material, I wondered what happened to the passion and fire that raged through E. Lynn's previous novels.While I liked the themes of friendship and loyalty, the cursory mentions of previous characters and the implausible storylines involving Ava/Yancey (again!) and Trent were a bit much. Ditto for the repeated references to 9/11.E. Lynn is a fine writer and I hope he comes up with some fresh, entertaining material next time. A Love Of My Own fell far short of my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Another one of the author's books that must be read.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Let Down.....","review":"I am sorry to say that I was so disappointed. I too am a very big ELH fan and this book fell way short of his others. He tried to pick it up a notch at the end but, at that point the ending was so predictable that I read on just to finish the book. Mr Harris has and can do much MUCH better than this one. No love lost though E Lynn Harris is still one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of ELHs' best","review":"I've always been a fan of Lynn Harris books but this one is far from being one of his best. In fact it feels like that the quality is going down. \\"Just as I Am\\" and \\"Invisible Life\\" where really good, but this one seems to be the result of pressure to publish. Also I really hope that this is not the end of Basil and Raymond as it seems. Zola was boring and the other characters are cliches. At times whole chapters where irrelevant to the story line. And only at the last page, where finally Basil and Raymond appear, (and I repeat appear) to finally become a couple, the story ends.Lynn, If I may -- it's time to explore. How about fatherhood for Raymond, he doing the cheating, falling in love to a woman. He guiding a desperate young gay guy. How about exploring other races. A latino or a white guy will add some spark. It's time to get out of the confort zone or loose relevance. Keep this in mind, we need your voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"This novel seemed formulaic -- following the \\"How to Write a Novel\\" guidelines. It didn't take long before I became annoyed by the name dropping. There are so many better writers in the world, I can't imagine how this one has become so popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the others.","review":"This book was not as good as the others but it still was a quick enjoyable read. I think ELH fans wanted more sex scenes and details. But it had a few surprises, and some twists. It also had some real life events in it that I liked, it made the book seem surreal. I wanted to jump in the lives of the characters and help solve some of there problems, however when it ended I still had a few unanswered questions. But that's ok, E.Lynn will probably have a come back on his next book and answer all of my questions. He really is a creative author. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Smash..","review":"E. Lynn Harris does not disappoint with this latest installment, weaving a tale of sadness, intrigue, hints of romance, and some very contemporary issues into a very entertaining book. I own every book E. Lynn has ever written, and this book is just as consistently good as all the others.The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because I was a little heartbroken at how lonely and slightly desperate Raymond seemed throughout the whole book. He's usually so strong and sure of himself in the other books - this seemed a slight departure from the normal Raymond character.If there's a God in heaven, someone will take these books and turn them into a fantastic dramatic TV series - along the lines of Showtime's \\"Soul Food\\". Raymond, Basil, Yancey B., Jared, Nicole, Peaches, and all the others would be wonderful to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has done it again","review":"Well E. Lynn has created another masterpiece. I could not put this book down. There was never a dull moment. I enjoyed his new characters Zola and Jabar, with his fine self. He is truly a genius.

You need to go out and get it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"He could and has done better","review":"I only hope that E. Lynn Harris has done a better job of investing his money from his previous books than he has done writing this one. I read and waited for this book to get better..it never did. I have been a fan of E. Lynn Harris and his books since the very beginning, but this book was a major disappointment. It lacked depth and a serious story line.The new characters were weak, had no backbone and it was full of \\"fluff\\".

And believe me I have been a devoted fan since his first book...he needs to give his loyal fan base much more than the seemingly formulaic crap that we've gotten lately. Don't mean to be so hard but the theme & characters are just plain tired now. We don't need to read anything else about Yancey B's old evil vindictive mom; nor about the never ending cat & mouse game between Raymond & Basil (just hook up for peet's sake!) and what was up with that weak subplot with Raymond getting shot?????The challenge for ELH is to continue to engage his loyal fan base with new fresh story lines & characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"I've done Callanetics off and on for years.

The truth is, people gain weight back on any type of diet, IF they return to their old eating habits or give into their cravings once they lose the weight. This diet does work, but it's something you have to stick to FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, just like any other weightloss plan.The Lean for Life plan is a low carb diet, but it is different than Atkins in that it stresses low-fat types of high protein foods ~ and it allows for fruits, vegetables, and grains. It emphasis psychological efforts in dieting along with the usual eating and exercising information. It's easy to follow, and the weight loss is pretty rapid (which is very motivating). However, if you only follow the weight loss phase, and not the maintenance phase, the weight will come back on.This diet may not be for everyone, but as with any weight loss plan, you have to find what works for you, and make it a lifetime habit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally found a diet that works","review":"I am a lifetime member of weight watchers, I have done the grapefruit diet, cabbage soup diet, atkins diet, and any other diet that came my way.

I also realize that if I go back to my old eating habits the 14 pounds will find their way back.

I've not given it 5 stars because many of the cuts are not his best performances of the selections. Some are also not my favorite arias.

While it's filled with very good equipment and car-free lifestyle choices, the riding techniques advocated are highly dubious. In some cases, they're illegal and stupid -- like showing you how to run red traffic lights, or riding on the sidewalk -- and will do nothing for the image of cyclists. The book even shows (by a backhanded warning) the best place to crack a car windshield.It is a shame that such moments of crassness spoil a book that is aimed at beginners. These would be bad habits to get into, and terrible things to learn from the outset.Better books on assertive cycling are John Franklin's \\"Cyclecraft\\", and John Forester's \\"Effective Cycling\\". They show you how to gain your place in the traffic, and how to keep it without resorting to crazy stunts."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, but NOT good on the kindle","review":"I enjoyed the book though I'm not as 'advanced' or willing to take risks as some of the examples. I found plenty of content for an ordinary commuter like myself, including answers to some 'I wonder what you're supposed to do in that case?' type questions. I was quite disappointed in the kindle version of the book though. It was tedious to read as page numbers were not there and illustrations needed to be zoomed in and out on every page in many sections. Some images were nearly impossible to read because the image resolution was so poor. Buy the hard copy version of the book if you're going to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recomended","review":"At best this book is incomplete and at worst it is downright dangerous. Recommending that a rear light is not needed for night riding is foolish especially given how inexpensive and good today's bike lights are. My advice get at least one light for each side of your bike. White light for the front, red for the back, and amber wheel lights for the sides. Two lights or more for each side is even better. Get the brightest lights you can afford. Reflectors just don't cut it.Get towed by cars or pick a fight with a driver if you want to die on your bike. It's a small twitch of the wrist or foot for a driver to put you in the hospital. Bike commuting can be safe and fun but you must be smart and careful. This book should have covered all the basics of interacting with traffic safely. It glosses over the basics and then shows you a bunch of dumb stunts that are likely to get you hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Skip this book.

The colors are insipid and uncoordinated. The drawing is inept.

These sentences are not really the first you would like to know when you plan to visit Thailand. Nevertheless you have to start somewhere, and this book is good as a first acquaintance with the (very complex) Thai language.I used it before I went to Thailand for the very first time, and it did teach me a bit of the Thai alphabet and some basic things like counting (useful in bargaining).

Of course it's not that simple after the for days I could not delineate words at all. I had to start reading a children's picture dictionary, then reading books for very young cheldren etc. To write Thai I had to buy children's letter writing books.But this book does a good job of giving you the basics. The vocab is wierd because to start with you only know a few Thai characters and so there are only a few words they can use.There are some mistakes in the execises and they have been left in in subsequent editions because the author is Thai. Do all the execises though - they work.It also ends too soon - just introduces the vowels and tones and then stops. It could have done with some more work on these areas.This book will teach you to read Thai."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, just terrible","review":"If you want to learn Thai, you can find much much better books than this.

It's the perfect size for me. It's not such a large handbag that it's a hassle to carry around. It is the ideal size to keep my wallet, phone, sunglasses, mp3 player, small makeup bag, etc. and not be bursting at the seams or be so crammed you can't find anything inside.There is a small zipper pocket on the front of the handbag and another inside. There are 3 pouches on the inside as well for organizing small items (phones, glasses, etc.)I've read other people's reviews where they've said when they saw the item online and compared it to the item they received, they felt that the colors didn't really match the photo. That is not the case for this handbag; the picture is an accurate representation.

There are moments and pauses where an apt phrase could lift it into loveliness, but banality wins out every time. The wallpaper is bland enough for background effect and therefore will have its uses. Sadly, the final track requires drum-machine and over-emphasis to end on an up-beat note, and is simply annoying.

Wired it up and it works fine with one minor (to me) exception, and that is I cannot get the MODE to change (the MODE button is supposed to let you manually select the input for the TV, or set it on automatic, or set it on scan).

So if I'm watching the satelite and I turn on the Wii it will switch to the Wii automatically. Then if I turn the Wii off it will go back to the satelite. Very smart box. The only bad thing about it is it uses these little suction cups on the bottom of the unit to secure it to a surface. This might be ok but the suction cups pull out of the mounting on the bottom.

I just decided to put my own word in as I checked back to see if this artist had finally released another album, and unfortunately it looks like no, she hasn't. What a tragedy, as this debut of hers is/was top-notch all the way around with only a couple of songs not quite as good as the whole lot. She clearly has singing talent and unmistakable charisma that shows in her vocal acrobatics. The music is executed with pro talent including Jeff Porcaro on drums if memory serves right. The album is upbeat, instrumentally organic (not much in the way of synths), and ever so soulful. I'm now a little depressed to see that evidently this girl did not get a second chance at making her name in the world musically, unless by chance she went on to sing under a different name? or as the lead of a band instead of solo?

The faucets make so much noise as water is flowing through them, you could hear it across the house. Compared to Kohler faucets which are much quieter, when water is turned on, the Danze shower and sink faucets make a lot of noise. Also, I've had the shower faucet in for three years and I clean the bathroom every week; I have to tighten the screw every week for the lever that changes water from tub to shower. It comes loose after a week. I've never had a shower faucet that needed so much fixing. I realized that I had to tighten the screw every week because if I didn't, the lever would just pop out. This comes down to a basic design issue. I would not recommend the shower faucet because of this design issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"power rock pop metal","review":"Starz had come out with two of the best melodic metal rockers of the seventies and then they did this rock metal pop cd. It has some killer songs on it like x ray spex, hold on to the night. and many others. There's not a bad song on this one but it's not killer metal like the first two releases from this band. Those two are must haves for any fan of good melodic metal. (the best kind) While this is a mellower record by any means it's still done by a group of excellent songwriters and musicians. Fans of this band should get this one last probably. THeir next one is totally killer metal , but this one is worth listening to with your girl in your car by your side. It's got that vibe for great songs for making out to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good album","review":"I think that Starz's third release Attention Shoppers! is their weakest album cause I think that almost all of the songs are somewhat unfocused and the songwriting tends to get lazy cause when it comes to the third chorus, they don't want to finish it, they would rather get halfway through the third chorus and start a fading chorus, and I was kind of dissapointed in it and you think that the whole song would be good but unfortunately it only gets weak, the only songs that are worth having for the album is Hold on to the Night and She, the rest of the songs are forgettable and luckily their next album Coliseum Rock is quite an improvement, if you're new to the band Starz, start with their Greatest Hits CD or Coliseum Rock (their final album) which I think should've been a classic like their debut although I haven't listened to Violation and I would be interested in how good that album would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Before Buying, Please!","review":"I liked that this stroller was so light-weight, with a canopy, it seems hard to find an umbrella stroller with a canopy, even if it is very small. My original Graco travel system was huge and bulky, so it seemed like a relief to be able to put my 6 month old son in this. My problem with this is kicking the wheels,(I am 5'5\\" and apparently too tall to wheel this stroller) which would be solved by walking on the side of the stroller and steering with one hand, instead of the traditional behind-the-stoller-walk.

I would agree with others that the seat is also narrow. My daughter is now 2 and a half and it's getting tight for her shoulders. We were recently on a trip and while we were in the airport, the foot strap (for the child to rest their feet on) just broke off. Now we have to buy a new stroller because she has to hold her feet up.

We liked the style especially the canopy, as many umbrella strollers don't have these. Also the handles seemed much higher than the other strollers which was nice being that I am 5'7 and my husband is 6'0. We were very disappointed though. As someone else mentioned there is very little room to walk behind it. We were constantly tripping over the wheels, not very fun for us or I'm sure my son either. Another problem was that my son is on the tall side, and if he took his feet off the foot rest(which he did constantly) his feet could touch the floor and they would drag i was afraid they would get caught under the stroller! Needless to say, we took our old stroller on vacation with us and this one is in my husbands vehicle as a back up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too happy......","review":"About 2 months ago I purchased this stroller.

Major safety concerns if I had not been right on top of him when it tipped forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andrea Searcy, Fairburn, GA, USA","review":"This stroller looks great, the weight and height is perfect. However, I must say that this stroller is entirely too narrow. My son was 14 months old at the time I made the purchase. When I placed him in the stroller, he looked as if I squeezed him in and he's not over weight. I also didn't like that this stroller does not recline. This product needs improvement.I was able to find an umberlla stroller made by Chicco at a great price. My son is comfortable in it and he's 18 months old now! It has every thing I wanted in an umbrella stroller.

Very compact and very light. However, all of these nice qualities do not mean anything unless you child is slim enough to fit in the seat. My 10 month old who weighs 18lbs was too large. His shoulders were just narrow enough to fit, but the seat is not deep enough to keep him from sliding out. Unless your child is wearing a rough material type pant, s/he will just slide out of the seat. I ordered online, so I could not discover this until after I purchased the stroller. I ended up returning it. You really must try this seat before it. Otherwise, there is a good chance you'll have to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUTE LOOK BUT TOO SMALL!!!","review":"I bought this stroller for my 18 month old son. We already own the 3-wheeler all terrain jeep stroller and were so pleased with it and decided to buy this one for our smaller car. I returned it after a week.

The great things about this stroller are it's maneuverability and it's cool mesh back. It easily whips around tight spaces and can even be pushed with one hand. The mesh back really does keep little ones cool.The thing I did not like was the narrowness of the stroller, but my little boy is small for his age so it is not too much of an issue for me , but I can see it being a problem for those with bigger size toddlers.Overall this stroller is a good value for the money and seems to be made extremely well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Quick Transport","review":"My husband I purchased this stroller a week ago.

I tried bending it back the best I could, and now I unclip one side of the canopy before folding it up to prevent more bending of the frame. I wrote the manufacturer, but have heard nothing back.

He's got to be about the most interesting of the great late 19th century US capitalists, the biggest rags to riches story of them all and a man whose mind tried to contain and maintain diametrically opposed ideas about rights of labor and rights of property. In the end, of course, he caved and went with the money, but hey, at least he never really felt good about it, and he did set the standard for philanthropy in the last 20 years of his life (after becoming the world's first billionaire in 1900). A very complex man, and Wall stays balanced about him.

Hopefully we can finish the bag before she grows anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why pay more?","review":"all the quality for less the price - I used to buy strictly pampers, but tried these because they were so much cheaper.

Don't buy these crappy diapers!!!","review":"I bought two boxes of these Luv diapers (thats 448 diapers!) and I sure wish I had spent a little extra for Pampers Swaddlers. These diapers leak out the top because they don't have any elastic on the tabs or anywhere on the waist. Even the generic Kroger diapers have elastic waistbands! I am just sad that I have to use these crappy diapers for so long! I also think they run small so I probably will not even use them all. What a waste! The only good thing about these diapers is the price, but, I would highly recommend that you just buy your store brand instead if money is an issue. P.S. I don't like Huggies either because they leak out the legs! Hard to find a good diaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I Choose Luvs?","review":"I have a 6 month old baby boy, I switch all the brands at the beginning. In my opinion, Huggies Supreme is the best, fit and no leaking but too expensive. Pampers Swaddlers is good too, but when my baby squeeze too hard, still leaks everywhere, for that kind of price, it's not worthy at all. Luvs is just as same as the Huggies Baby Shaped but cheaper and softer. The worst is the Pampers Baby \\"Dry\\", leaks everywhere and really saggy afer pooing and peeing, it made me turn on my washer everyday.So far I used 1 pack of size 2 and lots pack of size 3, so far I am going to use size 4, for the price and quality, Luvs almost have nothing to complain about, if it sold out in the store, I would buy Huggies Baby Shaped instead.I think every baby have different shapes and situations, if you keep trying, you will find the best diapers for your baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed Only Diaper that did not leak for us","review":"When my son was 6 months he started leaking with Pampers. Then we tried Huggies and he still leaked. Then we tried Luvs and have been using them ever since. Can't beat the price and having them shipped to your door. I wish they had more of a elastic tab but other than that I am happy. Different Diapers work better for different babies because not all babies have the same butt or stomach or thigh size. It really is just a try game. you could always donate the diapers to shelters and Goodwill and Salvation Army if you do not like them. Love Luvs Love Price Love Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good purchase","review":"Good purchase.

I was very hopeful after reading all the positive reviews.Unfortunately, however, Luvs did not work for our daughter. She had a leak within a day of starting to wear the Luvs diapers. The diaper simply did not absorb the urine quickly enough, and the pee just ran out the back of her diaper as she was lying down. She'd never had a leak with Pampers. Since I had purchased the value pack, I continued to use the Luvs (but only during the day, and not during naptime) -- but we had two more major leaks before we finally ran out of the Luvs diapers and went back to Pampers again.Clearly, other people have found success with Luvs, but I just wanted to share our experience. I'd personally rather spend the extra money on Pampers to be sure that my daughter is wearing a diaper that won't leak..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luv's Leak","review":"This is my first experience with Luv's.

I would never have bought them if I'd known that.The worked fine for leaks and those related worries, but every time I put one on her I was irritated. I want to smell my baby, pooh incidend or not, when I pick her up. I don't want to smell the flowery perfume a corporation has added to their diapers. Shes my child, she smells, its ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't these supposed to catch the poo?","review":"Conventional wisdom is that the diaper's primary function is to absorb urine and catch the poo. Although, if you were a Luvs devotee, you'd think that the poo is supposed to leak through every time, while the fastening tape is there to cut into your child's legs. Yes, these are unconventional diapers that don't do what a diaper's supposed to do. Of all brands we've tried, to include generics, these are the crappiest.For a good brand, with a lot of comfort try one of the following:1) Pampers, 'cause they got all the coolest cross-branded characters2) Huggies, 'cause they got the gigglastic that is both elasticky and makes all the kids giggle.3) Kirkland Signature, yes, the Costco brand. They look way more comfortable than your average diaper and are a good deal cheaper. I've yet to see one of these leak.Then again, if you're ok with leaking poo, go with the Luvs, they're guaranteed to satisfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than any other brand","review":"I was a Pampers only mom, don't get me wrong pampers worked great when my son was in the swaddlers size, those are the only diapers I would use, and I still to this day recommend the pampers but swaddlers only, after that, it was leak after leak after leak. My son is a thin active baby, very active, and I tried Cruiser's, Huggies, everything and believe it or not only the luvs work to keep everything in. The pampers wouldn't survive the overnights! In the morning when he finally woke up the stuffing from the diapers would be stuck to him! So much for absorbency, I have never had that problem with the luv's. I will always recommend them for anyone needing size 3 and up, size 2 I would still recommend the pampers swaddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good diaper","review":"Comparing to Pampers Cruisers, it has similar characteristic in stopping leaks.

My son was only 14lbs when I bought the size 2 and they seemed like they didn't fit him already. They don't have much elastic on the sides, so it doesn't stretch like Pampers or Huggies.

When it came time to replace our tea kettle I thought choosing their kettle was a no brainer. The problems became evident the first time I tried to lift it from the burner. The handle is mounted pretty closely to the kettle, if your fingers are of large size your sure to singe them a bit.

Unfortunately, they are no longer made in the U.S. and their craftsmanship has definately suffered for it. The first thing I noticed was that the bottom was thinner than my original; not a big deal only an observation. Next, I observed that the kettle's whistle didn't whistle, but rather whispered so you could only hear it if you were in close proximity. Finally, the lower part of the handle had a piece suddenly 'pop' off when the kettle was boiling.

This boiling action makes the kettle rock a bit. It is very strange to hear water boiling through metal. This thing is a disappointing hunk of junk. Very sad.

After an exhaustive google search it seems like the part is just not available. This is ridiculous. Planned obsolescence? Perhaps. But if you are like me and care for the planet and do not want to throw away a perfectly good teakettle because you can not find a replacement handle then you may want to research another kettle, which is where I find myself.

While the metal work looks okay the cheap plastic handle and spout opening mechanism looks like a child made with a pocket knife. I'm skeptical that this thing can handle the daily grind of the stove top and I fully expect the plastic components to disintegrate within a year or two.

It's nearly impossible for your fingers not to brush up against the insanely hot metal when going to grip or release your grip from the handle.Second, and this is the deal breaker for me and why I am returning it, water dribbles down the side (not into your mug) of the kettle and drips all over the counter when you attempt to pour at anything less than full tilt.Talk about frustrating and disappointing: the product and the undeserving rating users have given this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"revere 2-1/2 quart whistling tea kettle","review":"another made in China item the whistle does not work but when filled with water and placed on the stove I expect the whistle to alert me that the water is boiling no whistle burnt pot on the very first day very frustrated"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken","review":"The plastic on this item is not very sturdy and the lid thatopens has a piece that has come apart after taking out of thebox, have not even used one time.

Since I use this kettle so much I though I'd save myself a bit of hassle and buy a kettle with non metal fixtures. This kettle is small enough that the handle and \\"trigger\\" mechanism sit very close to the body of the kettle. Consequently they are both too hot to touch with the bare hand.

It's nice-looking, small and light. I only use it occasionally, boiling water to clean my cast iron skillet, etc. But I still find some major problems of this pot.The first problem is you can only fill in water through the small hole where you pour water out. Unless you fill it directly under a faucet, you're likely to spill a little bit (like me, using a brita.) There is no lid of this kettle, which means you basically can't see the inside very well. I don't know how I can easily clean the inside either.The second problem is the handle gets very hot if you boil a full kettle of water. Can I wear those heavy kitchen mitten? Yes, but I also need to use one finger to pull that hook (under the handle) back so as I can pour water out.

Others have a removable top that falls off if you hold the kettle at too steep an angle, and you have to push a small lever to pour water out the spout. (That's difficult for me because I have arthritis in my fingers.) The Revere kettle is a no-nonsense workhorse. No cover top to fall off--just pull the trigger and pour.

I was disappointed to see that that the new design puts the handle very close to the top of the kettle. The worst thing is that when you pull the trigger to pour your newly boiled water it flicks a few drops of boiling water onto your arm.

Now after my purchase I have read not to leave any remaining water after each use because of the green marking meaning that there is water leaking at the seam causing a reaction with the leaching of the copper and the water combined.

Note to manufacturer: put a notch on the cap lifter to allow it to boil without the whistle, if desired.>>>>> UPDATE: 9/19/2011 I have no explanation, but the \\"dribbler\\" has stopped leaking water and is still performing well as far as an economical method of heating water. Keep the copper bottom shiny for top heat transfer. The stainless steel finish is still in excellent condition after almost 6 years of use and shines up as if brand new. Now give this 4 1/2 stars.

All of the steam escapes around the lid and not through the whistle. My reason for paying the price was for it ability to whistle and whistle loud so I could hear it anywhere in my house.

Apparently the copper bottom is not the same guage metal as my old one. This one taks longer to bring to a boil. One advantage though is tht the whistle is louder on the new one--you can hear it in another room. The trigger-like mechanism for opening the kettle top on the new one rattles in a way the old one didn't. On balance, the Revere is the best teakettle available because of its copper bottom.

It is safer than most kettles--fancier ones (in decor) always seem to mark up the range, steam leaks and burns hands, etc.Revere's handy whistle (which of late I take not for granted) safety manner in pouring boiling water as well as it's heat retention has made this the one product I surely missed when others decided to \\"borrow\\" my kettle.I am grateful for a very hot cup of tea!

The metalseemed thinner. Reading the box I notice that they now produceit in China. Nothing wrong w/ China, but the manufacturing ofthis tea kettle sucked.

Big mistake. This kettle spits out large amounts of boiling water while whistling (there's no way you can fill it to the 2 quart level; half would go all over your stovetop or, much worse, over yourself), and dribbles hot water down the base while you pour. The whistle works, at least. But it's really not a safe kettle and, as I said, I was a big fan of the Revere kettles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good choice","review":"Fine small kettle, but the handle gets very hot, too hot to handle and the top doesn't really whistle."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get the small one, get the larger one","review":"The diameter of the base is so small that the flame from the burners overheats the handle and the whistle cover.I got burned the first time, as I was used to the larger size kettle where this did not happen.The whistle in my particular kettle did not work upon receipt of the item, and still doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"We had a Revere Tea Kettle for over 20 years. Finally, the trigger broke so we ordered what we thought was a new and identical version. Pure junk. Thin, cheap steel and copper made in China. Worse, it leaked all around the base where the steel meets the copper. We returned it and got a replacement (just a bad example of a great product - right?) and the second one leaked worse. And, we bought a smaller (2 1/2 Quart) one for my in-laws - and it leaked around the base. Revere Tea Kettles shold be avoided.This is not Amazon's fault - it's just another example of \\"Made in China\\" ruining a great brand.We checked reviews and bought a BergHOFF 11 Cups Whistling Tea Kettle - THAT is very high quailty and exactly what we wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong tea kettle","review":"The Reverewear tea kettle in the picture was not what I received. The explanation was that the product number was for a different kettle and the one I wanted was not available.

The transaction was satisfactory, but I was not happy with the product and ended up ordering the one I wanted from a local merchant. The blame was placed on Amazon, deserved or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I had a Revere kettle that looked like the one I just bought. I had it for over 30 years, and loved it. Recently, it began leaking out of a pin hole in its bottom. I was so glad to see I could obtain another like it (I thought). I did not think the price was too high for the quality I believed I was getting. When the new kettle arrived, I was very disappointed, for it felt as light as a feather. I thought perhaps it was my imagination, so I weighed the old kettle, and the new one. The old one weighted 25% more than the new one. Also, the \\"whistler\\" on the new one is different. When it whistles, steam does not just come out of the spout-cover hole, it comes out in every direction. The plastic, bake o lite (or however you spell it)handle and spout cover does not seem as sturdy as the one on my old kettle. It is the same old story of this decade..........In most cases we now get less for more. In my opinion, the old one was much better, and it was used by 4 people, not just one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they used to be...","review":"I have had two of these kettles previously, which I have had to replace due to my own errors (melted and broken plastic). One lasted 15, the other 12 years. This one, unfortunately, is not of the same quality as the first two, which were made in Korea, this one in China, so it has changed. It is lighter, but the worst thing is that the wistle is barely loud enough to hear in the next room, while the old ones I used to be able to hear out in my garden!

We were using it at least 4 times a day. I like the design and the size of the kettle. We drink a lot of tea and often have guests so we appreciated it's generous size. The whistling sound is loud enough but not annoying. I tried 2 different kettles since but they didn't last and had faulty designs. I'm buying this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at a great price!","review":"I have owned several Revere teakettles (or slightly different variations of this one) over the years.

Now you and Amazon know too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trigger is built to break and not replacable","review":"This is a great product. Its a good design that functions very well. Our family have had many Revere teakettles of this design over the past four decades.---BUT---This latest version of the product is built with a serious (deliberate?) design flaw. The pull trigger that opens the spout is made of thin plastic and is the weakest part of the kettle. When is breaks (and it will), you cannot buy a replacement part. Crazy glue doesnt work for some reason - tried it. Your only option is to chuck the entire kettle and buy a new one.Aside from the cost, I personally have a problem with the waste created by this kind of planned obsolesence - trashing a perfectly good teakettle for want of a 25 cent part. When a manufacturer does not provide a facility for ordering replacement parts, its pretty clear that they are not making products for the long haul.I wont buy another Revere ware product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old fashioned tea kettle","review":"This tea kettle looks just like the ones my mother used when I was a child.

I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks at spout","review":"This is the second one to leak. The first one took a few years but this one is worse just a few weeks out of the box.It has a mechanical attachment of the spout to the body.

Plus, it's tapered toward the back so that it wants to slip out of your hand every time you tilt the kettle to pour. It heats up so that you can't hold it in your bare hands (the ad says it won't) and the small size and tapering makes the thing almost impossible to use with a hot pad. A towel might work, but then you have the issue, if you are using a stove with exposed burners, of setting yourself on fire. Buy the next size up would be my advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tea kettle is well made & very satisfactory.","review":"We had an electric kettle.

The new Revereware is very cheaply constructed and nowhere near as high a quality as the old. The Cu cladding has been reduced to the point where it no longer serves to distribute the heat evenly on the bottom. The seam rolling on the side \\"leaked\\" and we already see Cu verdigris on the edge. The Teakettle itself \\"pops and hops\\" as it heats up, an indication of thin metallic bottoms. After all these years of telling our guests how wonderful our Revere ware was to cook with, it was a great disappointment to see how cheaply made and how poorly the new stuff works. My recommendation is to buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this tea kettle!","review":"I love this kettle. The way it is designed, you don't burn yourself when you pour.

Unfortunatley we found it leaking 2 nights ago while being heated up (not even to the boiling point yet). The leak was bad enough to put off the flame completely. The gas leak was so bad that we had to keep all our windows open for an hour for ventilation. The same thing (flame being put off) happened again twice today and it's a good think that I was right in the kitchen to catch that both times. We've decided it's too dangerous to continue use. I just wrote to request for a replacement since it's still covered by the 1-year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boils fast but this is a flawed kettle","review":"Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst.While you learn how to not get scalded, this kettle is always at least slightly irritating.

Among the best remixes include You Want This, If, That's The Way Love Goes, Anytime Anyplace, Where Are You Now, pretty much every remix. The only one I didn't enjoy was the Because of Love remix, but its still nice. The bsides are great too, And On And On is a great summer song, 70's Love Groove is a great song about making love. I wish the CD included the great bside One More Chance, its on the If Single if you can find that. Overall this album is a must for fans of Janet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it","review":"I was always a Janet fan, had the albums went to the concerts etc.... But it wasn't till VR, I became a die hard fan! Anyway, rediscovering an artist is amazing and hearing these remixed really made me take a step back and say \\"whoa!\\"I think the best remix on here is CJ's remix of \\"Anytime Anyplace,\\" he also did \\"That's The WaY Love Goes.\\" I remember someone commented on, why did Janet let CJ remix her songs. Well, he is a tight remixer, duh. CJ also remixed some songs for my other favorite artists the london based band Incognito and he pimped their single too!Get this, because most of the singles from the \\"janet\\" era are out of print just like her earlier singles.Now, if we could get a remix album for \\"Rhythym Nation,\\" ha, like that will happen.

I recommend the Good News Bible. Yabba. Dabba. Do. Blah. Blah. Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Message","review":"The book, The Message, was a very small book. I was expecting to receive a regular size book. The Bible itself is very good. I don't like that the book is so small and the print is hard to read. When I placed the order there was no indication what the size of the book would be. I had planned to give the book to friends and family but I don't think they will be able to read it very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God no","review":"Please oh please read another Bible. I don't hate this \\"translation,\\" I really don't. And if it brings somebody to Christ, then who cares what I rate it. But seriously, I have never cringed so much reading anything before. The great thing about the Bible is that it can be understood through its already fantastic simplicity--parables involving such easily comprehendable things as bread and water, for example--that they really don't have to be re-written so drastically as they are in The Message. And isn't the setting and diction of Christ and his work what makes the Bible such a fantastic literary work? I'm probably just old-fashioned; for every person I know who dislikes The Message I know five that find it wonderful. Personally, I recommend you look it over before you buy, and make sure that if you do purchase it, it's not the only Bible in your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice poetic prose...for those that already know the Bible","review":"The book arrived on time and in new condition. I ordered this size because I wanted something compact and did not realize the print would be so small. As far as the book...er...Bible...itself...I agree that there are some interesting passages, but this is for people who already know scripture already and can hold this \\"translation\\" up to others. I am not a King James purist (not yet, anyway :) ...and there are times when the language of The Message is like reading easy poetry...its fluid and it flows, but any new age language or references are completely unacceptable...this cannot be considered an actual Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invicta is by far the best!","review":"This watch is great...it looks big and manly, it keeps great time, and I get lots of compliments.

I promise you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference","review":"Behavior and Handling of Ships is an excellent tool for the professional mariner and is a great addition to any collection of maritime reference materials. The book itself revolves almost entirely around handling large, single-screw merchant vessels so it is very focused in its application; however, it does an excellent job in doing so. What is most impressive about this work is the way the author describes to the reader the forces from the wind and current that act upon a ship - and how the operator can overcome them....or NOT overcome them!! He also goes into depth on the effective use of tugs, thrusters and the anchor. Toward the end of the book, the author lists a number of practical applications that are excellent reading. In all, the book delivers as promised in a very concise, straight-forward manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Probably my favorite reference for shiphandling. If you are thinking over a docking and can't figure out why the ship reacted the way that it did, you can probably find it somewhere in this book. If you are training Mates or JOs in shiphandling, this is invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but I've read better.","review":"This book isn't a bad book for learning shiphandling. However, I found Crenshaw's Modern Shiphandling, Merchant Officer's Handbook, and Naval Shiphandling much better. Still it isn't bad for the vetor theory and the pictures are helpful once you figure out what you are looking at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Tunes","review":"All I can do is agree with the other reviews here: this is indeed a power pop classic, a great album that never got the attention it deserved. Killer tunes played with passion and energy, guitar firepower to burn, and melodies that soared. Man, this really was a brilliant collection of tunes. I like Adam's vocals too. Really, there isn't anything on here that falls short of very impressive. Where is the power pop love for this album? Spread the word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From the opponents own words","review":"George Chuvalo, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Henry Cooper, Ron Lyle, Ernie Shavers, and more all fought Ali at one time.

If I could add anything it would be more perspective on the fights. If I could take anything away it would most likely be Spinks and Holmes. Not their fault but they fought Ali when he already had symptoms of Parkinsons Syndrome and/or was being treated for Parkinsons. They really didn't face the greatest of all time, by then they fought the man that was the greatest of all time. Because of this, their perspectives are different and in some ways, less valuable in terms of discussing the boxing matches. Frazier's segments were good. Foreman's segments were the best (and he speaks most clearly among these retired fighters). This is worthy of adding to your collection but it is not as good as some other Ali documentaries (Thrilla In Manila, Through The Eyes Of The World, Muhammad Ali The Whole Story, When We Were Kings are must sees!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Poignant Film","review":"Facing Ali is on the short list for an Oscar nomination and deserves to be there. This documentary is more than a tribute to Ali; it is an intense study of great boxers after they leave the ring. My particular hero is Ron Lyle, who overcame the toughest odds and is making a real contribution to his community; he is also the most articulate of the spokesmen. But all have moving stories to tell and all may be forgiven, just as they have forgiven Ali."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I like movies that tell a story or teaches things and this movie does that.

One push of a button and the razor gets cleaned and charged. The shave is also good. Noise level is not bad. The problems came when the silver finish started to peel off. I called Braun and they said that the \\"cosmetic\\" features were not covered by warranty. Today, the shaver started making a very, very loud raspy sound as if someting inside was grinding. I take that to mean that it is not much longer for this world!I am considering giving Braun another chance with another model (perhaps with its Series 7 - 760 cc) but I'm not sure.

On my return I orderded multiple copies to give to friends. It is so well and I will say so sweetly written that everyone should read it just for fun. The author's use a common and kindly sense approach toward writing thank you notes that makes it fun to do rather than a task. They cover a range of reasons for thank you's as well as approaches. A must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was extremely disappointed when I received this book. First of all, someone giving advice on writing thank you notes should know that it is improper to begin them with \\"thank you\\" as the first sentence.

But thanks to AMAZON.COM's low price on DDR, i have been able to play it at home for less than the arcade. This game has also been helpful in getting a good aerobic workout.

There are lots of songs that are great on this game even though they took out a lot of songs from the import versions. Some of the songs include Dynamite Rave ( My favorite song), If you were Here (One of my favorites), Afronova ( a very fast song), and Dub I Dub ( My brother's favorite song). I hope someday I get to catastropic difficulty level, which is 9 feet.This game also is a surprisingly active video game. I was even sweating after 2 rounds of difficult level songs.

The songs are completely different from the USA arcade game, and some of them are from second mix (Japan) and are extremely slow. The only good thing about this game is that it brought official Konami pads to the US. So save up the extra 20 bucks and go to express.com.

Even my wife, not a physical person, plays the game a half an hour a night.I really think that it is a waste of time to buy this and not buy some third party dance pads. Two pads, the game, kickin' sound system, and all your friends equals a party.Another cool thing about this game is the other players. Ever try to ask a \\"Tekken(or other fighting game) master\\" how to do a special move? Most likely, you got sneered at; if not worse. However DDR players actually volunteer information to beginners.

The slow transformation of the main character Caroline is fascinating as she goes through therapy and takes a critical look at herself and her past.

The only critique is that some of the records recommended never made it to disk and are long out of print (even at the time of the publication I couldn't find about half of them); however, with the help of allmusic.com and a thorough music program with a deep jazz collection such as Rhapsody one can piece together the albums.Overall highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty","review":"Nice.

Having lived in France I was not surprised. Rodinson, so desperately trying to be a \\"good Frenchman\\" is quick to dismiss the State of Israel as the culmination of Jewish nationalism. Instead, he writes that \\"the creation of the State of Israel is an outrage committed against the Arabs as a people\\". He then goes on to show how Diaspora Jewry is generally unconcerned with Israel as evident that the majority of Jews live elsewhere. One might wonder how Rodinson would deal with today's statistics, as the majority of Jews now reside in Israel.All in all this is another expression of \\"Galut\\" mentality. While the world certainly should debate Israeli national policy just as we should all debate all national policies Rodinson's attempt to de-legitimize Zionism is a disaster.

Gopal, our Indian, has taken a strong liking to Coke, french fries and has won over quite a few people with his innocent and funny behaviour. His friend,philosopher and guide, Randy, is eager to introduce Gopal to the joys of an American college education. At the same time Gopal has to \\"uphold\\" the Indian culture and also keep his head in the books. All in all, the book is very hilarious and will be appreciated especially by all Indians in the USA.

A good read.","review":"Having attended college with Mr. Mathur (I hate to say how many years ago), I was so happy to come across this book about the plight of one foreign student in our midst. He gave wonderful, witty insights into the mind of a young man just trying to stay afloat amid the madness of early 70's American culture. To say he's a wit is an understatement. Mathur has managed to guide us through the angst of embarrassment with a guffaw at his character's naivete and no little admiration for his courage.I bought the book thinking I knew what the author was going to say. I was surprised at my own naivete in believing I could guess what was happening with the foreign student population in those days.I only wish I could contact Anurag so that I could tell him how wonderful I think the book is, and how pleased I am that he has written such a funny, awful, touching account of this young man's experience in the U.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"required reading","review":"bought this for my daughter who is a college student; it was one of the books required for one of her courses, and not easy to find"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"The Inscrutable Americans is the first novel I read by the author Anurag Mathur.

The prose was at times lyrical, beautiful, naive, and sophomoric. As an Engineer I found myself instantly relating to the main character, however, I think the author missed an excellent chance to parody the different approaches to Western society which emmigrants have taken.post scriptum: did anyone else find it interesting that the main character consumated his carnal yearnings not with an American but one of his own countrymen, err,... women?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn to laugh a little","review":"Anurag Mathur weaves with great sensitivity and panache a tale of a small-town boy who goes straight to the Big Apple.

I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amatuerish effort","review":"There aren't many books on the Indian experience in the United States. Just having the patience, insight, and (dare I say)courage to write this book should be applauded. Some of the reviews on Amazon have been written by Indians born in the U.S. who no doubt had a rollicking laugh at the expense of their parents and relatives, as well as a reaffirmation of the 'uncoolness' of 'native' Indians. It's extremely easy to parody our third world mentality, miser mentality, and sexual deprivation, and Mathur (of course) does all that. Where I think he fails is in providing no genuine insight into the culture clash in the U.S. Any one who disagrees with me, answer this question: How different is this book than the \\"How to tell if you're Indian\\" emails floating in cyberspace? Basically it's an eleven dollar expansion of the same theme - and not too well written at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"Mathur tries very hard to satirize American culture, but fails miserably. The key weakness is that in trying to portray \\"typical\\" Americans, he gets too many details wrong, such as the manner of American speech. Every line of dialogue in a purportedly American character's mouth made me think, \\"That's not how he would say that!\\"The book also fails as a novel because it doesn't really have much character development or a story arc. The main character goes to the United States, is faced with a number of amusing puzzles and then, well, that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic and avoidable","review":"Dorothy Parker once reviewed a book saying, 'This is not a book to be set aside lightly.

However, I believe that there was a fuzzy line between the main character's innaccurate views on Americans attitudes on sex and the author's descriptions of Americans. This is a very dangerous mistake to make. I am currently travelling in India with a female friend and we have encountered countless Indian men who believe that American women are very free with their sexual behavior. My friend has been verbally harassed hundreds of times in the last three months, and has been sexually assualted eight times. The Inscrutable Americans only contributes to this dangerous misconception of American women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy book","review":"To be honest, i really found this book to be boring.

Even the familiar lines from \\"Circle of Life\\" are wrong (example: the line \\"through despair and hope\\" becomes \\"to the cir-ra-cle\\"). The beautiful Zulu chants so prevalent in the Broadway recording are literally gibberish here. True, Zulu isn't easy to sing, but any fool can read the lyrics from the B'way CD booklet and do better than this! \\"One by One\\" is so wrong (and so badly mixed) that I burst out laughing halfway into it.

This is evident from the opening track, when the singer of Rafiki sounds suspiciously like the singer of the child simba (!) right on through the inauthentic sounding chant tracks. The harmonies have been made harsher, and the sound generally grates on the ear throughout, even when the singers aren't horribly mangling the notes or text.It isn't quite deserving only of one star (in part because the genius of the show's music still shines through in places, in part because a few tracks aren't all that bad), you still should banish all thought of purchasing this CD from your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"If you're into herbs, this is a great resource for Chinese herbs.

Otherwise, it's an interesting peek into Edinburgh's criminal world, and particularly at what pushed the famous William Burke and William Hare and their wives to murder people to sell the bodies to medical researchers.

It has tons of them so you are constantly looking for balls, pails, buckets, the shapes and the hammer.

We also like the fact it is a tool bench and we gave it to our little girl so she will grow up with as minium gender bias as possible. It gives her the feeling that if daddy can play with tools so can I! At the end of the night my husband and I round up the parts and put it back together for the nest day.

It instantly throws my son into a panic and it isnt easy to get his hand out.. Safety is a Huge concern with this Mom as I am sure it is to many others.

We constantly had to put it back together and he did not want to play with any other parts once he could dismantle it. Now the toy just collects dust. It would have been a great toy if they could find a way to fasten that portion of the toy on so that children could not just pull it off. Maybe then he would have wanted to play with the other parts.

You can't build anything, the phone doesn't look like a phone. There are only three things to bang, the hammer doesn't even look especially like a hammer. You can drop the ball in but they don't even go anywhere interesting.Maybe this toy is for much younger kids (my son is just turned two) but since he fell in the middle of the age range I thought it would be good.

He sometimes tries to pull the balls back out the top of the drill press, but then figures out that that won't work and uses the lever.

I was just about to give up and take him to the ER with the toy attached to his leg! The underside of the shape sorter holes are rough as well, and he had bruises and cuts all up and down his shin/ankle. It immediately went into the basement and then to the dump!

The pieces are good for more than *workbench* activities (she rolls the balls, has learned to put things in - and take things out of - the paint cups, etc.) and it gave her an incentive to sit up independently. At first, we would sit behind her/support her while she sat to push the shapes to make the noises and soon, she was so interested in doing so, she sat on her own. There *are* a lot of pieces and things *do* get separated, but that's just part of being a kid. It's a bit unstable (falls over easily under the weight of my child trying to steady herself in a standing position), but I'm looking forward to when she actually pulls the lever on the drillpress purposefully and clicks the ruler for a reason.

He was all excited about it and loves the hammer and phone. The only problem we have found with it is-- he sticks his hand down into the holes to retrieve the balls, I am sure once he sees that they fall out near the bottom he will quit. But the holes are quite small and he has gotten his arm and hand stuck in it a few times. Plus some of the holes have rough plastic and when he pulls his arms out it scratches his arm. It bright and noisy!! Plus the hammer and phone both are unattached to the toy and they can be played with when not playing with the workshop. I have a 7 year old who thought this toy was a real hoot.

What I disliked about this book (starting on page 3 \\"The Vedic Religion\\") is that the author goes out of his way to link Indian accomplishments to fanciful European or non Indian influences without any citation or even a plausible theory. This causes the non novice practitioner of Buddhism to question even the most basic facts presented by the author. Max Mueller, Thomas McCully Aryan invasion theory was based on pseudo science and racism, and has been disproven by archeological evidence. why is it being present in this book as fact? The Vedas never even mentions an Aryan homeland. If I were an invader I think I would make sure my history and origin was keep alive.

A clean chain is a MUST.Once on, you won't believe the outcome. It goes on clean & stays clean. You will not find yourself giving the chain a thorough cleaning again for a long while.

Don't forget to shake the bottle well before each use!EDIT: I have grown to like this stuff so much that I just ordered a quart bottle ($$ouch!) of it to refill smaller dispensers. FAR superior to oils, unless you like oil on your clothes and skin. Only drawback is that you have to use it every 50 miles or so to have a quiet chain that doesn't sap energy. On really long rides I often stop every 40-50 miles to relube chain.Actually, there is another issue that might be a drawback for some. It can accumulate on your wheel. Doesn't bother me.

You will find scores and tablatures for most of the instruments used in the record sessions (sorry, no orchestras parts), always including guitars, bass and drums. The songs are very close to the actual recording, and so are a little bit hard to play. You can simplify using the chords shown above the scores, but if you are not interested in solos and perfect playing you should buy simpler material. There are a few typos and the lyrics and notes are very small.

You can't play through an entire song while looking in this book. As all songs are written down with vocals, two different guitars, bass, drums etc in parallel, you have to scroll through several pages to get through the song. In order compress all this information into as few pages as possible the author have used very small types. So you need to keep your head close to the book while playing if you want to get the information. This makes me think this book is written for \\"conductors\\" and teachers who want to get the whole picture in order to instruct groups and ensembles, and not for the individual musicians. Probably this book would work out well as bedside lecture for the theoretically minded musicians.

The Beatles are great but it's impossible to get a feel for their music by playing from this book. They often played with several guitars and overdubbed alot, particularly in their later work. Therefore, trying to play many of their songs from this book is incomplete unless you have a whole band to play with. The INCREDIBLY small print is a pain to read as well. I would reccomend getting The Beatles Complete Chord Book instead. It's not in tab form, but if you are good enough to play most of their stuff, you can probably figure out the picking/soloing yourself. If you are still not satisfied, there are alot of good free websites with guitar tabs that have most of their songs, including good versions of Dear Prudence, Blackbird, Julia etc. The version of Blackbird wasn't even that good in this book.

There are many wrong voicings of chords, capoed parts written without capos ('Nowhere Man', 'Michelle'), missed notes and missed parts.As for the later songs, the transcription of the piano part for 'Lady Madonna' is a joke and the other piano parts are well wide of the mark. Also, the fact that George Martin's groundbeaking orchestrations are reduced to single, cursory staves marked 'strings' or 'brass' is wholly inadequate.This is an expensive book which does not live up the claim on its cover.

Which should have been one, not on....speak you mind. Do I need to explain this one?...as a big rig blew by during 70 miles per hour. What? Maybe \\"doing\\"?The problem was all these errors were in 2 Kindle pages! I can understand one or two typo's in an entire book, but this was worse than a high school paper.

But after one week use, it started to get foggy, then worse and worse. Now it gets foggy just in 5 seconds when I start to swim. After one lap, I am totally blind, too foggy. I even have little water leak too. As all other good reviews, I think I maybe just got the defective item. But I read all the reviews, lots of people had the same problem like I have. I don't think this is a very reliable product. I just contacted Amazon to return it. I don't know how much refund I could get it back, but I will be happy just get part of money back, cause it's totally trash for me. I could just throw it in the trash. I am going to get a pair at Walmart then."},{"rating":"1","title":"everything looks magnified, ant-fog fails","review":"the first time I swam with these it took a little getting used to. in the water everything looks magnified, it was disorienting because the object in front of you is much closer than it appears through the goggles. and the issue only exists when viewing under water. the first couple of lap I swam I had issue in judging when I was going to hit the wall.also this pair of goggle has quite a bit of blind spot, you can't really see around you unless you really turn your head. this is due to the small lens.only good thing about this goggle is the anti-fog, no more stopping between laps to adjust goggle. but I would definitely not purchase the vanquisher again. I will stick with my old aqua sphere kaiman, which has much larger lens and no weird magnifications.EDIT: anti-fog coating failed after just 2 weeks. Horrible goggles, half way down a lap and I could barely see anything other than my hands. Will never purchase again. Completely useless in water."},{"rating":"1","title":"great fit, but fogs up","review":"i bought these for my wife as i have the first vanquisher and have nothing but good things to say about them. however, for both me and the wife both lenses of the vanquisher 2.0 fog up within 10-15 seconds in a pool. i switched out the nose piece to a narrower one to see if that would resolve the problem but got no better results. i am disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"the product is good, and the color is suitable for teenagers. pretty good, I like it.

Also as nice looking as goggles could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"they fit very well and stay on!","review":"I've tried numerous goggles over time, as I used to be a competitive swimmer. These are definitely one of the best ones out there. I wear contact lenses so it's important that water doesn't get in the goggles and they always stay on. I also have a smaller face than normal, so it's hard to find the perfect pair of goggles. Even when jumping/diving in though, these stayed on. They are also quite comfortable. I have the violet one, and it looks pretty nice too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible","review":"How did any of you change the nose piece size?

These goggles began fogging up from the very first time I used them in the pool. I have been very careful to follow the package instructions about not wiping, spitting, etc on the eyepiece surfaces but every time I use them they are totally fogged up within two laps of swimming. I have tried adjusting the nose pieces but that has not helped either. Unfortunately I waited too long to return them and am now stuck with them. I do not recommend them at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Wanted to Like These Goggles-Blue Vanquisher","review":"I am a beginner swimmer and really wanted to like these goggles, which I've owned for a week and used four times. I'd heard and read so many wonderful things about the Vanquisher that I didn't feel like I needed to spend much time deciding on which goggles to buy. I was wrong.Pros: the straps are easy to adjust but not so easy that they'll un-adjust themselves; it's comfortable to wear (getting them on is a little challenging for me); it comes with three nose pieces for a customized fit.Cons: it leaks just a tiny bit. Maybe I am not using the right nose piece; it also fogs. This is a major problem for me because I cannot wear contact lenses, so I'm already swimming a little blind. Top it off with foggy tinted lenses and I'm lucky I don't smash into the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love! Love it!","review":"I so love this goggle, the colour, the fit, the style.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best women's goggles","review":"I buy these for my daughter routinely, she is the swimmer.

The nose pieces are a bit difficult to switch out, but I was able to do it with no problem. The straps are easy to adjust and result in a snug fit. My experience in the pool was great. No leaks and great visabiity. I rinsed the goggles under regular water in the bathroom sink before I took a shower. After I got out of the shower, I went to put them in my bag, and I noticed that the lenses looked like they had cracked. After further inspection, I realized that the anti-fog coating was coming off after just one use in the pool.I really like these goggles, and they were great the one and only time I got to use them. I'm hoping that I just got a defective pair, and I'll be able to replace them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best goggles in the world!","review":"I am a competitive swimmer and long ago decided these goggles were the best, and this purchase continues to confirm this decision.

She swims thrice a week, and is a serious swimmer. When she first got it, she seemed very happy with it and could swim for long periods without having to adjust them. But now, water gets in constantly. No matter how much the band is adjusted - tightened, loosened - worn at different angles, it just won't protect her eyes. They also seem to get foggy at the end of every lap. She takes care of it as suggested, by rinsing them with clean water at the end of each session. For a $17 product, we don't seem to have gotten our money's worth. I wouldn't buy this pair again.The two stars are for Amazon's packaging and speed of delivery!

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the mirrored lenses bother me when swimming in the ocean (I see my eyeballs rather than the fishes) - the men's Vanquishers have clear lenses which I prefer.

It worked well the first time and I really enjoyed doing laps. Managed to do more than 10 laps fog free on that day I got them. The next time I tried they fogged up midway doing the first lap. Rendered them quite useless and wasted time going to the pool.Pros: They wear comfortably, I had no goggle marks on my face and it immediately sticks to your eye sockets nicely when you put them on because of the suction.Cons: Foggy. Probably after 2nd or 3rd usage. Save the money or buy a different pair.

Then \\"Terraform\\" came out, and everybody bitched about the 12 minute lead-off track. That album was more mellow Shellac, with some kickers thrown in. But come on, people! It had \\"This is a Picture\\", and \\"Copper\\" on it, two of Shellac's strongest tracks, the kind that make you bounce of the walls.\\"1000 Hurts\\" takes it all a step further, and it seems that Steve and Co. are literally out for blood. It also is proof, in my humble indie opinion, that Shellac will continue to bust out albums under 40 minutes that are of the highest quality possible.Steve Albini: genius guitarist.

The big difference is Santiago Durango's guitar jangle present in Big Black (as well as Naked Raygun early tunes) isn't here. Instead the vocals are given center stage which made this album more difficult for me to get into.

It seems like steve may be a bit board and lacking much enthusiasm for \\"it\\" anymore and it comes through. It left me feeling drained...which is not a feeling I am fond of these days, regardless of his goals. I do not expect people/bands to always put out 10's each release, but I am also not interested in paying to listen to someone else's disinterest.

What is the point of challenging everyone else's taste and credibility? This album is excellent, a bit different from Shellac's other releases, but that's the point, different emotions, and feelings go into the production of each album, Steve Albini is one of the only people in music today who makes good choices. Go buy this Record (not CD)."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"steve albini sounds tired. every other review seems to tote \\"prayer to god\\" like its some major breakthrough. i think he's just screwing around on that one actually. matter o' fact, it sounds like he's pretty much screwing around on the whole record. everything that WAS inventive about shellac is now not. for someone who prided themselves on breaking up his bands just after they hit their peak, albini sure missed the mark w/ shellac.. they try to break new ground with songs like new number order and song against itself, and it's quite sad.. mamma gina and QRJ are just mastabatorial nonsense. oooo is that a drum roll? wow! ok, ok, squirrel song kicks a little ass, but that's IT.to use a tired metaphor: watching the career of shellac is like watching a pretty girl go fat. if you really try, you can see the hot skinny chick she once was, but it's getting harder and harder to.. anyway, it's just a damned shame she got all fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel embarassed for Steve Albini when I listen to this.","review":"This is one of the worst, not to mention most downright annoying albums to come out in recent memory. Anyone who claims to like this overrated insult to underground music is just trying to sound cool, and failing miserably. In fact, I'll go out on a limb here and say that anyone who says they like this album hasn't even heard the damn thing, and probably just saw it on a pitchfork list somewhere - and if pitchfork says it's good, it must be good, right? Wrong. This album sucks. It's sad to see people so desperate for indie cred (which, I hate to break it to you, isn't that cool either) that they degrade themselves by publicly admitting they enjoy this album. However, I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys hearing Steve Albini ramble on like a douche, with mediocore music being played in the background. Everyone else, save yourself the trouble and the $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but flimsy base","review":"while the heart-shaped tube is awfully cute, the plastic base that it sits upon is really flimsy and cheaply made. the bottom (underneath) is made of basically cardboard, and it was already somewhat buckled when i took it out of the package--it doesn't even sit flat on a shelf. also, the piece of \\"metal\\" included that you can have monogrammed is not impressive, either. sorry to be negative, but i'm just being honest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enduring music pleasure","review":"I'm still listening to this record after twenty years! Suzie Hug's vocals are fabulous and the music just works. I still get pleasure from going back and listening to these incredibly catchy tunes regularly.

Their guitar sound is unique, as is their song structure, which is rare these days.This is not the simplistic prog of supergroups like Spocks Beard, with their long, yet almost predictable, songs.

Before this my husband was haphazardly strapping in the pickup bed and it was just awkward! My husband didn't think we needed this but I ordered it anyway and he was quick to put it on his truck and we both love it. Nice little loops on each end to strap the canoe and it is adjustable to use with my Jeep if I want to put the canoe on top of that. The packaging was fine and was in good shape when it landed at my door."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for being made of actual metal!","review":"I was expecting a more stable fit and better build quality. Also didn't expect the product to be dropped from the sky by UPS either, well that is how it looked like the package was delivered. The box it came in was destroyed, if they didn't just leave it without ringing the bell, I would have refused it. Shockingly all the parts it appears were there, just covered in rust dust. Every single piece was covered in this dust, even the inside of the product. The product is made of square steel tubing, even where it fits into the receiver. The fit in the receiver is not acceptable. I have a BACKRACK on my pickup and was going to use this product with it to carry a 40' ladder. If you are simply using it to \\"EXTEND\\" your bed to carry a canoe or kayak it will be fine. To use in a vertical manner as they show, would be silly with the amount of movement that occurs at the top. For the price I was expecting much better quality, I should have known better for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"idea good/fit bad","review":"I choose this truck extender hoping to miss some of the problems associated with the other model on amazon. Unfortunately, this model also suffers from some less than excellent production methods. The two pieces that go together to adjust the height of the support have 5/8 inch holes that do not line up, making use of the included pin impossible. I was able to use this item only because I wanted to transport lightweight mouldings, so I used a 1/2 inch pin instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price, performs as advertised","review":"I used the product for the first time today, and as far as I'm concerned, it's already paid for itself. My truck, though full-size, only has a 5-1/2' bed. I needed to carry 16' long lumber. This product was the answer. Easy (child's play) to install, simple concept, very effective in doing what it's supposed to do - extend the carrying capacity of your vehicle. May not need it often, but I'm sure glad I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"extend-a-bed","review":"This is an excellent product for an excellent price.

It stores inside itself, requiring very little space when not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The PERFECT solution for transporting our kayaks!","review":"We had been searching for an easy way to transport our kayaks. We used to transport them on roof racks, which were a pain. We planned on having a special trailer made, but didn't really want to spend that much and didn't like the thought of how much room it would take to store the trailer when not in use. We were so happy to have found the Extend-A-Truck. The price was right, it was easy to install, and it just takes minutes to load our kayaks! Best of all, it takes up basically no space in our garage when not in use! We highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bed extender is great!","review":"I had thought about making something to haul my kayaks, then I saw this bed extender.

Soild, strap hook points, adjustable. I've installed in both horizantal (as shown) and vertical. I did however weld shims onto the hitch point to increase stability. A little sloppy with low wieght. But great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"lumberhaul","review":"Have used the bed extender so far to haul lumber to jobsites. works good but you should use common sense as to how much you think you should load up the rack.

Make sure you have plenty of rope or straps as you need to secure the rack as well as the load."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"Extend-a-truck was just what I needed to be able to carry my kayaks while towing a 5th wheel trailer. The only thing I needed to do was to get an extension so that the top bar was the same height as the rack on my F350. Product was shipped and arrived before they estimated at time of order. Overall experience was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited positions","review":"The Darby bed extender can be mounted in two positions: crossbar at bed height and 4' behind the bumper, or crossbar at roof height with vertical post so close to bumper you can't open the tailgate. Not enough choices, unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but quality questionable","review":"I just received the Darby Extend a Truck. Package appeared to have been opened before and taped shut again. Mounted it on my truck and the T-bar appeared crooked. Got out the old square and found the T-section was out of square by about 1/2 inch over a 2 foot section, making one side appear 1 inch lower than the other side. Plan to call the company and see if they'll send me a new T-Section. Otherwise I'll take it to a welder and have him square it up. I'm sure it will work OK for carrying kayaks, but they ought to check to make sure the T-section is square. Not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk About Customer Service","review":"I purchased a Darby Extend A Truck many years ago and had no problem with it until recently when I visited Lowe's to pick up some lumber. Someone, while I was in purchasing the wood, and as an example of one of the lowest of human deeds, purloined the T part of my Darby Extend A Truck. I had no idea how I would replace it as trying social, sale and other sites produced nothing. As a last resort, which should have been my first choice, I called Darby. Talk about customer service! The gentleman took my name and address and sent one right out and at a very \\"reasonable\\" charge. They not only have a quality product but they value their customers. A company that has a presence the best of both worlds! Go Darby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Just what I wanted. Works exteneded out horizontally or upright with my Pro-Rack. Nice not to have a rear rail to bang your head on getting in and out of the bed of the truck. No issues in parking garages or house garage with an permanently installed rack system height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truck Bed Extender","review":"Great item. I have a short bed and Extend-A-Bed works well for all my hauling needs. 10 ~ 14 foot material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this bed extender! I have used it to carry my canoe in the bed of my truck and above my truck on longer drives. Both positions work really well. It's pretty durable and has a pretty good range of adjustments for different heights. My only complaint would be that it sits a little loose in the hitch receiver, but once everything is strapped down, it's all secure. It's not going anywhere. The locking pins that are included are good, but I replaced them with the locking kind, so I don't come back from the water to find that someone needed my canoe rack more than me. Works great for lumber too. I would definitely recommend this to other people, and already have several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truck Bed Extender works for vans","review":"I don't have a truck but use my mini-van cabin and roof to move a fair amount of materials for your week end warrior.

I suppose it takes a certain amount of willingness to believe the statements being made in this book, but having read at least forty other books on this anomaly that cover various factions of the UFO subject, I find the evidence compelling, to say the least.This was the first book that gave satisfactory clarification to much of the muddied, often mis-leading material from other expose's on the subject. The only thing I really question is, if these aliens are so altruistic by wanting to assist humankind in solving our self-destructive ways, then why have they continued (for at least fifty years, probably more) to allow people of highly questionable moral integrity to be the keepers of their secrets, so often at the cost of innocent lives?A great, great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disclosure","review":"Must have book... Reveals really interesting information about UFO and what the U.S. government thinks about it, as well as tells us the extent to which the government will go to hide it's secrets.

Please let me point out that I'm not a \\"skeptic.\\" I have long been convinced that ET interaction is a reality. However, while a few of the interviews in this book are sincere and quite probably valid, nearly all of the testimony from people claiming to have substantive or direct knowledge is manifestly invalid. Let me say it more plainly: the book is filled with plainly delusional reports. If you know anything of history and basic science and how governments and corporations operate, you just shudder at the blatant fantasies being poured out by some of these folks. Very few, if any, could stand up to even mild questioning. The price of this book was not well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info mixed with disinformation","review":"After reading the entire book, I find the reports about the physical crafts mostly credible.

One day he submitted one of his papers to the school newspaper, and it was rejected. One of his friends asked him what he was going to do he said \\"What can I do blow up the school and massacre all the students?\\" Some one heard and told on him. Later that day, two detectives took him away. A few people heard what he said but didn't have the courage to tell anyone. Everyone that is but, Ursula. Ursula has always been known as an Ugly Girl because she is bigger and meaner than all the other girls, and most of the boys. She tells the principle what Matt says and gets him out of trouble, at school. The accusation made Matt's parents really mad, and screwed up most of their life, so they want to sue the school. Because of this problems come along with it. The media never leaves Matt and Ursula alone and some one is trying to get Matt's life really messed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crucible Meets Town Without Pity!","review":"In an era of post-Columbine hysteria, an innocent joke is turned into a circus of wild, irrational accusations and convoluted media commentary. Big Mouth & Ugly Girl are the two main characters of Joyce Carol Oates' novel, and the story is told through their observations, conversations and correspondence. It's both amusing and infuriating to see the plot unfold. You know where it's all going, and secondary characters are trotted out to move it all along. The bigots, phonies, dumb jocks, cowardly administrators and more are almost cardboard cut-outs propped up to decorate a stage.There are no huge surprises in Big Mouth & Ugly girl, but it is a story well-told. It is certainly worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"To know who are your friends!","review":"Ursula Riggs is 16 years old and an outsider but she does not care about it. The other major character is Matt and very popular until he is accused blowing up the school. Every friend breaks up the contact and only Ursula wants to prove his innocence. They become friends very slowly and at the end they even come together.I do not like that you need a very long breath to read through this book. You are waiting that something happens and it does not. It is sometimes very boring. What I like is the growing friendship between Ursula and Matt. At the beginning they do not know each other and later they realize who are their real friends.In addition to that I would say that it is not written in a difficult English and it could be read by people at the age of 14."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great!","review":"Matt (a/k/a \\"Big Mouth\\") is sort of a popular guy, until one day he says something that gets misinterpreted. Ursula (a/k/a \\"Ugly Girl\\") is a loner who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her -- but she knows the truth about what Matt said. When Ursula comes to Matt's defense, the two are thrown together in an unlikely friendship. This book is really realistic about the way teenagers relate to one another. I especially liked the parts with the e-mails. The characters were interesting, and I wanted to read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"This book was so powerful and so well writen and completely awed me of Joyce Carol Oates.

It didnt begin the way I had expected it to begin. It was a refreshing shock, reading this new tale by Joyce.Matt Donaghy is a popular boy who finds himself in the midst of a school scandal. A prodigal jokester, he is indignant about this wrongful accusation. Big Mouth...Ursula Riggs is a strong tomboyish girl, who won't take any mess from anyone. A rebellious athlete, she finds herself in cahoots with Matt after an encouraging email. Ugly Girl...They develop an uncanny friendship, funny and acute. They find they have a lot in common. And they push through this struggle together.All in all, I was surprised by the freshness of this book. Joyce connects with teens in a way that is virtually unseen in may of today's literature. I definetely reccomend this to anyone in search of something to relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't succumb to the hostility of others","review":"This book offers a glimpse into the lives of two unique high school students. One is a definite outcast, and the other becomes one over the course of the book. Big Mouth and Ugly Girl is an excellent novel because the characters act \\"outside the box.\\" Both of them undergo numerous hardships throughout the course of the book, and they take comfort in unlikely places; each other. This book will teach you to look beneath the surface and discover who they truly are instead of acting like all the rest of the kids at the high school; so ready to point fingers and accuse people at the drop of a hat. I adamantly recommend this book to everyone whether they are in high school or not, they will surely learn something from Big Mouth & Ugly Girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A junior mixup","review":"This book was as interesting as strange to those new to Ms. Oates.

This is not a book that would keep you excited throughout the whole story, but it's not so boring that you won't want to finish it.In this book the main character Matt Donaghy is supposely accused for something that he said, but he apparenly never said it. No one in the school knows if his side of the story is true or if he really did say something worth being accused for.Matt loses a lot when no one believes him, but he starts to think that he's gained more than he ever lost.This book takes Matt through thick and thin and back to thick again leading him on an outrageous high school journey.I liked this book pretty well and I think if you will read it you will like it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Child Development","review":"As far as textbooks go this is a pretty good one.

To just listen is not quite as good. It sets you up for expectation of more, and doesn't deliver. Also to spend nearly $20 for less than 15 minutes of music is ridiculous. Yeah, I know it's an import and all but I still felt cheated. It's like kinda cool, but not great and then it's over before you even get a chance to get into it. Lame.

Great in the car, on the plane, much better than drive-through and gas station fare.

I will just buy it in local store or Shiseido's website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the Herbie Mann Live Recordings","review":"Let me preface this review by stating from the beginning, I am a huge fan of Herbie Mann's music. I've been listening to him since 1974, soon after I began learning to play the flute.Like many jazz musicians, Herbie Mann was able to convey the energy/vibe from the crowd, back to the audience. This is especially evident in the second of the Live at Newport recordings, \\"Standing Ovation.\\" Listen to the encore of \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" and you'll hear what I mean. On \\"New Mann at Newport\\" Herbie's solos sound just a bit forced and it seems to me that there's a certain cohesiveness that's lacking. The title also seems ironic since the playing seems to be trying to recapture the magic of the previous Newport recordings.Herbie Mann recorded a genuinely satisfying wealth of music to listen to. If you're looking to get started, I suggest you check out my list here on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard To Find","review":"Good country style and production in stories that many of us know and lived.

Like Kristofferson or Mellencamp, Thomas tells stories without being overly jingoistic or opportunistic. During this time of unrest, I found this record to be extremely valuable in putting a human heart/face to the thousands of soldiers I see on the evening news each night.

Linda Nevins tells her story beautifully--this book is what my wife and I call \\"a gripper.\\" Normally I avoid family sagas, but I am delighted that I didn't let that stop me this time. This book is really about two women, one who lived in the late 19th century and her great-grandaughter, who lives today. Both of them are admirable. A great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating family saga, plus","review":"This is an intricate tale told by a skilled story-teller. Since Boston is close-by, the locations are familiar to me as is the character of John Singer Sargent. Ms. Nevins captured the Victorian period beautifully and developed her characters, especially Zoe, with an understanding of human nature and human failings. This novel brings you into the highs and lows of two lives which are generations apart, yet so close to one another in many ways. Reading this novel leaves you wanting to read more by this author, which is the biggest compliment which can be bestowed upon any artist of the written word. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright bright bright","review":"I've never liked yellowish light, so I bought two of these for a bedroom.

I will cite King Crimson, Fairport Convention and Return To Forever among the many others. If you like music from that era, you will want to pick this CD up. The material is not as challenging as Ex Tenebris, but this disc is a more polished piece of work. This is for the most part a quiet, mellow affair, but there are those occasion loud passages. There is plenty here to keep you musicians thinking. There are even a couple of marketable tracks here. The Last Rose Of Summer and Paper Moon could get this band some publicity. I don't know why the marketing types slap the Goth label on this disc. That distinction belongs on Signal To Noise, but not here. This disc is straight from the early Prog school and it compares quite favourably with the material from that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm.","review":"I never slam music, because it is open for interpretation.

Now that I have \\"Sacrament\\", I understand why: they're really, really boring. No one told me about them before because they're not worth mentioning.The songs are dull, the playing pedestrian, the singing wan, and the sound of the album so subdued it fades into the slightest background noise. There's no substance, no character, no assertiveness, subtlety, quirk, theme or innovation to grab on to.There's nothing progressive going on here. However, the album does have its uses - I'm confident it will put even the most frantic and desperate insomniac to sleep.Insipid, [bad] and completely lacking in direction: Easily the worst of the last 200 albums I've bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stacey's True Friendship","review":"I rate this book 5 stars.

It is not a scholarly work. There are no footnotes to check quotes or attribution to see whether statements or remarks are taken out of context. The author is short on history. Under the imprimatur of the Yale University Press, it is more a peep show that masquerades as a book. (For that alone, the Press should be ashamed and one wonders about its editorial policies to accept such a tome.) It is neither \\"honest\\" nor \\"wise\\" as suggested on its back. One hopes that the author had the courage of her convictions to make these ad hominem attacks personally first to the persons that she directs her imprecations.The Late Professor Strauss deserves better.It is not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"*review of review*","review":"Just a note to the reviewer who mentioned Hayek's *Constitution of Liberty*, and the postscript \\"Why I am not a Conservative.\\" That reviewer clearly did not read, or did not understand what Hayek was talking about. Hayek's point was that he was not a conservative in the original sense of the word.

How professional is that?No value what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time and money","review":"This is the worst photography (or any other subject matter) DVD I have had the misfortune of paying for. It is contains pathetic, amateurish 'lighting' experiments. The tawrdry model is full of body piercings and tattoos. The photographer parades around in a black, see-through stocking outfit in one shooting sequence, and then treats us to a view of her shrunken breasts when she photographs herself in blue light. I think the real purpose of the DVD was to give the photographer a means to exhibit herself when no one would hire her as a model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photography Experiments--A great value","review":"Photography Experiments is an inexpensive, yet useful guide for working with amateur models. The primary focus of the DVD is on the relationship between photographer and model, and how to bring creative ideas to fruition during a photoshoot. There is not a lot of photographic-specific technical information here... if you want f-stops and lighting setups, this is not your guide. However, if you want sound advice on how to relate to your model... and get the most from your model during a photoshoot, this DVD is well worth the price. \\"Kudos\\" to the Producer and the Distributer--Photography Experiments is a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video if you're looking to increase your creativity","review":"If you're looking for a photography \\"how-to\\" video (or some kind of \\"Playboy\\" style video), you'll likely be disappointed with this DVD. HOWEVER...if you're an artistic photographer looking for help with the creative side of your work - I think you will find it quite useful.It starts a little slowly, but quickly takes off after just a few minutes! I got a few direct ideas from it, but what was most valuable to me was help with \\"thinking outside the box\\" more. I felt that this video was more \\"inspirational\\" than \\"educational\\" - which is really the more difficult material to find (IMHO). Technique without creativity can only take you so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sensual Approach","review":"This film explores creative experiments in photography, lighting, and costuming that you can do with models/amateur models, or that you might try with your wife or girlfriend. I found that the film's narration was informative without being too technical, and the photographer explained what she was doing to the model she was working with, and us the viewing audience. The film moves at a relaxed pace, to display the workings of a real time photo shoot in each experiment presented. I found that one of the most valuable lessons shown in this film was how a relaxed and open communication with the model, can really bring out her sensuality. Experiments is a sensual approach to photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star, because 0 isn't an option","review":"A fully regrettable purchase. Amateur in every respect.

His mother Jenny has been killed and Bo is now an orphan. From here the story continues with both sets of grandparents fighting for custody of Bo. The white grandparents only want Bo when they come to the realization that there may be some money involved. The story of the whole custody battle was slow moving and really not developed enough.I enjoyed parts of the book but really felt it could have been a little less confusing in its depiction. It was somewhat disjointed and the characters never became real to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing novel with TV-movie plot","review":"This novel was a major disappointment, especially after reading a positive review of the book. The point of view alternates among several individuals involved with the small boy, including that of the boy itself--if you like reams and reams of baby-talk, then this book is for you. Grown-ups would have preferred that the author had fashioned a less predictable plot (conflict over custody between black and white grandparents) that seems calculated for a movie or TV sale.

There is the matter of the missing $11-12 million dollars from a bank robbery that has people guessing. As bodies turn up, the Feds get involved. This is a typical crime movie with killings, gang girls, and tough talk. This movie has a fairly decent rock sound track. They frequently use the split screen technique to show us they used 2 cameras to film the same scene. The pace is decent. The plot is easy to follow. Matthew Marsden plays Madso, a mid-level crime boss trying to survive and figure out what is happening around him as his world caves in.

Even in other parts of the books which teaches you how to draw things OTHER than body parts, it also includes nudity. I have many examples, but only 2 will be said: When they teach to draw the neck and water drops/sweat. So if you want to draw females, head over to pretty gals (great book) this one does not teach you to draw female characters but they teach you how to draw naked girls. Only a small part of it doesnt, and mostly its \\"learn from the pros\\" which the author of this book did not draw the images in their, but got from other artists.

I hope you find this review helpful, so do not waste your money and do not get this for young children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to draw manga or females in sexual positions?","review":"Thinking this book would make drawing the female form easier in the manga style might not be the best motivation for buying this book. The book is almost completely based on sexual positions you may want to draw in and in my opinion isn't what drawing the female figure should be about. Buy this if your not interested in drawing anything but dirty pictures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what in the...?","review":"this book is full of kiddy porn, for some dirty old men, but other then that I didn't learn any thing, save your$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you want some cheap soft porn","review":"My son bought this book because he is interested in drawing. I guess I should have read the book before allowing my teenager to have it, but I didn't know Amazon sold soft porn. Lots of crotch shots and \\"the female breast at rest, and jiggling.\\" There was little if anything on actually how TO DRAW, just good pics to look at for a (really) cheap thrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature theme but great instruction","review":"Like other reviews say, this is an intermediate or advanced book and not for a beginner. But if you can draw what you see fairly well, your skill for drawing manga girls will greatly increase after parsing through this great material. I broke out the \\"newsprint\\" pad, pencil set and sharpener, and drew along with every picture in this book over a 15 or so day period. And my skills went way up - I'm now very comfortable creating a manga girl from scratch. Highly recommended, although not the best book to carry around because of the mature theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful at best","review":"This book did not help me at all. Breasts, buttocks, crotch, and tastless panty shots took up the majority of the book, though I found a few helpful hints. I guess guess the \\"techniques for drawing female characters\\" was different from my expectations. The male character book wasn't anything like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Illustrations","review":"As other reviewers noted the book is abound with upper body nudity and some rather indecent panty shots (Which are made all the more hilarious by little warnings \\"Be careful not to draw the crotch in too much detail. Otherwise the affect is obscene\\" they should have told the illustrators that. Despite pages on n the jiggling of the breast drawing the female face and portraying different female characters is almost non-existent. Add into that the poor illustrations and the affect is a pure waste of money. The illustrations were rather crude and unrefined and not something you want to aspire to.If you really want to draw female characters check out Volume 2 of \\"more How to Draw Manga\\" by go office. Although, the title is officially penning characters there's a lot about female body types and the art is consistently top notch. It also briefly talks about women's eyes, a very important feature of any manga character.Just save your money and don't bother with this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from the Best","review":"I got this book when i got into drawing and was disgusted to find it did'nt really help me at all. I only gave it two stars because it gives you a few examples to look at if you really need them. and if your gonna draw something more for an ADULT kind of cartoon. There was more on how to draw breasts in diffrent postions and how it'd look with diffrent hands holding it then how to draw legs and arms. combined. it's alright if your deperate. but don't waiste your money otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good source for anatomy","review":"I found this book very good for teaching how to draw the female figure. Sure they focused on certain areas more than neccisary, but oh well. I have always struggled drawing the female figure and found this book very informative.And to those who called this porn or hentai:1. You have to learn to draw the human form nude to learn proportions and how clothes fall on a person.2. Nudity in art is not porn. It's art. Don't believe me. Go to an art museum.Grow up. If you are a parent then you should be checking on what your children are ordering anyway. That or be a bit more open minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"slighlty disapointing","review":"Some of the drawings in this book were disapointing because they look like they were made by someone who doesn't know how to draw manga. Some are sloppy, in some it is evident that they were made in less than 10 seconds. Those are mostly in the first chapter, so from the 2nd chapter until the end, the book gets much betterI would recommend it to people who are not beginners and who don't mind using liquid corrector to get rid of the less-than-satisfying drawings"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book for people who have experience on drawing manga","review":"this book is great even if it does have nudity but theres a purpose for it so the artist can see how the clothes fit on your female character it shows the different angles of different views you can draw your character there are a good amount of poses. and how to do eyes, legs of different lengths and size, hands, feet and for those who like to draw there characters in water it explains how the water drops flow on the body. So in other words this book is good.it doesn't earn its fifth cause there are some poses half done meaning they don't show the head and face so if you are trying to draw that pose you have to assume how the heads shape is suppose to be buy the book anyways because it has help me a lot so it could do some good for you ^-^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not OEM quality","review":"Either Lenovo has changed the spec, or these are cheap imitations.

Rod assumes at least some familiarity with construction jargon. For construction illiterates like me, some of his explanations leave me wondering what he is saying and it is at least in part due to terminology I'm not familiar with. A glossary would help. I also wish he'd deal a little more with how to work around, or options for improving, existing construction, like an existing window or door you might want to keep.Overall, this book is well worth the price for the wealth of detail about materials and construction techniques alone. It will be a great reference book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is a must have for anyone considering building a studio in their house.

It describes several of the most efficent DIY designs which can be used even in professional studios, but one thing people doesn't understand is: There is no easier way to get professional insulation with \\"home tricks\\", so the book explains the only ways to get it (not cheap, not easy).

This book was nothing more than a Pan-African manual that is probably passed out in meetings. Chances are, if the book is published by a dodgy publisher, it wasn't approved by credible academics. Nascimento creates his own definition of genocide. Not to say that Africans never endured hardship and atrocity in Brazil, but it is not genocide. Works like this one are dangerous because it is written to serve a political agenda instead of providing an objective truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blip!","review":"I had hoped to see more of these guys than we did, but I guess they were never more than the sum of the Holt Brothers' production (see their awesome work with Exodus, and you'll get an idea of the energy and guitar sound you'll get here). It's kind of a knock-off, but Blackfeather Shake and High Strung really do rock. I have to confess that I don't know much about the lyrics the other reviewer discusses, since I tend to focus in on the music and not the words (*shrug*), but I sure can rock out to these tunes. Saw them at The Troubadour in support of this album, and it was a kick-ass show.

The Student Aid Game should be read by anyone interested in making college more accessable to those who are qualified to attend but can not afford it. Schapiro and McPherson demonstrate that increasing Federal Financial Aid greatly increases the participation of minorities and the poor. It is not, however, a book designed to help parents manuever through the paper jungle of financial aid offers and dealing with financial aid offices.

But then I looked at the specs, saw the aspect ratio and realized that it was yet another crappy Disney pan-and-scan hack job.

This movie makes me laugh for all the wrong reasons. The stereotypes are quite amusing. Am I the only one that noticed that Ed Wynn's character at the end is dressed like a \\"pimp\\"?

And after the demise of \\"Zwan\\". It is more than pleasant to see that Billy Corgan has decided to renew his love for music, amoungst other things with his solo cd. For any fans of Billy's work over years i strongly recomend you check out his website. In his owns words he confesses his feelings about the smashing pumpkins. And how there is a possiblity of the group getting back together. i dont know about you but ihave been waiting to hear that ever since dec 2000. But for now lend your ears to \\"the future embrace\\" and lose yourself in the blissfull 12 tracks that are sure to set your heart at ease and mind soaring. Thank you Billy! you have no idea how good it is to hear your voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a million little gnats buzzing around your head","review":"I saw Billy Corgan performing one of his songs on a talk show and couldn't wait to order this CD. Once I got it, I quickly became annoyed with his music.All of the music on the CD is performed with too much reverb. The songs would be great if they were done in a clearer format. You know how the radio sounds when the tuning button is a few pushes from getting the station in clearly? Or stuck between two stations?Half-way through the CD my brain began to feel numb and my head hurt. All the songs began to sound like an annoying bzzzzzzz bzzzzzzzzzzz bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.Distortion effects can be terrific when used with more discretion. Billy, put the pedals away and just play the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak - 2.5 stars","review":"as someone else mentioned, this also reminds me of the new NIN album. two albums by great musicians putting out mediocre stuff. i'm a huge pumpkins fan and thought this would be better. i'd rather listen to this than horrible zwan, but machina was a much better album, or anything else done by the pumpkins. apparently corgan realized the weakness of this album too, because after it was released he decided he wanted to reform the pumpkins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey I saw you in concert.","review":"Billy Corgan kicks ass, pumkins or not (altho i prefer the pumkins).

When Corgan formed Zwan, he lost that Nirvanaeque edge that had the power behind the music. Stil left was the good music with good musicians to back it up, making them a mild success until group dissent and band politics broke them apart. But with Corgan embarking on a highly predicted/expected solo career, he lost the alt-rock edge in deference to an equivocal, electronic sound, and with half of the great musical talent gone (Chamberlain), the album is but a stale ghost of the powerful synergy Corgan had created with the Pumpkins. All in all an disappointment, though a forseeable and expected dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought it...but I'm glad it was someone else's gift","review":"I haven't even listened to the CD in it's entirety, I have only heard Walking Shade and the other clips here on Amazon. Billy is an amazing songwriter, but this CD grasps onto everything I hated about Adore. Everything is drowned out by mass amounts of noise and billy's standard singing methods. There is absolutely no substance to the music at all, it all sounds like a lazy meandering river with no beginning, middle or end. I don't think Billy can pull off the solo thing, he's more suited to showing his musical talents with other artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a surprise!","review":"It is no wonder that Billy has announced the pumpkins will return.

The electronic instrumentation is combined with catchy, and often haunting melodies, much more akin to Motzart than Kraftwerk. The lyrics are abstract, yet resonate with a comfortable familiarity.I absolutely adore the direction this album took, and I'd love to hear more songs like these from Mr. Corgan.But I can handle the Smashing Pumpkins reuniting for now :-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Things Change Indeed","review":"Once I was sad about the pumpkins never getting back together, but I don't really care anymore. With the pumpkins or without them, Corgan is a genius. This album kicks ass!!! We don't find the pumpkin guitar sound anymore or chamberlin's typical rhythms, but Corgan sure worked with new things, cool dizzing guitars, building up such an ooah-m-a-z-i-n-g masterpiece. The standouts : All Things Change - Mina Loy (my old heart)!! - The Cameraeye - A100 - Dia - Walking Shade - Sorrows - PRETTY STAR - and the wonderful Strayz... kinda the entire album..

You rock!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"Billy corgans most consistent/best work yet if you're into the mellow beautiful songs that he creates that are what hooked me to his/smashing pumpkins music in the first place.

Completely love the album, takes a few listens, but once the puzzle comes together, you're hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"BILLY THE MUSICAL PRODIGY","review":"Corgan's talent is unprecedented by all means. His music unparalled, and his thoughts uncommon.This album is a step up from Zwan and a step forward in life. The music is descent and the lyrics are meaning full. A great CD for all the Corgan fans.

Sadly, her attitude is unflinchingly fawning; she seems afraid to say one negative thing about these countries and their economic and political challenges. As well, the writing style is very dry and wooden. Her bias is symbolized by one of the maps showing the UAE as extending westward all the way to Dawhat as Salwa, at the southwest base of Qatar. This reflects absurdly ambitious territorial claims of the UAE at a time when the Saudis have claimed the coast in the vicinity of Khawr Duwayhin, southeast of Qatar. This map is emblematic of the book's flaws. A much better book despite its age (1980) is 'Arabia, the Gulf, & the West' by J.B. Kelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick Flick","review":"\\"Arabella\\" is essentially theater dressed up with operatic music -- showing that Richard Strauss (and Hugo von Hofmannsthal) could reverse the \\"Prima la musica, poi le parole\\" dictum when they wanted.In this case, the theater seems to play to fantasies of vanity, intrigue, and romance that in other places would qualify as chick lit.As usual for Strauss's operas however, \\"Arabella\\" contains a variety of strong, modern psychological characterizations, a nearly unique attribute that combined with Strauss's music makes Strauss's body of operas so much more interesting than many other popular pieces in the genre.The performance and recording on this DVD are exemplary, even though the material is inherently not at the level of the masterpieces that Strauss produced so often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: no subtitles","review":"If you love opera DVDs bez you can learn the opera -- music and words -- this DVD may not be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"This is a wonderful production, superbly directed, sung, acted and filmed. One might nit pick here and there but I'm not a nit picker. Everyone is so perfect in their individual roles, so rightly cast.The acting all around is terrific and just as rich in close ups as from a distance. This is very demanding vocal music that requires extraodinary abilities of the supporting players and they all deliver no matter how small the role. Gorgeously costumed and set in the 1860's, the ladies gowns can be somewhat cumbersome. A rare opera where no one dies although a duel is barely avoided a happy ending ensues joyfully expressed by Mandryka's ecstatic skips as the final curtain descends. Only the very difficult will be disappointed but for those of us who don't know too much, it's a pleasure. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, wrong singer...","review":"I was avidly browsing through the recorded evidence of *Natalie Dessay's* brilliant vocal performances --having recently heard her on a free TV arts network music CD extract. Not realizing that into Ms. Dessay's amazing recordings would be inserted [mirabile dictu] items featuring OTHER operatic personalities such as Bev Sills and Te Kanawa. So... without reading carefully, I mistakenly bought THIS version of Richard Strauss's \\"Arabella.\\" Let this be a warning to all semi-conscious shoppers. Dessay sings Strauss inimitably.And I WILL succeed in finding the \\"holy grail\\" of her performance. But, woe is me! Until then, I shall haveto be content with Kanawa. Sorry, wrong singer.... And I can't blame Amazon for misleading me (I think)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I'm quite happy with this score which was given to me as a Christmas present(!).Despite the small print size, it is completely legible apart from a couple of places where the staff lines are a bit faint - but still discernible. The printing is better than some other Dover reblications I have encountered (and some Eulenburgs also).NB: This score was first published in Moscow in 1912, by Editions Russe de Musique. Hence it is the 1911 version not the 1947 one."},{"rating":"2","title":"original score","review":"I got this score because the orchestra I belong to was going to play this piece and thought it'd give me a better understanding of it. This score has a clear description of each tableau and detailed stage directions whenever the mood or musical theme changes, and has been a great help for me to understand what's happening in this ballet. However, this is an original score and while very helpful as a whole, since my orchestra was playing the revised edidtion, there were many differences between them in instrumentation, sometimes in a number of measures and even time signatures, and sometimes it was very confusing. Although I was glad that I had this score while practicing this piece, I did wish if I'd gotten the revised version. Beware of the type of edition you want to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our families' favoritebook-on-tape","review":"This is a delightful version of this book by the author of Anne of Green Gables. We first listened to the story when we drove to Prince Edward Island with our young children. I feel that the young woman who reads this story is so perfect for the story, wonderful inflections in her reading, very articulate and expressive. The story is such that you know how much you will love PEI, and you long for the time when everything there was so simple and sweet. This is a good story, but my caution is that it is not a great story for children of divorce. It definitelty plays into the fantasy of every child of a split family that all eventually will work out and with the efforts of the child the parents will eventually get back together. Still it is a fun book, especially Montgomery's description of family members reactions to this young girl and Jane's steps to take control of her life and her happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"colorful, but fairly useless","review":"The content of this book is not up to the quality of paper it is printed on or to the number of colorful pictures. The book is essentially a collection of advertisement of vendors offering photoshop-compatible plugins, which sponsored this book. The author neither attempts to compare the third-party plug-ins with those included into the Photoshop package, nor discusses the advantages and limitations of each plug-in. The enclosed CD containes primarily demo (limited functionality) versions of some plug-ins and programs, but no practical lessons, as most books with CD-ROMs do. If you are looking for an unusual effect which cannot be achieved by using the standard Photoshop filters, this book may help you to find a place where to buy what you need. Generally, you get much less than you would expect to get for this money."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited use; limited scope; outdated","review":"This book helped me to understand the general concept of plug-ins, but that's about all. I found it at half price, but it was hardly worth that to me. The CD is mostly a lot of save-disabled demos and trials for commercial plug-ins. It was written when Photoshop was in version 4.0, so even when it discusses plug-ins that come with Photoshop, it is too outdated. Plug-ins are not discussed in detail - only one (set of) setting(s) per plug-in is covered. I'd like to see a new book on this topic that also covers the multitude of free plug-ins now available. This book doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"desk looks great but shakey","review":"Nice looking desk, but not quality. The desk is not stable enough to hold the hutch.

They should have stuck it out through series one and two, because it becomes clear that the title Without Motive is an irony. The killer may seem without motive, but the people involved with the case, the detectives, the spouses, children, bosses, all have motives for their behaviors, all leading them to actions that are self-destructive, and harmful to the case and others. Some great watching, as the chaos piles up around the detectives, and you're not sure if they'll ever dig themselves out.Also some great acting to be found here, especially from Kenneth Cranham as DCS Henderson.

When we unconditionally release our lives to God, He will work through us to be a blessing to others for His glory.4. God always takes the initiative with us and requires total faith in Him.5. God will reveal His purpose when our heart totally belongs to Him.6. God will use difficult circumstances in our lives to teach us dependence on Him instead of self-reliance.7.

It's indeed a gloomy picture. Arafat's puppet administration sinks deep into corruption whilst steaming in impotent helplessness, as the so-called peace process becomes a transparent tactic to block all real Palestinian aspirations for a viable state in the occupied territories. The Israelis and the US continue to block all real statehood negotiations until 'violence stops', overlooking the crucial fact that Palestinian violence is largely a reaction to the brutal Israeli occupation, and is impossible for Arafat to control while the Israeli settlement and occupation policy continues. So things remain in a deadlock. And meanwhile Said's health deteriorates.

As history or journalism, the book is useless, as it gives no background or context, and darn little content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did we read the same book?","review":"This book was a fascinating read that really opened my eyes to what happened in 1989 during the Tianamen square massacre. I'm not sure the reader from new york and myself read the same book. Salsibury was in his hotel room during some of the events, but I don't blame him. With a totalitarian government's army on the loose against its citizenry, I'm not sure I could call his actions cowardly. This book is a must read for those of you uninformed on the horrific events that occured in this country that we Americans give \\"Most favored Nation\\" status. Happy hunting to find it, since its out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable -- Why don't you have a no-star category?","review":"This is about the stupidest book on China I have ever read, and the worst account of the Tian'anmen Massacre. While people were being killed, he was cowering in his hotel room, upset because the incident was upsetting his TV shooting schedule. Come on get real! A friend sent me t his while I was living in Beijing, and it provided us with some good laughs!

I am considering buying the purple ones, which I wanted more than the black, but which were out of stock at the time of my purchase. The only thing holding me back is the fact that when I received the pair I already ordered (black), this one-size-fits-most item didn't fit at all, and actually could have fit TWO of me. Lucky for me, I'm good with a needle and thread. ;) All the same, it's a bit annoying. They do look nice, though. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda' Okay","review":"They are definitely sexy looking, but I'm a size 6/7, and they are very big. They almost slip right off ...

It is written by a lawyer, whose sole purpose appears to be to get you to use lawyers for everything in life. Forget paraphrasing, I can tell you in depth everything this book taught me in its 209 pages about cleaning up your credit. SUE SUE SUE! In my opinion, Stanley G. Hilton is what's wrong with America today. Nothing is your fault, everything can be blamed on someone else, and you can do that through lawsuits. Unfortunately, there is no zero stars rating, because 1 is about 10 stars too many for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"I read this book and the author is very vague about how you can go about doing some of the things he brings up in the book.At least he could have suggested some lawyers that are versed onhow to proceed with some of this debt elimination tactics that he describes.

The tone, the message ... could hardly believe what I was reading. When I got to the page where Hilton states that credit scores (FICO) range from 0-1000 and are issued by TRW, I knew I couldn't trust this author. Come on, Mr. Hilton! Do your research. TRW has not existed as a credit bureau for at least 10 years and credit scores range from about 350-950 max depending on the credit bureau issuing. Isn't it funny how this clown nit picks and searches for the tiniest little error to have grounds to sue! sue! sue! (recommended repeatedly throughout the book) ... but can make inaccurate statements in his book like it's no big deal. I hope someone sues! sues! sues! him for writing this ridiculous book.

There's also a lot of useful information for running takeover bids, and some fun locations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belfast II","review":"Belfast II is very nice, however, it's difficult to follow a \\"truly anointed-great\\" cd...Belfast. I listen to Belfast even to this day. I've owned it for years and have recommended it to everyone. The words are truly inspiring and the melodies are awesome. Belfast is the type of praise and worship cd that drives you to stand to your feet and praise and worship the Lord even if you never have gotten up and moved before...a cd for the ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful worship with Robin Mark","review":"Revival in Belfast II is a wonderful worship experience. Mark has a gift for bringing his listeners into the presence of God to worship our God with music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"After a hit comes the sequel, which is usually quite bland. Same with this CD. Revival In Belfast was outstanding, but Revival In Belfast II is quite different. Gone is the Celtic beat. Even Robin Mark seems to have lost his Irish brogue. This CD sounds like a million other Christian CCM CD's. Sorry, but if you want a Celtic Christian music CD, this one is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is so funny!","review":"I read this book, and without a doubt it is one of the funniest and clearly direct books on intercession I have ever read. I couldn't stop reading it! He lives with an intercessor so his stories are real, interesting and helped me learn a lot about this cutting edge subject. I highly recommend you read this. If you are an interecessor great! Both men and women intercessors are discussed. If you live with one -- well go for it! Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great for watercolor.....","review":"After getting excited about a new watercolor video by a so called expert, I was really disappointed. He knows his art history, but he paints with watercolor as if it were oil or acrylic. Most of his methods would make a true watercolor artist cringe. It's also a little slow listening to him and he seems a bit full of himself. There are some really great watercolor DVDs out there, this is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing Sing Death House","review":"Clocking in at a mere 29 minutes, this has to be one of the most furious albums in the history of punk rock. Brody was blessed with one of the most powerful voices I've ever heard. Forget about the Kurt Cobain murdering, trashy, fake-as-can-be, actress, sellout Courtney Love. Brody is a million times the vocalist Courtney will ever be. Not only that, but Brody is much better lyrically, and she has a much better band to back her up. On \\"Sing Sing Death House\\" you'll find some of the rawest, yet precise bass lines, as well as some of the fastest drumming known to man. I was lucky enough to catch this band live at a pretty large club venue in Dallas, and it was one of the greatest shows I've ever been to. I also suggest that everyone reading this go out and pick up their other two releases \\"Coral Fang\\" and their self titled debut. You will not be disappointed my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This is a pretty good album. The music oscillates between old school punk and hardcore, but stays pretty melodic and anthemic throughout most of the album. I tend to really like anthemic punk songs, and they definitely have that going for them.However, none of the songs really grabbed me. My favorite songs on the album are \\"The Bullet and the Bullseye,\\" \\"Sing Sing Death House\\" and \\"Desperate.\\" These are fun songs but by no means punk rock masterpieces. All in all, the album is \\"good.\\"Some of the negative things are that is seems a bit too derivative, and a little bit \\"put on.\\" The singer is good overall, but sometimes strikes me like she's trying to sound like Courtney Love sometimes... which is OK, but kinda bugs me a bit. In other words, it doesn't really sound like her singing is really emotionally charged but rather like she's \\"trying\\" to make it sound that way.As another reviewer said, if you like Rancid you should love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"this is a good cd. my favorite songs are the young crazed peeling, bullet and the bullseye, sick of it all and lordy lordy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, real punk","review":"this isn't pop punk like blink 182, and its not trashy punk where you dont know if they are playing guitars or just throwing them around, this is the distillers. lyrics from the heart of Brody Armstrong. pick this cd up and give it a couple litens, soon you'll have the lycis for city or angels or sing sing death house in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album by the distillers","review":"Sing Sing Death house is a pissed off, ultra asskicking, punk rock album. I would have givin' it five stars but after about the fifth songs the album becomes very monotonous. Some good tracks are: Sing sing death house, sick of it all and the young crazed peeling. If you get any distiller albums, get this one, I highly recommand this band to fans of Rancid and teenagers who are really, really pissed off."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing release.","review":"This cd's vocal preformances by Brody Armstrong are some of the best in the history of music. They contain a power within them that is rarely matched by other vocal artists. The instrumentals in this album although simple and unorigional compliment the vocals in power. This album would be perfect except for the fact that tracks 6 10 and 11 are plainly bad songs. This album would be amazing withought them. I was dissapointed to see these songs ruin what could of been an absolutely amazing album. They should have been removed, I would of been more satisfied with a 9 track cd than this 12 track cd. Despite that I would recommend this cd who likes genuine yet powerful music from artists such as Anti-Flag, Johnny Cash and Bright Eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"hell yeah!!!!","review":"From the moment i put it in my cd player its never been further from the pile and i doubt its ever been in the box. One of my freinds told me to listen to The Distillers and ever since ive been jammin along with them, he thinks Brody's sexy and frankly so do I. Sing sing death house has everything a punk album needs, all the power and energy of the guitars and Brody's voice makes it complete. It's been in my mums car for months and she says she hates it but it's still in there, if my frank sinatra loving mother can like it anybody can. Anybody who is into good music should try it, even if you do like power-pop, this is nothing like it, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the three","review":"I love this album. For anyone who knows anything about Brody (and even for some who don't), you can really tell the way in which this is a slice of her life. Brody Dalle may have stopped taking hits, but this CD is just as gritty and heroine-soaked as their debut album. Songs on the album chronicle everything, from the sexual abuse of her childhood friend in \\"Young Girls\\", to the symptons of withdrawal in \\"I Understand\\". The best songs on the album are without a doubt, \\"I Am A Revenant\\" and \\"The Young Crazed Peeling\\"(an amazing autobiographical song marked with reverance for her inner circle and the reassuring line \\"the way you feel, its okay. Its never gonna change anyway.\\"). This is the best of the three Distillers CDs and it's not really fair to compare Brody to any other punk female vocalist, because she truly has something all her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop reading, just go buy the damn album!","review":"Tired of the same old [stuff] that people have the audacity to call \\"punk\\"? So am i, pick this up, it's a breath of fresh air that gives me hope for the punk genre. It's a great Cd, Loud, Fast, Real, everything punk is supposed to be. PLus it comes wth a lyric sheet so you can understand what in the hell Brody is saying...{{{Oh, and fun fact: There is one line in the song \\"Bullet and the bullseye\\" that is not in the lyrics page because Brody says \\"the only thing i .... is my man's ....\\", i guess it's too um, graphic.lol.}}}BY the way, Brody's voice is incredible, she does kinda sound like Courtney love, but she's much much better....Bottom Line, GO PiCK UP THIS CD RIGHT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brody can sing sing","review":"Brody Armstrong, frontwoman of the Distillers, can kick anybody in punk music's ass with her growling vocals. Sing Sing Death House is comprised of bouncy melodies with snaring drums and tickled guitars... paired with Brody's unique voice, this makes for a great combination! Some of the best tracks include \\"Young Crazed Peeling\\", \\"Young Girls\\", \\"I Am A Revanant\\" and the almost-mellow \\"Lordy Lordy\\". If you're in need of some awesome punk you can sing along to, you have found your album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even with the negatives, I give it 5 stars","review":"The bluegrass and country/western portions of this live album are so phenomenal, I can forgive the out-of-place tribute to ecology and martyrs of the 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed with Nash Ramblers as well as ELH","review":"Of course, I have this CD but better yet, I was able to see this show in person and the performace sent chills up and down my spine. Emmylou was great and the Nash Ramblers are awesome. They are able to get the most incredible sound from acoustic instruments. Jon Randall Stewart on guitar and high tenor made the hair stand up on my neck. I understand he has some great music out now just under the name Jon Randall. Sam Bush is a legend in his own time and of course, the late Roy Husky, Jr. will live in my memory as the greatest stand up bass personality of all time.

Her version of Cattle Call would get a nod of approval from Eddy Arnold, and in Hard Times you can feel the struggles in living from her voice. I feel that her approach to music is so honest and sincere, simply because she loves music. I highly recommend this CD, if you love the traditional sound and want to feel the energy of a concert without being there, then buy this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"tntpowerful","review":"Excellent!! At the Ryman, oh yeah. And in addition to the best of music and sound, there is a ton of Emmylou Harris's personality. I only wish I could have seen her dance to the music of Mr. Bill Monroe. And on top of all that, you get the Nash Ramblers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't heard the CD but.......","review":"saw them live and they were the worst band I have ever seen or heard.

Curse (a german rapper) improved his skills with this album. \\"Von innen nach au?en\\" contained of brilliant lycris and wonderful musical arrangements. Basically it is a real hiphop album, but lyrics are very personal. this is not typical in the German hiphop scene, but it makes the album very special. I am very interested in the further projects from this artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice german hip-hop","review":"curse is probably the best MC that germany has to offer. he definitely has some skills and every song has a message. now, most of you guys will probably have a hard time getting any message out of his songs because you can't understand what he says. but sometimes that really doesn't matter because you can just get the mood without really understanding. curse is a great mc and this is his best album. this is my recommendation for anyone that likes to listen to decent hip-hop. enjoy that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: Disappointing.","review":"Give 'Em The Boots I and II are punk-rock neccessities. Sprinkled with ska, reggae and rocksteady, they were truly palatable for those of us with eclectic tastes. Sadly, Give 'Em The Boot III purifies itself of most of the reggae and ska from it's two previous outings, leaving us with a punk rock wasteland. The songs here just simply aren't up to Hellcat's high standars. There are a few good moments (The Slackers' BRILLIANT \\"Information Error\\", the Tiger Army video) but that is outweighed by a parade of messy and talentless punk rock. Even the Rancid track is anemic.Although, for [the money], \\"Give 'Em The Boot III\\" isn't much of a gamble. Still, it's been three years since Vol. II, and III frankly falls flat on it's body-pierced face."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mix","review":"give em the boot 2 had a lot of reggae & ska on it & this one is more punk rock, which is good. the bands on it were really good and i pretty much liked every song (the joe strummer one was kind of weird...not like the clash at all). i would recommend it especially since it's so cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must have CD!!!!","review":"This CD is OUTSTANDING. This is a must have for any music lover. Eric Benet's vocals are on point. you can feel the expression and passion in his voice when he sings these songs. I have all three of his CD's and this is by far the most diverse of them all. The songs that really strike a chord are \\"Be myself again\\", \\"Hurricane\\",\\"PrettyBaby\\", \\"Cracks of a broken Heart\\", \\"Man enough to cry\\" and \\"India\\" These songs are perfection. I wish that there was a radio release from this album to help with promotion.

During the interview they showed clips of him making this CD, and when I heard him sing, and I knew I had to buy it. The CD is is very mellow. There are a few upbeat songs, but most are soft and jazzy. My favorite is \\"Pretty Baby\\". I love the way he sings that. This CD is definitely about his marriage to Halle. If this is his only true way of expressing his feelings about her and his life with her, then I am so glad he did it this way. Life goes on Eric, and hopefully this will be the start of a new life for you!!It is defintely worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HURRICAN - Eric Benet","review":"I just can't believe this CD. Every single song stikes a cords on my heart. Hurricane is on of my favorites, but Man Enough to Cry is the one that made me cry. Eric Benet has poured his heart, soul and everything else he could gather into this CD. I Wanna Be Loved, broke my heart because I can relate. Be Myself Again, almost made me dance in the grocery store isle. Fine work. Something I will listen to for a long time and very much worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I guess Eric has lots of friends making these reviews because the cd is not at all that good.

I am a huge fan of Eric Benet, but this is his worst CD EVER. I have everything he has ever recorded and could not wait to hear his new CD, Media hype and articles stating if you love his first CD, you will love his new one, it's funky, old school R&B, it's not at all. It does not compliment his beautiful voice and soulful tone, the songs are not quality at all, to me the name of the album is so appropriate, it seems what he is going through personally is affecting his music career in every way. This CD has a folk overtone, which I don't get, it's not his style and he is straying away from his audience by doing this album. All I can say is, please go back to what you do great, singing soulful funky R&B with great ballads and write memorable material, I so miss hearing your voice, so sad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurricane Eric crashed","review":"Eric Benet is a Talented Cat,but even in his Peak he was at best a 2nd tier type of Cat.

I was very impressed and disappointed that more people don't have this CD.

It was a big letdown. While all in all, and individually, the songs are good---they are just not Eric Benet's style. Way too adult contemporary, pop. The man has a voice like butter and his roots are in soul. And while he has a wonderful tone, he does not have the vocal RANGE to pull off some of these big ballads on this album.I am sure this album was a very cathartic and renewing experience for him, as an individual, but it does nothing for him as an artist. There is not one cut on here for the radio, except \\"Where Does the Love Go\\".

However, nobody cares...This cd was ready for release for years now and over time, Benet gave away all the happy songs. He gave Better and Better to Lalah Hathaway. Benet is probably one of the top FIVE distinctive Urban voices in the industry. Hurricane was promising to be a BREAKOUT, but it's a whiny, depressing, introspective letdown. Music to take a handful of pills and drink a bottle of vodka by... \\"Making Love\\" is a great tune, however.

Keepig the album as simple as possible was a good way to show off his best vocals to date and most heart felt words. Whether he is saying that he can finally be himself or showing how hard and honest love is and can be, the acoustics that are used throughout the whole album give a great feel to the words, and give a vibe to the entire album, which is hard to find in a time when most albums are just a bunch of different singles that don't fuse together. Some of the problems of the album where the semi mid-tempo songs that had the acoutics, but just sounded somewhat cheesy.

His voice and the way he delivers the lyrics touched something in me. I separated the personal and embraced him as a musical artist -- one whom I have adored since I first heard \\"Rainy Days and Mondays\\" sung by \\"Benet\\" the group that consisted of he and his sister. I certainly hope that radio, as whole, gives this musical collection the chance to shine, because it is truly wonderful. Eric, we waited, and thank God you got back in the studio and delivered.

This book will keep you turning the pages until the end, at which point you may be asking yourself why a sequel has not been written. McCammon is just a great writer. He has written some of the best books I have ever read. This is not his best, but even his lesser novels are great. His ability to write different types of books is astounding. To go from this, to Swan Song, to Boy's Life..Let's just say that anything from McCammon is very satisfying, and when he's great, he's breathtaking. Although this book does not quite reach that level, it has periods when it does. To be truley honest, it is a 4 1/2 star-er."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite McCammon Book","review":"You never forget your first love. This seems true for me and the first McCammon book I read, The Wolf's Hour. I found his werewolf protagonist adventuresome, colorful, poignant, compelling, exciting, and provocative.I could see The Wolf's Hour done by Spielberg and Lucas, as it is paced and set reminiscent of an Indiana Jones movie, with all the action and locations and WWII intrigue.Does the thought of a lycanthropic Indiana Jones pique your curiosity? Our werewolf protagonist is no archaeologist, but still leads quite an adventuresome and at times heart-rending life. If you've not read McCammon before, please give this a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf's Hour","review":"I have read this along with everything else that was out at the time Robert McCammon came to me. I was in the Navy at the time when I read Swan Song,(in 21/2 days), couldn't put it down. When we arrived back in port, I quickly went to the bookstore and purchased everything that he had in print. The next book was Wolf's Hour. I quickly found, like in Swan Song, Robert McCammon puts you in his head as he is writting. You not only read what is happening, but see it as well. Never before have I read any author with so much attention to detail. He places you on the shoulder with a perfect view of everything going on around you. When the end of the book came, I wrote to him telling him that there HAS to be a continuation. His answer was that he was \\"thinking about it\\". I wait in anticipation. Anyone who reads any of his books is sure to become a devoted fan, such as myself, of one of the best writers of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wolf's Hour is the greatest book I've ever read!!!!","review":"I had never heard of Robert R.

It is THE WOLF'S HOUR and it is the bestbook I've ever read. It grabs hold of you from the start andnever lets go. It is the story of a werewolf that is amember of the British Secret Service in World War II. Thiswolf-man is used for only the most urgent missions and thatmakes for always exciting adventures.

I read this book about 8 years ago but I still reread it once in while (at least until my copy holds up, then I'm buying another).

It really made u feel that u were right there with the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it! Where's the movie?","review":"Like many of the reviews I have read, I also cannot recommend this book enough for anyone who likes: Charcter driven stories with action; action stories with character; war stories; horror stories; love stories; just plain good writing! The detail in the descriptions was minute without being overbearing. McMannon made a legendary beast seem more like a real human than many humas I know! I also agree with the call to Hollywood--Where's the movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lycanthropes Rejoice!","review":"The \\"Wolf's Hour\\" is relentless, frightening, and beautifully written. It is told from the werewolf's perspective, as was Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire,\\" but replaces baroque romanticism with gritty realism. McCammon was a powerful voice in the horror genre during the 80's, surpassed only by Stephen King and later, by Clive Barker. The novel, set first in Russia, then Britain and Nazi Germany, parallels the briliantly rendered beast-culture of the lycanthrope tribe with the far more terrifying human evil of the Holocaust. His scenes of werewolf transformation are astonishing, the eroticism is stirring without being silly, and the characters resonate emotionally in what could easily have degenerated into a silly comic book story (werewolves-vs-Nazis). \\"The Wolf's Hour\\" is one of the best werewolf novels of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I originally owned the paper back of this book but couldn't put my hands on it. I ordered this hard copy of it, knowing it was a used book, but I didn't realize how \\"used\\" it was. If I had known the condition of it better I would have just ordered another paperback copy. The story itself reads as well as when I read it years ago in high school. It was the first book that got me turned onto Robert R. McCammon. Definitely worth a read and a purchase. Just don't get that \\"used\\" hard back. I plan on unloading this puppy first chance I get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howling Good Time","review":"It was fun to return to this novel twenty years after I first read it. In many ways McCammon is superior to Stephen King. Both authors can be a tad verbose and McCammon could have whittled The Wolf's Hour down. But in the end who is going to argue over a few extra pages when the subject is a Russian-born British spy who takes on Nazis as a werewolf. The interspersed flashbacks that explain how Michael Gallatin is able to take on wolf form add to the whole outing. The main plot itself drags a bit with the author seemingly wanting to do a travelogue of Europe. Yet, it is fun, campy with an old time serial movie feel. Specifically I have to commend McCammon for the riveting scene involving Gallatin and a Panzer (Mark II or III I guess). The reason I returned to this novel years later was to reacquaint myself before sinking my teeth into The Hunter from the Woods which is McCammon's follow-up published in 2011."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible hero","review":"This is among the top 20 books I have ever read. It will truly keep you spellbound until the end.It has been criticized for lack of literary merit; I'm not qualified to judge this book on that score but I will say it does not lack entertainment value, a protagonist you can side with, and a broad sweeping canvas of history upon which to paint. The plot? You just have to read it to believe it!I read this book when it was first released and several times after that. It was lost, the way books often are, but now it has been re-released I am buying it again. My biggest disappointment with this book was that it cried out for a sequel, or at least I wanted one!For McCammon fans and anyone who likes a strong, action filled story I can recommend this book without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun","review":"This is a classic werewolf tale (Harry Shannon pays it tribute in his exceptional new novel'Night of the Werewolf' by featuring a werewolf in the WW2 military in one section) and McCammon should be in everyone's library anyway. Right up there with F. Paul Wilson's vampire/Nazi \\"The Keep\\" for campy fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Werewolfs Galore","review":"I am always looking for a good book on WWII. This unfortunately wasn't one of my favorites. As many readers have alluded to, this is a great book if you want to understand the mind and the changes a lyncathrope goes through. His description of the change in the early parts of the book are fascinating and realistic. The plot is okay for the WWII buffs in the begining. North Africa and the spy intrigue are good. But from the time he parachutes into France there were just too many flashbacks for me and in the end, it appeared he almost forgot that \\"Operation Iron Fist\\" must be stopped. Sorry, just not my favorite read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf's Hour is McCammon's weakest hour.","review":"The Wolf's Hour reads like two different novels grafted together. One is the tale of the origins of a unique werewolf, the other is that now adult werewolf working as a spy for England in WW2. Neither plays well with the other. The book also suffers from an 11th hour back to his roots subplot that just makes the story drag on even longer, mainly due to its needlessly repeating events already explored in the character's childhood. This is one 'epic' that is far too padded to do its stories justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This book is pretty weak. It reads like a list of cliches taken from James Bond and every other cheapo action book you could imagine. The women are all beautiful and mainly interested in sex with the hero; the Nazis (of course) wear big boots and are psychotic; the head of the secret government agency has to come to beg the hero to come out of retirement for one more job; there are shoot-outs and fist fights galore..... I think you get the point. The language is at its worst during the romantic scenes, which are barely one step above Romance novel cliches. I will give the book the following. There is a ton of action from stop to start. But generally, this is a weak thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite all time book","review":"I was one of the many people that just keep passing this book by based on the back cover. It just sounded way to corny, but i finally ran out of other things to read so i gave it a try. i don't even know what to say. i really liked the how he became a werewolf part. i made all my friends and family read and they all like it almost as much as me. i have since reread it and found it just as good the second time through, now iam wanting to read it again. if you haven't read this book GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable, non-stop action read.","review":"This was my first adventure into the world of Robert McCammon, and a fun one at that. The wolf's hour tells the tale of Michael Gallatin, a werewolf who is also a spy for the allies during World War II. Mr. McCammon intertwines two stories at once, the WWII part as well as the story of how Michael grew up and became a werewolf. This second story was my favorite part of the book. Mr. McCammon portrays the emotions of the characters so vividly that you can almopst feel the pain every time the \\"change\\" overcomes Michael and you really get a sense of the internal struggle between man and wolf. This is one of those books where suspense lurks sround every corner and the action never lets up. My only beefs are that 1)near the end, the author seems to rush the story and 2)the ending could have been a bit better. Even so, I still gave it 4 stars since the rest of the book was simply awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"tore after a couple weeks of use","review":"This would have been an okay bag but it tore after just a couple weeks of light use.

There is no organic certifier to be found, either.Now, this actually breaks the National Organic Program standards and should be investigated by the Agriculture Department.

Only drawback is the long, boring, almost inaudible talking between some tracks - but then, I guess that's probably there for some artsy reason or another. ...just get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales in comparison...","review":"While I believe this is a fantastic album (for its time)......it certainly pales in comparison to Disco Volante and California which are the bands 'masterpieces'...So I'm giving it one star as to not mislead people to think that this is the better album for its higher rating..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than A Poor Man's Frank Zappa","review":"God help me for disparaging Frank Zappa by mentioning him in describing this incomprehensible CD. Zappa had chops, Zappa had humor, Mr. Bungle has neither, though it appears they were influenced by him. It's weird without a purpose, highly unlistenable, and only marginally creative. It doesn't stir passion in the listener the way great (and even good) music does and should. The singer sounds like Jello Biafra on a bad day and the lyrics belong in the Non Sequitur Hall of Fame.Highly unrecommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"critical note","review":"I don't really like the CD, because I don't like funk-metal and I think the music contains far too much of it, which I think is not good. What should be so avantgardistic about funk-metal? It's all too chart-friendly. Especially this one Song, dead goon sounds like a very cheap Bon-Jovi-remake. And the vocals are really detestable, this guy sings like madonna on prozac or at least pretends to. And I wonder if it was for these reasons that he didn't want to put his real name on the sleeve. But anyway, one little star for the lyrics, they're good, at least, and sometimes they remind me of my English textbooks at school. Except for girls of porn, I think it's not funny to make fun of people who need buying adult magazines to satisfy their sexual needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Zappa!","review":"See above...the music ideas were weak. There's nothing really original here to my ears...Just a weak and derivative mix in which the ingredients never really gave themselves the opportunity to break new ground and foster organic ideas to take the world that Lawrence Welk created to new heights. Instead it's \\"this goes here, that goes there\\"...too much of the same material (and each piece was 4-7 minutes in length) it was hard to keep up the patience to appreciate it as a whole....the recording was so boomy (like all recordings today) I couldn't understand what the guy was saying, printed lyrics or not...sounded like a hip-hop record. This is the second time I tried to get into these guys but once again, dissapointed...even Zappa himself bored me a lot...give me Dead Kennedys or the Bonzo Dog Band any day, now THEY were original...this is just a failed attempt at evil circus/clown music (an old stereotype in itself)"},{"rating":"2","title":"CRAZY GENIUS","review":"This Album is crazy.You must listen to it.Lyrical and musical Genius.Lyrical and musical Crazyness.YOU MUST LISTEN TO IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bungle at Best","review":"Patton and his buddies created a winner. This, their first cd, is the best out of the three. Then it would go Disco Volante then Cali. If they are to realese another one in the next year I am hoping it has more of the SPAZISH stuff as in self titled and DV. If your not a fan of FNM or of Mr Patton, you should still go out and get this cd. Its a whole new expierience. I found out about them in middle school from my older bro, and they've really messed with my brain the last 5 years. I myself enjoy lightin up a fatty, sittin back, and goin from \\"Carousel\\" to \\"Dead Goon\\", the two best tracks on that cd. And if im doin shrooms i'd prefer \\"Squeeze me Macarooni\\"...if you're a bung fan you'll know what im talkin about:PEACE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible musicianship, terrible songwriting","review":"I gave this album a chance because it was recommended to me by a couple hipsters. I appreciate artists like Primus and Frank Zappa for their musical talent and avant garde style. Mr. Bungle seems to fit these two catagories, so I thought I'd dig them.The musicianship is incredible, arrangements are highly complicated, the lyrics are really out there. However, it's hard to appreciate it all when the songs simply aren't enjoyable to me. Many people listen to music for different reasons. Perhaps for shock value or brain exercise. For me, I simply listen to enjoy.The technical prowess of all the instruments are highly advanced (especially for when this was released). But in the end, this collective musical effort is not pleasing and lacks soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what the radio should sound like.","review":"With variances ranging from sould r&b to thrash metal, to the always lovely funk bass; this is what God intended for man. Boy is it good! More than 75% of bands out there these days started off by listend to Mike Patton's whitty voice. Why just look at Incubus's first 3 albums: (You couldn't tell the difference). Personally I believe Incubus used to be a million times better: they were what Earshot is to Tool though. A rip-off but still sounding good. Incubus's stuff now (which they claim is more \\"mature\\" sucks hardcore besides Drive). Anyway this album rubbed on Tool, Deftones, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, KoRn, a bunch of bands. Sadly many crappier than others. However this album is NOT for everyone: it is an aqcuired taste. Love it or hate it you can't ignore it. Like this? Listen to Nuclear Rabbit (my pals band: you can order it from here), Primus, and Sleepytime Gorilla Museum."},{"rating":"2","title":"the album that changed my life","review":"i was introduced to mr. bungle via one of my friends when i was about 15 or 16 - I'm 26 now, and this is still one of my most favoritist albums of all time. This was Mr. Bungle's first major release, but it's incredibly refined b/c of years of producing their own albums and music (OU818, The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny, etc). It took me no time at all to connect with this album, but it took many more of my friends years to appreciate this fine work. This album incorporates about every form of music possible, in each track, so if you don't like lots of changeups, don't bother - if on the other hand, you live for the eclectic flair (and you already like forms of music such as metal, funk, samba, jazz, etc.), then this album's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Plain Record : Piece of crap","review":"Lp defective pressing.

BUNGLE AND MIKE PATTON ARGHHHHH. AND IVE ASKED THEM \\"ever heard of MSI and they say no\\" and that makes this album bad somehow. if u want weird acute music instead of this mainstream industrial bland vocals music go buy franken girls or tight. and mike patton's vocals. hes just ripping off anthony keidis (RHCP 4 EVER!!!!!!)

I listened to it once and got so freaked out by it that I put it away and didn't listen to it for a year.Later, when I got the courage to listen to it again, I appreciated it much more. Now, about six years later, it's one of my favorite albums ever. There's a lot going on here, some jazz and funk influences and a perverse sense of humor, and that's what makes it so cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could only have one album for the rest of my life...","review":"...this would be it. I had 36 CD's stolen in Brasil a couple of years back, and when I had to decide if I should replace them and which ones, I realized that this album was really the only one that I simply could not live without.

Unfortunately they're all treated the same way...Needless to say, the CD is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Album, Worst Pressing Ever","review":"First of all, let me say Mr. Bungle's first two albums are two of the finest hours of music ever recorded. Which is why the Plain Recordings 180-gram vinyl pressings are such an abomination.Pressed at the lowest volume level of any LPs I have ever heard, and on apparently the lowest quality vinyl available, these albums come out of the shrink-wrap full of dirt, surface noise, and violent skips.In a time when lameness seems to be the standard, it is still nearly impossible for me to imagine the thought process that went behind these pressings. The people at Plain Recordings should give a full refund to everyone unfortunate enough to have bought them, without asking for the completely useless items to be sent back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Bungle is unique, catchy and psycotic!

The songs are pretty funny if ya listen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk-a-delic, thrashing, circus ska","review":"Funk-a-delic, thrashing, circus ska is how Bungle describes themselves and I would have to agree with them there. This album is absolute, pure genius from start to end with only a couple MINOR stumbles along the way. What I mean by genius is that this \\"genre\\" of music has never been touched let alone tryed before but Patton and company pull it off in such a way that I am still amazed everytime i listen to this album. The album starts out great and ends great. A wonderful album for anybody who respects Mike Patton's (Faith No More, Fantomas, Tomahawk, etc.) incredibly strange but amazing take on music. Quote Unquote (Travolta), Slowly Growing Deaf, My Ass Is On Fire and The Girls of Porn are my personal favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still in my CD changer","review":"This isn't going to be the most technical of reviews.

Tracks like \\"This Love\\" and \\"Laura's Theme\\" are just FAB, nothing else around at the minute compares with them. Don't get me wrong, this is not some pretentious CD only music critics will like. Craig Armstrong writes songs that will appeal to everyone, but still remain deeply personal to yourself. \\"The Space Between Us\\" is a soundtrack that re-defines 90's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a six stars","review":"Well first than nothing let me say this to the guy who wrote in french and gives one star to this CD :first write in english even when it is not your first language (like me) you should buy a new pair of ears , because this CD is a solid master piece.A friend recomended me this CD because C. ARMSTRONG was in the Massive Atack?s Protection, and i said thank like a hundred times for recomended me this CD , this work is one of those that have a universal feeling (except if you are this guy who wrote in french) i do not know anyone who have not enjoyed this CD!!! .The feeling in this CD is already well said for the rest of the reviewers, but i am going to say this: It is a down tempo music full of strings , piano and ocassional beautiful voices (PAUL BUCHANAN from The Blue Nile and LIZ FRAISER from Cocteau Twins) with deep melancholic feeling this music will take you far far away to places where the hope lives at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very rewarding collection","review":"This is an excellent and varied collection of classical-influenced and ambient styles.

I hope Mach Baron will also be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Featuring Snoopy, But No Pizza","review":"Fans of ULTRAMAN and similar Japanese TV series could scarcely go wrong by picking this up. RED BARON is a well-made and quite action-packed series that plays like a melding of ULTRAMAN and ASTRO BOY. As a series, it kicks the tar out of BCI's previous IRON KING set (not that IK was terrible) and is very well thought of in Japan. Buy THE SUPER ROBOT RED BARON and see why. There is even a cameo appearance by none other than Snoopy! BCI/Eclipse is doing a great service to tokusatsu fans by making shows such as RED BARON available in the US. I'll certainly be getting their next set, SILVER MASK, but would like to see more ULTRAMAN series...let's hope. Before I forget: as usual for BCI, the video quality here is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"This is one of the coolest shows that I remember when I was younger.

All the passion that encompasses Greece.","review":"I loved this movie overall, but it was the music that was the real clincher for me, so I just had to get the soundtrack!

Don't be tempted as I was. The CD is filled with music repeating the same melody over and over again. While some of the musicians are credible and pleasant listening, by the time you're at track 18 you'll recognize you've been mightily deceived! Yes, the melody lingers on...but I don't think that's reason enough to purchase this CD, and in fact, the repetition becomes annoying.

I was bred on 90s grunge and took to the gangly arty-rock like the Pumpkins and Tool. After randomly downloading some tracks from Luscious Jackson's first EP (In Search of Manny) the other day I started digging light female-driven hip-hop flavored stuff.. For some reason I then randomly found this album and \\"The Sea\\" instantly enthralled me, easily drawing me into the rest of the album. I think I found a new music genre to explore, which always kicks. From hearing a little Portishead years ago, I didn't really get a full feel for trip-hop. You can be chill without being depressing, as expertly evidenced on this disc.Great, solid album, start to finish. Smooth musicianship with a nice breadth of everything from strings to mellow guitars to slow beats. The singer's voice is what truly makes this CD for me, though. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billie Holiday marries Pink Floyd","review":"As seductive and sensual as this trip-hop CD is, it only scratches the surface of seeing/feeling/experiencing Morcheeba live. You MUST buy this album...then catch them in concert. \\"Big Calm\\" is a more polished (and mellower) recording than \\"Who Can You Trust.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Morcheeba Big Calm","review":"I was very disappointed with this cd. It was like the smooth jazz equivalent of trip hop. Very cheesy and nothing like Portishead, Povi or Lamb, which it had been compared to. If you like your electronica with a easy listening twist, then you might like this album. Otherwise, listen to Asian Dub Foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Snooze","review":"I was one of those people that fell into the trap of \\"if you like..., then maybe you'll like Morcheeba\\".WRONG. This stuff is just boring. The slow soulful stuff would work good for tv commercials but it's nowhere near as creative as Massive Attack or Lamb. The more upbeat stuff is uncomfortably cheesy. Sometimes I wonder if the Brits are making this kind of music as sort of a joke because it's too corny to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big Calm From Morcheeba","review":"The female vocalist is the star of the show. Her voice is so smooth that you just want to cool out and listen to what she has to say. The music is not bad either. It is modern and upbeat, but is laid back too. A good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I bought this album because i read that morcheeba was good. but after listening to the first 3 songs or so, i got irritated by the vocals. The singer's voice doesn't change and transcend through the album like Beth gibbons does in the most excellent and unnerving of ways. Spend your cash on Portishead and Massive attack, not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"i bought this album when the name kept popping up around portishead, and i was seriously dissaponted. Very chlich��, very sappy, and they take themselves to seriously. Uninteresting, poppy sound. Pick up Mezzanine, Dummy, Love Box, or Homogenic if youre looking for intellegent trip hop. The first track isnt bad at all, but it goes downhill from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"If you are a genuine Portyshead, PJ Harvey, Massive Attack type. Beware, this is sweet girly music, major chords, dreamy pop tunes. Keep it in the girly rock genre. And please, no more false adversting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It-Love It","review":"This is a great album. It is smooth and sexy, and never tiring. One of the few albums made that you don't get bored with after repeatedly listening for days on end (that is my test for a good CD). It's great party music, it's great chill-out music, it's just great music in general. Good for any situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of this genre","review":"I think this is the best album in this genre. Everything good about modern music is here. Good songs, interesting sounds, great production and a really good singer.Big Calm is calm, perfect for relaxing or whatever. You don't usually come across music this well rounded.Each track is unique and each track is recognizable and has it's own sound. One of the things that makes this cd so great is the blues style playing guitar, not something you hear in this type of music all the time. This album makes me feel like I am walking in a cloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"slinky & thinky","review":"Smart, cool, and sur/real. Digital laudanum: what else can you say? This is every bit as smooth, haunting and subliminal as that one Mazzy Star record that you need to own; but moving way beyond Mazzy's atmospheric haze, they also have great, artful, skillfully-shaped songwriting. (Sadly, kind of a lost art in the studio-mad past decade -- with the exception of occasional shining moments like 'I Am Shelby Lynne'.) Plus, well, they've got the inimitable Skye. (!) At its best, almost Beatles-esque in a trippy, 21st-century way. Pop this in the player, settle back in the 'comfy chair' (or on the floor), break out the Lord Dunsany, and watch as your own head spins... very slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"did i miss something???","review":"i dunno, i bought this album on a whim and based my judgement on all of the raving reviews here. the album pretty much got 5 stars almost everywhere...so i bought it, liked it the first time i listened to it, and then every other time i put the cd on i got bored, and, well, frustrated. b/c some of the tracks are cool, but OVERALL THE ALBUM IS WEAK and doesn't stand out in any way. it's not bad background music and is rather catchy and poppy (but not at all trippy), but nothing i'd ever seriously listen to again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great chill record","review":"This album is super for those lazy days where you want something to give you the feeling of floating on air or being by the ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first few songs are worth the price of the album.","review":"I first heard this CD in 1999, and I have to get it out and listen to it every few months. I have yet to hear any of Morcheeba's other albums, but this one is one of my all-time favorites. I will have to listen to see if their other work is comparable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exemplary trip-hop classic","review":"This disc works as a party trip-hop disc; as cruising music; as cool pop music for a date, and on plenty of other levels. It's extremely accessible and consistent, more so than anything else Morcheeba produced. Great grooves, very listenable, good for cleaning the house, partying, driving, whatever.But: I have to make a note of this. Sky the vocalist(I DO love her, I'm so sad she's gone from Morcheeba now) does start to get a little heavy on the loud breaths during song phrases (\\"seagulls scavenge... hooaaaggghh... steal ice cream... waarrrggghh... worries vanish within my dream... waaagghhhh... left my soul there, down by the sea-ee... hoaghhhh... lost control yeah... haaaggghhh...). It gets a little bit distracting. Now that I've helpfully pointed this out, I'm sure you'll immediately download the MP3s to check it out. It's definitely there. It's not present on their earlier work, such as Who Can You Trust. Shame really. The only thing that mars this otherwise fine disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all the way.","review":"Great all the way. I love Skye Edwards airy voice and I find the musical arrangements very unique and interesting. They carry a kind of mood that penetrates the ear deeper than most music you hear. All the songs are great and each one has something different to offer. This is one of those CD's I could kick myself over for not buying when I heard people talking about it when it was released. If you have, like a lot of people and myself, fallen in love with the Song \\"The Sea\\", then buy this CD. Great to listen to while relaxing, and will definetly be a staple in my cocktail party music mix. If you like the music of \\"Zero 7\\", \\"Hooverphonic\\", \\"Spicehouse\\" and \\"Emiliana Torrini \\", you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivetting, daunting","review":"To me this album made incredible sense, the sound and melody of Skyes voice calmed me, and left me hanging on to each word. The melodious slow, Jazz type music in the background has and incredibly cathy beat which had me humming for ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORCHEEBA is a cool music trip!!!!","review":"MORCHEEBA is a cool music trip...a friend told me that MORCHEEBA is like MASSIVE ATTACK but i can't really define what is MORCHEEBA's sound...i hear some hip hop influences, some jazz, some pop and reggae...but the smooth voice of the singer SKYE is so beautiful that makes all the stuff something unique...if you enjoy what MASSIVE ATTACk does, you probably will like BIG CALM...REALLY NICE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention American Potheads!!","review":"With a smooth-groove and an angelic voice to back it up, Morcheeba blends the bass-based grooves of the day with a mix of Euro flavor. Not a raging masterpiece (either in sound or in content), this European trio adds a peaceful yet bumpin' side to any music fans collection. And this is not solely for those with techno backgrounds. I found this style fits perfectly as a replacement for Phish or Widespread. Don't expect those type jams, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thompson Twins Last Album","review":"Don't be put off by the album title or even the awful looking cover, this album from 1991 is a great recording, it just got lost. Its still the Thompson Twins with their dreamy vocal signature sound from new wave pop to heavy dance but with an early nineties producing technique that makes the group sound more richer. If you are a fan of the group then you should enjoy having this record for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the MP3 of Flower Girl and skip the rest","review":"Only \\"Flower Girl\\" holds up to repeat listening. \\"Come Inside\\" starts well but goes nowhere. The rest are, umm, boring. It got 2 stars only because I really like 'Flower Girl'.I have most all the TT and consider myself a fan. This release was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooooooooring !","review":"Even ONE STAR IS TOO MUCHThe Thompson Twins WERE an interesting band.In the earlier albums, their search for musical identity and independancewas interesting and creativeand the 80s albums were certainly their best and remain the best ones to date.Especially QUICK STEP, GAP, and FUTURE DAYS.The reissues are the TT Treat to all fans.Edsel hit it right every time by the way...TT were orignal a seven set trimmed down to a trio after two endeavoursand it sounds clear that with the departure of Joe Leeway the inspiration departed alongside...Was Joe Leeway THE creative element in the set ?Queer is a very poor parent of poor and rock.The feeling is the drum machine was set from the beginning of the album ad liband the musical and singing performance do nothing for the albumbut add to the boredo(o)m !This certainly accounts for the flop.if you like or want to know about the Twins go for QUICK STEP, GAP, and FUTURE DAYS.They are great disco, pop, and dance albums you will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics with Guster","review":"Ryan, Adam, and Bryan managed to capture the thrill and the magic of a live Guster show and record it on a 11 track album named \\"Goldfly.\\" Instead of just adding more instruments to make their songs sound full like other bands do, they simply squeezed as much music as they could out of the few instrumants they use. Don't get me wrong, they are joined by a few other musicians to complete their three peice ensamble. However, overall this album is back to the basics of alternative music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guster's Goldfly is a Masterpiece of Music","review":"Guster's Goldfly completely disregards the sound of conventional music by implemented bongos and other various instruments / sound effects. It has a sound completely unique to itself and has not cowered to pop culture. An amazing work of music that should be in every music collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incredible","review":"In my opinion, Guster is one of the best bands to come out of Boston in recent history. With winners like Airport Song and Rocketship, Guster can't go wrong on Goldfly. They are at their best, however, with Demons, a moving song that beautifully explores the darker side of human relationships. The combination of guitars and bongos really bring out the simple yet deep beauty in their work. Guster truly does rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it.","review":"just go and buy it. this trio blends congos, guitar, and vocals amazingly. buy it. do it for yourself. this is a great group, and if you dont like them your nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Guster album","review":"I, like many people, discovered Guster in concert. It's a good thing I did not purchase Goldfly first or I might not have bought any other of their CDs. Musically, it's a bit heavier than their other albums and I don't care for it. And the lyrics...they remind me of some of the teenage angst-ridden poetry that I wrote in high school. When I finished my first listen, I was so depressed I felt like heading to my nearest bar. If you are trying to choose your first Guster album, please pick anything else except this one. This one should best be reserved for the \\"hard-core\\" fans who feel they must own all of Guster's albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone loves this disc","review":"Notice that nobody has ranked this CD with anything but 5 stars.

But other than those 3 things, I didn't see any change in my hair other than IT STARTED FALLING OUT! Huge bald spots in my hairline so it was visible! OMG.

As otherbands in this area have done (HIM for example), the emotional depth and intensity of goth are there, the slow, churning, cello-driven songs are all here. WHat sets this record apart is its nice variety. Without falling within stereotypes, Lake of Tears have crafted a rich, dense album that is not a bore to listne to from beginning to end.

She kept singing and playing 'Praying For Sunny Days'. It was a very catchy song.I borrowed her CD and listened to it, and listened to it again, and listened to it again. There are several other very good songs besides the one that I had heard originally. Their sound is quite different from anything else that I have heard.

This toy made her other toys salvable; I would either tie the rattling mouse, or feathers torn away from the crinkle ball, and recently the mint stick from petstages that she barely look at. When too tired to drag it, we stick the plastic wand into our loft bed so she can jump and swat at the toys tied to it. And I feel the product is pretty durable. She could be pretty aggressive with the tugging and biting. she figured if she chew off the rubber that holds the wand to the rainbow fabric we could stop tormenting her, so when we get a little distracted she would try to sneak off with the toy somewhere and try to chew the rubber off.

Still, they love the toy, and that is what matters, I suppose. I would say that it is a couple fo dollars over what it should cost, for what it is (a soft fabric on a flexible plastic stick), but it isn't like this thing is outrageously expensive. If you have cats that you like to play with, or if you are trying to break into the funny cat video on YouTube business, this toy will do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Toy Ever!","review":"This one is the very best cat toy, hands down. I have bought several so that each of my cats has their own. I drag, swirl and loop them in the air and even the heaviest, laziest cat will do flips in the air while chasing it! It is an interactive toy and not one to be left out for them to play with. Some cats are fine with it but some will begin to swallow it and it can be a definite choking hazard. I always put them up when play time is over, but I've caught one of my cats climbing up on top of the entertainment center trying to get them back down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat loves it.","review":"My cat goes nuts for this toy and chases it with a crazed look in her eye. Only thing is, as somebody else mentioned, most cats will chew this to pieces if left alone with it so just remember to put it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing cat toy","review":"This cat toy is very disappointing. My grandson was playing with it and his cat and it wrapped itself around the cat and wouldn't let go. His mother finally had to cut the \\"cat dancer\\" off of the cat!!! It was like a strong adhesive grabbing on to the pet. We threw this cat toy away. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Afraid","review":"My 3-month-olds cat doesn't intrest. She is totally afraid with this. She is running and hiding in the corner when she saw this."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEAD OR ALIVE STILL ROCKIN'!","review":"AWESOME 80's classic that will take you right back to the dance floor! Immediately, before even listening to it, I loaded into my itunes library. Can't wait to take a nice, long walk with this nostalgic music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"My snow shoe kitty completely ignored this cat charmer toy. No interest at all.

I think you have a 50/50 chance with this one of your kitty liking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cat didn't like it at all","review":"I bought this because it was reviewed so highly but my cat didn't like it at all. She examined it, poked at it, laid on it but refused to play with it. When I picked it up and tried to coax her she ran.To be fair she is a timid kitty from a shelter-I think she was abused so the rod the charmer is attatched to may scare her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supervised Playtime Only","review":"In fairness, this is a great interactive toy. Unfortunately, I didn't think to put it away. While I was at work my cat chewed the string off and swallowed it. I assumed the kids broke it, and kitty died about a month later at the end of a long and expensive surgery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short for serious ribbon routines","review":"I was first drawn to the charming dancer ribbon 301 because of the coloration. Many have noticed a lack of flair in my usual dance ribbon (transitioning from jet black to charcoal grey as you move along its length). While flair was no longer an issue (Thanks Cat Dancer!) the weight of the ribbon felt frivolous and the length insufficient. Using this product during my patented \\"Rain Dance\\" routine did not allow me to \\"drizzle\\" along the floor and \\"soak\\" the audience as I can with my longer ribbons. All in all, fun for a while, but not for any serious Ribbon Dance Routines, unless you are a junior dancer or have short arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're crafty don't waste your money","review":"What you see is exactly what you are getting. This is an 18\\" flexible plastic wand with a long strip of colorful fleece attached to it. The fleece is slightly wider where it attaches to the wand and narrows down at the end to something resembling a tail. It will keep a cat entertained no doubt about it. But if you have the time, go down to the dollar store buy a kids cheap plastic wand, attach about 50 cents worth of fleece (approximately 2.5 feet) with electrical tape and you will have the exact same thing. My cat loves it and I am not going to waste my time shipping the stupid thing back.But I am willing to warn others about what a waste the thing is. Perhaps I will go into business selling these things myself, even at half the price I would still make a profit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitten loves this","review":"Great product.

I run all over the house pulling it. He is right behind chasing the toy. There is only 1 problem with it. If I leave it lay out my cat chews of parts of it. Fortunately he has not swallowed any of it. He just sets the piece by my feet. When your cat isn't playing with it supervised by a pet parent I suggest putting it up somewhere where the cat can't get at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended kitty crack","review":"I bought this to try a different type of toy for my cat who is obsessed with fur and feathers. Whoa, Nelly! He loves this thing. He munches on the end (I think he ate some actually so keep supervision in mind if you buy one), wraps it around his body then races through the house with the stick part thwacking away and exciting him even more. I think it will be easy to DIY replace the fleece if it wears out. Or make your own with a flexible rod (1/4\\" dowel, eg) and a 36\\" strip of 1\\" wide fleece attached to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucks","review":"I cannot get much play time with this toy at all because every time my cat tries to bat at it, he gets his claw stuck in the stupid flannel material and I have to unhook him. It makes it no fun and my cat agrees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Loved Toy","review":"This toy is an absolute favorite with our cats. Our oldest cat will drag the Charmer from room to room and all of the other cats will follow and pounce on the trailing wand or tail. Many is the time we will find the Charmer dragged out of the cat feather wand holder and taken to another room, either upstairs or downstairs. The fleece fabric is durable and has stayed intact through multiple sessions of tug o war. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as interesting to my older cat","review":"My cat is a bit old, she's over ten years old as of this writing. I mention this because I think it might be her age as to why she's not interested in this very much. She will play with it a little bit, but she loses interest pretty quick. Still, it's a pretty cheap toy and it does get some use."},{"rating":"1","title":"not thrilled","review":"My kitten is not as interested in chasing this as in eating it. Even while we are holding the stick she has managed to get some good bites of it. The stick has been useful, though, for retrieving her furry mice and little plastic balls from under the radiators. Otherwise, the toy came as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better toys","review":"I purchased this on-line along with the Cat Dancer. My cat is not really wild about this toy. He will play with it for about two minutes with me but he would rather us be playing with his Cat Dancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd only make one small improvement","review":"The Cat Charmer is my three cats' favorite toy. They love to romp around after the multicolored flannel tail. What I love is that there are no feathers or tinsel to get caught down their throats and choke them.The only improvement I would suggest for this product is that I wish the Lucite (tm) wand was maybe 6\\" longer. I have three cats and it's hard to 'cast' the tail out far enough to reach all of them.Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cat toy","review":"Great little cat toy.

It's a trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Loves it Too Much","review":"Both my cats love playing with the toy. The younger one has an obsession with string and if given the opportunity will eat it. Several times I have turned my back for a second and found a chunk chewed off the end. Then the next day she throws up brightly colored fabric. She loves playing with it too much to take away completely. If your cat has this quirk be warned that this toy is very appealing. My other cat does not have this issue. The toy does not seem breakable, just edible. Be warned that the fabric does stretch a good deal if the cat likes to tug on it. Until you know how your cat reacts, I would recommend very close supervision as suggested by the instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats Love it","review":"It was a great deal for the price and my cats love it (although my finicky male cat got bored of it quickly, my playful female kitty can't get enough)I only wish it were a little longer so that I could get them running all over the house (when I run around too much it freaks them out)."},{"rating":"2","title":"our cats love this thing!","review":"For just a few bucks you can keep your cat entertained endlessly with this thing. With a little practice you can learn to have the ribbon dancing in the air with a little flick of the wrist. The \\"ribbon\\" is a velour-type fabric.

The toy itself is well made and seems very safe but I guess mileage will vary depending on your cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda cheap, not all cats like it","review":"It comes as a piece of fleece on a pole that is too short (shorter then the picture looks), you have to be standing next to your cat to get it above them. I could see the pattern on the material but it didn't interest my 2 grown cats that much. One cat sprints after a laser pointer for minutes at a time but the cat charmer didn't hold her interest for long. The other cat is more laid back and didn't care for it.I bought two other cat toys at the same time to test them out.The cat dancer metal wire thing Cat Dancer, didn't hold the cats interest much either and has awkward to hold. The movement is pretty random but they didn't go for it.Da birdDa Bird Interactive Feather Cat Toy (easy store pull apart rod)had a nice design that made the feathers spin while in air. The pull apart rod was sturdy enough and let you manage up close with it. Interested my lazy cat to bat it, he liked feathers as a kitten so these toys probably work best when introduced young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun and different","review":"This cat toy is different than i might appear. The material it is made of is impossible for cat to hold on to for very long. My cat is declawed but has learned to catch toys with his teeth and hang on. He is not able to do this so we have more fun when it slips out of his mouth. The label indicages it would be similar with claws. My cat seems to be intrigued that it doesn't act like a piece of yarn. I have not had any problem with the material coming off the plastic wand."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST EVER!","review":"My little old lady of eight ADOreS this simple thing! What a wonderful find! She is so perscnickety....but this one \\"gets\\" her...if it get her, it will get your kiddlies too! I would like to add though that these should NEVER be left for kitty to play with unattended...becuase of the stretchy, elastic nature of the material, there is a potential for kitty to get it wrapped around the neck, etc and not be able to get undone (figured this out i first play session). other than that, it is a WoW and a must for kitties that are too sedentary and hard to entice to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your lazy cats moving!!!","review":"My cats are fat. They needed excersize. Before we got this toy, the only thing that got them moving was the sound of us in the kitchen, or running away from the vaccuum cleaner.

It's completely adorable, and we're glad to finally see them being active, and having fun ~ :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last cat toy you'll ever buy!!!","review":"I have two cats and they absolutely LOVE this toy! The cat charmer is very long so even when you're sitting, just wave the charmer and they'll chase it. Other toys have feathers that can be pulled out, but not the cat charmer - it's attached very well to the wand.

The message and illustration is clear and folksy. A gentle, faithful mailman (who happens to be a dog) and longs for his own mail, delivers a birthday package to Bobby Beaver on a cold and rainy night, then gets a bad cold. His get well letters come in a big sack of mail and there ends the tale. The type is large enough for the child to eventually read on their own and they want to!! This book is similar in tone, simplicity and clarity to Maurice Sendaks Little Bear, or Mazy the Mouse. A quiet refuge for the young and their protectors in an often hectic world. I'm surprised there aren't more books and merchandise for this character, it should be and probably will be a classic one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the favorites at our house!","review":"This is such a sweet story with opportunity to show children how to encourage others. Our 2 year old loves it and asks for it over and over. Why is this not on the classics list yet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush Life","review":"First, let me clarify that these comments refer to the soundtrack, not the film itself. When I bought the soundtrack I knew practically nothing about 80s alternative rock. The inclusion of recent pop music was one of the things that made the film quite controversial. A lot of people really couldn't handle it. After listening to both discs repeatedly --while I still don't know much about 80s alt-rock-- I would say the music has 'grown on me'. Words like 'atmospheric' and 'evocative' come readily to mind. Ultimately I think it is an odd but fascinating mix, an interesting melange of then and now. It's one of the few soundtracks I'm likely to continue playing rather often, just because I like the overall vibe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool score","review":"Brilliant use of back-in-the-day music to frame Marie Antoinette as a teenager living in her own time.

There are some good beats to be found and the use of modern music set to a pre-revolutionary/revolutionary France setting *was* intriguing. Unfortunatley, the film itself was a dissapointment for me. I suppose the great number of historical inaccuracies and the \\"chic flick\\" factor (remeniscent of a movie like the Princess Diaries) are what really put me off and ruined the intriquing factor of the soundtrack for me. The real story of Marie Antoinette is dramatic and scandalous enough so adding to it sent the movie \\"over the top\\" in a very negative way.

At the same time, this CD could easily be enjoyed by someone who hasn't seen the movie. The first CD has a very happy sound. It's like, light and funky rock; almost 80's. The second CD is mostly instrumental with a couple exceptions. It's definitely more somber, but still highly enjoyable. It's more serious, but still beautiful.

This book is a bit drier and emphasizes code over everything else, which is as it should be. You won't find the pointless filler that pumps \\"Dynamic Content Studio\\" to 1000+ pages, but you won't be paying for it in money or weight, either. Of the two, this should be your choice if only because it doesn't suffer from the \\"too many cooks\\" syndrome of the Friends of Ed series. You don't need to figure out 8 peoples' coding style here like you do in \\"Dynamic Content Studio.\\"True, this is not a complete book about middleware technologies, and I wouldn't want to dive into a serious ecommerce project with nothing more than this book, but it's a solid introduction to a wide range of technologies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Specific, extrememly helpful","review":"When I found this book, it was like discovering the missing link for my programming library.

If you already know ActionScript ans some ASP/PHP, then grab this book and you can say goodbye to hours annoying guesswork in your coding.It blows away the Freinds of Ed books in it's precision.

I was impressed with the studies and experiments that indicated the problems of depression being linked with low blood sugar and schizophrenia linked with white flour allergies. Dr. Fredericks describes how the two basic metabolisms, Fast Oxidizers and Slow Oxidizers have different nutritional needs. (This theory is similar to Oz Gracia's Fast, Slow and Mixed Burner categories in the book, The Balance.) Dr. Fredericks also gives case studies where people with emotional disturbances were able to \\"cure\\" themselves with mega dosages of supplements such as vitamin B1 or extra amounts of sleep. This book is well-written and sheds some light on body chemistry and mental/emotional health.

Although there are some beautiful photos here, you can find similarly beautiful photos in \\"Architectural Digest\\", \\"Home and Garden\\", etc. What ticked me off was that it would mention something enticing (like canvas inserts), but say only to request them from your photographer. For those of us who like (or have!) to do it ourselves, it wouldn't have taken much space or time to very briefly explain what that is (it is like a very plush canvas-covered matboard), where to buy it (most framers, or online), how to use it (as you would matboard), available colors (I've only seen ivory and black). Likewise, a few framing tips would have been a very nice idea, rather than just saying \\"go to a good framer\\", like each reader has tons of money for this. It could have been a wonderful book if the authors had only been a teensy bit less greedy, and tried to help readers from all walks of life, rather than just the super-rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Angie Stone but missing some things","review":"This cd single of \\"No More Rain In this cloud\\" is a great single but it needs improvement.

And it's gotten dull and boring.This isn't quite as boring and uninteresting as the latest 2 or 3 of his Great War books (the latest of which I couldn't even finish), but it's nowhere near Turtledove's best work. Believe me, he can write an interesting story when he bothers to try. See under: Ruled Brittannia.Example in point: the book starts off with the Battle of Pearl Harbor. You'd expect some excitement to the scene. It's a surprise attack, for gosh sakes, with defenders in a panic and attackers exulting in their success. But somehow the entire sequence seemed incompletely drawn and at the end of I found myself yawning and wondering what was on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad this is only fiction","review":"A well done start of a new series. (To the reviewer wondering when the next book will come out, Turtledove usally has sequeals to books coming out the same month that the previous one did.)It was fascinating having both a father and one of his sons as view point characters and how they had opposite takes on the Japanese invasion.Most of the historical events in this time frame were shifted east and in addition, luck appears to be on the Jap side. (Fortune favors the Bold.)I just have the standard critism of most of Turtledove's novels including this one which is \\"Less bad sex scenes, please.\\"Perhaps the sequeal could also shed some more light on how the US having to focus so much more on Japan than historically is affecting the allies in North Africa, England, and the USSR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, just like the Left Behind series","review":"this whole tale just repeats over and over and over. page after page as you slowly crawl through the story.

He is a great writer, and his stories always make you think. However, this one left me a bit disappointed. The story is feasible, instead of attacking the fleet, the Japanese invade Hawaii. In fact, not much imagination is required to imagine the treatment of civilians and POW. Frankly, none at all, everything they do in the imaginary Hawaii of the story, they did in fact in Singapore, Hong Kong and innumerable other places.The story has some good points (like the launching of the 3rd wave by Nagumo against the fuel farms, etc. [don't want to ruin the plot]). However it falls short on other areas (even without Hawaii, we did break the encryption codes).

It even makes me consider fishing in the winter, and I HATE COLD.This book is one of the few I have found that conveys a fly fisherman's love for the sport and his surroundings so well. Mr. Hall is engaging and down-to-earth, not snotty, elitist, or condecending (which is hard to find in the sport of fly fishing today).I have read it at least six times and keep it handy for the next.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a horror novel set in modern day Arizona, includes a cast of humans (alive, dead, and undead), and incorporates colorful, actual legends from both the Navaho and Anasazi cultures. The book gave me many of the positive impressions I had while reading \\"It\\" by Stephen King, e.g., teenagers battling supernatural forces, characters you care about, and some spine-tingling imagery. However, unlike \\"It\\", \\"WiZrD\\" builds, from the start, to a thoroughly fitting and imaginative ending. Zell has a real talent for creating a large cast of characters, each of whom are unique, each fitting like a puzzle piece into the overall story, and each contributing to the eerie climax. In general, I was very impressed with this book and highly recommend it. Zell shows great storytelling skills that I hope will only improve in his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editorials not Science","review":"This is a deeply flawed and disappointing collection of polemics revealing the editor's \\"watermelon\\" politics, (green on the outside, red in the middle)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this item...","review":"It's now a real puzzle to figure out a real review from a fabricated review and sort out the truth, but decided I would take a chance on this wine cabinet. I put it on my Christmas wish list and my husband ordered it for me. It arrived yesterday and today he spent a couple of hours on the assembly. We discovered three areas where the finish is significantly marred. In addition, the drawer rails are warped preventing the drawer from sliding into the cabinet. Even if the cabinet did not have these defects, the slots for the wine bottles are very flimsy (on the caliber of throw-away furniture you might buy for a college dorm room). The workmanship overall is pretty shoddy. What is really annoying is that my husband has to take it apart to ship it back. Others seem to have ordered this item and found it to be ok. But if you take a chance, be certain to check out all the parts for defects before beginning the assembly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawer runner 1/4\\" off, looks OK","review":"So let me state that this looks fine in finished condition, though the back and wine bottle slats are definitely lower quality particle board. The wine slats don't sit tight and thus can move slightly around.The left drawer runner was a 1/4\\" off, which may not sound bad but that meant the drawer did NOT fit after I put everything together and tried to slide it in. The runner is also particle board so very delicate. I had to take a nice chisel and gently detach it and drop it a 1/4\\" inch, there are three brad nails in it, so it was firmly attached. Then I had to shoot three new brads in there.Luckily I had these tools, most people would not.

It is still beautiful and functional, an amazing price for such a nice piece of furniture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nice, design flaw","review":"We needed a taller wine rack that could double as a mini-bar when we have company over. This cabinet is the perfect size. After a little trouble putting the thing together, which is a bit tricky due to the design, we set it where we wanted it and admired our work. It looks very nice! However, due to the design, it is a bit wobbly. The back panels just slide in, and are not actually connected to the cabinet. Anyone who works with furniture or construction would tell you that the lateral strength comes from the solid piece in back. Having stated that, I can tell you that the thing is not going to fall over, it's just not going to feel real sturdy. After filling the bottom space with wine bottles, it did feel a bit better. All in all, we are not disappointed. The price is told me I wasn't getting a piece of handmade fine furniture, so I knew what to expect. It will do the job and it does look nice, so for now, that's all that matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"I bought this for my dad it was a great gift.

The screws stripped almost immediately. It's not been used and is just sitting in a corner with a couple of glasses and bottles in it and is already listing to one side.

The author bounces back and forth within a chapter. I expected a straight discourse on each case instead there was a mishmash. For example in one chapter I thought he was going to discuss two malpractice cases that Lincoln defended. Instead there is an eassay on Medical Malpractice from 1830s through the 1850s. In another chapter about a malpractice on a broken leg that was not set as the patient wanted, there is a three page discourse on all the medical literature that Lincoln COULD have used. IN the end the case was setteld, but then we never find out the particulars of the settlement, why it was settled or such.Overall a major disappointment for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"lincoln the lawyer","review":"Like everything else concerning Lincoln's life, his law practice has acquired the patina of legend over the years. Mr. Spiegel's book does an excellent job of dispelling myths and presenting Lincoln as a well respected attorney with a thriving practice. The strongest part of the book are the introductory materials and the first two chapters. Lincoln is shown to be willing to argue any side of a case based on his clients' needs. In a case where two men had a monetary dispute Lincoln was hired by one man for the trial and by the other man during the appeal. Reamrks about the difficulty assessing an attorney's effectiveness based on the won-loss record are well considered.However, later chapters seem somewhat unfocused. The author adds interesting tidbits unrelated to the topic and outside the time of Lincoln's practice. I had hoped that a ten year research project would focus more extensively on his actual practice. Still, this is a good reference for scholars and Lincoln \\"buffs.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Insurance","review":"One of the most overlooked items on engine service.

I previously had a rechargeable trimmer from B&D which was fairly reliable, but the automatic feed spool didn't work very well. The same problem carries over to this model. I had to return the first one of these I purchased, because the AFS was broken right out of the box. The replacement lasted only about two months - it no longer feeds automatically. I think I'll be trying another brand next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, lightweight, does what it's supposed to do, bargain at the outlets","review":"I bought a reconditioned model at a Black & Decker outlet for less than half the price advertised here on Amazon. I initially experienced problems with the automatic line feed and the line continually getting wrapped around the motor head until I figured out that the cutting blade was too dull to cut the line to the proper length. Ordered a replacement blade online for less than $2 and have been blissfully happy with it ever since. It does a great job, doesn't kill my arms & shoulders even after an hour+ of solid usage. It was accidentally left out in the rain once and exhibited no apparent problems. Prefer it immensely to my old Toro model. A great bargain when acquired from the Outlets. Do buy extra replacement spools when purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"I have owned two other Grass Hogs.

When it was time to buy a new one I thought I would try the refurbished model since it was exactly like my previous trimmer. First, the trimmer I received is not the same as depicted in the main picture. The trimmer never worked right out of the box, there is no tension to keep the line from wrapping around the interior (spindle?).

The handle was totally different. So I sent it back to where it came from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Piece Of Garbage","review":"I bought this at Lowes, not here at Amazon. It lasted just two uses before the motor smoked and burned out. Returned it for a full refund. I haven't had good luck with anything from Black and Decker's new line of products and will never buy anything made by them again. Total garbage from their small kitchen appliances and cordless tools to their yard equipment.

Also while using it the plug loosened causing an electrical arc which melted some of the plastic. My repair was to open the handle and wire in a male electric plug with a couple of feet of cord hanging out. This allowed me to secure that cord firmly to the handle which solved the problem. The unit should be designed with the plug on a cord and not fixed to the handle.

This thing worked fine for most of the first reel, but cannot get it to feed correctly after that, whether I buy their over-priced \\"factory-wound\\" reels or load it myself. I have spent far more time changing or fixing the reel than actually using the product. Do these engineers ever actually use these products before they send them to market?

I'm going to try re-spooling myself. I was going to buy extra spools, but changed my mind after it went through the first spool in about only 1 hour of use. Did not give it 5 stars due to few factors: 1) Not for tall people unless you like to hunch over. Just right for my kids to use, but I am 5'8\\" and have to hunch a little even with the longest setting. 2) Bottom motor design makes the trimmer head heavier, which makes you have to push down on the back handle all the time, while holding the complete weight of the trimmer with the middle handle.

It's a slight hassle getting it secured each time.2) The construction of the shield assembly feels a little flimsy. Nothing has broken, so maybe I'm being unfair. The line-cutting blade should be stainless.But these are minor flaws.

I have not taken either apart, but it seems like the shaft or cable or whatever transmits power from the motor to the head has broken. Perhaps a link or something has come loose. At any rate, neither are working at this point.

Was disappointed in that since I have A LOT of replacement trimmer line heads for my old since line unit. These are great machines and do a great job edging. Only problem is that I find that I get 2 years out of them before they stop feeding the line and it becomes a problem. I LOVE them when they are working but it sucks when they stop :(!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"Zero stars. The so-called \\"Automatic Feed System\\" should be called the \\"Tangles in 5 minutes system.\\" I've gone through three spools. The first ran out one side the line in minutes, leaving the other half of the spool still wound. They \\"Recommend\\" against rewinding yourself for good reason. It's impossible.I went back to Menard's, got a second spool. This one tangled into a birds' nest in 5 minutes.I got a third. This one lasted perhaps 10 minutes, then fed against itself and tangled up.American business management and Chinese craftsmanship.
