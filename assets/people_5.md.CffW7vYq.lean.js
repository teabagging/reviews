It blends fantasy, a wee touch of horror and just enough romance into a fabulous tale that you will watch over and over. Whenever I'm depressed, I look at this DVD and I immediately feel 110% better.

This is a great story with some great actors, a kinda hokey-for-today script & definitely dated special effects. Tony Randall is great- losing himself in the characters even if obviously-himself in the various disguises. His Dr Lao is deliberately part offensive-caricature and part perhaps-saint/angel/god.Amazon's pairing of this with SOMETHING WICKED is genius. Before showing this to a friend, I was telling her \\"It's the good & happy version of Mr. Dark's Pandemonium Carnival\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"43 Years Old and Still Fantastic","review":"This modern classic was released in 1964! 43 years later it is still relevant and moving. Tony Randall gives the performance of a lifetime--He portrays the seven \\"faces\\" of Dr. Lao, as well as himself. His performace of the philosopher/magician Dr. Lao is masterful. At the end when Dr. Lao has accomplished his mission to the tiny, dusty Arizona town where all the action occurs, he leaves and must leave behind a young boy who desperately wants to join Dr. Lao's Circus. The scene is done so well, with Randall saying almost nothing, that you will get a tear or two in your eye. But the ending is happy despite the presence of a classic bad guy, and no western hero, including Eastwood's High Plains Drifter, makes a better exit than Dr. Lao."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Ripoff","review":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!

However, some of the usual Punk-o-rama line up let me down. Millencolin, let me down. Pennywise did as well. Which is pretty surprising cause they are generally great bands. However, the Guttermouth and Osker tracks were AMAZING! Which is also very surprising because generally those bands usually aren't that great. I discovered a decent song by a newly discovered band: Deviates. The Bad Religion song was amazing but I already had a recording of that song. The Pulley song was amazing as well. And NOFX, the [worse] unreleased songs are supposed to appear in the Fat Music Series, Not the Punk-o-rama series. Oh well. Pick this up to complete your collection. However, this just doesn't live up to the previous Volumes: 3, 4, and 5. Pick up 4 and 5 first. If you don't like them that much I strongly suggest you stop there.

The characters are lively and interesting.It was nice to see if Bell would finally get her man. I was really rooting for love and goodness to win in this book.

I get that there are hidden agendas and meanings behind poetry, children's movies, and I guess even children's literature. There are biases from the author that kids will subconsciously pick up on. But this book was unnecessarily complicated. I literally could not understand the messages trying to be conveyed from any of the chapters. I can somewhat understand the hidden meanings behind children's literature if I care to read it for more than the surface story, but I could not understand this book trying to help me understand children's literature.

Real English, real conversations. He was twenty years too late. About a month into this disaster it's becoming obvious that even the lower middle class have abandoned the gray, chilly English coastal towns for cheap jumbo jets to sunny climes. The old resorts have become God's Waiting Room and battlegrounds for the skinhead urban poor. Chapters go by without him seeing a child, or a real family, only potty old people who hate foreigners.

Its picture of the British is projected right out of the jerkish Theroux's psyche, and does not represent the way one sees a country if one wishes to UNDERSTAND it, which is to see it as it is through the frame of mind of the inhabitants, and with transcendent human sympathy and a great deal of imagination. One goes to another country, first of all, to learn something about ONESELF.Britain is a country to love, not to hate.

You will find every detail about legacy PC hardware and low-level programming for these systems in this book, and it is well organized for low-level system programmers.PC hardware areas are each given a chapter with an introduction explaining the history and workings of the physical hardware, followed by interrupt and port programming details. There are also chapters devoted solely to the interrupt vector table and BIOS data areas that list all software services, and refer to the other chapters for more details...you can get a good overview of a particular area of PC hardware, or you can just as easily find the particulars of any interrupt service, port usage or BIOS data area entry.

Of course I didn't know how big it was until I opened the package and unfurled the garment to look at it. That was a mistake on my part because this company will not accept undergarment returns if they've been opened..

It smartly has Lullaby, Fascination Street, Lovesong and Pieces of You back-to-back in such a funky kind of way. That one new song they recorded, Wrong Number, is full of energy for its 5:59. It has such a unique dance-techno sound all throughout. Also songs like Why Can't I Be You, Friday I'm Love, 13th and others are unique musical treats. The Cure was able to place their dark themes over a very accessible rock sound without coming off depressing as one may think. They smartly placed these 18 songs in an over 70-75 minute mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop whining","review":"about how melancholy The Cure is and get this album.

In fact, it's added to the fun since both kids like to stick the cookies togethr, then pull them apart.

But, like several colleagues and acquaintances, I have examined a number of the notes very carefully. What I have discovered casts real doubt on Quinn's reputation for meticulousness.

Much better than their first two albums.","review":"This third album from U2 is a great improvement over their first two albums which sounded very raw and rather dry in their production.While still raw, this CD has a much better sound than those two and deservedly propelled U2 into the spotlight.My favorite songs are \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"Drowning Man\\" which are among the best songs of U2's early. Even over 20 years after first hearing them, these three songs still give me the chills with their cold yet edgy sound and pleading vocals.This may not their best album but \\"War\\" was a much-needed improvement over their two previous albums and should be included in any U2 fans collection. \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" takes another quantum leap forward which would be their best album to date. Everything else from there was leaps and bounds for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is awesome","review":"I do not like the kind of music that bands like this do.

The song \\"New Year's Day\\" started playing on my radio, and I stood transfixed. I had never heard anything like it: the passionate vocals, the chilling lyrics, and the truly unique guitar style. As soon as I found a copy of WAR, I bought it, and found each song as satisfying as \\"New Year's Day.\\" Now, I've heard countless U2 ripoffs, not to mention several other U2 albums. Still, I can't hear the songs from this album and just think of them as background music; they still demand my attention. While U2 continues to deliver great new music, WAR stands alone as one of rock's greatest albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Not Great","review":"One of U2's better alblums, and War certainly had its fair share of radio airplay.

'sunday, bloody sunday' and 'new years day' are my two favorites but this is an ALBUM in the true sense of the word. its a well rounded collection of songs the flow together well and have a certain relativity to one another.

I originally had it in cassette format but had to buy it again in CD format because it's so good and such a classic reflection of Christopher Cross' songwriting. He's got those pretty melodies he's known for, along with his distinctive voice, and some great backup vocalists too. Also, if you get a chance, see him in concert!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This disc is kind of a slapped-together cd - a low-rent version of your typical tribute album. Pearl Jam, Phish, and Kelly Jones' tracks are all recorded live, and not for the purpose of this cd - they just happened to be recorded well enough to be included. This cd lacks a cohesive listen, and most of the tracks are pretty uninspired or are note-for-note imitations of the original - just with a different singer...I bought this to hear other artists take Who material and make it their own, and what this mostly sounds like is a 'karaoke with the stars' cd.David Bowie's track is the most inspired, but..c'mon, he did this same sorta thing with the same-era Who music on his Pinups album in the early 70s."},{"rating":"1","title":"b-list kareoke","review":"Once again the Who get dissed! They had to scrape the bottom of the barrel for half the \\"talent\\" on this disc. The idea of a tribute album is for the artist paying tribute to arrange the song in their own style. That does not happen here. Only Bowie does the job right. Most of this drek is taken from live shows where b-list groups attempt to pull off a Who song.

It descends from Steve Hodel's silly and trashy _Black Dahlia Avenger_ which has already been adequately demolished on this site.

Sensationalism and faux-intellectualism run rampant, bleeding and sore... a trifle; a magazine of a book.Flimsy connections that you could pick out of a hat and downright ignorance of the subject matter, on the end of both the murder and the \\"connection(s)\\" to Man Ray; thus connections to the Surrealist movement.If you plan for extended defecations, this book may serve you well... convulsive images..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten","review":"I can't see anyone finding much value in this book except the kind of people who enjoy looking at pictures of mutilated dead bodies. Even that group ought to save their money, as the photos here have probably already been scanned and posted all over the internet by now, thanks to the more industrious members of that particular club. What little else there is of this book hardly bears mentioning. It amounts to little more than a poorly organized magazine article attempting to connect an almost random selection of art works to the crime. Sort of throw back to the old-time practice of dressing up prurient material as \\"educational,\\" I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating story","review":"Wow. This is a great book for anyone who's interested in 20th-century art, especially in how it can inform real-world events. The interplay among artists, their work, and the people and culture around them makes for a fascinating story, even without the proposed revelations about this particular murder. Before reading the book I thought it might be only for those who already had an interest in the Black Dahlia murder, but it turns out to be a much richer experience than that. It also vividly captures a certain milieu of mid-century Los Angeles, which usually gets lost in the larger story of Hollywood's development. I recommend this book for even casual readers of art books, because even though it's scholarly in its research, it's also simply a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Let it burn through you...\\"","review":"Run Baby Run by Garbage is another excellent song and import collection.

However, it stained the shower floor, rubbed off on my white towel and reduced the shine in my hair. When my hair is short and layered, as it is now, I use the True Red shampoo and the Leave-In conditioner, which I wash out. If I want to air dry curly, I towel dry, rub (don't comb) in a dab of Brilliantine and just a touch of B&B Curl Mousse, fluff and scrunch and leave to dry. If I want to blow dry, I use just a dab of Super Rich conditioner instead, wash out, rub and comb in just a dab of Brilliantine and blow dry without further product. I use henna - no chemicals - and B&B has always worked better for me than any other product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous: All TV dramas should be this good","review":"This is a realistic depiction of a Minneapolis black family's struggles -- WITHOUT corny melodrama and bad overacting.

To tell you more about the plot would spoil things -- BUY IT!

When we were 12. we felt ourselves newborn Progressives with this album in school, now I am 40 and I love this album still. The title track is very sensitive and sad music of a broken love. This is no haeavy rock, its an own style.I love it, my first record for Christmas. The European Cover was better, but not suitable as the american.

My copy is falling apart and I'm going to try to get a copy in better shape.Along with the Trixie Belden series by Julie Campbell (later written by Kathryn Kenny, but not quite as good), The Timber Trail Riders books,and The Horsemasters by Don Stanford, Scarlet Royal is one of the books from my childhood that I treasure and re-read every few years.

It is not a comedy, it is a Catherine Brelliat film. Many people rent this film thinking it's going to be fun. It's a great film, and it's not frivilous.

I wonder how many male acting stars are like him? I'm guessing too many. And I doubt if women are any better. If it wasn't for him, the film would have been a complete disaster.

It is inane, frothy, and utterly empty; nonetheless, the score is catchy, and if you're really in need of some suffocatingly sweet tunes, its a good go. I am not totally averse to frothiness. This recording, however, is not the best representation of this score (which has been recorded quite a few times.) Streisand may have a great belter's voice, but she is totally wrong for this part; she is way WAY too young. The other women in the cast make no impression whatsoever. Michael Crawford sounds like he's about twelve; i have never been a fan of his nasal, forced voice anyway. Matthau is the only one who does good by the material; unfortunately, his big song early on, It Takes A Woman, suffers because it is essentially the same as the more well-known We Need a Little Christmas from Mame, and this is a big distraction.

This may have been true, yet the fact remains that she is terrific in the part. On the whole, this is a fine film musical, true to the original. Very funny and hugely entertaining. There have been a lot more succesful film musicals that weren't nearly as well done. The CD is enjoyable, though I agree with others that much of the music has been needlessly abbreviatted.

Ours came with a veggie steamer which worked well, just remember to put a little less water for the rice if you make rice along side it as the veggies will add water to the rice.Aside from the failure this was a good rice maker, if it hadn't failed I'd have rated it 4 stars, because sometimes the cooker would switch spontaneously to warm mode before finishing cooking the rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this flimsy rice cooker!","review":"After three months of use, this rice cooker stopped working.

I had to use a Python replacement (I found online). The connecter valves broke (leaking, and the switch completely snapped off) after 3 uses, I ordered a replacement valve and that doesn't work either! Water leaking all over. Not to mention, the hose is just more narrow enough to make drawing water a HUGE challenge. I have used the Python for years, and was told this was the exact same thing: IT ISN'T and I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO to change the water in my TEN aquariums from now on. DO NOT BUY THIS IT DOESN'T WORK. By the way: I have talked to OTHER CUSTOMERS in our local fish store and THEY ARE HAVING THE SAME EXPERIENCE.

It starts with a prologue that finds Father Koesler regarding a coffin with an unknown to the audience corpse. Father Koesler is lamenting that the death did not need to happen.What follows is a treatise on pre- and post-Vatican II politics, Catholic history, etc. The merger of mystery and theology in Kienzle's previous books is what made them interesting to me. Here, there is no merger. There's no mystery, really. No action, and no puzzle to work out while you slog through it all.I've enjoyed most of the other books in this series, so this was a big disappointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"This novel is the first William X. Kienzle book I have read in about 7 years and I could wait another 7 years if future books will be like this one. The beginning is very well written and gets you prepared for a wonderful story, but then the body of the novel slows to a crawl with more talk of Church teaching than actual mystery.

But then I was quickly amazed with several other songs on the disc, i.e 'Long Lost' 'Normal Town' 'King of New Orleans' and the song that I think is probably the 'best' on the cd 'Rewind'. I bought th disc for one song and liked eight others, how can you beat it! 'Ezra' combines a little heavy guitar palying to some sweat sounds of creole from New Orleans to make a completely new, original and fabulous sound! This band has some great talent it's a shame they aren't as big as other less imppressive bands beacuse they certainly deserve it!! All around this is one terrific CD I suggest buying it ASAP and then get 'Deluxe', they are both well worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising gem of a CD","review":"I found this CD for $2 in my favourite record store and got purely on the basis of Desperately Wanting.

It does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deluxe - under - rated, Friction Baby - a disappointment","review":"From an English point of view, where the majority of the country have yet to hear Better than Ezra, my chance finding of Deluxe proved to be a worthwhile investment I found Deluxe while I was last in the states and found their unique style of music on this album, refreshing. Their whole approach to music took on a different theme to the music of the time, but also stayed similar to more famous bands, such as R.E.M. The follow up album - Friction Baby took on another form completely, it showed obvious modernisations to keep up with the market and did not keep the all to familiar \\"country\\" style image found on Deluxe. If the band were to reach a comprimise in their next album - it would be sure to be a hit !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"impassioned and proficient","review":"Their debut with the MTV hit \\"Good\\" didn't do much for me, although admittedly it now takes me back to the waning days of college and that feeling of \\"oh god, I have to face the real world and get a job.\\" I was plugging away in my first job in the far north of the USA when I heard \\"Desperately Wanting,\\" the lead single from the band's second album, Friction, Baby. It had a vaguely southern (I didn't say country,) vaguely Falkneresque vibe, great singing, excellent geetar playing, sophisticated songwriting. It pretty much blew me away. The album itself is an incredibly rich stew that took a couple of years to digest.

Pinnick's work with King's X has always been highly praised as being soulful and powerful but the last thing anybody could say was that the music was sexy. With Pinappleskunk we still get Pinnick's trademark bass and vocals but delivered with more sophistication, self assurance, and joy than in any of his previous work. Potency like this could carry the band for another twenty years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to playing bass, Doug.","review":"After semi-enjoying the detuned slow tunes on Doug Pinnick's first Poundhound effort,I took a chance on the second offering.This is more of the same only worse.Doug should hire a guitar player,try a different drummer and try writing some upbeat stuff even if still in \\"detuned mode\\".I love King's X.I have all of their CD's and have been following them for six years.I will,however,not buy any more Poundhound...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better after the first few listens","review":"On the first listen, I didn't care for this recording. Much of that had to do with my dislike of the first 2-3 songs. I don't care much for She, Jumpin', or Somedays. But Atlanta, Smearing, Next In Line (lyrics aren't that great), Rain & The Will are very good. Oh My Soul is my favorite. I feel this is an improvement over the previous CD. Massive Grooves sounded all the same. This CD is more varied (has worse songs than any on Massive Grooves, but the better songs are much better) than Massive Grooves. Definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing followup","review":"I really loved the first Poundhound album, and I'm about to put this one on e Bay already. My main problem is with the vocals. Most of the songs here have good choruses, but the distorted/half-spoken vocals on the verses get old after about one song. Sing, darnit, you have a great voice.

The recording coulda been better too as I get the feeling that a better studio couldn't hurt. However, the music itself is awesome.

We will meet him in heaven some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rachel Papers","review":"Perhaps not on par with the novel but more accessible. Although brilliant and highly original, I think Martin Amis' first book contains some obscure passages and insider English schoolboy jokes. Also, the 1970's setting of the book has been replaced by the 1980's in the movie.Ione Skye and Dexter Fletcher portray the growing relationship between Rachel & Charles rather well. James Spader fills in nicely as DeForest, the rival boyfriend. The college scene with Michael Gambon as Doctor Knowd is particularly humorous.A good study in adolescence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wah wah wah","review":"Found the main character very annoying--unlike Ferris in \\"Ferris Buellers Day Off,\\" the narration by the lead found me liking him less and less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy for safety","review":"This is sturdy and makes exiting the tub easy and safe...........however there is an inside and outside to this bar.

The design is adaptive to mount anywhere on the tub and can be switched around in either direction for shower or bath use. The clamping design as well as the textured grips gives extra security rather than the suction design of many other products.Assembly was a little difficult and tedious but this was the downside of having such a flexible, adaptive design. Not sure if this safety bar would support the weight of a heavy person.Mother-in-law is happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Par","review":"I thought a product made by Moen would be top quality, but this Safety Bar is not.

The ending of an era of dynasties lasting centuries and monarchy for several countries along with the evolution of communism. The personalities of the leaders and how they related in the process is fascinating. The process of breaking up the Austrian-Hungary empire as well as the Ottoman empire and the ramifications resulting are worth the read.I enjoyed the cultural differences outlined between the French, English, American and Italian as well, not to mention the German, Japanese, Chinese, Greek and others. The evolution of America and the American position on foreign affairs is also worthy of note.There is much complex material and much history of the areas in question but I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight.","review":"I bought this book to better understand some of the historical events that happened during the earlier years of our century. This book describes in great detail how our leaders of the time changed history for better or for worse. depends on your point of view. The author described in detail every leaders character, background and decision process during that time period. The author has a fluid style enabling the reader to follow her thoughts and perceptions, then tie them into the overall environment.I would recommend this book to all readers trying to understand our current status by looking back in a detailed past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to my expectations","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I would have liked more detail on the actual events instead I felt the author dealt more with the characters that attended the meeting. If I wanted to know about Lloyd Gearge's mistress and the Queen of Rumania who attended with her plump children, I would read a biography. All in all, the book could not hold my interest. I tried to just read the chapters dealing with areas that I was interested in such as Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey and the Middle East. I could not do anything but skim these chapters before giving up entirely on the book. It is very rare that I do not finish a book that I start."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor narrative","review":"A bit unconnected and fleshless account of the Peace Conference, it tries to cover the whole array of negotiatinos and peace treaties leaving a rather superficial taste. It may be good for an introduction to the topic but it is definitely not a deep analysis or a main source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reading for high school level","review":"Was excited to read it but slightly dissapointed after finishing it. While the book seems well researched it lacks critical facts that need be understood before attempting to analyse the complexity of tribal Europe after WWI war. With the exception of the 4 big players many other descriptions are not anything more than caricatures. The author defends the results of the peace conferece while making little to no reference to the will of the people inhabiting the areas in question. This is needed to better understand the real impact of this major historical event on the rest of the 20th century.Nevertheless this is a good starter for people that know little to nothing about the 20th century Europe and its complexities and want to know what questions they need ask from further readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened and why the 1919 Paris Conference failed","review":"Paris 1919 is a fine piece of scholarship. It goes far beyond recounting the events of the post WWI peace conference to explore the context of decisions and the personalities involved.She recounts the economic and political pressures on Wilson, Lloyd-George and Clemenceau, their characters, and the exaggerated expectations of the Allied victors.In general terms Wilson's fair and reasonable 14 points were used as cover for an epic land and power grab at the expense of the defeated Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires with a collection of the most outrageous nationalistic and historical claims being put forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This was a truly marvelous work. Ms. McMillian presented an astonishing amount of information but it was done in such a way that I never felt overloaded. She masterfully presented the peace conference in all its complexities, nuances and intrigues but in a manageable way. The book was absolutely fascinating both in showing how the conference affected European history from 1919-1939 and how it still has effects today in other parts of the world, most notably the Middle East. She does an excellent job covering not only the negotiations between the Allies and big powers like Germany and Austria-Hungary, but also negotations involving Europe's smaller countries like Rumania and Bulgaria.She also ably rubbishes myths, showing, for example, that reparations were not as damaging to Germany as popular history has it. A long read but worth every minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book on a Subject Usually Not Covered in Depth","review":"I liked the way the author divided up the major subjects/geoggraphic regions by chapters and covered the issues in this mannner.

MacMillan does a creditable job of making sense the negotiations that took place in 1919 to divide up the planet after the total collapse of the Central Powers and the Russian Empire. She addresses dozens of issues involved in the meetings and committees of the Versailles conference and the politics involved amongst the victorious allies. Millions were taken from their Ottoman and German colonial masters and given over to the French and British. The United States was offered a Mandate over the Kurds but refused it as Wilson did not want to get involved in middle east colonialism. The existence of new states was recognized and the colonial authority of France, Britain and, ominously, Japan was reinforced.A good book and the best I've seen on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda or History?","review":"Unfortunately it is no accident I think, that Margaret Macmillan is the great grand daughter of Lloyd George. This book essentially reflects a British interpretation of the treaty of Versailles, and not least, a more positive view of David Lloyd George. It strikes me as more of an op ed piece than sound history. In my opinion readers should be forewarned that this is a piece more closely akin to World War I British propaganda than anything else. With this in mind,the book is interesting and the manifold details are fascinating, albeit misleading. It is well worth reading with a big pinch of salt. It is \\"a page turner\\" alright. Nonetheless,I would advise them to look elsewhere for a history of the Versailles treaty,its creation and creators, and its effects. The biases are quite subtle and even clever, but they are there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good but tedious book on the Peace Conference of 1919","review":"This book is about the Paris 1919 Peace Conference following the end of World War I. It is nicely organized and focuses on all aspects of the negotiations. The book is fairly long, due to the high amount of detail that was included. The research the author did was amazing and she included a great deal of information in her book. This is good and bad because I found the book to be tedious to read after awhile. About halfway through I got bored of the book.This is by no means light reading so I only recommend it to people who are genuinely interested in this topic. Otherwise you will probably be a little bored and find this book somewhat difficult to wade through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing history of World War 1","review":"This is truly one of the greatest books on the Post World War 1 and how it developed into World War 2. This book goes section by section through the world and talks about the effects of peace on the east, Middle East, Africa, and Europe. It redraws the borders, shows the alienation of Italy as well as the harshness of German reparations. The failure of the League of Nations is coached in this treaty and these six months were a catastrophe for the world. It is done in amazing detail. This is an essential book for any World War 1 or World War 2 historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris 1919","review":"A detail of the Paris peace negotiations at the end of World War I and the far reaching effects of these negotiations even on todays geography, this book is truly a must read for anyone interested in the 'how we got here' of the middle east, the League of Nations, and even the causes of the second World War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past page 12","review":"The tone of the writing in this book is like a middle school girls' cliquey catfight. I thought I could stomach that at least for a few chapters, but page 12 has this rant which can be summarized as: Wilson failed to determine what the perfect ultimate form of government should be, was hiding in his cabin (when he was not out taking walks, arm and arm with Mrs. Wilson (not one of the \\"lesser wives\\" you know)), failed to tell his advisors what this ultimate perfect form of government should be, and more horrific than that used lofty words in his speeches that made people sad and disappointed later.I was glad to leave middle school.

I read Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto for a world governments course that I am currently enrolled in for college. I really don't agree with many of the opinions voiced in either book, but I take them at face value. Weather you agree with Hitler or not he was able to control the masses. My purpose for reading the book was to understand the man. The \\"method to the madness\\" if you will. Reading this book helped me to understand where he was comming from with some of his ideals. I don't agree with him, but atleast now I understand it. There's really no since in bashing something you know nothing about. I'm not saying that you should follow the \\"teachings\\" in this book.

Book description: \\"It is unknown exactly when the book was published but it was found in a prison camp which opened in 1938 and was liberated in 1945 so the book must have been published sometime during those dates.\\" - That's the fact that they're exploiting here and using to brand the old James Murphy version of Mein Kampf as \\"Official\\". All this is, is the same ol' Murphey edition branded as \\"Official\\", despite the fact that there's nothing official about any of \\"Murphey's Kampf\\"...which would make for a better name for his translations since he writes in so much of his own propaganda into the book.If you want the original (note: they couldn't call it original, because that would be a bold faced lie, they used subterfuge and called it 'official') get ETS Dugdales translation. He translated the original & OFFICIAL Mein Kampf (My Battle) in 1933.

That expectation is completely extinguished by these typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow worse than I thought it would be","review":"I didn't think I would be reading something as enjoyable as say Mark Twain or Ernest Hemingway but I couldn't get through the first two pages of this thing before I had to put it down. It was so choppy and misplaced and required so much attention on my part (probably more than I am willing to give this book), when I looked to see it was something like 800 pages I couldn't imagine putting in the required effort to reading this book. You read this book if you have to (maybe a research project or something) not because you want to. I thought I would be getting a real good snapshot into Hitler's mind, which you probably will, but you might as well watch a documentary on him and get the same information in one or two hours that it would take to read this entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"In A Literary Sense It's Junk","review":"Hitler, although extremely evil, was possibly one of the best orators of all time. He could move crowds like no one else with his powerful speeches and yet virtually nothing he said is still quoted today. Why? Because it was not what Hitler said, but rather how he said it. Do not buy Mein Kampf if you want an entertaining, well written read; rather buy this book for its historical significance. Were this book written by some other unknown man the ramblings about racial purity and Jews as parasitic sub humans would enthrall very few and put most to sleep.

Consequently, \\"Mein Kampf\\" comes across as a heavy, meandering, disjointed piece of work that lacks intellectual integrity. It also reeks of narcissism and megalomania and, as such, much of what Hitler said should be taken with a grain of salt.Historians will undoubtedly find it useful for studying the mindset of Hitler and how he used his rhetoric to seduce the German people and lead them to war and self-destruction. Other than that, there's not much to recommend this book and as far as I'm concerned, it should be thrown on the garbage heap of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the Publisher Thinks This a Poor Translation","review":"Michael Ford, who self-publishes this under his \\"Elite Minds\\" logo, writes the following about this translation in his \\"Mein Kampf: A Translation Controversy\\":This version \\"had many gross misspellings, punctuation errors, and grammar errors. Apparently, an English speaking Nazi Party member took James Murphy's unpolished translation and tried to finish it. The result is very poor and this may be part of the reason it was not more widely distributed.\\"If one is really interested in \\"Mein Kampf,\\" this translation may be of marginal interest. However, since it never had significant distribution, and since in the publisher's own words the translation is poor, why would the average person interested in what Hitler had to say buy this translation? Go with Ralph Manheim's translation, the one most scholars use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"There seem to be a number of people downloading the public domain version of James Murphy's notoriously bad translation and trying to make a quick buck on it. This is one of those times. This edition is obviously from the web. It has the same OCR errors as the web version. The Murphy edition itself is a very poor quality translation as Murphy was not a fluent German speaker and relied heavily on his German dictionary. This fact is clear from the stilted style of the writing and he also uses many incomprehensible words. You need a dictionary to read his translation and even then it is a challenge to understand.I gave this edition one star because it is a copy of a public domain web version so you should not have to pay for it when it is already free and it also got one star for being such a poor quality version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The delivery was prompt and the price was just right.

When I listned to the whole album I was not too happy. Desert Plains,Solar Angels and Heading Out To The Highway are the only 3 I like on this album. JP were criticized more for TURBO than POINT OF ENTRY. I find TURBO to be better than POINT OF ENTRY. It sounds like JP didnt work very hard on this album. While the 3 songs I mentioned are very good I just don't care for the remaining songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Priest Goes Pop","review":"Here's all you need to know about the albums Judas Priest put out in the 1980's: Half of the them were good or great, and half of them were pretty bad. POINT OF ENTRY falls into the latter category.Following the enormous success of the hard-hitting BRITISH STEEL album, Priest decided to try to capitalize on the American market by going in a more commercial direction with the follow-up. The result is a collection of mostly forgetable songs. There are three good songs here: \\"Heading Out To The Highway,\\" \\"Hot Rockin'\\" & \\"Desert Plains.\\" The instrumental intro to \\"Solar Angels\\" is pretty cool also.Simply put, this is an album that was made more for pop music fans as opposed to metalheads. Just look at the album cover!!!! It doesn't exactly scream \\"Metal\\" now does it? If you need further proof, just look at the track listings on the live albums Priest have put out since the early 1980's. How many songs from POINT OF ENTRY do you see?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!! \\\\m/","review":"How does a band possibly follow up British Steel? With Point Of Entry. Great album from start to finish. Well crafted songs, true there is more of a rock sound here but it's still got the solid Priest beast metal power in every song. Great album worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Judas Priest must have!","review":"It's pretty hard to rate this CD by Judas Priest...all I can say about it like any Judas Priest album...the originality of heavy metal!I'd have to say my favorite tracks are 'Don't Go' and 'Desert Plains' for sure.The re-mastered version has the bonus track titled 'Thunder Road' which is awesome-a killer unreleased track by Judas Priest which is worth the price of the album alone.If your'e a true Rob Halford fan,get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but far from their best","review":"While it pains me to give a Judas Priest album 4 stars, sadly, that's what Point of Entry deserves. \\"Heading Out to the Highway\\" is the best song off the album, and easily one of the top ten Priest songs. \\"Hot Rockin'\\" is a good classic song, also. Other than that I really didn't like this album that much. However this isn't their worst album. It is still better than Turbo or Rocka Rolla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum.","review":"For me, the LAMEST Judas Priest CD (which is still better than the best CD's by most bands). Dumb lyrics (the only thing dumber than the lyrics to \\"Hot Rockin'\\" is the video - awful) and mostly boring songs. \\"Heading Out To The Highway\\" is good, \\"Don't Go\\" is so-so (about as simple as a riff gets), \\"Desert Plains\\" disappointed me since I thought it sounded so good on the VHS version of \\"priest...live!\\". Only add this to your collection if you're trying to collect all the JP discs. Otherwise, go with the superior \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" or \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just forget the bonus track and enjoy it...","review":"Like most of Priest albums in this remastered series, you just can forget about the bonus track in POINT OF ENTRY. \\"THunder Road\\" is terrible, just a throwaway song from the TURBO era... Really awful. Just enjoy the new crisp sound of the remastered series, and check how Point of Entry is a trong album, full of simple riffs and straight-ahead vocals.Also, an observation: the song \\"ON THE RUN\\" seems like a tribute to AC/DC..."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 Stars- actually very underrated.","review":"Upon hearing the first listen to the album I thought the album was rather... meh. But with multiple listens, the album has grown on me. I really like \\"Heading Out to the Highway\\", \\"Solar Angels\\" and \\"Desert Plains\\". In fact, I also sort of like the hard rock feel this album has. This album will make you feel like you're riding a motorcycle through the Arizona desert. The reason this gets only 3.5 is because of The last 3 songs kinda suck. But anyways, to make things short, this is a damn fine album, one worth adding to your collection.PS. Another thing. Why the hell did they use printer paper for the road on the cover? As well as the cardboard on the back of the image? What's with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Rockin' Priest","review":"Another classic JP album hot on the heels of \\"British Steel\\". Almost as good - but a bit less commerical... not at all a bad thing. 1981 was not a classic year in regards to heavy metal. I thought the head banging pickings were slim. Outside of JP, the only ones that come to mind were Triumph (Allied Forces), Van Halen (Fair Warning) and Rush (Moving Pictures). For Judas Priest, only \\"Heading out to the Highway\\" made major air time on the radio. There's some classic/vintage rock tunes here - \\"Solar Angels\\" and \\"Desert Plains\\" are two of my all time favorite PRIEST songs. Rob Halford & Co are in their prime after the success of their prior release, and better yet, what was forth coming (Screaming for Vengence). I rank this studio album 3rd behind \\"British Steel\\" and \\"Screaming for Vengence\\". A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"judas priest,s amazing point of entry!!","review":"judas priest,s point of entry is an overlooked gem and definately one of their best albums ever!!!point of entry was released in 1981. one year after the well known british steel album.point of entry is a good album for the most part.i used to listen to this one almost every day for a month or two in 81.in my humble opinion the outstanding cuts are;heading out to the highway,desert plains,hot rockin,turning circles,solar angels and on the run. don,t miss this gem in priest,s catalog if you are a fan!!grab it. heading out to the highway is a good tune to start a road trip with."},{"rating":"2","title":"point of return","review":"sandwiched in between classic album\`s,british steel(80)and 82\`s screaming for vengeance,81\`s point of entry is good but not great.the band goes for a bit of a different sound here but still delivers some good metal.if your a metal fan this is still a must buy to complete your collection of priest discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album","review":"Judas Priest is an amazing band.

Look no further than this book. It catapulted Zola to stardom and so impressed the public that, after moving pictures were invented in 1895, three film versions of the story were made before the First World War, and even Hollywood borrowed the basic plot for \\"The Lost Weekend\\" in 1945. Don't think it just describes French society. Next time you drop into your favourite bar, look around you and imagine where your fellow customers will be in twenty years time.

Most of the class got this, though the professor had not mentioned it, and we were all glad we did.This book covers the same material in the casebook, but in a much more straightforward, easy to read fashion. Reading this book is where the lightbulbs go off and you understand what you are supposed to be getting out of the Casebook reading.The authors also bring in cases from the other Legislation/Statutory Interpretation casebooks, so I'd think it would be helpful if you're using one of those, but I can't speak to that personally.

It was a \\"stretch read\\" for most of the children because the text is heavily colored by the time period, language, and general style. BUT! This was a very worhty read. Each chapter reads similarily to a short story in that there is an adventure, resolution, and moral to the story.

The world they are set in is certainly different from ours, which adds to their interest, but the writing is immediate and there is nothing mannered or didactic that one might associate with books from Victorian times. A combination of lively, very real children, with sometimes a little magic thrown in and sometimes just the adventures children have when they're not too closely supervised, the books are fast-paced, humorous and adorably wholesome.This is a story of a family under stress and the children's earnest attempts to put everything right.

The kids are decent and well-presented, the story moves right along, and the sense of place is interesting and comforting. But it is pretty old-fashioned, which nowadays means \\"slow\\".

As a Veterinary Nurse I like to wear a watch that looks stylish when dealing with my clients, but that can take a light beating when dealing with my patients. I expose the watch to frequent hand to elbow washings daily, and the wrist band never looses its shine. However the clear plastic cover will get a bit dull after a few months, and unlike with glass covers, deeper scratches are noticeable. But at this terrific price I don't mind replacing it every 8 to 10 months as I have in the past couple of years. Truth is at times I favor wearing it over my other expensive watches when I go out, and often get compliments for its sleek appearance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable","review":"I love my watch lol.

They should be up there onstage receiving video music awards for there debut album that REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN the rock album of 2001! I think they should be just as popular as Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, or ANY post-grunge artists.

I also had to send $6.00 S&H for a return lighter. I did receive a new lighter but after about 7 months it had the same problem not lighting. I boxed it up and sent it back with the $6.00. That was March 24, 2008. About mid-April I starting sending emails to their customer service area. After no response to three emails, on April 21 I called their office and was told the man who is in charge of returns had been gone for three weeks. He told me he had seen my emails but that they do not respond to emails and that he would check on my return and call me. It's now 4/23 and I have not heard from him.

Griffith to Sherman Alexie. It offers discussions of nearly 60 films spanning the twentieth century. It highlights some general trends from negative to positive stereotypes, and then towards the depiction of Native Americans as human beings. The author's discussion of such films as \\"Pocahontas\\" and \\"Sunchaser\\" are perceptive. However, much of what she offers is derivative of the works of others, the research is thin, and there are egregious errors in her discussion of Federal Indian policy. Because of the general level of ignorance in American society of some of the political and historical context that Kilpatrick rightly identifies as relevant to these films, this book is horribly dangerous.The book offers a useful general overview, but readers must labor to verify many of her statements of fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contributes Nothing New to the Field","review":"Celluloid Indians offers on overview of the history of Indians in the movies but rehases much of what has been done before. The author cuts and pastes long previously published excerpts from other articles and calls them her own. She adds merely a few comments to issues that have already been thoroughly discussed elsewhere. She knows little of Hollywood history, which makes her book nothing more than a superficial study of Native American images in the motion picture business. But perhaps the most annoying aspect of this book is that it's so one sided and determined to fault everything on Hollywood that it gets tiresome after a while. Isn't it time for this field to move beyond that stereotype?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enigma of Crop Circles","review":"Whether one chooses to dismiss or accept the evidence of crop circles is purely circumstantial since everyone lives in their own mind.There are hoaxers who claim responsibility for creating the crop circles, but they are unwilling to demonstrate.The plant stalks are heated, bent and cooled according to the artist's intention.

Most scenes were shot and not even edited because of budget restraints. Look carefully at Gary Busey's eyes during every single scene. He's so high he can hardly slow down his lines. The same is true of most of the other actors who are either conspiculously quiet and speechless in scenes or are over animated. Coke is the reason that this film has so few close up shots and why, in almost every scene, the actors are just running, jumping around and/or screaming- both inside the cab sets and out. This movie, from my view, is a sad example of a possibly funny movie devolving into a cocaine fueled manic mess of scenes strung together into a releasable product. The project was such a negative experience that few or none of those involved would ever work together again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not what I was expecting","review":"This book had a great intro on how to set up mediated debates.I was thinking it would have debating techniques in it and was dissapointed to find it really didn't.I would still recommend this as it does lay out a pro vs. con take on all of the biggest current issues and could be used as a reference guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves This Book","review":"We had checked this out from the library and after the 2nd read through, I knew I had to buy it for my 2yr old.

Although this book addresses a common concept familiar to toddlers and pre-schoolers-Will Mommy come back if she leaves?-I have to say that it should have remained a picture book. Although the black ink and watercolor crosshatched illustrations on a black background are very realistic, they set an ominous tone that, in tandem with the plot, I am not certain should be introduced to very young children; at least not introduced before bed time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrified Owl Babies","review":"The beautiful artwork in this book doesn't mask a storyline that is way too upsetting for a young child. From the perspective of a 3-year old, mama owl disappears on page 1 and doesn't return until the last page. The pages inbetween show 3 gorgeously drawn little birds in the throes of anxiety over the loss of their mama. As an adult, I found it unsettling as well.

The best part of this book is that there discussion about where mom has gone keeps them from getting into mischief. The worst part is that it gives the impression that mom will sneak out during the night without so much as a goodbye-I don't personally know a good mother that will do that as it just increases the anxiety experienced by a child.Gave it 2 rating because somehow my nephews love it.

Turning to your siblings for comfort and support during this time away from Mommy is a good thing. Mommy doesn't \\"sneak out\\" -- Mommy Owl, like every other Mommy, must go and do things without her children at times, and they are not always aware of when she leaves. Hey, leaving the room to go make dinner constitutes \\"sneaking off\\" by my kids when they are too busy coloring to notice that I've left the room.My 5 year old loves this book -- the repetition allows him to read parts of the story himself -- he has great delight in repeating Baby Owl's lines throughout the story.Trust the reviews from parents with children who read this book together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry and emotion - the oldest form of storytelling","review":"\\"Owl Babies\\" is a work of art, visual and poetic. The repetitive cadences building the story page after page, together with the perfectly-judged atmospheric paintings, combine to create a world we enter unconditionally.This book has it all, in the classic theatrical sense - unity of time and place, a predictable safe story told with an appropriate degree of suspense, thrilling buildup to catharsis, epilogue full of warm reassurance.

Through the Rabbit novels Harry's son, Nelson, held little interest for me, despite the closeness of our ages. But now he's grown up, cleaned up, filling the main-character role quite well.

After listening to this in a dark room, alone or with friends, then going outside and looking at other people...they look like pale ghosts (a reflection of the life we mostly live)..just going through the mundane actions of being alive. This CD is for only those that have the insight and experience that most people will never know. It is based on the lives of modern American philosophers, those that travel a different path. Tom Russell, PLEASE keep up this work and never make a song that is played on the radio. But you may not want my opinion, I'm just a drunken Indian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious failure, unfortunately","review":"It is not difficult to understand why Tom Russell would try to pull off something like this. It is an ambitious synthesis of many of the influences and traditions that has been part of his earlier work, this time moving even further towards bohemian litterature and poetry. Unfortunately it does not even come close to deliver on its ambition. The result is a pretentious and affected collection of ideas that are mostly form rather than content, effect rather than emotion. It is understandable that he wants to move on, but this was a step in the wrong direction and he really did not pull it off. It is an embarrasment to listen to - unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many times will you listen to Hotwalker?","review":"I am a big Tom Russell fan and purchased this CD on faith.

It is very incomplete. It is a recording of a class the instructor was giving to a group of people. It is not the entire class, and mentions things she discussed previously without explaining them. It also almost exclusively shows well behaved dogs. The very few aggressive dogs that are filmed, do not show very much. The instructor says things like; \\"I can't tell you how to understand this, it is something you'll just know with experience.\\" Well, if we have to learn it by ourselves, why are we buying the DVD?

A very special book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. Incredibly Thought Provoking","review":"It is almost impossible to review this book without giving too much away. The book seems to have been written in three stages. The first stage is a humorous back story which sets the scene. The middle part reveals that these are real characters, and their seemingly humorous actions now have serious and sometimes heartbreaking consequences. The end of the story totally turns everything proceeding it on its head. At the end of the book, the reader will come to a startling and somewhat shocking realization. This book is such a strong mix of humor, horror, hopelessness and hope, that I don't think there is anything else quite like it. This beautiful book is bizarre in that it mixes feelings of dread and despair with such hope. What a powerful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Don't bother with this cat toy!

I try to avoid writing negative reviews, but I want to give a sign of warning for those who bought the first two sets. Listening to this set makes you wonder if this was even produced by the same DJ. It is good for artists to change up their music and crossover into new boundaries, however, this is not what you'd expect compared to the previous releases.

The 10-year battery was a bonus that pushed me to buy it.I cannot recommend this watch because it fails in the most basic, necessary function -- the watch loses time. In other words, the quartz movement that drives the analog watch is off, so that within one day the watch can lose 20 minutes. That's just too much to be off for such a short period, even at a low price.I will not buy another cheap Casio watch.

I'm not sure if there's a mode where you can hear all your recordings continously because I haven't really read the manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not clear enough for my class- but was on wrong setting.","review":"I tried this for class, but it didn't pick up the professor's voice.

There was a hiss sound present during all recordings that really starts to drive you nuts when you want to listen to a recording. I was driven to purchase this recorder due to the Sony name and I became tired of using my MP3 player with a built in recorder as my conference recorder. Long story short, I'm going back to the MP3 player as my recorder.

The instructions that came with it are very easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"this one, not so much","review":"I bought this recorder as a quick replacement after I lost my Olympus on a trip. The Olympus was so much better for my use. As a student, I like to record lectures and notes and burn CD's to review as I drive. The trouble with the Sony is the complicated software that comes with it. Sony corp is so concerned about music rights that they have made it a nightmare for the user to burn CDs from recordings that they have made themselves. Forget drag and drop into your your preferred software(like the Olympus.)With the Sony you must bow three times, kiss the ground and use their proprietary burn program and format--with no guarantees that the CD will play back on you chosen CD player. On the up side, the sound quality is very good for such a small recorder. Its just a real clunker once you try to do anything more than record. I just ordered another Olympus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what I need","review":"This dvr is used primarily for recording my sermons. I use it with a lapel microphone, and the quality is very nice. I have it record in the highest quality available.I start recording early in the services, and cut down the file on the fly--very easy. It links to my computer effortlessly, and there is more edits that can be done through the software.Battery life is suitable, maybe I'll use rechargable batteries in the future. The size is perfect to fit in my pocket. I've got no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for recording music","review":"This recorder is good for recording lecturers. It is not good for recording music. I bought one for my daughter for her piano lesson. The playback of the lecture (from either the device itself or after I downloaded it to PC) was good, but the sound quality of piano was terrible, with lots of noises. I ended up returning it to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"This recorder does a pretty good job. When it actual records, that is. It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow because it never actually turns itself off from what I can tell. You can put it on hold, but it's never really off until you take the batteries out. So if you want to buy this, be sure to carry extra AAA batteries with you just incase. Although you should probably warned further that I had this recorder for a few months and one day it just all the sudden stoped working. Stone cold died on me. I put fresh batteries in, was about to use it and it just would not turn on. It's dead to this day, will not work, will not turn on, not even able to function when I plug it into the computer to get the audio I had recorded off of it.Basically, this is, in my opinion, not worth the price. You're much better off finding an Olympus digital recorder and spend the extra money on something that's more reliable and records at a better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 'Off\\" switch","review":"I use this recorder for class lectures and while the microphone adequately picks up the professor, I dislike the unit as Sony failed to provide an 'Off' switch. So if you buy this unit, be prepared to either 1) spend money on batteries, or 2) manually take them out and put them back in, resetting the time, date and settings.

The liner notes are kind enough to compare these versions to the ones released, pointing out the probable reasons for their being rejected. But they don't tell you where the released takes are available. 2. The sound is particularly bad. As one who collects early recordings (including on 78 rpm) I accept some degree of hissing and scratching, but some of these cuts are, even for me, unlistenable. I would think someone would have to be a scholar or a deranged blues fanatic to buy this CD at full price. But if you MUST have these sides to complete your Lucille Hegamin collection, spend away!

He presumes so many facts told us by the bible that he might as well just say \\"Jesus is risen because the bible says so\\" and save us some time and money.For reasons why the resurrection is not supported by history, and for other challenges to fundamentalist Christianity, see the writings by Robert Price or Michael Tenenbaum on the matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend","review":"The content of this book is good, but the font is very small, and the ink is too light.

The Bible has one word for them: fools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using the Historical Jesus as a Witnessing Tool","review":"For the skeptic, this may not be your cup of tea, you would do better by reading Habermas' Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ as this book basically takes some of the main points of that book and presents them to Christians in a way that they can use to share their faith with others. The CD offered with the book has the \\"Resurrection Challenge\\" software that can be quite fun and will aid in retaining important points from the book. The outlined approach taken in the text is useful as well. If you like this book, and would like more information on the historical Jesus or early Christianity, I would recommend Habermas' other works (his website has some great videos, mp3s, and articles as well), John P. Meier's A Marginal Jew, Boyd and Eddy's The Jesus Legend, and basically anything from Martin Hengel, Larry Hurtado, or Richard Bauckham. The footnotes in those works will no doubt point you to many more sources as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for proof of the Resurrection","review":"No way you can escape this. Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus is presented in a very detailed and resonable format. The evidence speaks for itself. It's like the phrase \\"he cast out demons with the Devil's Power\\". They didn't say he DIDN'T cast out demons, they just attributed Jesus' power to the dark side. They had the evidence right in front of them. Lazarus was alive and could be questioned. Who covered up for the Roman Guards? How was Saul changed into Paul, the completely transformed former killer of christians? What changed his mind? People do not die for a lie or the perception of a lie. The disciples that saw Jesus Resurrected had no mass hallucination, delusion or craziness. Jesus did die and came back to life.

Worse still, we misunderstand the meaning and develop a theology that misses the point entirely!Here at last is an opportunity to experience the fullness of God's universal truth written by Paul to the Ephesians some two thousand years ago, but with unmistakable application to our modern day world.

Each episode involves the girls fighting some sort of monster (After going through a stock-animation \\"shielding up\\" sequence.) and revealing a tiny bit about their past, with very little to hold them all together but a side-story about a necklace.In the end, I lost interest in this anime and stopped watching it about ten minutes in to the last episode.

On an excellent CD that pattern may continue until all the songs have had their turn. After 6 listens to \\"Back to Me\\" ... nada, zip, nothing. The songs sound more and more alike. I'm no expert at writing music but I know when I hear a musical pattern that is repeated over and over and over, and I hear it on this CD. The sound is pleasant, but ultimately boring and not one song is memorable. Alas, after the hype I'd hoped for more. Oh well, to the used CD market it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails","review":"I was eagerly anticipating Kathleen's new album, but it seems a little too country-pop. A lot of the songs have simular-sounding verses to te ones on her debut cd. I'd say the only \\"interesting\\" tracks are Back To Me, Old Time Sake, Independent Theif, Good Things, and Summerlong. I miss the edge to the songs on her debut cd Failer. The guitar olos were so awesome n that cd and they are strongly lacking on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failer #2","review":"Based on the video for Back To Me and a few short clips from the other songs, I gave Kathleen Edwards the benefit of the doubt. Now it's all cleared up. Back To Me is the only song I like. I can't fast forward through the rest fast enough. What was I thinking? I have to wonder and that's all I'll do about her first cd \\"FAILER\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigh","review":"Ah the musical Kathleen days when she wasn't being reinvented as Sheryl Crow by the Bon Ivor dude. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Her literate lyrics wrapped around solid folky rock left me wanting more every listen. Hopefully, she'll get back to her roots soon. The latest Kathleen is a washed out, soothing layer of vacuous over production and shimmery adult rock with hardly one memorable tune. Oh, well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to average","review":"ALL the ingredients of 'Failer' (a CD I really like!) are there on 'Back to Me'. And they are used in EXACTLY the same way.

Give it a spin, before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the squeemish","review":"I first became acquainted with Tim Buckley's music in the early 70's when I was a disc jockey for the AM radio station at the college I was attending. Buckley has a way of \\"sneaking up\\" on you when listening to his music. Lots of his music begins with soft introductions and then, like a split personality, changes into a wildman. The first time I auditioned one of his toons, I almost fell off my swivel chair! It was almost like an audible version of \\"Friday the 13th, Part 1\\".Buckley has a spine tingling way of entertaining you. He is bizarre, strange, wierd, unusual and most of all quite effective in scaring the \\"willies\\" out of many listeners. Personally, I don't like him, but if you'd like an audible roller coaster ride, then by all means buy this or any one of his albums.

For me the show ended in S2 and I can easily forget anything that came after it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the BEST television","review":"Theres lots of ways to critique the West Wing; but at the end of the day its simply one of the best television dramas ever. The mere fact of its political setting will polarize some viewers, etc., but taken as a whole (or as 4 seasons worth) theres has been little out there to equal its intelligence and idealism, excellence of writing and acting, episode after episode. This is television.. remember that. This is the same medium that would equate a laugh track with humor, and that increasingly markets the wares of the national drug-dealers during commercial breaks (side effects may include nausea, vomitting, headache, flatulence, loss of bladder control, and mental uncertainty and mistrust of nature.) As television, then, the West Wing is a oasis. It may not be perfect (the characters all have a too similar 'smart & snappy' way of talking.. even the pizza delivery guy) but taken as whole it is a landmark. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost of Drama!","review":"This season of the West Wing is full of drama as Bartlett goes through a campaign, Leo faces Congressional hearings, and Josh pursues the stunning Mary-Louise Parker.Every episode is fun, witty, and exciting.

For die hard West Wing fans, you will love this season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great political series, great season","review":"This was one of the best TV series ever. If you like comedy, politics, and drama, you should check this out. I have the entire series on DVD and I cannot tell you how many times I've watched it. This series has massive replayability so it's worth the buy. It is also not \\"dumbed down\\" so they deal with a lot of hot-button topics and you can actually learn a little of how the government actually works and how cutthroat life is like in Washington, D.C.The first few seasons and the last two seasons are the best. There are a good deal of special features and this season was amazing. It has a liberal bent so if you are conservative you may not like this show as much as someone who is more liberal.

I loved Manchester and the kick-off of the campaign. The whole Josh and Amy thing is great, but we all know that Josh is subconciously in love with Donna. The Christmas episodes are always my favorites.On the other hand I think that fiction mirrored fact a little too much for me. I watch West Wing to see a country that is somewhat idealized, and Sorkin put a little too much real life into this season. It was somewhat inevitable, but still if I had wanted real life I would have left my tv on C-SPAN.All in all though I gave it 4 stars because it is smart, and leaves the viewer thinking, and just a little bit smarter than before. West Wing is a great show, and season 3 was not the best (season 2 was the best) but it was still a must watch and now must re-watch show."},{"rating":"2","title":"The West Wing - The Complete Third Season","review":"The West Wing seems to get better with every season and is one of the few shows that I would be able to watch over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"west wing 3","review":"Very good copy of the program.

The have a similar sound and they do it well. . .that's really the key here, they do it well. It would be different if they were some cheap imitation but they aren't! They have developed their own style based on music they grew up on. Don't knock them just because you don't have their talent or their magic. Realize that good musical styles are often recycled!

I was hoping that every song had as many cool hooks. Abra Cadabra and Love in Plaster are ok tunes but nothing too memorable.The energy of the album is high but the problem is it starts feeling like a wash of white noise with trite riffs and silly lyrics. As much as I like Two-Timing Touch and Broken Bones the guitar riffs are right off of I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone\\" by the Monkees.There are plenty of bands imitating the garage sound of the 60's with varying success, certainly the Strokes seem to be leading the pack.

Every page was like pulling teeth. And the absolutely absurd descriptions of various vodkas. Does this author know what he's talking about? I think not. I've working in Russia for over 10 years, including in the alcohol (aka vodka) industry. This book isn't even remotely close to describing what Russia was really like in the first post Soviet months/years. It's just a long dragging nightmare about an alcoholic American, her seemingly Yetti sized Russian mafia boyfriend, her sad American husband, and the most ridiculous killer/cop relationship that could have ever been created. I'm convinced that every time he described or even mentioned vodka, Mr. Starling must have been having a snort himself. Don't waste your time or your money, there are much better books on similar topcs out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like his first 2 books","review":"I hoped for the best when I bought this, but was very disappointed. The heroine, a Type A successful American brat, never won my empathy until the last 10 pages (of a book over 600), and then it was too late. The plot dragged on and on and on.

She also battles it out with alcoholism even as two mob factions fight it out for rackets in the city, all the while an Afghan war vet suffering from dementia starts drinking children's blood. Boris Starling has made a good read, the type that you'll read cover to cover and keeps you guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian Epic","review":"If you love to read long, entertaining and informational stories this is for you. I think a lot of people want too much of a static high speed suspense story instead of a good dynamic read. There is a lot of backstory but it is necessary to set up the gothic setting that early 90s Russia was. I recommend it if you don't mind the length. Several intertwined plot-lines keep it entertaining and a constant mystery. There will be some characters you like, like the gang leader lev, and some you absolutely loathe and despise such as the ex-KGB officer Sabirzhan. Really gets the blood pumping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the action begin!","review":"But it never really does. There is not much compelling action at all.Or maybe the problem is that the characters are of little interest. Who cares about them?I started this thinking it to be in the fun genre of DeMille, Grisham, or Follett. Wrong.What is of interest is the glimpse into vodka and the situation at the fall of the Soviet Union. But one gains that understanding very quickly, in the first few pages.If one is looking for a nice, quality, action sort of read, this is not the book to select."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"A relative multitude of storylines and a colorful backdrop are almost enough to save \\"Vodka\\" from being what it is, another generic entry in the commercial thriller/intrigue genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is also not what i wanted","review":"now the logo changed to mi. when I ordered it, it still shows IBM and I received the white and blue one.

My feeling: it sounds strange at first and probably will remain offputting to many people, but after a few listens it reveals itself to be a great and classic album. It is music that sounds out of time, medieval, gothic, sung in Nico's one-of-a-kind deep melancholy voice, with John Cale's spare, sympathetic backgrounds. Nico will always be a fringe character in rock and roll history, weird, fascinating, unknowable, a heroin-addicted beauty who ravaged her looks and health, and this album shows she should be taken seriously as an artist. \\"Midnight winds are landing at the end of time\\"...yes, they were for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Marble Index","review":"Cold and stark as the marble of the title. How many albums will you be listening to 30 years after you first bought them ? This is a journey to the edge where it leaves you with no way home. Each sound cuts through the rubbish around you and leaves you bleeding in the snow. If you want instant satsifaction this album is not for you. If you want something which will last, buy it. If you have it on vinyl, get it for the extra two tracks. Join me in the evening of light, and stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely beautiful Gothic music","review":"I found this album to be simply amazing. And very underrated. At the time that this album was released, in 1968, people were busy loving Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, The Rollingstones, The Doors, and The Jeffereson Airplane. Nico did not fit into any of the very popular music category back in the 60's. She was ahead of her time, very ahead.

But what made those 2 cds great is that she did not write any of the songs except the one i usually skip on chesle girl it was a preasure then. You probably already know that she slept with most or all of the people who wrote and performed with her on chesle girls and this cd. I listen to this cd 2 times to give a chance it is ok background music but it is dull and boring most of the songs sound the same but the one about her son is good and moving but that is it.And by the way Nico thought later on that her early work was boring she was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good choice","review":"dosent work like the same type of noise maker a friend bought at Walgreens... don't buy it111"},{"rating":"2","title":"FARM MECHANIZATION HANDBOOK (Purchased on 04/17/2009)","review":"The service was very good and the book is a valuable old edition which I was delighted to be able to source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This must-see classic for any music fan features the ultimate line up of Clapton, Harrison and Dylan and great Indian music.

Their sound never grabbed me when I would hear them occasionally on local radio. I saw the lead singer, Marcy Mays, one day at a Wendy's drive thru and she seemed the epitome of not phony and definitely living in the real world. I figured she had something to say as a singer-songwriter and I was right. I played this album more than any other in late '96 and '97.

The carafe concept is good, as the coffee never gets that burned flavor you get when using a burner-based coffee maker. However, the unit doesn't have a pause and brew function. It leaks...a lot...onto the unit, onto my counter, it even leaks after brewing has stopped (fyi this is with a half filled water reserve so that isn't the problem). Secondly, the coffee doesn't come out hot enough and after about an hour (definitely after 2 hours) you have to microwave your coffee. I have had it for about a year and have not been satisfied.

A few months later the same seam, this time on the left bottom side of the koshita, separated. I repaired it myself. Months later, seams on the himo began to separate. I have a cheap $25 spare hakama that held up much better.I thought I was just rough on my hakama, until I recently purchased another one of these. I had the hakama for less than 10 hours of training when the seam at the bottom of the koshita separated. I sent an e-mail to returns@e-bogu.com approximately 2 weeks ago asking for a refund for this failed hakama. I have not received a response.The only positive I can say is that I liked the feel of the material.

And nothing else in the box was harmed, so I know it wasn't damaged during shipping. Unfortunately, I had already unwrapped it before I realized it was damaged, so I know I can't send it back. But, honestly? Why would you let something so terribly damaged get sent out to a customer? Especially when it's a fairly expensive item. Over all, I give this experience a 2 out of 10, simply because it's so obvious that the one item was so terribly destroyed.

Stand out tracks in this one are \\"Spark Plug\\" and \\"The Noise of Carpet\\". The CD is packed with Stereolab vintage synths, interesting sounds and an intertwining of Anglo-Franco leftist songwriting and female vocals with interesting female back-ups, for those who may appreciate it. \\"Refried Ectoplasm 'Switched On', Volume 2\\", an album full of Stereolab odds and ends, yet good ones, is also recommended as a nice complement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanta-bulous","review":"I don't really know what to say...this is a great album, definitely one of Stereolab's best.

The album really fools you by kicking some ass with the first three songs, and then starts to slowly fall apart. The Sentinel and Heads are gonna roll are Mediocre, but passable, but the last four songs on the album are the worst S**t songs that I have heard on a Priest album, and those ballads Judas Priest has no buiness singing. Sure, Ram it Down and Turbo have been bashed, and those albums aren't Great, but slightly above average around the 3 1/2 Stars rating. This One Sucks.

My first copy of Defenders of the Faith was in 1985 (in cassette), regardless of this media I found great sounds and vocals quality, because of that I decided to get it on CD this year again for replacing the old media.

There is no ther way to hear it either, unless you have the original vinyl and a good turntable. The remaster sounds like a cassette tape that was recorded to loud. It's distorted! I ripped it into my .wav editor and couldn't believe my eyes. Instead of seeing the peaks and valleys that a good .wav is supposed to have, this thing was all over-peak! I could have done a better job. Remaster does not always mean better. Metallica's first 3 cd's are lower in volume than other cd's for a reason: clarity! All you have to do is turn up your stereo. I'd say do not buy, but if you want the music I see no other choice, unless you hunt down the Japanese Digi-pack, which I have not heard but I have yet to hear a negative review on one of those.

The riffs on here are wicked. \\"Freewheel Burning\\" is one of their best openers, it really gets the album going. \\"The Sentinel\\" and \\"Night Comes Down\\" in my opinion are two of the greatest Priest songs, and they both always seem to never get mentioned very often by Priest fans. The downside to this album is at the middle it falls apart for a couple tracks. \\"Love Bites\\" is laughably bad and \\"Eat Me Alive\\" is absolute filler. As a whole it is quite strong, and I could say something good about the rest of the tracks that I didn't speak of. This is the essential 80's Priest album. Make sure you get all their seventies offerings as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something To Be Aware Of","review":"It seems that an error during remastering has flipped the lead guitar tracks around.

If their only option was to sell out, use puffy hair and thing like that, they even managed to release a stisfactory pop-metal album. I must remember you that this was not a \\"phenomenom\\" that occured only with the mighty Priest, during the middle eighties: it also happened with SAXON, SCORPIONS, MICHAEL SCHENKER, RAVEN, ACCEPT, and other greta European bands, who tried hard to \\"make America\\". In Judas case, they had already \\"made America\\" with their previous albuns, but probably greedy executive men made up their minds about selling out and making even more money. So, in DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH we have the first clear signs of what we should have to endure with the release of the \\"great\\" TURBO.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically catchy, lyrically embarassing","review":"One of the most consistent Judas Priest albums on a musical level. Every song is very catchy and fun. Even the slow songs are slick and well-written. Side one, in particular has a catchy nonstop momentum. A major, problem, however, are the lyrics, particularly the song Eat Me Alive. Musically, the song jams and is very rocking. The words, however, appear to be written by a very spiteful, mean-spirited 10-year old.This album made me rethink my interest in heavy metal. Sure, the music's great, but with lyrics that embarassing, is it even worth listening to?I was recently tempted to buy the remastered CD used, but at the last minute I bought Joni Mitchell's For The Roses instead. What a great decision. The songs don't rock as much, but the melodies are intriguing and beautiful, the lyrics are infinitely more interesting and the music doesn't make me feel like I drank too much coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defender of the Faith=True Metal","review":"Defenders of the Faith in my opinion was Judas Priest's best album. I know everybody prefers British Steel, Painkiller, Screaming for Vengance and Turbo, but Defenders of the Faith is Judas Priest's most solid recording. The best songs on the album are: Freewheel Burning because Rob does a truly amazing vocals, Jawbreaker because the guitar solo is a true classic metal solo, The Sentinel because everything about it is good. This album is by far ahead of the rest and is classic metal at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"For some reason, I posted in my earlier review that this album is less than phenomenal. Please forgive me. If you take this album and spin in a good stereo (which I did not have at the time) and crank the volume WAY the heck up, this album is a thundering metal masterpiece! The first 4 tracks will drive you into oblivion! Almost all the songs on this album are metal classics. I don't much care for \\"Some Heads are Gonna Roll\\" or \\"Heavy Duty.\\" However, they are still good songs, just not much my cup of tea.

Why his precise and simple sound (which flourished in BRITISH STELL and POINT OF ENTRY) was replaced by the horrible kind of electronic / reverb sound disgracefully associated forever with hair metal???!!!

The real star here is Thomas Mitchell, the Duke is just a supporting player, and Mitchell gives the best performance of his great career. The moment in which Mitchell realizes that he is delving into a fellow shipmate's sad private life under the mistaken impression that the man is a spy has rarely been equalled in the American movies for emotional power. The film doesn't get mentioned enough in the litany of Ford's great movies but he never surpassed it, in my view."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of war movie","review":"Director John Ford took big lug John Wayne out of his usual prairie wanderings in this sad, slowly deliberate film about a group of merchant marines eager to make it home, with the shadow of WWII hovering over them, and German U-boats haunting the waters of the Atlantic. It turns out the Germans are less of a menace than their fellow sailors, as Wayne's naive young Swede, Ole Olafson, falls prey to a criminal pack of shanghai-ers in a seedy local tavern. The ever-dependable Thomas Mitchell brings this film its emotional core, playing his old-timer experience beautifully off of the Swede's wide-eyed innocence. Nice flick; not as exciting or robust as other wartime offerings, but complex and emotionally resonant. From a story by Eugene O'Neill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to literary agents","review":"Try this one first if you are just starting to look for a literary agent.

Whatever you want to call it, punk-grunge-stoner rock, this is one of the best of the genre. It's so simple, yet the distortion, riffs, and sometimes grinding pace are just what I love about it. It's almost like primal metal. The tracks \\"One Inch Man\\", \\"Jumbo Blimp Jumbo\\", and \\"Size Queen\\" are all great, and it's almost impossible not to break out the air-guitar to each one of them.

The voice of heartbreak, loneliness, rejection, the used then dismissed suitor who only wanted true love and an honest committment, Jerry sang for all of us who went through the pangs of disappointment back in the day.

Jerry's recordings late in his career with the Philadelphia Sound resulted in some of his big hits but his work with the Impressions in the late '50s also rates high praise from music lovers.

Suffice it to say that 90% of the tunes are outstanding but there are notable exceptions. That and only that is what brings the rating down to 4 stars.Jerry's performances are flawless. His voice is fluid, soulful, and evocative. But even Henry Aaron couldn't hit a home run every time he came to the plate. If a few of the cuts (primarily) at the end of this compilation had been left off I would have rated this as a five star disc.And I would invite more traditional music (non R&B) fans to take a listen. For the material within is appealing to both fans of soul and the more traditional.I find myself coming back to this collection very often and singing along with these reflective songs of simplicity, beauty and longing that seems to have only existed in my memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ICEMAN","review":"Jerry Butler was known as the ICEMAN because of his cool demeanor on stage.

I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Sprayer works great and is easy to use and clean(that was a big deal to me). Takes about 5 minutes to get it nice and clean after use. You really need to use the viscosity cup and thin the paint accordingly. If you do, it will lay down a nice pattern similar to a spray can. I would suggest following the instructions and taking the gun apart before your first use just to get familiar with the components. It will make it easier when it's time time to clean it for the first time. I have only shot latex in it so far, but plan to spray some varnish later today. I hope it works as well.

This one needs improving.It's easy to set the desired drinking temperature and it beeps when that temp has been reached. The display shows the current temperature when you first plug it in and after you set your desired temp. Although I'd like it more if it were wireless, the cord is plenty long enough to drink from the cup without the cord getting in the way.

No dice on getting to return it from the seller as I bought it before Christmas and you only get 14 days to return (if it's still pristine and in the package).I think $24+ is too much to spend on something that MIGHT break after one week.

Certainly Clapton's finest solo work (if you count Derek and the Dominoes as a group effort, and it should be). The decision by the record company to delete one of the songs is simply unacceptable, and the deleted song is one of the highlights of the set. Can you imagine ABBEY ROAD without \\"Here Comes the Sun?\\" Or BEGGAR'S BANQUET without \\"Salt of the Earth?\\" The deletion here is equally as ludicrous. Also, the original arrangement of the songs worked to make 461 an extended work of art, not just a collection of songs. Now it is just a collection. I don't know how to react to this kind of corporate arrogance except to refuse to buy the album, hence the one star rating.

On first listen, was surprised to hear such a different mood in the music. Reading the reviews let us know that this was an album with another flavor, but kept waiting for the fast riffs and wailing of other albums. Was a little disappointed after one listen, but each time you hear this one it grows on you Now we consider this one really great, mellow sound and love to put this on and let it fill you with the sense of peace Clapton seems to have come to at this time of his life. The reggae sound in used in several of the songs and there is quite a variety on this one, from first to last take. He is still one of the BEST guitar artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of 70s Clapton!","review":"In stark contrast with his unimpressive self-titled solo debut, \\"461 Ocean Boulevard\\" is a classic from start to finish. From the mellow blues of \\"Motherless Children,\\" to the funky riff of \\"Willie and the Hand Jive,\\" to the classic rock staple \\"Mainline Florida,\\" this is '70s Clapton at his best and the place to start for the casual fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor and pick this up","review":"I really like this album, I used to not but I grew into it. The album opens with the rockin' cover Motherless Children. Give Me Strength is alot softer, but just as good. I also like Willy and the Hand Jive, but don't think much of Get Ready, a worthless duet. I Shot the Sheriff proves that Clapton can play some good Marley, too. I Can't Hold Out is a nice blues-rocker. Please Be With Me and Let It Grow make up the album's one-two punch, both fine songs. Steady Rolling Man proves Clapton's love for Robert Johnson, and Mainline Flordia is a winner. Great work by Clapton."},{"rating":"2","title":"No bonuses?","review":"As with most of Clapton's albums, this has a good mix of blues and rock. The only thing that I can really say that is disappointing about these Clapton remasters, is that, unlike other remastered classics, we get no bonus tracks of any kind. I am sure that most fans would have wanted something extra to get their teeth into. And as a marketing move, it's a way for record companies to get true blue fans to fork out the money to replace their older copies if they are to get extra previously unreleased tracks. Maybe I should apply for a job there! But, that aside, this is a great album in true Clapton style. 3 songs are Clapton originals, and of course there is the Bob Marley hit \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" which introduced a lot of people to the reggae sound. Not a weak song on this album, but then again, this is a Clapton album. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Delight","review":"fantastic musical rendition of pure joy !!

Maybe the first time he implied that Jack and family were somewhat nastier than the Camelot legend would have you believe, and that they were taking advantage of the poor naive Jewish boy it was mildly amusing.

So I walk out with Steve Martin's Pure Drivel and this one. 10 pages into both and Mr. Stewart's effort clearly works best. Clever topics, nicely done. The waiter at the 'last supper' had me curled up like a shrimp on the floor with laughter. Loved the 'Revenge' peice as well. I'm not sure why there is so much venom in the other reviews about his jabs at Jews and Christians. Thin skins should never read humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with those who say \\"disappointing.\\"","review":"Like the other 1 star reviewers, I was looking forward to reading this, but I have to agreewith them that it's not very funny, considering how funny he is on TV. I have read it all, andit's as if he's trying to imitate the humor of Woody Allen in his writing. Borrow it from the library,is my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Like most other negative commenters here, I love Jon Stewart. He is excellent on The Daily Show, and America: The Book was great, so I was terribly disappointed by Naked Pictures of Famous People. I guess it doesn't help that I only read it recently, making most of the essays terribly dated to begin with, but even in that context the writing is painfully unfunny. I found myself cringing more than laughing. This was Jon's first book, and all I can say is thank God his sense of humor has progressed - and that I bought a used copy of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was funny?","review":"Could NPoFP possibly be from the pen of the same Jon Stewart who brought us \\"America (the Book)\\" (one of the funniest books ever assembled)? It dawns on me that the latter was team-written. Not sure whether any of JS's colleagues contributed (ideas, moral support) to NPoFP. I imagine they'd cherish their anonymity if they did. NPoFP is a spectacularly unfunny book trying desperately -- and in the most hackneyed ways -- to provoke a laugh(, a chuckle, a crooked smile...) page after juvenile page. (Disclaimer: I'm a big fan of the Jon Stewart show and of JS himself. I think he's both a very funny and a very thoughtful guy 'in person'. That said, I can only register my surprise and disappointment at how totally TOTALLY lame a guy he apparently is (or at least was this time) on paper.)

Anybody who compares it to Woody Allen is hurting Woody! He wrote about his imagined friendship with President Kennedy; not funny. The Hansen's Christmas letter each year was not funny. Even the discussion of Martha Stewart's vagina was not funny. The book looked like it was trying too hard and totally missed the mark. The title could have been really funny and wasn't. I bought it in the aiport and had a long plane ride and was really psyched to read it. The book was lousy from beginning to end and I don't even recall anything funny in the entire book. Don't waste your money. See the show, but don't bother with such a lame book. I would have given it NO STARS, but the system wouldn't let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dead Horse Groans","review":"This post-Arsenio endeavors to compel a disinterested audience to a true Utopia: the nowhere where anywhere is funnywear. Jon's cheeks are too big for his tongue, and self-deprecation reaches a seventh degree of separation. Every joke is purported to possess a grain of truth, but in Jon's case, one must be a child of the corn to taste a sour mash. Simply: I don't get it! It ain't funny! It's bad! Smarmy isn't campy, and Jon isn't either. The horror, the schmorror. Back to you, Jon."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't expect too much, you won't be let down","review":"What is amazing about Jon Stewart is that he keeps getting good jobs despite his failures. He currently works the Daily Show, despite every other show he had bottoming out. This book is a demostration of why he has failed.Many of the jokes/stories in this book are old jokes that he recycled and put a slightly new twist on. For example, how many jokes about the Kennedy family can be funny? While the new twists are often creative, they fail to actually be FUNNY! The story about Hitler 2000 was creative, but it was not laugh out loud funny. Also, the new Judiasm joke was humorous, but most people do not have the funny bone for Jewish jokes. Otherwise, Woody Allen would still be huge.In this book, Jon Stewart tries to be something he is clearly not, funny. George Carlin knows how to write a humorous book. Stewart knows how to luck out and get good tv jobs and book deals with little talent. The high ratings for this book are fraudulent."},{"rating":"1","title":"stewart book","review":"The service from the bookseller was just great, book as promised.

Maybe his humor just doesn't translate well to the printed page.I'll keep watching the Daily Show and his movies though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stewart's sarcastic, witty humor proves entertaining","review":"I picked up this book because I'm a huge fan of Jon Stewart's sarcastic, self-depreciating humor on The Daily Show. While I still prefer his in-person standup persona, Naked Pictures of Famous People is, well, funny.The beauty of Stewart's humor is his intelligence, especially in the age of Tom Green, The Man Show, and TV Funhouse. It's comedy for those of us who got over laughing at someone getting hit in the nuts round about puberty. This book reemphasizes his intelligence and wit. I'd reccomend it for anyone who is a fan of smart comedy. If you're a Tom Green fan, probably stay away -though in that case, you probably wouldn't be browsing the editorial reviews on Amazon.com anyway. So on second thought, if you're reading this, buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read In the Privacy of Your Own Home","review":"This is one of those books that makes you laugh so hard that whatever you are drinking will most likely shoot out your nose.

If you like David Sedaris, Woody Allen, or smiling - buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"had a moment","review":"Just as the title of this review states, that's all it had, just A moment. I really only laughed once throughout the whole thing. As I was reading it I could feel the disgusted look on my face, as if I was watching a car accident. I wanted it to be funny, but it just wasn't. I read the excerpt that Amazon gave on it, and that one bit was funny, just that ONE bit. Not even the rest of the Hitler interview was that funny. I tried to finish it but I simply couldn't. I tried to give it two stars, to be nice, but I just couldn't, so, for it making me laugh but only once, I give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Jon Stewart on The Daily Show but....","review":"I didn't enjoy this book.

There were some portions that were minorly amusing but I expected great stuff and it wasn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully not funny","review":"I was so so so dissapointed. Stewart's humor in this book resembles a 12 year old trying so hard to be funny, and failing miserably. He looks for any place to throw in a stupid punch line that any child could write and then the stories themselves lead to predictable, and dissapointing conclusions.It's so sad how pathetic this book is. It almost hurt to read. Please do not read this, it makes me think less of Jon Stewart though I love the Daily Show and America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humor not as sharp as his show","review":"I got this book because I enjoy watching the The Daily Show, however was very disappointed after reading the book. Stewart's attempts at short stories fall short - way short. I gave his book two stars because I did enjoy one of the stories, but the rest didn't entertain me. I bought this book based on several positive reviews, but if you're thinking about purchasing a humor book, look elsewhere such as Steve Martin's Pure Drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage - 1 star is too generous","review":"Stewart's feeble attempt at humor would have been better placed if scribbled on bathroom walls. From beginning to end, this book is filled with vulgarity, racism and sexism. It is totally without merit. Usually when I finish with a book, I either place it in my bookcase or pass it on to a relative or friend. Stewart's book deserved neither. It went in the dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humor?","review":"I can not believe some of the reviews of this book call it educated humor.

CRUMBLING DOWN and AUTHORITY SONG are such straight rock songs. PINK HOUSES is a nice sample of homecoming nostalgia. During 1984 campaign Republican candidate Ronald Reagan used PINK HOUSES as Presidential campaign song ,which was against the will of the artist who made it of course. In AMERICAN FOOL the gap between hit tracks and the rest are so huge but this one is truly consistent -- the other album tracks are arranged and mixed so that the listener would not skip after track 4, WARMER PLACE TO SLEEP. PLAY GUITAR is another of upbeat rock song and closing song GOLDEN GATES refreshes our soul.Essential for American rock fans and for any music fans who enjoyed recent compilationWORDS AND MUSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ass kicking album? Uh-huh!","review":"In 1983,after three albums under the name John Cougar,he extends it to John Cougar Mellencamp.

The latter tells about a fighter(\\"I fight authority,authority always wins.\\") JACKIE O is an ode to the now-deceased Jacquline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. On PLAY GUITAR,JCM tells listeners,\\"Forget all about that macho s--t and learn how to play guitar!\\". This album was recorded in the summer of 1983 and released only 4 months later. An ass-kicking album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD from Mellencamp's \\"Fun\\" era. Start here.","review":"Uh-Huh is the best Mellencamp CD...in a way. It features non-stop fun, anthemic music that got loads of airplay on MTV way back in the day. Every song is fun and, though the CD is short (c.38 mins.), it is totally worth the price of admission.Uh-Huh doesn't really offer a cohesive set of songs--it compiles a bunch of killer tunes that could easily fit on other albums. After having completed as uniformly excellent a collection of songs as this, he would spend the rest of his career becoming more somber and reflective and make uniform statements of an album length. So, in a way, this is his best collection of singles, but it's not exactly his deepest work.This is a great place for neophiles to start listening to JCM. A true rock classic, it sounds sloppy, honest, and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4 1/2 Stars As It His Best","review":"Steady throughout and rooted in rock n roll. Gritty guitars, steady bass, and crunching drums combined with edgy vocals that John Cougar is famous for. Pink Houses is a touching acoustic driven song probably the best tune of this strong set. Play Guitar, Authority Song, and Serious Business are the rockers that roll for me.Others may think differently but Golden Gates is another album highlight. Very emotional singing by John, touching lyrics, and great effects make this ballad a true gem.As the header says, this is Mellancamp's best to date and its just short of a five star rating due to a little lack of diversity. However, a two thumbs up, Un Huh certainly deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"I purchased this CD after buying \\"Lonesome Jubilee\\" which I loved.

The watch is a bit heavy, but I don't mind this, the watch winds up on the palm side of my wrist because I have the watch fitted very loosely.

I use this regularly, typically a few times per month, usually to blend heated kidney beans in a middle eastern dish we often eat. This blender works well and it is super easy to clean (best to clean immediately after use before food gets caked on - food practically just rinses off).

The low price of this blender convinced me (warily) to try this one. It seems to have short blades, and really they didn't seem sharp when I felt them. Maybe the motor itself doesn't have much power. But for whatever reason, this thing just wouldn't blend the baby food smooth. I did peas and okra. I could only get the peas to a 3rd foods consistency and the okra never got close to smooth enough to feed my baby. I ended up dirtying the big food processor to finish the process. This blender is half the price of the Cuisinart, but really we're only talking the difference between $14 and $28. I suggest shelling out the $28 to get a much better item."},{"rating":"1","title":"PS Hand blender","review":"I was disappointed in this blender.

You are also not supposed to \\"immerse\\" it in your dishwater. I have no problem with this; just thought I would let you know it has limits.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because you have to continue to hold the trigger down while you use it.

In fact, if the proctor silex had been my first immersion blender I'd have thought the entire concept was a fad.Still, at 13 bucks I'm glad I tried it out.

The blender did a bang-up job on the beans, which couldn't get away from it as I moved it around, and up and down in a large, flat pan. I could've gotten the mixture even smoother if I'd wanted, and all in just two or three minutes. It was a bit noisy, but the vibration actually felt good to my hands, and clean up was a cinch.

While Mills was in fine voice throughout this disc, every song she was given to sing was pure rubbish, nothing befitting of a vocalist of her legendary status. I was very saddened and disappointed to see her reduced to this. Mills has not resurfaced with any new material since this disc.

I bought this cd to listen to on a car trip...my first impression was the voice is still strong but the material seems repetitive and weak (i then pulled out the liner notes and read that she had written a majority of the songs...big mistake!) on 2nd listening i had other people in the car who were willing to pay me to change cd's or they were going to slice their wrists. not only is the song choices poor ..she sounds off-key and over emoting on several songs. This is my first review, but after reading the others on this CD, I felt I needed to warn you...I don't get what the other reviewers are talking about and after the second listening it is out of my disc player and on its way to used cd store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting book.","review":"The only book that I recommand to understand the basic design of optical transmission system. Several books are covering only few aspects of DWDM technology, this one generalize with the just need of what's going on over the fiber and where are the key points of the network.

To conclude, this book is well proportional between the physical layer and the rooting issue to get the network smart and efficient. Well done and almost sexy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many technical errors! Burn this book!","review":"I went through chapter 4 \\"WDM Network Design -1\\" of this book. I found so many annoying technical errors and inaccuracies, almost on all pages, of this chapter. It appears that authors copied various material and formula from various sources without fully understanding the material. In my view this kind of technical publication does more harm than service.The book still may be useful if you are looking for only general ideas on the subject, but if you need accurate technical information, forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence par brilliance!!!!","review":"This book is extremely well organized, easy to read and makes understanding optical networking so easy. The good aspect is the design considerations. On the negative side the book is not very liong and I hope there is a second edition. I am offering courses with this book as a tutorial guide and i findit better than contemporary books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutscene after cutscene.. more like watching an animated movie.","review":"If you like watching animated movies, especially foreign Asian animation, you might like this game because that is what you do in Jade Empire. If you like some good button mashing and then watching cutscene after cutscene after cutscene, then this might be the game for you. I like SOME cutscenes in my games, but too many will take me out of the immersion factor. Also, the graphics in Jade Empire just feel cartoony.Your character fights scripted linear enemies and then triggers another cutscene. Then your silent voiced character will have choices of dialog to select from leading eventually down the path of good or evil. Once you choose your dialog, you continue to the next cutsene. I just couldn't get into this game no matter how hard I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but terminates way too early","review":"This game came highly recommended. I can see why. I can also assume that it wasn't the PC version of the game.Good side: Epic martial arts action. Nicely developed storyline. Easy controls. Lush graphics (though a little dated).Bad side: No hopes at all for a patch. Every so often the camera would get stuck with your nose in the ground with no hope of getting it back out except through either leaving the area or reloading the game.

Good family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching Again And Again","review":"This movie, the story of a teacher from an upscale area who is mistakenly assigned to a poverty-stricken school, is heartwarming and very funny. The acting is superb; the children are street kids who quickly win your heart as you get to know each one's distinct personality and life's story. I am trying to learn to speak Italian, so it serves a double purpose for me. I've watched a number of other Italian movies, which were enjoyable, but this one I watch again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Bullion is the bomb!","review":"Every other bullion I've ever seen lists salt as its first ingredient. In the Better Than Bullion chicken base, \\"chicken meat\\" is the first ingredient listed. In the BTB beef base, \\"roasted beef\\" is the first ingredient listed.Because these bases are so concentrated, they're quite salty, so you'll want to use them sparingly. I usually eliminate or use very little other salt in whatever I'm making. My Beer Beef Stew just wouldn't have quite the depth of meaty flavor without BTB beef base. For an 8-quart pot of stew with 2 lbs. of cubed beef chuck roast and loads of veggies, I add a tablespoon of the base.And, I use BTB chicken base in almost every chicken recipe I make, especially my chicken gravy. I'll be buying the BTB ham base next for my Ham and Beans recipe!These BTB products are very much a staple in my kitchen now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Disclaimer: I am a salt-junkie, so that might explain my disappointment. But it really lacked in depth also. I tasted it unwatered when it became obvious that it was too weak for my use and there seemed to be an excessive amount of filler--it had a flour roux-like weight on the tongue that didn't dissolve. And I was making soup stock (not broth or bouillon) and it took three times the recommended measure to bring it up to snuff. It might be fine for those with more sensitive taste, but I wouldn't buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was not what I wanted.

Where the reviewed literature is often used by defense experts, the author takes personal criticism at the defense experts for using this literature in assessing injury potential. This is done quite often to a point where it is rediculous and quite defamatory.

I would not recommend this book if your looking for literature on this matter which is impartial."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Mystery","review":"This is my second book by this author and i have loved her since.this one is a truly wonderful mystery.The heroine had long time ago met a young girl who had a face of an angel in a manor that was in ruins.

But not this one ! Although some pictures are really nice, the real-time emergence of the mosquito got a biiiiiiitttttt tooooooooo ssssssllllloooowwww !! ( you know what I mean ? ) And the lack of narration meant that if you knew what you were looking at, great ! otherwise, good luck trying to determine what insect or flower you were looking at and why !The only reason this is not a 1 is that there are some nice segments, but that is only about 10 minutes. The other 60 minutes are a dooozer !

This movie is a bit like a silent-era movie, but played by small, incognito alien creatures. In Microcosmos, no effort is made to explain or describe, the scenes that are presented. Though or perhaps because the images are gorgeous, the movie feels even more vacuous and futile.Now, if instead you are moderately- to well-versed in biology and want some stock footage, say, to illustrate a lecture on invertebrate behavior, then this movie is perfect. The bland and sometimes almost vacant soundtrack is not intrusive for a voice-over during lecture. However, you will need to know your invertebrates, for Microcosmos does not mention anything about the rich life it depicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspires thinking about the world around you","review":"In addition to the great cinematography and sound, the best thing about Microcosmos is the lack of narration. Throughout the movie you will find yourself wondering why an insect behaves a certain way. Why did it EVOLVE to behave that way, etc. You will have theories about what an insect is doing, and sometimes you will see things that corroborate your theory or disprove it. More often than not you never really know for sure what the point or the details of a particular behavior is. I had to do some research the day after I saw it to find out what really was going on with some of the bugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie on bugs","review":"This movie has some really brilliant photography. You can see a whole variety of insects closer than you ever thought - or wanted to. The music goes very well with what the insects are doing, and it is easy to imagine a story behind each insect. However, this movie would have been a bit better if there had been a bit more narration explaining what the insects were doing, or at least subtitles with the name of the insects pictured. Overall though, this is really a great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly amazing insects world","review":"One word to describe it; it is just \\"Excellent\\"; I have got it on a VHS.

The new camera techniques used lose the small depth of field, keeping everything in crisp focus & making all the insects appear enormous. (If you liked \\"Honey, I Shrunk The Kids\\" & the feeling of being miniaturized, you'll dig this movie.) When a large beetle goes for a run, you can almost hear thunder. Both children & adults should find this a beautiful & interesting movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this one for the kids.","review":"The fascination of absolutely gorgeous photography wanes as the puzzling insect antics remain unexplained. My 6-year-old and I are great fans of all that's to do with creepy crawlers, but within 10 minutes, he lost interest. If your kid sits still and doesn't ask questions, this movie is fine; otherwise, buy this movie for the beauty of the best insect photography I've ever seen--but don't expect to be educated. And don't expect the kids to sit through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Kids!!","review":"My husband and I purchased \\"MicroCosmos\\" believing it would be on par with \\"Winged Migration;\\" however, we were sorely disappointed. Even though God's hidden universe was captured with macro-cinema exacting lenses, unlocking all hidden defining detail, the formatting content lacked the necessary uplifting creativity to make it uniquely interesting.We were expecting the unsurpassed life-capturing video technology displayed in \\"Winged Migration\\" with its musical score uniqueness that captured the magnificence of flight in all the world's arenas. But \\"MicroCosmos\\" of bug life was a dud; all-dreary in comparison.I would not recommend this to children!! The producers cunningly included a sexual scene to display mating in a way that no child or discerning adult should observe or would want to. It is deplorable that it is recommended for children as if its content holds all innocence."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did they do it?","review":"I was absolutely mesmerized by this film.

It doesn't glamorize things like they do on TV. Instead it gets to the nitty gritty nuts and bolts stuff that is everyday EMS. In my 26 years in the medical field, some as an RN and some as an EMT, this book shows all of the good and bad of medicine. Nurses tend to resent paramedics because they didn't have to go to school as long. I, for one, have been trained in both. You can't take an RN and put them out of their environment without the EMS training. This shows what EMS is and what it can do when properly utilized. The burnout section was also pertanent to any medical personnel.

After nearly thirty years, this volatile work is still so powerful that the entire genre of \\"heavy metal\\" sounds irrelevant. Iggy Pop sings like a serial-killer... on speed AND acid. However, what really puts this album over the top is a subtle understanding of what makes rock and roll work. \\"1970\\", for example, is patterned, in a typically demented way, after Chuck Berry's classic, \\"You Can't Catch Me.\\" Much of the credit (or blame) rests on drummer Scott Asheton, who plays impossibly tight swing. More minimalist than \\"primitive,\\" the band produced singular music- more sturctured than punk yet more aggressive than metal. \\"Funhouse\\" was the Stooges' fertile peak ... although the album will be a challenge to less adventuresome listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Id Personified","review":"I first heard this anarchic assault in 1977, and have never been the same since. It is Iggy in his most aggressive mode, and no record, not even \\"Raw Power\\" with its superior production and ferver can come near this dangerous attack upon convention. It is a slap on the face of reality; a goose to the reality that stretches from Iggy's howl on \\"Loose\\" to the throat-grabbin of \\"TV EVE.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Stooges Album","review":"I recieved this, along with \\"The Stooges,\\" for my birthday very recently. I had had Raw Power for a while, and had enjoyed that. The first album I also like and recommend it. But this is certianly the best. Very rarely do I really like an album on the first listen, and I knew immediatly that this one was going to be amazing as soon as I heard the opening guitar part to \\"Down on the Street.\\" Every track is great. My two favorites are the opening track and \\"TV Eye\\" and I love the saxophone (being a sax player myself) on side two. And it all ends chaoticly with \\"LA Blues\\" which appealed to the side of me that likes experimental, psychedelic, fusion noise like Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and the Beatles \\"Revolution 9.\\" If you liked the debut album, you MUST own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enought stars","review":"I'd give this album 100 stars if I could.

I own no other album that affects me like this one and I own over 400. As soon as I hear Down On The Street or the opening of Loose I just immediately get sucked in and want to start kicking stuff. With this band the whole is definitely greater than it's parts. If you break everything down individually there is really nothing groundbreaking here. But when you put it all together watch out! Something happens. It's primitive, it's simple, but it kind of lulls you into a violent rock and roll trance. If you like driving, garage type rock then you MUST own this disc. This re-issue also sounds amazing. It punches you in the gut far more than the original CD. The alternate takes and things are pretty cool too so you can hear how some of the tunes evolved. What also kills me is the date this was released. Think back to that time and see if you can come up with anything even close to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock N' Roll Built To Last!","review":"Albums like this aren't made anymore. The Stooges are band that fired out three timeless classics and I think this is the most interesting of the bunch. The passion and drive of the band turns in to a real avant gaurd direction. They are finding themdelfs and building bridges at this point. It rocks 10 times harder then the sex pistols and groves more then the doors! These are some of the best songs in the stooges library. My favorites being \\"Down In The Street\\", \\"Dirt\\", \\"T.V.Eye\\" and \\"1970.\\" Their self titled started it all, and Raw Power is a total classic but Funhouse is the album that will command your attention the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pounding forward","review":"Take it from me, as a lover of music and one who is just dicovering this gem of an album: jump in; let this album explode in your head. Possessed rage riding blues riffs blindly, believing in the power of their noise, letting it become them, something with which to shout. Flash foward thirty years and hear Rage Against the Machine lift their riffs and load it with another line of manic aggression. The primitiveness of the Stooges instictually reminds us of what we love so much about rock & roll and wonder of its birth. Iggy Pop and the Stooges are that (...) beginning, overlooked and shunned,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough and ready-this smokes","review":"I got to this album last out of all the Stooges albums, but it's the one I play most. The funkiest and fiercest of the lot, and the songs are very strong. It's lean, it's downright mean, and one slinky, heavily sexual record. As a band the Stooges leapt in huge strides from album to album, and if you can't move to \\"Down In The Street\\", \\"Loose\\", \\"TV Eye\\", \\"1970\\" or the title track, get yourself to an emergency room because you're physically or mentally distressed. This all fits together very well, even the climactic final freak-out of \\"L.A. Blues\\". A MUST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun indeed","review":"This album is truly greater than the sum of its parts- take any one single song alone and its ferocious power is lost, but together it creates the one and only punk rock opera. As for the Stooges themselves, they may have been stupid, but this stupidity was a vehicle to imbibe you with their feral intelligence. Completely capable songwriters and players, they were at the height of the late- 60's, early- 70's avant garde."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Stooges","review":"Funhouse came along during my formative years as a musician and was one of the albums that influenced me most in my own songwriting and playing. When Iggy Stooge began calling himself Iggy Pop, it was the full flowering of punk, a mecca toward which every heavy metal and punk band has been slouching ever since. When you put this cd on and turn your headphones to B-52 take-off, you will hear the distillation of rock influences that formed generations of music, fashion, attitude. Iggy Pop belongs on Mt. Rushmore. Now that we know Thomas Jefferson lied and would have been impeached had DNA testing existed in his era, perhaps we could rechisel his visage, add a ton of black mascara and a dumptruck full of peanut butter and put Iggy where he truly belongs, sneering down on the world he has created out of three chords and Motor City teenage angst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Affirmation of existence","review":"I drove down my street while enjoying the delicate taste of a Parliament Light, I listened to this album, and I almost drove off the road and off of a cliff that led into a cavern of never-before seen or understood musically delirious pleasure. To call this house of Stooges \\"fun\\" is like calling hunger a symptom of fatigue. To say the least, in this album Iggy presents an ultimatum to existence.

It was Dirt. I immediately got up and looked for who it was...the stooges. This is still my favorite and in my opinion the best stooges album. Gritty hard rock and roll that extracts every last cell of hippidom from your body. Dirt and Loose are the best. The vocals are amazing and the way the album flies off into chaos in LA Blues at the end is perfect. You've got noise, you've got punk, you've got the hardest rocknroll to date, you've got a sax, sleeze, drugs, pain, blood, murder.

There is a really good mix of slow and fast songs. There are several Bee Gees songs that really get me ready to work out, but one of my favorites is a slow song called \\"Finding Out the Hard Way\\" which is sung by Cynthia Rhodes (wife of Richard Marx). She has a beautiful voice as does Frank Stallone (yes, Sylvester's brother) who sings a really great song called \\"Moody Girl\\".

The top hit \\"Woman In You\\" was a great departure for the Gibbs, and they followed through with the next ballad single of \\"Someone Belonging To Someone\\". \\"Breakout\\" is a great rockin' song and \\"Life Goes On\\" begs the listener to tears with a great guitar backing by Alan Kendall. Side two? \\"Far From Over\\" was a huge hit and made a good addition to the film, but the other four songs fall shot. Not to blame the artists, as they were thrust into being big recording artists in a major film with the Bee Gees.The album as a whole is a classic album. The Bee Gees were not happy with the way their music was handled in the film, cut into snippets and seemingly out of place, but that is beside the point of this album. This is a piece of history. Its not \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" as there will never be another film like that, but it is still a good collection of songs.

But that just shows you the loving nature of God, He would sacrifice His Son, as an offering to redeem the world for it's sins. It goes in detail of the injustice of the trial of Jesus with the Pharisees, Pontius Pilate, and the rowdy mob who participated in the death of Christ Jesus.

(A technical note: I love the ongoing game with speech verbs and, at one point and to great comic effect, their absence.) Genre-hopping from hard-boiled-private-eye-meets-dark-lady to mad-scientist-saves-the-world-by-destroying-humanity, with the unexpected casting of a group of mimes as the baddies, the book is finally almost too overjoyed by its own weirdness to sustain itself as, well, a book.

This is one funny book. The word play is hilarious, bringing to mind Groucho Marx on crank. The story is a simple enough detective-trying-to-find-missing-spouse story line. The best thing about Zamboni is not necessarily the story line, but, instead the narrative voice (the singer not the song). Katzman is a very funny man. He gets so twisted up in some of his word play and surreal tangents that you wonder if he is going to be able to loop back into the story without it seeming forced. But he always sticks his landing from his bizarre little sidetrips and the story is all the better for such efforts. I look forward to seeing if he plans on writing any other books.

They work and control the fan as intended but the design made the installations problematic. The switch is big... fitting it into a wire crowded electrical box was difficult... and in one case impossible.The frame of the switch has an attached ground wire placed next to, and on the same plane as, the lower mounting screw cut-out... making it impossible for one side of the installed switch to lay flat against the box. One of these installations replaced a similar switch from Leviton. Because the Leviton is slightly smaller, it fit into the box which would not accommodate the Hunter switch, it lays flat and was much easier to install. the Leviton also seems to be of better quality and will be my replacement switch when the time comes.Edited to note that replacement time came within two weeks of the installation when the plastic connector on the Hunter switch broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap slide design","review":"Item works as it should, but the slide stem is a poor design and breaks easily.

It says to install within 12\\" of bottom HEIGHT. Doesn't mention distance from tank. I figured that it should be fine. Nope!! This thing has problems with being on a hill. If you have to park on the slightest incline be prepared to roll, push or winch to get pointed downhill so the pump primes itself. This also needs to be mounted on rubber feet because if it runs dry, from sitting on an incline, it literally sounds as though a tiny jackhammer is pounding on your vehicle. Trust me, it's loud and takes forever to prime itself, provided you're pointing downhill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No GooD","review":"This is by far the worst part in automotive history. I like the others in the previous comments bought one and had it sitting for a few weeks after purchase. When i went to install it. It ran for a bit, after minute was over Complete silence.

I have no idea what most of the titles mean, you'll certainly recognize Imagine, Let It Be and Love is Blue and Dust in the Wind. The first song Fuego De Ilsion is one of my favorites and En El Camino with guitar is also very good. Aires De Mi Tierra is very typical of their country music - but still very enjoyable to listen to. This is a great album of songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick People Would Like It","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift because it was recommeded by a relative. I have found it helpful because of the basic instructions, but only in conjuction with other knitting books that I own. I have not made any of the sweaters because they are all for people that must not only be stick people, but also quite short. If you are of normal size, forget about it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I'm somewhat passed beginning knitting, but I look through all the books and usually, there are a number of things in any given book that I want to run out and buy the yarn to make. But not in this case. Really, there are much MUCH better books for the beginner knitter out there. If you're investing that much time and money, you should at least end up with something really nice at the end, not these things. I encourage you to go with a Passion for Knitting by Nancy Thomas instead; clear instructions and attractive easy patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute patterns, but...","review":"I picked up this book while looking for a new knitting book. I'm pissed at myself that I didn't look closer at it, because the patterns are basically useless for me. The patterns are very cute, but the fact that they are knitted in bulky yarns is a big turnoff. I get the feeling that if any woman wore sweaters from this book made from bulky yarns that they would end up wearing a fat suit. Not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"sort of ugly sweaters","review":"I was pretty excited about this book when I got it, and I made two sweaters from it... but they both turned out kind of cropped and wide. I think it requires a little more adjusting and thinking than \\"simple knits\\" implies. I still have hope that their sweaters could be cute, with a little modification. Also, they only suggest really expensive yarn, so you might want to substitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"I got this book & the follow up to start knitting. Made the first sweater without a hitch! Plan on making one of the men's sweaters and several other projects. Yes the yarn they use is expensive, but there are plenty of other options out there. Directions were fairly simple for a newbie [though a the Vogue Quick Reference for certain stitches was nearby] & the patterns pretty hip & stylish [not your typical grandma sweaters]. I'm sure there could be room for improvement, including a few better views of some of the projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginner Book","review":"I just started knitting and have already made one of the sweaters from this book. The directions are easy to follow and the stories are funny. I highly recommend this if you are looking to get started on something \\"big\\" after making your first scarf! I have a few friends that have knitted for a while and they all wanted copies of the patterns as they are hip and use fun yarn! Great Book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to read instructions, good simple patterns","review":"As part of my manic knitting book purchases, I happened across this one in a tiny fibre store in Nova Scotia. The patterns are simple and straightforward, the instructions are extremely clear and if you're careful to knit up a gauge swatch, you don't have to use the pricey yarns they recommend.This book was the first to offer me a straightfoward sweater pattern that I could follow without abbrieviations or complicated shaping. I knit my very first sweater out of a pattern from this book.My only complaints are with the pricey (yet beautiful) yarns and the lack of a simple glove, mitten or sock pattern. Also, an earlier edition had some errors in the patterns, but my copy must be the newer copy, because they were corrected in mine. You can visit the yarn company's website to check out the book's original errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this one to your library.","review":"If you're looking for simple, quick projects that will result in great gifts and wearables, you'll find them here. This book is well-written and beautifully designed. The photos are great and will make you want to knit each project. More important, the directions are easy to follow. I don't recommend it for a beginner, but this book is perfect for the knitter who is ready to advance to the intermediate level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but could be better","review":"This book does have some very basic, approachable patterns but as one other reader mentioned, the hooded sweatshirt pattern is incomplete. I am also having trouble achieving the gauge with the yarns recommended even after trying different needles. Also, the little story with the V-Neck sweater is obnoxious --- it was made to show off the store owner's \\"washboard abs.\\"On the plus side, they do give row-by-row instructions for shaping armholes and necks and they do have schematics for the sweaters which is very helpful. Yes, the yarns they recommend are pricey but I do think good yarn goes a long way to making a knitting project a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"pictures, please!","review":"i checked this book out of the library because i thought it might have some hip, new knitting patterns. unfortunately, i can't tell what half of the finished designs actually look like because the photographs are so bad. one sweater is shown hanging on a clothesline and most of the others are photographed on dress forms and cropped so that only half of the sweater is visible! i'd like to know what these clothes look like on real people before i put the time into making them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-so-simple","review":"I am an intermediate knitter, and I had a lot of trouble with this book. First, many of the patterns are just not that appealing. They're quite bulky -- and while thicker yarns do knit up quickly, they're not so attractive on anyone larger than a beanpole. While I'm fairly small (size 6), I do have a chest and cannot imagine wearing such bulky garments.Second, I found the yarn selections hard to substitute because of the way they were almost all used double. And the yarns suggested were quite expensive.All in all, I resold my book on Amazon after holding on to it for about six months. I just never was that interested in knitting anything in it. I like the kids' book much better, and am looking forward to the \\"Beyond the Basics\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yarn Girls Guide To Simple Knits","review":"I found this book disappointing. I bought it because it had been well reviewed and I thought the younger styles would appeal to my 14 year old daughter. The pattern I did was the hooded sweater. The picture was cute but the pattern is incomplete. There was no info on finishing the hood. No directions for the drawstring or casing. This is not good in a book for beginners especially one as expensive as this. Also found the authors' attitude insulting to the history of knitting ie. the comments on your grandmothers kniting in the intro.They act like they invented knitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy, Boring, Not so Sophisticated","review":"Another in an onslaught of books aimed at the non-knitter. Patterns are dull but a good place to turn if you are JUST starting to learn how to knit."},{"rating":"1","title":"not simple for beginner as states in book","review":"The book does not give details on how to use circular needles, but states pattern is easy for beginner. I had to search the internet to learn how to use circular needles. It does not give detailed explanations, even though it states the book has beginner patterns. I would not recommend this book for a beginner. Easier books to read and learn from than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"U S Book Distributors Directory-no great deals yet!","review":"I.'ve been through about half the book from front to back and haven't found a good deal yet. At least not at the prices some of my comeptetors on Amazon.com can sell their books for. The best deal I've found is a comapnay that offers 45% off regualr list prices, but you have to spend $500 minimum order. That's a lot of books to sell, and the discount isn't that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite books","review":"I got my copy of Ammie Come Home when my school library was discarding books, and I'm glad that they did. I feel that this book is simply wonderful. The characters natures are subtly reveled, and within a short period of time you feel as if you have known them for your whole life. The imagery is superb, as is the dialogue. This is one of my favorite books, and I have read it over twenty times, I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in history, the supernatural, romance, or just a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one I would typically recommend.","review":"I bought this book based on reader reviews, and I can't believe how dissappointed I was! The story itself was interesting enough, but the writing just didn't pull at my emotions at all. Perhaps it made a better TV movie, but the read was nothing special. I don't even think it was the fact that it was released in 1968 because after all, a classic transcends time. This book is far from classic. I can only guess that those who love it have maintained a smaller spectrum as basis for comparison. I however will continue my quest to find the perfect novel that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ammie come home","review":"I was dissappointed by this book.

This was my introduction to the wonderful world of Barbara Michaels and I've remained 'hooked' ever since. The characters of Pat, Ruth, Sara, and Bruce---not to mention Ammie, her gallant (if naive) lover, and her seriously flawed (and truly horrible) father are so well drawn that like Ruth and Bruce I too smelled lilacs in a Washington winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among Scariest Books I Ever read!","review":"I, like the reviewer just before me, read this book many, many years ago. It sticks in my mind years later as one of the scariest and creepiest books I ever read. I remember lying on the bed in my son's room late at night so I would not disturb my husband who was asleep in our bedroom, and almost feeling a presence in the room with me, the writing is so powerful! I can remember being so afraid that I was scared to walk down the hall to our room after I finished it! I remember the details, but will not go into them here for lack of space, just take my word that it is an extremely good story and will give you chill bumps for years to come! It is one of the many reasons that I love Barbara Michaels' books to this day, and I have read almost every one she has written, with the exception of one, which I just ordered and I don't know how I missed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ammie, come home","review":"One of my favorite authors and she never fails to deliver a good story.

There is just a touch of the supernatural, two great romances, and a lot of historical background. The next book featuring many of the same characters, Shattered Silk, is also very intriguing, and features a more 90's motif. There is a third book which is connected to the same characters, but I don't recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific MUST READ BOOK!!!!!!","review":"this book is officially one of the favorites of my favorite books.I read this book the first time about a month ago and I absolutely loved it!!

It is great and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"This was a great movie. It makes you very aware of the way things were done in that time. With the new rules now I feel that wrestling is a safer sport ( not that you don't have the kids that still take laxatives and starve themselves). The new rules just make it a little harder. The story was very down to earth. We can't make our children live out OUR hopes and dreams. It has to be something that they want. And this movie proves that you have to want it very badly and you have to work extra hard for it. You don't have to spend a lot of money to make a good family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indy Movie of the Year","review":"I have been involved with the sport of wrestling for more than a 13 years, both as a wrestler and a high school varsity coach.All I can say is this movie is a MUST SEE, no matter what sport you follow. This movie crosses the sports barrier. Although REVERSAl is centered around wrestling as a theme, it is more about a father who will do anything to help his son succeed! I have never experienced such realistic, raw wrestling talent from the movie industry before REVERSAL; likewise, no movie with a sport as a foundation has ever taken me on such an emotional roller coaster. In fact the last movie to send me on such an emotional roller coaster was TITANIC -- the highest grossing movie of all time (at least until Star Wars came out for the 2nd time).THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE -- DON'T MISS OUT -- DON'T MISS THE MESSAGE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I would not reccomend this movie to students. I thought it was supposed to be a family movie. The language and sexual themes were unnecessary. It could have been such a great film without those things. The convenience store part where the kid is buying trojans is pitiful. The part where Shaw is talking about them sleeping together is unecessary. Just a few things and it would have been so great. Now I can't show it to my wrestling team. As I was watching the video, my thoughts were to destroy it, because I find it unsuitable for any audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little film, big heart","review":"Even as a non-wrestler, I enjoyed this film. It has a compelling father-son story that elevates it above being a sports movie. That being said, the wrestling was some of the best sports action that I have seen on film in its raw but technical feel. The photography in this film was good, but the movie does feel at time like a good effort from film school, especially in the pacing. I was not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised and moved by the story. It is far better than most big studio productions, despite a few imperfections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This CD - You Will Love It!","review":"To be honest, I didn't know what to expect from this CD. I was a bit skeptical about it since I hadn't heard any of the songs before and wasn't familiar with Duff's music away from GNR, plus it isn't even released in the USA (why is that?). I took a chance on it an am very glad I did, it is one of the best CDs I've picked up in a long long time.

Lee Underwood's guitar never sounded better, and the lineup of acoustic bass, vibes and 12-string (and no drums!!) is perfect for what Tim is trying to get across. A very accessible and musically fulfilling album. Side One (the first 3 tracks...sorry, I'm still hooked on LPs!) is one of the better listens from the late sixties, period! After the first two albums, which were flawed by overambitious lyrics and lush production (Tim was not a psychedelic artist), this is an extremely satisfying listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buckleys Best","review":"This was the transition album for Buckley from folk protest type gig--to the mixing of folk jazz rock hybrid that he single handledly invented and perfected. At times he failed miserably but when he succeeded the results were amongst the best music of the 20th century. Standout tracks here are \\"Love From Room 109 At the Islander(On Pacific Coast highway) gotta love that title and \\"Strange Feeling\\". This record would lead to the ill fated \\"lorca\\" that distanced Buckley even further from the rock mainstream and an audience for that mattter.

But mostly it sounds like Japanese pops in the sixties.But their main excitement exists in their live performances.

The plot turns on an attempt to redefine metaphysics for the rest of eternity (now that Hume has essentially disproved its usefulness). Will he succeed? You can be the judge, if you like, but please take the time to read Hume's brilliant work before you waste any time (or money) on this scoundrel's scientific-sounding drivel!Kant is one of the main reasons philosophy and philosophers are today considered boring. He influenced a generation of fools after him, most notably Hegel and Schoepenhauer. I can attest that Hegel's work is no more valuable, equally unintelligible and obscure, it clearly had no positive influence on history. His idiocy is the main reason why later philosophers Marx and Nieszche, for example, come off sounding so angry!

In addition, Kandel makes poetry and beauty of the mathematical aspects of the story. At one point, he describes the angles of a triangle in such luscious language you want to curl up with one, just to see what it would be like.I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

I was incredibly frustrated to find out that there are numerous mistakes in their answer keys. There were several answers that I knew for a fact were correct and upon checking my answers to information in recent text books, I was indeed correct and the answer key was not. It is very annoying to pay money for a test preparation tool just to find out that they did not take the time to double check everything.

It is filled with errors and mistakes. The review lecture contains materials that are not only misleading but sometimes contradict most current edition of organic chemistry textbook (ex. read the Sn1 and Sn1 solvent). Even the practice test are filled with wrong answer and incomplete explanation. The diagrams are often incorrectly illustrated, especially in the PAT section. Chances are that you will end up missing more points because of the wrong information in this book. I would recommend Kaplan's prep material instead.

It's not even the typos that makes me so disgruntled... the book will answer questions with wrong answer! or it'll provide you with 2 \\"right\\" answers, but choose the lesser true of the two.i.e. How does a catalyst work?There was an answer of \\"Lowers Activation Energy,\\" which should be right, but was not! ummm, are this is for the DAT?Sure, the title says \\"How to prepare for the DAT.\\" Yeah, this only prepares you to PREPARE for the DAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"Like many other customers who reviewed this book, I have to say that this book does have a lot of mistakes in every section, however for the PAT section it will definatly help you out by giving you some good info on how to do well, but as I mentioned before when you'll be doing one book's test be prepared in getting a lot of \\"wrong\\" answers do to the lots of mistakes in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with KAPLAN...or anything else","review":"If you feel that your future is worth 10 bucks than this is the book for you. This book is an example of everything that is wrong when studying for the DAT. I cannot tell you how many errors I found while flipping through the pages...the errors not only included a multitude of typo's, but more importantly conceptual errors. This book contradicts Kaplan and my organic chem book in explaining substitution reactions, their explanation of rate laws is inaccurate, and the practice exams have many errors that will make you believe you are an idiot...an idiot in the sense that you know you are right without a doubt, but Barrons answers the question differently.

It is ok for the Science sections, however the reading comp section is not representative of what is on the actual test. The passages on the real test are not all about Dentistry. There are also plenty of errors in the PAT section. I would recommend the coursework from Kaplan. I would also recommend the KSF review since their questions are somewhat representative of what the actual exam covers.

Although there are a number of fine performances of this extraordinary work (including several others by Hans Hotter, and a darkly beautiful one by Josef Greindl), the Hotter interpretation recorded in November of 1942 is truly exceptional. It grips the listener completely from start to finish with a directness and a profundity of emotion that cannot be described in words, but must be experienced. The tragic shadows that pervade this group of songs (mirrored in the fact that Schubert corrected the proofs on his deathbed) are given substance in Hotter's performance and are communicated to the listener so effectively that one truly becomes a participant in this horrific winter journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop watching!

She not only looks remarkably like her, but exudes that innocent, yet sexy persona. Also, like Hemingway's character, Syd (Mitchell) begins to dabble in homosexuality. I never saw this movie before, but it always had my interest because it was a big change for Ali Sheedy playing a very butch photographer. It is also the first movie directed (and written) by Lisa Cholodenko who had great success recently with \\"The Kids Are All Right\\". Unfortunately, the movie is more style than substance. Aided by the terrific Patricia Clarkson as a drugged out German actress, this is another example of the actors being better than the material. It isn't a bad movie, just a boring one. Cholodenko holds back on the hot and sexy when it's most needed and generally leaves the viewer flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Clarkson is why you sit through it","review":"WHAT, for heavens sake, is Rhada Mitchell doing in this film -- and why? As a mousy editor of a preeminent, cutting edge, photography magazine? The masses may buy the idea, but it doesn't fly with reality. Ally Sheedy did an interesting job of looking bored and wasted, but I did not for one second believe she was a lesbian and her pawing attempts at portraying homo erotica were laughable. Thumbs way up to Tammy Grimes: when she was in front of the camera (as little though it may have been), she ruled the scene. The absolutely phenomenal actor in this dreary and bleak story was Patricia Clarkson -- her portrayal of a drug addict high for most of the film was too real for comfort.

The story is as trite as it could get. A better part of the movie has been spent showing people snuffing mind-bending drugs in a house that resembles an opium house (with some chill-out ambient music playing in the yonder)? Is this high art?I really fail to understand as to why artists (painters, photographers) are shown as unsocial, drug-addicts, cranky and emotionally distraught.

Both were so natural (Sheedy was always my favorite Brat Packer) and I never doubted for an instant these were real people, not just stock junkie lesbian characters.

More recently I copied the vinyl to a CD. When I discovered this remastered version, I decided to buy a copy and I expected a much improved listening experience. Sadly that is not the case. As others have pointed out in their reviews here, this remastered version is very bass heavy and the vocals now sound like they're in the background. Listen to the song samples here and then compare them with the samples on the page for the un-remastered original album CD and I think you'll agree.....

Absolutely essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star Songs, Horrible Mastering","review":"This is a wonderful album, but the first two songs are horribly mastered. The bass is over-emphasized for one thing, and the vocals are pushed into the background. They sound as though I were listening to a receiver or car radio with two controls, bass and treble, and the treble was turned down and the bass turned up. This is a shame, because \\"In A Big Country\\" and \\"Inwards\\" are two of the stronger songs on the album. Awful clipping. Awful bass-emphasis makes it sound as though you are listening to the two songs through some kind of heavy veil.Fortunately, the other songs that I paid close attention to appeared to be nicely mastered. If anyone knows of a CD version that is better mastered, please let me know. I'd like to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"To borrow a recent title \\"All killer with no filler\\"","review":"From the first tap of the bass drum of In a Big Country to the last notes of Porrohman this album/CD picks you up and takes you on a Celtic flavored rock journey. There literally is not an average song on this CD. I know I'm biased. I have been a fan of Big Country since freshman year of college in '83. Their sound is not for everybody. But it's definitely for me and everyone else who recognizes great lyrics, singing and musicianship. While most of my generation was playing their Def Leppard CD's to death, I was more than content to know I had found a gem in this band and their first album. I'm not going to list song by song but if you're considering purchasing this CD, please don't hesitate. My only regret is that I wasn't able to see Big Country live and sadly never will. For those of us who have found their music, we know they are far from being one hit wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST albums EVER!!","review":"I still have the cassette tape I bought in 1984! I adore this album, yes I am old and still think of things as albums. This album rocks like few others. The drum work is spectacular, and the guitars, well, what can be said of the guitars! The band, somehow, makes them sound like bagpipes. Simply incredible.I was fortunate enough to see Big Country at the Tower Theater outside Philadelphia during their tour for The Seer. They were an outstanding live band. As often happens, my musical taste changed and I drifted away from BC, but rediscovered them years later. All of theie albums are good - there is not a dud in the bunch, but The Crossing, in my opinion, is their best. If it was released today it would be hailed as a triumphantly original, breathtaking debut.The songwriting and musical power of this band was exceptional.As Stuart wrote, \\"Dreams stay with you, like a lover's voice\\". This album will stay with me, in my collection, forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting sound,makes me feel kind of travelling","review":"I first listened to this album back home in Germany.

The Scottish flavor to the guitars and the driving bass and drum work make for a classic rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Country's masterpiece","review":"This is a great album. Big Country has its own sound and its own style with clucking guitars, pattering drums, and lush, dreamy lyrics. And with that style they create their own poppy songs, like \\"Inwards\\" and \\"1000 Stars,\\" as well as epics like \\"The Storm\\" and \\"Porrohman.\\" What can I say: it's brilliant. Repeated listenings make me sad that they couldn't hold onto that sound in later releases. This is Big Country at their beginning, and at their peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, huge, multi-layered, anthemic. Easily 5 stars.","review":"Bought this one on vinyl when it first came out, and after all these years, I still get chills listening to it. So much to hear in every song. The power in this music is beyond description. The absolutely gorgeous \\"Close Action\\" is worth the price of this album alone. Mr. Adamson's death is such a huge loss. A million no-talent nobodies filling the airwaves with hip-hop banality can't begin to touch the depth and gift that this group had. So unfair that those groups perpetuate endlessly, while Big Country is gone.\\"I will carry you home.... with the gods in my eyes.... \\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Zox Rox my Sox","review":"A friend told me about Zox one year ago, and my musical life has never been the same. I must say that they have the most original sound that I have heard lately. \\"The Wait\\" carries the tradition of Zox excellent that began with \\"Take Me Home\\". The edgy guitar intro to \\"Thirsty\\" catches you in the heart, and the emotional violin throughout \\"Anything But Fine\\" tears the heart right out. However, \\"Can't Look Down\\" has to be the most uplifting song I've heard in years, and my friends and I sing it at the top of our lungs over and over again in our small dorm room. \\"The Wait\\" is most certainly this year's must buy album."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't stop listening","review":"zox was playing at a local show so i went to see them and it was definetly one of the best performances i have ever seen. i immediatley fell in love witht them. i bought the wait and cannot stop listening to it. it has such deep lyrics which are rare nowadays, and the violin and bass riffs are one of a kind. if you like good music, this CD/band is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Replacement","review":"I chose this product being the older attachment on my suction equipment broke; saved me a few bucks, without ordering an entirely diffrent one.

This was one of the underestimated English rock bands of the 70s, never very popular beyond England and... Eastern Europe.

And the 2 closing tracks are among the beautifulest songs I have ever heard by a hard rock band. This is is music that not only rock fans shuld like but every one who hears this album must love it, i cant se why they shuldent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demonic Yes, But Where Were The Wizards?","review":"Well, this group made it, the Rolling Stone critic didn't commit suicide, but as a monument to bad taste Uriah Heep was in a league of its own. At the least, it could brag about having about the lead singer with the most annoying over-the-register scream this side of Steven Tyler and the \\"guiding force\\" who could and did prove there was no limit to delusions of rock grandeur. That this was actually considered a coming-of-age album for a band who \\"finally\\" found the right rhythm section (just what WAS so right about a meandering bassist and a drummer who couldn't cut a proper groove with a meat cleaver but had about the most ham-and-clubfooted style this side of Carmine Appice) testifies to how easily even the sensible get fooled. About this album, it is said best that the cover art (Roger Dean) was as memorable as the music was (and remains) irredeemably ugly.

I needed it because I had a copy of the first edition from the library and had ordered the CDs from Cornell University to match. The CDs (which are excellent and amazingly extensive and good value) didn't match the old edition of the book, so I ordered the new book, thinking it would be roughly the same. Unfortunately, it is totally different. In the old edition, the graded conversations followed a story and kept me committed to continuing. In this new edition, the graded conversations are totally random. I don't care about the characters in them, as I don't get to know them. I know nothing about them. They have no substance, and I'm bored. I bought this book because I don't have a regular teacher or class to attend where I live, so I need the book to be very engaging, which the first edition WAS!

I personally did not care for the added espionage element of the novel. I did enjoy Megan's adventures with having her bloodhound, Ferdinand, who is also on board the cruise ship with her. I did enjoy the day Megan and Luke spent at the port of Singapore in Chapter 7 (i.e., her visit to Tangs shopping centre, lunch at the Raffles Hotel, Sago Lane).

The Chinese government's fear of the Buddhists and the power of the Buddhist philosophy is reflected in this feeble attempt to disparage Buddhism and its practitioners. It should be obvious to Amazon.

Man is responsible for all the misery of this world, but a loving God has provided a means for repairing our relationship with Him through the sacrifice of Christ Jesus. There is no explanation as to how cultures destroy themselves by turning away from God and biblical truth. The Jewish story is not one hopelessness as it is portrayed in this documentary. In the end God will fullfill His promises toward His choosen people and all believers in Christ Jesus.This documentary is a onesided Liberal view focusing on a victim-hood ideaology.

It is eco-friendly but the light plastic slip case barely holds the CD's and the books that come with it. I like the liner notes but the poster is unnecessary.For those new to REM, there is no better place to start. It is a great compendium of their work, spanning nearly two decades. Hard to believe.

It's great to have all of these songs toghether as opposed to buying the soundtracks that they are on such as coneheads, batman and robin and a life less ordinary.

However, the differences between the two groups are demonstrated by a love of the early, non-commercial stuff and the mid '90s commercial stuff. The compilation is all about the mindless singles that gave REM mainstream success. Excluding \\"Electrolite,\\" none of these songs really needed to be included for a \\"best of\\" album.

Their last collection of singles was Eponymous, which came out in 1988."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a Box Set will due justice","review":"It's simply too difficult to find any 16-18 tracks and call it \\"Best of REM\\", a subjective exercise that is sure to disappoint long time fans (no IRS material) and fall short of expectations for the newbies (not enough radio-friendly fluff).That caveat aside, this is an excellent compilation, if only because \\"Bad Day\\", \\"Animal\\" and the outstanding \\"The Great Beyond\\" - all non-CD tracks - are here. Choosing the rest is like selecting your favorite sister / brother. Sure, I could have done without \\"Stand\\", \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\\", and \\"Imitation of Life\\" (fluff) and would have substituted \\"Me in Honey\\", \\"The Apologist\\", and \\"She Just Wants To Be\\".

Interesting to see how the main advocates of the Yugoslavia war, German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and foreign minister Joschka Fischer would defend themselves. Milosevic is dead for some time now. One may qustion the trial against him but one should also ask why our own leaders have not been put into the docks with him! At least in literature they can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schroeder in prison? - Never!","review":"When reading the book I was really not sure at the beginning whether or not this could be a true scenario but I must say it is fascinating as the fiction becomes very real and one can imagine that the politicians who once attacked Yugoslavia and Afghanistan would not have any power anymore when they are in the docks like Milosevic is. After reading the book I thought, well, yes, why not put our leaders into prison for their crimes? Then again, can I imagine Schroeder, Bush and others serving life sentences? On the other hand: who ever thought that Milosevic would end up in prison? I am glad thait is only a fiction so far but it made me think about our democracies. I can only recommend the book to anyone who is eager to learn something about the background of today's world politics and their actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of the others","review":"The African slave trade is one of the great stains of human history. Much has been written about it by European - white authors, though unfortunately, there are very few recollections of the slave trade by actual slaves. This book is one of those works. The author, Olaudah Equiano, was born in Nigeria and captured as a child and sold of to slavery in the New World. He eventually accummulated enough money to free and educate himself, and make his way thru the world as a free man. This book is his story, told by himself. He retells his kidnapping, his trip from Africa to N. America, his service to different masters, how he bought his own freedom, and then his life as a free man. He retells both the punishments he endured, the work he had to do, and the opportunities denied to him while he was a slave. Overall, a good book to read about the life of a slave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This product was great! I am very satisfied with it.

I had to buy each of these for $40 each--they would not ship them, and also had to buy the software that was supposed to come with the camera. after all that, the leads broke, then the zoom button would stick, and finally the camera started eating tape. the customer service was useless and I finally just threw it out.

And to top it off, Amazon keeps asking me to review the product, which is kind of pissing me off, really.

Although, technically, this isn't really an all new single, it is none the less very good and worth the money. 'FINAL DISTANCE' shows off Hikki's voice spectrum and skill, showing that she's not limited to just singing pop music. Even though 'FINAL DISTANCE' isn't my favorite song, it still has an attractive and good melody to listen to (At the least, it doesn't have an annoying, redundant melody or sounds). The remixes of 'Distance' are also very fun to listen to after the slower beat of the main song. (The m-flo remix is especially good.)Overall, this is an essential for the Hikki fan.

I bought it first and foremost because it was nicely designed. It's brief but informative and has alot of nice images. The downfall of this book, as I noticed after reading it, is that the editor did an appalling job of ...well editing. This book has an insane amount of spelling and grammar errors (for a book in print I mean). I was a bit dissapointed by that, I guess they sacrificed clarity for image. Too bad, it could have been perfect.

It is very useful as a quick reference, but it is not an indepth book. It is practical and the original description on the amazon site is right on the money. I read the whole thing in just a couple of hours but will keep it on hand for reference (as which I feel it was designed for).I would recommend this book to students, teachers, and for people who want a quick reference for when that annoying \\"know it all\\" relative or neighbor brings up the subject of something they read in the paper last week. If you need a quick source, this is it.My wife is a plague, virus, and pandemic book aficionado and she liked it alot.

Clinical notes on treatment and prevention round out a unique approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"A smug harangue","review":"I took an intense dislike to her smugness and across-the-board disdain of her clients. She seems to despise all of them, unknown as well as known. She scorns those whose homes are too clean and those whose homes are too dirty; those who won't stay to talk and those who do stay around, presumably because they don't trust her (she doesn't consider it a violation of trust to watch TV, make phone calls, have sex on their bed, and \\"spy\\" (her words) on them. Even other cleaners don't escape her mocking. The writing style is breezy and reads quickly. Is it a good book? It does reveal who she is, and in that way succeeds as a kind of memoir. But I wouldn't read anything by Rafkin again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this insulting, hypocritical book.","review":"THE OCCASIONALLY AMUSING COMMENTS ARE NOT WORTH THE INSULTING ATTITUDE THAT PERSISTS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE BOOK.The author can't be pleased: She gets hired to clean a filthy house, she complains. She gets hired to clean a pristine house, she complains. Meanwhile, she NAMES her clients and their locales when describing their shortcomings, and talks openly about her brother's drug-dealing history. She spends WAY too much time divulging other people's private information. She also believes that housekeepers' employers should bring them into the home as guests for social gatherings, an absurd presumption (who invites their mechanic, their doctor, or their plumber to their home?). No wonder she got fired from jobs after divulging clients' names and eccentricities in local newspaper columns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another rich overeducated writer slumming it for a book deal","review":"This author grew up with maid service, she can't seem to understand why her former maid didn't want to \\"talk shop\\".

There is very little fun in this book and a lot of judgmental writing, which frankly, I could live without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"The author seems intent on insulting everyone around her, and puts herself above them. Her behavior is so often offensive that even her witty, breezy style cannot make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very curious or adventurous","review":"Well, they're not all that curious, and they're not all Rafkin's adventures. Either she simply didn't have enough to fill a book, or she felt the need to be \\"serious\\". So interspersed with anecdotes of her cleaning jobs, we are treated to interviews with \\"dirty\\" house cleaners, her family's former maid, and members of \\"Messies Anonymous\\". Not to mention an extraordinarily self-involved letter to the surviving lover of an old friend, a letter that read as though it were written with an eye to publication.Rafkin likes to clean, but she doesn't have to, and so one gets the impression, even though it may be unfair, of a dilettante. Too, although she mentions long-term clients, there's a sense that she flits from place to place. There are amusing anecdotes here, but in the end it's not a very satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Dirt Here","review":"I'm not sure what this book is supposed to be -- a tell-all? An exploration of the history of cleaning and its place in western culture? A treatise about the underclass? I think part of the problem is that the author herself is not sure where she is, in the metaphysical sense. I couldn't tell why she was a cleaner. If she liked it. Even where she lived! And as far as \\"other people's dirt,\\" there was precious little here. Not at all what I expected. I was more than a little annoyed at the curious tone the book took towards the idea that those who hire cleaners are somehow exploiting them... Very confusing. I was looking for an author who was going to dish some dirt and instead got an earful about Marxist theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"not \\"adventurous\\" enough","review":"I thought this book would be more about what the subtitle described: \\"A Housecleaner's Curious Adventures.\\" It wasn't. As someone else said, she tries to give overviews of a lot of areas at least tangentially related to cleaning -- minorities, a Japanese spiritual commune -- but jumps from one to the next without exploring any of them fully. And if you're reading it to find out the \\"spy secrets\\" she can supposedly figure out about her clients, you've learned all you're going to get on the cover blurbs. She knows how to write, but apparently can't decide what to write about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor little rich girl","review":"This book turned out to be a bust. Thankfully, I got it used at the library resale cart. I agree with other reviewers that she couldn't seem to settle on a topic. And then, at the end, when she mentions that she OWNS a home in the Bay Area--tell me she did that with cleaning money!! Yeah, right. Sorry, honey, but there are a lot of people who actually have to do the crappy job that you were trying out. It might be \\"interesting\\" for you; for most, such work is thankless and unending and barely serves to put food on the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let this woman into your house! Clean it yourself.","review":"Initially, the idea of this housekeeper's adventures seem amusing. But, the amusement wears off as the reader finds that virtually all of her past and present clients are subject to her nosiness and attitude. Home owners are criticized for being too neat (hence, no cleaning is required); They are criticized for having a house that is too dirty. Damned if they do and damned if they don't. Ms. Rafkin thinks that it is her place to bite the very hands that have fed her in such blatant, and frankly, nasty, memoirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude and not funny","review":"The author is rude and crude and tries to be funny in a sort of smug way. She assumes you will laugh at her \\"insights.\\" These are mere invasions of privacy that would make anyone with a maid or house cleaner shudder. The author thinks these invasions of privacy are funny. They aren't. Don't get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate book","review":"Louise Rafkin seems to find nearly everyone except herself below contempt, whether it's a client or a sibling. She doesn't seem terribly fond of friends, and a potential spiritual advisor gives her \\"vapid\\" advice, which she fails to follow in the single test she's given. She despises people who aren't as obsessive-compulsive as she is, and shows no integrity in her work. I can't imagine that anyone would dream of hiring her to clean their homes, or write another book, after this dreadful self-aggrandizement of what must be a very sorry life devoid of trust or true intimacy. The time spent reading this book could be spent doing almost anything else; cleaning your own toilet is more amusing, and you won't feel nearly as dirty afterwards"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"This book is filled with anecdotes that go nowhere and aren't funny. The stories are random and poorly written. I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Just TERRIBLE!","review":"Just when I was warming to the idea of hiring someone to clean the house, I read this book and it FLAT made up my mind to never, EVER do such a thing! In all fairness, housecleaners in general are probably nothing like the nosy, critical, self-serving, not to mention LAZY Ms. Rafkin, but I shall not take the chance. What an incredible waste of time, money, and eyesight it was to read the blithering idiocy proclaimed on each page."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely funny!","review":"I could hardly put it down. I think the scathing reviews in here can only be those of women or men who have never cleaned homes for a living. Lighten up folks...sheesh!! This was one of the funniest books I've ever read. Though I may not agree with Louise politically, her humor and humanity are wonderful. I have cleaned homes for 5 years. It isn't a \\"hobby\\" as some clients would like to think. This made for a delightful evening of laffs. Hey, Louise, when's the video coming? KUDOS, susie melkus"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Jerry Springer, you'll love this book","review":"Rafkin's book is doing well, which is fortunate for her, because she surely has driven a stake through the heart of her cleaning business by publishing it. The self-portrait she paints reveals her to be the kind of woman who would stab you in the back just after proclaiming you her best friend. THEN she'd have the gall to \\"tsk, tsk\\" you because the knife's no longer clean! This book left me feeling soiled, not unlike the revulsion one feels after watching a Jerry Springer episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliantly insightful, provocative and visceral read","review":"Rafkin's memoir took me on a roller coaster ride of emotion. From tears of laughter, \\"I nickmaned this couple the Shedders, because from the evidence in the bathroom, they had to be losing fistfuls of hair on a daily basis\\", to deeply saddened by the class issues she reveals in the chapter entitled 'McCleaning', cringing at the the thought of 'vacuuming maggots' from a crime scene, to a truly poignant moment making the bed with the husband of a client recently hospitialized with terminal cancer. Ultimately, she ties the whole thing together with what is presumably her own spiritual epiphany of returning to her native west coast to 'clean up' her own mess. This is a smart book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball hasn't seen anything like him since....","review":"Sure as hell no one in baseball was ever as driven as Ty Cobb. The stories and anecdotes contained in this book prove that. This is *the* penultimate baseball biography. Any true student of the game should have this on their bookshelf before any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ty Cobb, the ballplayer","review":"This is an incredible book. It's a great read for anyone who wants to know what it feels like to know someone so hated, yet a gem on the field, a genius at the plate, and a demon on the basepaths. Al Stump portrays this sports figure as legendary on the diamond, but a menace everywhere else. No one liked him, but he was better than everyone else of his day, or any day, for that matter. Some highlights are his 'restraining order' from the entire state of Ohio, his several run-ins with owner Frank Navin, and even baseball's only fatality is described(and how Cobb used it to his advantage). A good book, you come away with the feeling that you almost knew Cobb, but you're glad you didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps Baseball's Most Disliked Player","review":"This book documents the life and times of one of the most complex, violent, angry, and racist men to ever play the game of baseball. It takes the reader from his growing up in rural Georgia to going to Detroit to play for the Tigers and finally to his later years in California and his death of prostate cancer in 1959. But along with these personality defects, Cobb had incredible talent to go with his competitiveness----and he was competitive both on and off the field. Anyone interested in baseball's history would undoubtedly enjoy reading this biography of one of the game's most colorful characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best biography *EVER*","review":"Stump gives the reader a more thorough understanding of Cobb and his peculiarly ferocious personality then any Cobb books I have read.I can't believe Cobb wasn't locked up for lifeAs Babe Ruth put it: \\"He was the most agressive B**ch that ever played the game, he wanted to beat you on saturday and twice on Sunday, if he didn't he was miserable.\\"Best book and baseball player I've heard of and read about. Who else can get a double on a bunt??Who else can go from first to third on a sacrifice fly??TY COBB that's who!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK WOULD MAKE A GREAT COASTER OR DOOR STOP","review":"This was my first John Saul novel and I wasn't impressed. In fact I was downright bored. I'm not saying I won't read another one of his novels, but I'll ask around for a good one first, because if his other books are like this one, then DAMN.Now I read quiet a bit, and I love a good scary story from time to time. .... It starts off well, scary house in the woods...that hasn't been lived in for years. Yada Yada...you know the formula. Anyway half way through the book it takes a turn for the worst. No clear plot, or conclusion. Boring desriptions and characters you could care less for.I promise you, in a few years there will about 100 copies of this book on the used bookstore shelf in your town, because no one will want to hold onto it. Please don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Hand of Evil","review":"Excellent reading....I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read Nightshade. Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Saul Book Ever","review":"Very boring and simplistic. Struggled to stay interested until the end...what a let down. Not enough info about the evil (or why) and too many animal sacrifices. The scenes of evil were just plain weird, not scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bor-ring!","review":"I am a fan of John Saul, but this book was weak. The characters were hard to care about and the story line fell flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice scare, but unnecessary actions","review":"Saul's book was a pretty good horror story and it was easy to read, the only problem that really caught my attention was the sacrifice/murder of animals. I am sure that it adds a strange light and twist to the story but I am very offended by the needless graphic killings of the pets, and do not wish to read another book by Saul if this is the type of vision he saught. It is one thing to kill an animal by mentioning it's death, but another to massacre it with words when it is completely unnecessary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story - not as good as his other books","review":"I did not like this book, it was a struggle to finish. The first 300 pages were dull, and seemed written for children except for a few scenes. I kept looking for Barney or Kermit to appear. While the last part of the book was better it did not make up for the simplistic first 300 pages. I read The Presence and liked it, this book was a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, but would make a great B-Movie.","review":"Complete with \\"My husband's a drunk but I'm too weak to leave him\\" Stupid-Woman Syndrome and some adolescent sex, here is a sorry tale. The first few pages pulled me in, building up the suspense only to be disappointed by the rest of the book's predictability. Like lambs to the slaughter, the characters in this book followed an unimaginative path and most are unable to overcome their personal weaknesses. It's not their strength of character or religious beliefs that save them but rather a trivial token which saves the author from having to think of a more original ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps you thinking until the very end.","review":"What interested me in the characters were how their attitudes drasticly changed due to the movement from one ordinary home, to a complex building in which the whole town abhors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of your seat, non stop pager turner!!!","review":"I have read all of John Saul's books, although I was disappointed in how long it took to come out, this book did not let me down. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Right Hand of Evil","review":"This book was BORING! I love John Saul books - what happened here? Was this cranked out for the sake of cranking out another bestseller? I almost did not want to buy Nightshade. But I took the plunge and loved Nightshade - readers save your money - buy Nightshare instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche","review":"Maybe I am spoiled because my previous experience with Saul was so good - The Blackstone Chronicles. I really thought that was an excellent piece of work. So, I was in the mood for another horror yarn and I picked this up. And I was dissappointed!It seems like Saul knocked this one out as quickly as possible just to have a presence on the bookshelves - its plot was cliche and its ending very predictable. Characters were tragically underdeveloped and certain elements of the story that appeared as if they were intended to be important, went nowhere.All-in-all, not the best thing I've read this month. Not awful but bordering on a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked!","review":"With The Right Hand of Evil, Mr. Saul has definitely crossed the line. I was totally shocked and disgusted by the gratuitous violence. The animal mutilations and murders sickened me. It will be a long time before I pick up another John Saul book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eek! : (","review":"If you like animals DO NOT read this book! It is full of satanic animal mutilations. I put this book where it belongs...torn up and in the GARBAGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time-Totally Lame!","review":"First off I want to say, this was my first ever Saul book. I know this guy is VERY popular but after reading this book, I'm completely puzzled as to why. This book was BAD. A total rehash of 100 different horror movies I've seen. Dreams about sex & the devil (Rosemary's Baby anyone?), voodoo, possessed family members (Damien, I presume?), a creepy old house with a scary reputation (wow that's new!). How this book ever got published is beyond me. My first and last John Saul book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from his best","review":"I only kept reading this after the first third because I'd bought it to get me through a long train ride. It was a \\"page-turner\\" only in the sense that I wanted it to be over as soon as possible. Multiple cliches, no psychological insight, gratuitous pet mutilation, weak and unpleasant characters, no attempt to bring any degree of depth to the proceedings, and a conclusion that is in no way satisfying combine to make this perhaps the least of this authors efforts of the half dozen of his novels that I have read. Very disappointing. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it on the Shelf","review":"Unfortunately, your rating scale doesn't go into minus numbers. Flat characters, boring story and animal mutilation - was John Saul always this bad? It may just be that I've outgrown this particular genre, but in my opinion, this wasn't worth the paper it was printed on. It just goes to prove - when it comes to the \\"creepies\\", stick to the 'King'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed Stew","review":"John Saul has turned out some incredibly good books: \\"The Homing,\\" \\"Shadows,\\" and \\"The Blackstone Chronicles,\\" to name just a few. His dark, pessimistic view of life, particularly of youths and their parents, has always been a little disturbing, but his stories have held our interest and got us caught up in the plots effectively. Not so with this book. John has written this book so many times, I have to wonder why he bothered. It's so predictable! Hopefully, his upcoming release will exonerate him from this pedestrian effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment!!!","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. I am a Saul fan and this book was just boring. The characters had no depth and the ending was to simplistic. It had a build up then ended in like 60 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Left Hand of Predictable","review":"John Saul wrote this one for the bucks. Cashing in on his name, he has released a storyline that is at best predictable and juvinile. My son wrote better stories in the 8th grade.Pass on this one and go for one of his other books. Most of the others are good. This is a book you can read in a weekend, but it is filled with B rated horror cliches.I could give you a synopsis, but you've seen/read it a million times already. Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"I used to love to read John Saul's books - It must have been a teen thing, because this one just grossed me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"time is too scarce to spend it on this book","review":"The preface is the most exciting part of this book. It goes downhill from there. I kept going and going hoping it would get better, but no luck. The book makes it out to be a mystery, perhaps scifi, and about black magic. But it ended up instead being a boring uneventful book about being in a marriage with an alcoholic spouse, cleaning up a large house, going to school and trying to fit into a new school with a touch about teenagers and their pot smoking rebellion. I think you have to be high to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to a very good horror author?","review":"I see by the list that I will write one bad review among at this time, 9 rave reviews. I have read ALL of John Saul's books and thought he got better with age, but what happened here? This book didn't just grab me and not let go as so many of his earlier books, especially The Blackstone Chronicles. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better but, at least for me, it never did. I hate to say I was relieved when I finally finished this book. Come on John, try, try again. But thanks for the earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best form john","review":"It might be a novel by one of the greatest but not a winner. The story revolves around a spirit that dwells in a haunted house and control the lives of some who live within.The starting is really interesting but as the plot unfolds, the only thing worth addictive is the sole curiousity ... what will happen at the end? and still you may not be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but..Not So Great","review":"Not the greatest Saul book.I think the storyline was a good idea but the plotting was terrible. I was disappointed because in the past, John Saul has been a fabulous writer. I don't know what happened w/this book. The beginning was much more interesting than the middle of the book. The dreams of the characters were confusing because I wasn't sure if it was actually occurring.... A few paragraphs later, the reader realizes that it was just a dream. I also think the writer rushed through some scenes in order to get to the next \\"scary\\" scene. It really wasn't as eerie as Saul's novels usually are. If this was your first John Saul read, please DO NOT give up...his other books are much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthy of a B movie","review":"I couldn't help but think of a B movie while reading this book. He repeats himself several times, the dialog is ridiculous and I spent most of my time reading fast (not enjoying or relishing the book) so I could get through with it. Predictable, not fun, not scary, not original. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Greatest...","review":"To say the least. John Saul has written some entertaining and sometimes scary books in his career, but for the most part they turn out like this one. If you've read one, you've read them all. They are all so surprisingly alike that halfway through you wonder if you've already read it before. No, this is the new one? I couldn't tell...Same evil spirits, same bad child (or children), same animal mutilations (Saul seems to enjoy putting that in a bit TOO much), same idiot parents, same small town people hating the newcomers, same \\"old curse\\" on town, house or family...it's the same book after book after book. While it may be interesting to read the first or second time, it does get a bit old.I used to enjoy Saul. I also used to enjoy cheap, B-grade horror flicks when I was thirteen. The same old story needs to change sooner or later. Why he can't seem to find an original horror plot to save his life, I can't figure out. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the usual Saul's standard","review":"I bought this book just after its release, never mind that the rating was quite bad. After reading the book, I really regret buying it.The characters are too shallow and the plot is quite a mess. I still do not understand why the evil force only look for the males in the family. The dreams were confusing and led readers away from the plot. Hope the next John Saul's book is better.Those who are considering the purchase of this book, please do re-consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"It seems that this book is for first time John Saul readers only. It was the first of his that I had read and I must admit to becoming completely obsessed by it. I couldn't put it down until I had reached the last page. The good news is that it will probably bring in a lot of new readers to his older books(including me), but it seems that his previous fans aren't enjoying it very much. That's great news for me though, knowing that when I read his other novels it will only get better and better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I just finished Right Hand of Evil and was extremely disappointed. I'm not a fan of of the occult and satanism, but I thought I'd give Mr. Saul the benefit of the doubt on this one since he has given me some chills in his other books. None were to be had though. I found the plot neither terrifying or interesting. Again extremely disappointed and I only give this one star simply because I can't give it less."},{"rating":"1","title":"JOHN SAUL IS HORRIBLE!","review":"I hated this book. Slow, boring and annoying. I was so happy to finish it. There were so many dreams, that you didn't know if they were talking about reality or the past. No more Saul for me! Try Dean Koontz, that's a real horror novelist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book.","review":"If you find any original idea, plot or characters, please let me know. After reading a few pages, I knew the end. This is my first John Saul's book; I think Steven King is a much better writer.One interesting thought, if the gourmet burger is the same price and fast service as McDonald's, most people wouldn't bother with McDonald's. John Saul's book is about the same price as other good writer's books, and we have only limited time, why bother with John Saul's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but lacks Saul's usual depth and creativity.","review":"This book probably would translate well into a movie. It lacks depth but was enjoyable while it lasted. It took me longer to read than most due to the fact that it wasn't something I couldn't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"No matter how much I try to like John Saul books, and I've spent plenty of money on them over the years, there is just a twisted, almost perverse quality to them that just prevents me from truly enjoying them. I swear that \\"The Right Hand of Evil\\" will be my last Saul purchase. There is a definite formula in his writing that holds true again to this book - thus, for someone who has read any of his other work, the result is a very predictable tale. I did not find any of the characters to be sympathetic, and didn't care what happened to them by the end of the book. In fact, it would have been a refreshing change if the whole pathetic Conway family had been killed off by a mob of angry townspeople brandishing torches and pitchforks. My advice: save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I read this book a few years back and can't remember details. But I do recall that I liked it and it kept me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring with a bad ending to boot!","review":"I'd say 80% of my reading is done in the Horror/Thriller genre, and to those of you who feel naked without a book to read, I say pass this over and find something else. I've read just about everyting by Koontz, King, Preston/Child etc, etc. I picked this up (used thank God) because I couldnt find anything that interested me with my usual stand-by's, and thought why not try someone new...A haunted house? Dreams in the night of horrible things happening to family members? Demon possesion? Please tell me this is a joke, has this not been written five hundred times by every [person] out there? Add to this an ending that is an trite and quick, too quick. Maybe his other books are better, but I'll see what else I can find before I try one of his again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I picked this up at the library thinking it would be a good mystery, suspense. It was a big disappointment. The plot is predictable and the story and characters are weak. I found the use of God's name taken in vain horrible. There is constant swearing and its not necessary. John Saul is always writing about death,and evil. I think he needs to have a heart to heart with God and get it straight before he writes another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Cheaper Edition - and Get the Full Book","review":"Save your money.

Especially in the chapter about Victoria Woodhull, Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz paints a picture of woman that is of emotional, vindictive people. She says that Woodhull \\"targets\\" Henry Beecher to further her own goals. I'm sorry, but it is not her fault that he actively denounced sexual relationships while simultaneously having an affair with his close friends wife for years. He is the definition of sexual hypocrisy. One would think that Horowitz would be critical of Beecher, but no, she condemns Woodhull for releasing this story. She treats as a moody woman who took her PMS out on an innocent, lovely pastor.

I read the first few chapters and wanted to quit but I thought I might as well finish since I've gone this far - what a mistake.First of all, it doesn't get better nor does the tension steadily increase - two basic things every good thriller novel should poccess.

My husband came home with this when I asked him to pick up beef bouillon, said he couldn't find my normal stuff. I looked at the directions, and plopped it in my saute pan filled with my steak and ale pie ingredients. Before I put it in the oven, I figured I would taste it. Holy salt! All I could taste was salt. I grabbed the jar to see the ingredients, and low and behold, 680mg of sodium per teaspoon. I had to dump out half the liquid and add more beef broth and beer to balance it out.

The author communicates using a balance of academic level wording, but without the blatent 'My vocabulary is bigger then yours' attitude that so many books of this kind fall prey to. Of all the books for my migration course I had to read, this is the only one I looked forward to sitting down with. It's quite interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT book..","review":"The only reason I gave the book 4 stars is because the first is my favorite, but it still deserves 5 stars. I LOVED the book, some words keep me babbled for a few minutes, but the description was great. I'm VERY happy that there is a translation in the back of the books, it helps alot.I jusy don't understand how ANYONE of you other raters can call this book a waste of paper, you must be reading a different book. I give two thumbs up to this novel, and Christopher. Writing young is a great thing to do when inspired. So I just want to say THANKS Chris for giving me this spectacular entertainment. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful","review":"I won't detail the failings of this book because others have described them here better than I can. I will just say that it's as bad as they say it is. It's really awful.One thing that I would like to add is that the popularity of this book and the other book of the series, Eragon, disturbs me. I wonder how many young readers mistakenly believe that they are are reading real literature. How much are these books contributing to the \\"dumbing-down\\" of the reading public? I urge anyone who considers getting either book to think again and get something else. There are many better choices available."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER AGAIN PAOLINI","review":"I will NEVER read another book by this author. Chris, you've got the last dime you'll ever get from me. Anyone holding hope this turdball called the Inheritence series is going to get better is dellusional. P.T. Barnum said there's a sucker born every second and its sad to hear suckers who bought Eragon and now Eldest are still hoping this will get better.I'm ashamed of havign supported this author in the past. I will not do so in the future.To any friends who bought this book based on my recommendation I'm so so sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Alot of these reviews say","review":"First- I am tired of reviewers expecting polished perfect books everytime- Ain't gonna happen.....This one was worth the money if you have read the first...a Better continuation than many experienced authors bring to the table and hopefully the third is better. Personally I was amazed that a teenager wrote these books- he will only get more experienced/better as he goes on.....Maybe it is sour grapes for other reviewers whose kids have no talent except to annoy others or \\"Adults\\" who expect a TEEN fantasy to satisfy them- NO X rated SEX- so sorry...it is also an excellent book for more mature adults who keep in mind where the book came from!"},{"rating":"2","title":"volume 2 dependant upon volume 1","review":"A very good sequel to volume 1 of this series. Readable, mysterious, entertaining fantasy fiction with a solid moral basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some People Need to Move On From LOTR","review":"I will start off by saying that I enjoyed Eldest equally as much as I enjoyed Eragon; both of these books are great fantasy novels. I will say that Paolini does get as descriptive as Stephen King at times...even as indepth as Hemmingway could get but that's why it's a 704 page book (unabridged).The story evolves fairly quickly and the parts that many people compare to Tolkien are regular fantasy elements; can't a dwarf just be a dwarf; (and where else are Elves supposed to live - get real...well as real as fantasy will allow anyway =). I didn't care too much for the languages being so complex and indepth it really didn't add to the plot and at moments could stick out as definately unnecessary.To sum things up I will be reading the last book in the trilogy and look forward to it; I reccomend both novels to anyone who enjoys fantasy works. Paolini you're no Tolkien (which is good) and you're growing into a fine author."},{"rating":"1","title":"An open letter to Mr. Paolini.","review":"Dear Mr. Paolini,Please stop writing.Or in the very least, please stop bragging about how young you were when you wrote your mind-bogglingly awful debut novel.

I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents Don't Dismay","review":"I note the audience is 5th grade and up. After struggling with the excessive description, the love interest, and the ping pong of the story line; maybe junior high was the intended audience. A good story if you are into fantasy, disappointing if you want a successful read. So, if your gift is placed down wait a few years. Better yet, donate to your local public library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book In The WORLD!!!","review":"THis book is the best. I loved it. If you like sci-fi mixed with medieval with some magic tossed in you will love this book. I think Paolini organized it very well and he also depicted the different areas of the story perfectly. The book has difficult vocabulary and is written from 3rd person point of view. Paolini also was very inventive in creating \\"Eldest\\" and \\"Eragon\\".He uses foreshadowing and also analogies frequently to help the reader to understand the plot and details of the story. I really wish that the new book could come out sooner but you just can't rush the writing process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfolding Story","review":"Although there were parts of the book I didn't care for, overall \\"Eldest\\" was every bit the book I hoped for. The beginning was a little slow, but by the middle, I couldn't put it down. I hated for it to be over but I just had to find out what happened.I loved the transformation of Eragon from the boy we met to the Rider he becomes. The addition of other points of view was also refreshing. I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to the final installment, as well as future books by Christopher Paolini."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest is really cool!","review":"This book was so cool. It had so many new things and secrets. The plot is pretty good but maybe not as good as Eragon. Alot of really cool things happen at the end. Roran is also in the story and goes through alot of things. Big event happens in first 10 pages so read this quick because so much happens and some of it is sad but really interesting. Great book! Better than first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eldest SUCKS","review":"Is this for real people still ranting about this awful book? 99% of the people think it sucks!! So why keep hyping?

Almost as good as the phone book!","review":"One night, while eating a ham sandwich, I decided to go and read some stuff. So, I went out to a Books-A-Million and there stood the phone book with a new cover and the word \\"ELDEST\\" written in MASSIVE lettering. I wondered why they'd change the name of a phone book, so I glanced at it. Alas!, it was not a phone book, but an equally EXCITING read! What fun and joy swelled through my heart the minute I began to thumb trhough it! I purchased it immediately, with the money I had earned from working for two weeks in both McDonald's AND the laundromat. I give this book two million stars, even if I'm not able to ride the bus home now because of my money crisis! Yay! Thanks, Paolini!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I couldn't agree more with all the previous reviewers who said this one is the worst book written. Eldest is laughably bad. Skip it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG YOU PEOPLE!","review":"I liked this book, a lot. But I had to have my say in things, so here I go.A lot of people are saying that Eldest ripped things off of Star Wars, and it did.

WTF?!(Dune is written by Frank Herbert.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"that's the way I like it","review":"this is the best book I've ever read, and twice as good as Eragon.I would definitely recomend this book, but make sure you read Eragon first or won't really understand whats going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"I may be slow but I caught on that Lucille and other hypers keep re-posting their reviews every day. Why would any one do that except to try to keep up the impression peopel are luving this terrible book.I told myself I wasn't going to post a review even though I feel terribly disappointed but after seeing people playing games I felt obligated. Like most other readers I feel ripped off. I want my money back - I won't be reading another Paolini book in my life time. Even if it's a book by Paolini's dog I won't be reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I thought this book was as good as if not better than the first. I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out. I feel a very emotional connection to the characters in this book through his writing. I also loved the 3 seperate story lines that came together in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!! 5 starz! Incredible sequel!!!","review":"Okay... I think the problem here, is these readers who are giving bad reviews either have no imagination or they aren't listening to audio tapes. These audio versions of these books rock! This second book is as good if not better than the first book.I was totally involved and excited with each tape that I listened. I am so excited to \\"read\\" book three. What a great movie this whole trilogy would make. And I see no similiarity to LOTR. This young scribe is very original and I give him many kudos for his first two books. This is good stuff.Very very exciting read. I am most impressed. Highly recommended.JMHO //(*_*)\\\\\\\\"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are way better reads","review":"This book was way to long. If you want a great undiscovered book with tons of imagination read Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo. It shows how good a non-hyped book can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it. Stop Hating.","review":"I liked the book alot. And sure, at some points during the middle, you wanted something to hurry up and happen(as what happens with MOST fantasy sequels), but it was a great book nonetheless. For some reason I didn't really enjoy reading Roran's narrative, but Eragon's journey through the book made up for that.The end left you wanting more and the plot twist was a great surprise.I say its a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER FAST","review":"WOW!!!!!

Thank You!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promise unfulfilled","review":"I loved the first book in this \\"Trilogy.\\" Alas, the author should've ended with Book One and so should you.

So many predictable plots. It was as long and boring as the phonw book. I will DEFINITLY not be buying the next book. Im sorry I didnt listen to all teh sensible people who told me not to buy it. Eldest=Pathetic Rubbish"},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it Tedious","review":"i loved the first book, Eragon. i was really excitied to get a hold of Eldest, but as soon as i started reading, i found it very dismal. the author is trying to display his great vocaulary, but all he does is bore the reader, and make the reader confused. there was still some humor in it, and the secrets that are revealed are interesting and suprising. i would reccomend it, but be prepare to find yourself midly uninterseted in most parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughts from my 12 year old son","review":"Nothing can compare to the first book. The second book was a disappointment in the way it was written- too choppy and rushed. The author needed to spend more time doing finishing work to the book. There were areas of the book where there was no danger, where something should have happened but nothing did, though the expectation was there, such as the journey into the Elf City. Nothing happened, it was completely boring. I had a hard time getting into the book, unlike the first one, which I could not put down. I did not like the character switches and found it distracting from the over-all story. He needs to learn how to make the characters flow together. I hope that this author will read his first book again and do a better job on the third book and bring everyone together in a smoother format. I hope Mr. Paolini takes his time on the next one. He is a talented writer with a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% Pure Garbage","review":"Why any one would buy \\"Eldest\\" is beyond me. My kid brother was embarrassed to be seen with this book. He didn't want any of his friends to think he was an idiot for reading it.I returned it to the bookstore for him, and I was the one embarrassed when I was standing in line to return it. The lady in front saw what I was holding and starting laughing out loud saying something about how pretty pictures on the cover don't make a book good and I ought to know it by now.Got me thinking and I opened the book and started reading. Long story short, I got out of line to read, got through the first three chapters. Is this book like a car wreck where everyone slows down to look? It's laughably bad so it can't possibly be selling on its merits.I find it hard to believe there are people any where who think this is good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ELDEST","review":"Item arrived damaged broken into 3 parts front cover, spine with 3 rings and disc attached, and the back cover. 2 of the disc [3 and 19] were so scratched that I could not understand what was said. I notified company via email and they sent a full refund immediately.Love the reader's voice. He read long passages in both elf and dwarf and his accent changed consistenly with each one. He had a different voice for each character and culture too, of course. I had no trouble knowing who was talking. Listening to him kept me awake on long boring road trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Why I have to give credit to Christopher for experimenting with multiple points of view, he didn't pull it off successfully. Most of Eragon's story was dull description of the elves' home (which reminded me heavily of descriptions from LoTR) while Nasuada's was too short and came off as a cheap way to show the audience what was happening to the Varden. With the exception of a couple chapters, Roran's pov was the more interesting of the three because he actually did some important things during it. The pacing was overall a bit long as well and some parts felt like they could have benefited from more editing. I truthfully preferred Eragon over this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put this book down!","review":"ok well dispite all the rip offs of this series I liked the first book. I read it in one sitting. But Eldest is another thing alltogether! It took me nearly a year to finish it. I read the first chapter and there was nothing sucking me into the book so I put it down and could not pick it up again. I made the BIG mistake of actually buying the book. This is not a mistake that you should make! If you really want to read this book go get it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good...","review":"Nearly nothing happened in this book. All the minute details of uninteresting events were crammed into this book, and even the huge final battle was shockingly boring. Also, I can't help but notice how this book is basically a mix of \\"Dragon Flight\\" by Ann McCaffery and \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Not a real noteworthy book in my opinion. I was extremely dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me","review":"So tiring seeing people praise these books because they're written by a kid. Christopher Paolini was 19 when Eragon was published and is 22 now. There's no way in the world anyone should still be excusing his age for sloppy writing. Most of the time while reading I wanted to pull my hair out. Stupid, stupid, stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good...and here is why","review":"The sequel to the Eragon, which was a fun little book to read, was such a disappointment, that I feel I must share it with you.It is boring (entire chapters that do not contribute to the story at all) and frustrating (imaginary \\"magical\\" words and phrases that make you anxious while reading)I am a huge fan of fantasy books but sadly Eldest is as enchanting as trying to read an IKEA catalogue backwards (that is what most of the words in the book would sound like). \\"I think \\"trying\\" is the right word here. You can tell that Paolini, together with his mom and dad, was trying to put Eldest together-without success. It's a mish-mash of words, discontenting plots and confusing characters.You can try to read this book, but I do not recommend it. Don't buy it and if somebody gives it to you don't waste your time trying reading it. Just pick up an IKEA catalogue, it's just as good, and it's free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"As if the blatant plagiarism in his first book wasn't bad enough, Paolini returns to ruin fantasy even further in his latest train wreck, Eldest.

There is little plotting, monkeys could come up with beter dialog, and I was bored to tears until the end. I read Melissa's review of Eldest and then nodded my head in understanding. I too feel ripped off by this book/author. I wondered why so many people were singing the praises of a one book author, especially when that book was mediocre at best. This past Sunday, our pastor said in his sermon, \\"And the truth shall set you free.\\" The truth has certainly shed light here. I won't be reading any more books by this author or published.

I would never call Eldest acceptable, and I wonder why the series has so far been such a success.I do however wish to say to Paolini not to give up. He's not ready to become a writer. He needs more practice.Perhaps I am spoiled, since I just finished reading the Abhorsen Trilogy by Garth Nix, who writes excellent fantasy novels.If you were disappointed with this book as I was, I would highly recommend reading a book like Sabriel by Garth Nix instead.

If you enjoy books like the Hobbit or any of the Harry Potter series, this novel should interest you. It is about a teenage boy (Eragon) and his dragon's (Saphire) journey through Alagaesia. They, along with the dwarves, are trying to defeat King Galbatorix and his empire. While his cousin Roran, is fighting off the Raz'ac and trying to defend their hometown of Carvahall. Even though this book is very long, it is a good read. I would recommend it to anyone from age eight on up that enjoys fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"Eldest had all the problems of Eragon. Overly descriptive, derivative, awkward dialogue, and dull characters. And in some parts it was preachy.I know what some of you are thinking. \\"You can't criticize Eldest.

And coming from a 19 year old, the future looked promising. But as often happens to those who experience success very early, things start to go downhill quickly.This book needed an editor to step in and say no. It is long and boring and the entire subplot with Roran is mystifying. Brom and Eregagon need all of their skills and magic to get away from the bad guys (which kills Brom), but Roran just needs a hammer and a bunch of villagers???The time Eragon spends with Osmosis (or whatever the heck his name is) in the dark mysterious Elven woods reads way too much like Luke and Yoda on Degoba. And it just goes on and on and on. I don't blame the writer, the professionals around him let him down badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I must admit that I did not find Eldest as I expected.

I wasn't a star wars fan so I didn't notice the similarities really. Then I waited in eager anticipation for Eldest which meant going bookstore to bookstore looking for a copy/party. What a Ripoff! Most of the book consists of Eragon walks with troll. He walks in desert. He trains with jolly old elf rider who didn't exist in the last book. Rowan (his cousin) falls in love with the butcher's daughter. They love each other. The Razac come and attack. They are after Eragon (well duh) the villagers hold out. The villagers take the same path Eragon did in the last book. Big battle dark family secret. Oh yeah that blessed kid is back. Just skip to the last chapter or so and wait for the final book in the Trilogy. (star wars was a trilogy remember... makes you wonder)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Im a bird","review":"Im a bird. Eldest was a really good book, but the 1st book, Eragon, was much better. Eldest had a lot less action, and it took too much time talking about Eragons studies, and less about anything else about the Varden or Dwarves. The side story about Roran, Eragons cousin, was more exciting. As it got further towards the end, it was much more interesting and had more action, and was easier to read. the end of the book made me want to read the 3rd book because it left many things unanswered, like who the third dragon egg will hatch for. It was an overall great book, but not enough action in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to get through it all","review":"I've picked up my Audio CDs several times for a long trip, and each time, I find myself putting something else in.

This book is about the hardships Eragon, the Varden [ a resistance of King Galbatorix], Roran, and countless other endure after the battle in Farthern Dur. It goes into detail on Eragon's training as a rider as he is taught by a legacy. Eragon and everyone who knows him is sworn in the ancient language not to tell of the existance of the Cripple Who Is Whole. Eragon also experiences a miraculous alteration with his body. Many celebrate the victory at Farthern Dur, but an upcoming battle is on the horizon. Roran, an outlaw by the Empire, has to save his village of Carvahall from the Raz'ac. What will he do to save them? Can the Varden defeat the almighty Empire and save all who live in Alagaesia from the wrath of King Galbatorix? I loved this book and give it 5 out of 5 stars, when you read this book you will feel as if you are living the story! Read Eldest, by Christopher Paolini to find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"Well first of all I don't like that it has it's own language because it get's pretty annoying to go back in the book to see what there saying. also it seems that all the names have to have a weird pronunciation. Well now to get to the reason why I really gave it a four star, it was because in the end it is sort of like star wars when Murtagh told Eragon that he was his brother makeing Morzan his father whichEragon hated, but in the end it was still written very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but long and some parts boring.","review":"It was a excellent book, lots of it writen very well, but it got bumped down because it was long and all the stuff about roran and oromises training were BORING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful doesn't begin to cover it","review":"I saw reviews of this people were gushing praise then I read the book and thought what the #%@$!. I didn't want to tell anyone I hated it. Thank God to see I'm not alone... the vast majority hated this dreadful book as much as I did.Truth be told, reading reviews of Eldest was more fun than reading the book. There are so many dead on reviews I won't even begin to try to say how tedius this was to read. Like in the title of my review awful doesn't begin to cover it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest--Better than the 1st","review":"Loved this book! Paolina rights so well, like the magicians in parts of his narrative he weaves you into the story and you care about the characters & their trials & tribulations. Just read Brsinger as well & it's even better--further character development & in depth history is revealed. What an author--look forward to the next in the series and sadly the last. He is one of the writers who weaves such a wonderful tale you want to eat it up but dread coming to the end because you know you will miss the characters & the wonderful world he has created. Hopefully, more great novels will follow this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great continue of a great start","review":"It seems that even when the first book in a series is great the second or third one absoluley sucks. Not with something Cristopher Paolini writes!! The first book was great but the second was (if anything) even better because of his maturity in his writing style. The parellel storyline with Roran add a huge amount to the book.A great book and a fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"George Lucas just may have a lawsuit on his hands...","review":"What more needs said? Why didn't Paolini just start the books... \\"A long time ago in a Middle Earth far far away?\\"It's like he took George Lucas' plot outlines and just changed the names and locations. The comparisons to Tolkein are more thinly veiled and possibly more forgivable, the guy practically invented the fantasy genre as we know it, and its tough to stray from his world.But the Star Wars similarities are uncanny. Using a tried and true formula is not unheard of... (ie: hero meets girl, villian threatens girl, hero defeats villian, hero gets girl...etc) but this isn't the formula... it's almost the exact plot.Very disappointing, I expected better from him. But he's young and hopefully will mature in his writing as well as his plot devices...However, if you've never seen Star Wars (and if you haven't shame on you, LOL)... you may actually enjoy this not distracted by the obvious connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning it.......so should you","review":"When my son wanted to return this book to Amazon, I asked him why and we talked about the book. I couldn't believe a book could be published that was so poorly written so I read it myself and was appalled. Glaring errors, disastrous editing, poorly written, poorly organized. Clearly the most overrated book in years. Paolini you've got the last dime you'll ever get from our family of readers. This telephone book should have been trimmed to 1/2 size at the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...?","review":"I know that a lot of people like this book, but I have to say that I personally thought that both books were really cliche, shame I can't turn down a relative's present....

It is the story of Eragon's journey with the dragon Saphira. In it he encounters characters that challenge his beliefs and ideas of the world around him.The book also reflects on the events of Eragon's cousin, Roran, and his hometown under attack.The ending is thrilling and I was desperate for more by the last page.I was very impressed and glad that such a young writer delivered such a well-written piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?","review":"YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.......IN WHAT DELUSIONAL WORLD IS THIS CONSIDERED A GOOD BOOK?

Eldest was a highly enjoyable read from start to finish. What could be better than a well written fantasy novel that effectively incorporates aspects of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter, while at the same time retaining its own originality? The characters and storyline are captivating, and the world that Poalini has created is just plain amazing. Both my father and I (a doctor and lawyer, respectively) could not get enough of this book, and are eagerly awaiting the third installment of Inheritance. For those of you who are clouded by Poalini's age, or jealous by his success, get off it. This book is a must read for anyone with an open mind who enjoys a bit of fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book","review":"There wasn't much that happened, except for a humoungous tremendous battle, and golden dragon. Even though Eragon was being very stupid. But what happened Christopher Paolini put into very close detail. He used a lot of weird words. For every five pages there were four words that I didn't know, such as \\"alembic\\" or \\"sanguine.\\" My favorite character was Sephira. The fate of the dragons lies in her hands. You learn Eragon's true identity. And he is no longer human. You learn how Galbatorix is gaining power in gramarye. Most of the book takes place in the elf city of Ellesmera. There's a lot of dramatic changes in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest by Christopher Paolini","review":"Eldest of the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini is peopled with humans, dwarfs, elves and other magical beings and yes, there are terrible creatures bent on destruction of peace, beauty and innocence. It is a story rich with the love and protection by a beautiful dragon imprinted before her hatching upon a young man named Eragon, orphaned and ordained to save the world he lives in, to protect it from many evils. He has friends who help, though there are those whom he can't truly trust... who seem at first glance to be friends. But his wise and wonderful Saphira is always looking out for him...her Dragon Rider. This is a beautiful, poetic story. A 'real-live fantasy.' B. W. Cloud, Author of... 'Warriors of Planet Earth'-Book One in the series of The Incredible Adventures of The Tadpole Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest","review":"This is the second book in the trilogy of Eragon.

Perfect!Purchased for a very special fourth graders who reads at atenth grade level. It's what she wanted to read next. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating & Magical","review":"I bought the first book and couldn't put it down. I ordered book 2 before I finished the first so I could keep the magic going. Just wish Paoline would hurry up and finish the 3rd book. The movie did not do the the first book justice - should have had Jackson direct. He knows how to do fanasy the right way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Dissapointed","review":"I am sorry to say that this book is a big upset. Although I didn't enjoy Eragon for taking the ideas of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and DragonRiders of Pern, there was action in the book-- a good dose of it. Up until the final few chapters this book is a bore. If Paolini's writing was better it would be more enjoyable, unfortunately that is not the case.The story was predictable. The unique aspects he did put in (which were rare) had some nice touches. I'm really leaning for a 1.5 star rating. Eragon would have been a 2.5"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book was so cool. I loved it!!! Its full of action, adventure, suspence, and awesomenes! I highly recomend it to all fantasy lovers. I give it a an A for awesomeness"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, boring","review":"I read the glowing reviews and was completely dumbfounded!!!! Paint by numbers fantasy characters and possibly the worst writing I've heard encountered in my life. I found this book very unenjoyable, couldn't wait for it to end.I'm not sure which bothered me more: the shallow characters, the limp dialogue or the seriouslly dull characters. This is the first unfavorable I've ever written of a book, but I hope my review encourages others to buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE ERAGON!!!!","review":"Eragon was SUCH a good book. It is my favorite book in the WHOLE world - Eldest is my least favorite. It was too long, and unlike when reading Eragon, I welcomed diversions. One really annoying thing about this book is that the characters constantly say \\"Aye\\". Every character. Can't someone say \\"yes\\"???They never said that before, so why are they saying it now? Even the royalty said \\"aye\\". Eldest really disappointed me. Eragon was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"After reading Eragon, Eldest was very much anticipated. However, after getting thru half the book, I was sorely disappointed. Things seemed to move very slowly with little to no plot/character development. Only the last 1/4 of the book was interesting read, and of course it ended with a cliff-hanger in anticipation of the third and last book in the series. Very much doubt I will read that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for the end","review":"Eldest is a total snooze fest. Booooriing all the way to the end. I won't read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest","review":"This young man already has more talent than most writers three times his age. I can't wait to read the 3rd book in the trilogy. I also eagerly await whatever else he writes.He writes with surprising insight into people, wisdom about life, thus making the world of Eragon feel real and compelling. It's great to read about characters I'd love to meet, or even to be.I hope his books are made into movies by Peter Jackson as I'd love to see this world on the screen done similar to Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter/ Electric Eel smashing?","review":"After carefully reading both Eldest and Harry Potter I have prepared an equation to guide potential readers.Eldest=(Harry Potter)^(1/2)Eldest is the square root of Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"LET'S FACE IT.......","review":"......This book is horrible. Enough Said. God bless those who think it is a good book. May peace in the empty brain be with thee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like the fanatics have a new bullet in their gun.","review":"There have been many arguments to defend this subpar book and attack honest reviewers. However, we've begun seeing a new one which goes something like this: \\"If you like LOTR or Star Wars so much and Paolini stole so much from them, then you must like Paolini.\\" I'm gonna prove this wrong, though the fanatics are sure to close their ears to me.Each individual author MUST have his own ideas. When we pick up a book that says \\"By Christopher Paolini\\" on the cover, we want to read a book by Christopher Paolini. We don't want some watered-down LOTR fanfiction. While we want something that ties in to the classics of the genre, we also want something fresh and new. We want to see Paolini contribute to the genre rather than just mimicking other authors and adding nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone take away this kid's keyboard, please!","review":"So he wrote it when he was 15/17. So WHAT? Age is no excuse for bad writing. And believe you me, this is BAD. Is there a single major sci-fi/fantasy book/movie he didn't rip off? Paolini doesn't have an original idea of his own, and oh boy, does it ever show. He hasn't written a \\"groundbreaking new fantasy novel,\\" he's regurgitated everything he's ever read/seen that he thought was \\"cool.\\" Only the very young reader or the reader new to the genre could mistake this for a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT BOOK!.......NOT!!!!!!","review":"Blah, blah, great book, good book, blah, blah, kiss-up, suck-up, kiss-up. This book is a lame excuse for fantasy fiction...dragon dung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eldest is a great read","review":"This story is a wonderful read for anyone who can still use their imagination. I believe that Eldest should be read after reading Eragon (book 1) The characters are beleivable and easy to associate yourself with. It is hard to put it down until you reach the end.Bring on Book 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only because Amazon won't let me give a 0","review":"It's unoriginal to say that Christopher Paolini is unoriginal, but frankly, it's true. As a trusting person and an optimistic reader of all genres I have never been so outraged by turd wrapped in a fancy package. \\"But he was only 15, he's a prodigy,\\" gimme a break, the only geniuses involved in the inheritance trilogy work in the marketing department.On a more positive note, the book has inspired me to write my own work of fantasy, the only hard part is deciding what to call it; I'm thinking either \\"shmord of the dings\\" or \\"shmar Boars\\"Seriously save your money, this book reeks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And then Eragon lightly bounded up the epicly proportionatly steps to his bed.","review":"Bored yet. Thats what most of the sentences are like. I found myself skipping pages and missing absolutely nothing except Mr. Paolinis wonderful descriptions. When I read Eragon I thought it was okay not great, I didn't like the fact that Paolini copied just about every fantasty book out there. In Eldest though it gets ridiculous. As I was reading I was imagining Gimli, Arwen, and Luke Skywalker strolling through the woods.I have to agree with the others about the editor, this book could have gotten rid of 200 pgs. or so and we would have missed nothing except expandind our vocabulary. I found myself thinking of one of my old english teachers(shudder) I don't need to be reminded of that.Overall Paolinis descriptions reminded me of the enigizer bunny, they kept going and going and going. I'll probably read the third book when it comes out, lets all hope that a new editor comes along. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Traci, \\"dude\\"","review":"I've been reading and enjoying fantasy for many years, and am neither young nor stupid. This book, put simply, was horrific. It had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I am entirely baffled at how anyone could think this is well written or inventive. Paolini is a thief. He should be ashamed of himself for such outright plagiarism. Even a young kid should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"For God's sake, LISTEN TO US, PAOLINI!","review":"In an interview, Paolini said that he didn't listen to his reviewers and BOY does it show. Eldest has all the flaws of Eragon (derivative plot, flat characters, predictability, etc.) as well as all the flaws anticipated for the sequel (derivative of Empire Strikes Back). I know that these criticisms are almost as cliched as Inheritence itself, but these flaws are so obvious that they bear repeating.And rather than improving, Eldest has shown ANOTHER weakness in Paolini's writing. It's the same problem I've had with The Amber Spyglass and the later Terry Goodkind books. It's so preachy, probably in an attempt to sound mature. A good, mature writer would introduce his beliefs subtly and let the story teach his philosophy. Paolini hits us over the head with his beliefs in long, blocky monologues. No subtlety at all.I bought this book because of the possibility that CP would improve. I'm ready to give up hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, unpolished","review":"Paolini probably will be a fine writer someday. He's not there yet. The story needs to be tightened, the language brightened. It's one thing to be inspired by classic source material, and quite another to stick so close to it. The \\"Star Wars\\" and Tolkein comparisons have rightly been made by many, but there are also parallels to be drawn to LeGuin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" novels and Anne McCaffrey's Dragons of Pern, telepathic and bonded to individual humans. And when Paolini writes \\"Barges? Barges? We don't want no stinking barges\\" --- ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"Considering that this book like it's predecessor is a complete rip off from many worthy and skilled authors it is amazing how many people still give it a high grade. It doesn't deserve one. It can however be a revolutionary cure for insomnia and perhaps a motivator for ill behaved children. This young man cannot write. He can however come as close to plagiarism as possible without stepping over the boundaries. I recommend not wasting money on this massive waste of paper. I rather have teeth pulled then go through another book this bad. If you want a good read try the Pern series. If you want an epic challenge try Lord of the Rings or even Mercedes Lackey's Obsidian trilogy. But for the love of all that's holy do not pollute your mind with this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review!!!","review":"This book is great. Buy it! Eragon gets developed and Saphira is cool! The author does a great job keeping you wondering what will happen next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Arrived on time and was in awesome condition for a used paperback. Most of the time a used paperback means that they are all kinds of torn up and stuff around the edges. But this one is in great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start,, builds momentum","review":"The author seemed to fall in love with his words in the early stage of this novel. The descriptions were overly depicted and the characters said too much. The action was slow and the overall pace suffered, but in the latter stages things started to click and the author's style matched the pace. A good fifty pages should have been edited out, most in the first half, but overall a fittign and enjoyable sequel. Still eager to read the final chapter of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!

Not a person, though, but a monster - a hybrid, that is, of Frankenstein and Count Dracula.Frankenstein because they are monstrous creations put together by a madman from the dead parts of entities created by people who knew what they were doing, and Dracula because both books are dead-bent on sucking the life out of literature. Basically, if Eragon and Eldest had a catchphrase, it would be 'I vant to suck your money!'The antidote to these malign creatures - I mean, books - is to purchase some garlic. In this case, good, original books. It's your only hope of survival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible doesn't begin to describe it","review":"After reading some of the reviews for Eldest I'm beginning to wonder if this was supposed to be published on April 1 as an april fool's joke. This book reads like an april fool's joke what with the characters being pulled around like puppets and talking like they dropped in from cartoonland.I find it hard to believe any honest to goodness person read and liked Eldest. After rolling my eyes the umpteenth time at this stupipdity of the characters, I gave up. I couldn't even get my kids to read it. In a way, I'm glad my kids didn't read it. No good parent would let their kids read a book where characters are so lacking in values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universally loathed and for good reason","review":"It may be #1 because parents are buying this for their kids, but take my word for it kids universally loath it. I didn't have the heart to tell my dad to return it, so there it sits on my bookshelf next to \\"Eragon\\" which I had to pretend to love too.I think if everyone just admitted they hated it it would do the world some good. It took me three days to get past chapter 5 and not because I didn't try but on account of it's mind numbingly boring. Is there a more stupid book ever published? Don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"This poor excuse of a book is a cheap rip-off of other(and far more talented)people's ideas. It is a wonder there hasn't been any law suits."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGELY disappointing","review":"I didn't expect much from this book, just a nice fantasy story, pushing further Eragon in his quest...Well I was utterly disappointed reading Eldest. I must confess the book is way too predictable, and it does nothing but dusting off the same old fantasy clichès, or little more. Beside I found the carachters of Sapphira and Eragon REALLY nasty and childish...but I guess that's a matter of personal taste.Though I must praise the side quest of Eragon's step-brother. DEspite not being totally original, it was better written and much more dense with feeling than Eragon's.Finally I'd just point out thet the book is pretty uneventuful, there are few major events (5 I would say)and that's it.C.P. has potential, but I belive he must work more on plot and setting.P.S. Yeah, that's it, settig. Alagaesia is pretty much identical to R.Jordan's world (wheel of time series). And the plot, pardon me, seems too similar to Star Wars'. (I know this sounds ridiculous, but try thinking of it...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful, frankly.","review":"I tried so hard to like this book; I like Eragon so much! But ultimately, the writing needs work, the plot needs work, and the character development lacks. I give this book one star, only because I can't give it 0. Terribly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's Christopher Paolini?","review":"Did Tolkien awake from the dead and join forces with Anne McCaffery, Urusula K. LeGuin, and George Lucas? It seems as if those four adopted one common pen name, because at the moment, I can't see Christopher Paolini anywhere.Sure, some LOTR 'fans' of lesser dedication may like these books, but either way, you aren't reading Paolini, you are reading 'watered down' Tolkien plus akward description. Anne McCaffery fans will marvel at her amazing ability to suddenly go from great author of great dialogue to author of shabby lines. Ta-da! See Ursula LeGuin's science of magic corrupted in nothing flat! See Star Wars shoved into shoes much to small for it!So remember to ask yourself \\"Who or Where's Christopher Paolini?\\" when you read this book, though I advise you not to. I can't find CP anywhere. Can you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth...The Awful Truth","review":"Thanks to everyone who wrote honest reviews of Eldest - it saved me from spending money on it. My cousin's stuck with it though he can't even return it on account of the binding's crinkled. I didn't do that, but I will help him burn it. I never thought I would hate a book but Eldest is the rare book you litterally hate when you read it. The writing is so awful it's almost funny like its its own parody but I'm not laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reprehensible","review":"Entirely disappointing if not plaigerized from Tolkien's work.

Other entire pages and passages seem to be taken from other sources as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with most of the negative comments posted before","review":"Eragon was a decent book. It started off well and ended ok. I was intrigued to read it in first place because it was written by a 15 year old. The first book was good. However, the second book doesn't stand a chance. It reads like it was written by a 15 year old. It starts off exactly where the first book ended. So, you would think it might be worth the read. Well, I lost interest when Roran became so imported, particularly when he hit his future father-in-law. Now, come on... What was Christopher thinking? Roran doesn't seem like a hero to me. It made him look like an immature idiot. As I continue the read (I forced myself), I couldn't believe how perfect the characters were portrayed. I'm mean, they couldn't have one flaw? Children may like it, but it does come close to any fantasy story I have read. Definitely not worth the read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded and often dull","review":"The first book was tolerable given a good and quick moving story. In book 2 the story moves slower and is probably a good read only if you are trying to fall asleep. I'm quitting 1/2 way through because it just isn't worth it. Try George RR Martin books if your looking for a good Fanatasy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I have a self esteem problem...","review":"Why? I read this book. After hearing so many warnings about how terrible it was, I got a copy and read it.It's settled; I hate myself. That's why I inflicted on myself the punishment involved in reading Eldest. Reading it resulted in first 'my eyes! My eyes!', followed by 'my brain! My brain!'I warn you, visitor: do not read this book unless you've committed some awful crime against humanity and deserve to be soundly punished. It's so boring, so preachy and so poorly written that it could easily be used in prisons to subdue violent inmates. This isn't a book; it's agony on paper. Now if only someone could write another one for the author to read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fantasy - but book one was a 5 star","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I do think book one was more exciting.Book one has a new fantasy concept with a boy finding a dragon egg and tying a bond with the hatched dragon that is very deep. There is also a lot of activity going on, adventures and such.In book number 2, the saga continues, but much time is spent on the education of Eragon, and exactly what happens when the elf's teach him to become a rider as well as politics between the different races rather than pure adventures. Although this is part of the story, I think too much time and effort is dedicated to this aspect. Other than that, it is a great book, with a great continuation from book 1.I am eagerly awaiting to read the last book in this series!!This is a book that is fit for adults as well as kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Improvement over the first...but that's not saying much","review":"Eragon was a terribly written book. Full of cliches, flat characters, and an amazing amount of grammatical errors, Paolini failed to impress me. In the second book, Eldest, Paolini makes huge strides as author. Except now he's moved from a child's writing to that of your standard fan fiction author. Eldest doesn't have the grammatical errors anymore, but pushes ahead with deux ex machina, improbable occurrences, and the most vapid love story sequence you'll see since Star Wars II. This is the kind of book you read to laugh at, so check out some passages while at the library or bookstore--just don't pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, but a tad predictable","review":"The good: It was very entertaining, an easy read, and gripping.The bad: A tad predictable, and everything works out for the protagonists.

I find it so sad that many people would judge Mr. Paolini's latest book on such a scale!My personal opinion of why he switched characters and stories in multiple chapters is that he wanted us to view a perspective of different characters and what was currently going on in other's lives so we would get more out of the story, and I believe that he suceeded.Well done, Christopher! You are a gifted fantasy epic novel writer and a great role model to all!Eldest is an inspiring story, and I think that the idea of boring the readers in the middle of the book just made the ending more exciting! An excellent strategy, I must say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, very enjoyable.","review":"I read both Eragon and The Eldest after watching the movie.Some things I really liked:1) Length - I disagree with some of the reviews, I enjoy his writing style. I never put the books down! I like the back story, the twists and turns.2) Character development - Eragon trains and learns how to become a great rider. This is done in a well designed manner that is enjoyable to read.3) Magic - Logically designed and impressive. Much better than any other system I have read.4) Battle - The battle scenes are great, well written.What I did not like:1) Waiting to read the rest of the series...

Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!","review":"I am an adult who loves the Harry Potter books. Then I picked up Eragon and read that, absolutely fascinated by it. The same day I finished Eragon, I bought Eldest, and loved it even more. I do not think the book loses momentum, instead it gets better with every chapter!I also think this book is appropriate for a wide age range. Some of the words used in the book are very advanced, but it will give younger readers a chance to learn them while at the same time giving adult readers a good time.This book has captured my imagination and I would recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The product itself.","review":"Too many reviews on here review the quality of the writing. I found these unhelpful. There are plenty of other ways and better sites to find literary reviews. Chances are, if you're buying this sequel, you want to read it.The product, however, was a poor purchase. It is a small paperback, and is poorly made. The inside margins are so small that there's no way to read the book comfortably; you must stretch the book out to read the end of each line. The day I received my copy, the last 2 chapters fell out due to poor binding. If you choose to read this book, buy some other copy, as this is -- physically -- a poor quality paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book two!","review":"I wouldn't have thought it possible, but this book is even worse than the first one. I don't want to give away spoilers, so instead I will just bash the book. Once again it is super slow paced and boring. This author is more long winded than the Unabomber. Not only did the author manage to make up less of a plot and state the super obvious plot twists, but he made Eragon even more of a Smeg-mah. \\"Look at me, I'm Eragon, I caught an arrow and can tell who shot it, but I can't heal myself or beat my brother who has studied magic far less than I have. Oh look, now I am half elf because I got drunk on music at the dance. I think for my final act I shall get owned and cry about it.\\" Seriously, why does he keep writing these books and why do I keep reading them I hate them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad flop, nothing like Eragon","review":"Paolini followed all the writers rules in Eragon and yet in Eldest he failed to apply almost any of them. He takes you one direction and you find it leads nowhere. The character development that was so well done becomes sad in Eldest. At the end I felt the book was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Read the book before. My kids seen the movie Eragon and I told them that they had books on them. They asked me to get them so I can help them read the books before they go to bed. Movie doesn't do the book justice. But great choice. My boys love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eargon v.s Eldest","review":"Eldest surpasses any and all expatiations set by Eargon (book 1)A griping continuation of its beloved counterpart Eargon, Eldest is a must read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Awesom Buk!","review":"I luvd this buk.

Then he flis with Safira and fites a battle. Then he goz to the elfs and falls in luv. The luv seens are very tuching. The elf that he fals in luv with is namd Arya, like Arwen in Lord of the Rings. But then she hats him and he is sed. Then Aragon fites and losses. But his enmey is acually his bruther and then Aragon duzn't dy. But then Aragon meets his other bruther, Roran, who is like Rohan in Lord of the Rings. Then thy kis and mak up and evryon is hapy. This buk had a lot of gud plots.

Even though they cost more than twice as much as the other books I normally read, I thought it would be worth it. I had recently read \\"Tales of Otori\\" series by Liam Hearn and was looking forward to an exciting fantasy adventure.I made it through Eragon after a lot of effort to make myself continue reading because I kept thinking that the book is going to get better. I made it through a few hundred pages of Eldest thinking the same thing. But it never gets better! The plot and the character's motivations are incomprehensable, the characters are flat which makes it difficult to care about any of them. Suffice to say I won't ever read any more books by Paolini."},{"rating":"2","title":"The continuing story of a boy and his Dragon","review":"Eldest has a problem. It is to complex for the age it is written for. It's lack of originality turns most expeirenced fantasy fans off. I myself loved the Lord of the Rings. I don't mind how close this world is to that. What I like is how magic is seeping through the pages. The Characters are good. I don't think I can go great. It is just the whole package deal that I love. I love the setting. The sense of fun.

I think you will to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This limited edition is Book II in 'The Inheritance Trilogy'","review":"Avid fans of fantasy in the advanced middle to high school grade levels will find Christopher Paolini's ELDEST both a challenge and a treat. It's a challenge because it's complex and detailed - holding over 700 pages of plot and action. This limited edition is Book II in 'The Inheritance Trilogy' and appears in a deluxe edition to tell of dragons who have saved states from a cruel ruler. Now Eragon and his dragon must travel to the land of elves for further training and confrontations in an epic saga reminiscent of 'Lord of the Rings'."},{"rating":"2","title":"(3.5 stars) An improvement over #1, but...","review":"Okay, this book is about Eragon right? Good, I thought so. Then why was I more interested in the segments involving Angela (the herbalist) and his cousin Roran? Seriously, Mr. Panoli, you desperately NEED to develop your title hero. Furtherly, the scene with Eragon and Arya is indeed awkward, this book gets dragged out too long for its own good, and the big climatic revelation turned out to be predictable from the first.Still, there are some reasons to like this book, namely Roran's conflicts with the King's army, the political intrigue between the Varden and the Council, and especially Angela, the aforementioned loveably eccentric herbalist. Still, Panoli could use a couple more years to develop his craft, and to be frank it hasn't happened quite yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took two readings...","review":"I loved reading Eragon. It was an excellent book, and I read it quickly. So, I was excited about reading its sequel, Eldest, as well. But, when I got it, it took me SO long to finish it. I didn't like it very much at all. I would find myself skipping whole paragraphs just to try and finish the book. I didn't understand what was going on in the plot or anything.BUT!!! I read it again a few days ago, and I loved it!! I found that it was much easier to read than the last time. I found that i could celebrate in the whole \\"intillecual\\" (sp?) aspect of it, how hard Eragon was struggling with his rider education.I guess all it took was another chance.And please, everyone! If u read it once, and it doesn't really suit you, put it aside for a while, month, week, whatever, then give it another try. Believe me, it'll be worth it the second time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Dissapionted...but not at the book","review":"I personaly loved this book.

I know half the kids that read this book were dissapointed because of the lack of action... but GROW UP!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely ghastly","review":"Since when do people get a million dollars and movie adaptations for stealing all their ideas and writing really poorly? Well, since Paolini got published. I hope it doesn't start happening often, because there should be standards in writing.

To me this means there will be no major problems with the book, but may show some signs of wear. Well this book had a hole and tear in the front cover.

Book was in great shape and arrived in a timley manner. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it even if I guessed the ending","review":"I couldn't put it down even though I guessed the ending right. Wasn't so up on the training sessions but I found what everyone else was doing quite interesting. The series looks to be set up thus far like the Lord of the rings with the middle book breaking apart the main players and having them come back together in the end. It was fun and light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest","review":"Eldest is the second book of the Inheritance series. After pledging himself to the Varden, Eragon seeks to further his training that Brom started. He travels to Ellesmera where he receives instruction from the last surviving dragon rider other than Galbatorix. Eragon's studies include swordsmanship and expanding his knowledge of the ancient language. He and Saphira do all that they can to prepare for the war against Galbatorix.Meanwhile, in Carvahall, Roran is left with the decision of what to do. There are Ra'zac and soldiers hunting for Eragon and Saphira, and they came to Carvahall and started making trouble. Roran must come up with a defense or they will all be killed.I really liked this book. It put a hold on me and didn't let go until I finished. I think Christopher Paolini did an excellent job making a complicated but interesting Fantasy novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST books ever!","review":"I can't believe some of you people don't like this book. It rocks. I couldn't put the book down! I really liked the battles, storyline and adventure. I felt like I really knew the characters by the time I finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sequel","review":"After finishing the first book, Eragon, I was eager to read the second book, but I was disappointed. The book seemed bloated and it seemed to drag due to long details about everything. This book was 700 pages and yet could of easily been written in 200-300 hundred pages. The ending of the book picked up pace only to leave the reader dissapointed by not providing an ending. I just read 700 pages and Paolini couldn't even give the book a decent ending. If/when the third book comes out i will not be buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Dull","review":"Eldest is the second part of Eragon. It's about Eragon going to train with the elves. It also says what has happened to Roran. The book is a lot longer then it needs to be. It didn't to hold my attention. I only read a few chapters before setting it aside. The story dragged on with very little action. Unless you really like the first book I don't think it's worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Read!!!","review":"I picked up this book about a week after it came out and it is AWESOME!!! I read Eragon about a year ago, recommended to me by a good friend of mine, and I loved it. Eldest has a different meaning in it, a different plotline. I liked how the book frequently switches off between Eragon and Roran, and sometimes Nasuada. It gives the book a taste much like Artemis Fowl. At the end, there is a mindblowing secret which will make you want the next book as soon as possible. WAY TO GO, PAOLINI!!! 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Others have said it I'll say it again, this the worst book I've ever read in my life and I've read hundreds and hundreds. This book has poor characterization, horrendous plotting, and tedious dialog. I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would buy this book. Plenty of people will be trying to give it away very soon trust me. Problem is there'll be no takers. Should come with a warning label: MAY BE GOOD AS PAPERWEIGHT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good setup for the 3rd book","review":"Eldest is a good read, a few slow spots, but all in all a good book. It gives background on the main characters and sets you up for the 3rd book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing yet not perfection","review":"Personaly I Have not seen the best book ever. Though this is right in line. Paolini seems to have a knack for writting even at the age of 17. For many of the books \\"haters\\" people seem to forget that. Yes the book seems to have woven in some of the plots of many of our favorites (star wars, toklien) yet its great. Im hooked and so are millions. Plus the movie rights have been bought. No i can not say it worth of 5 stars as i am a firm beliver of 5 stars means PERFECTION but no its no 1 star either."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"Books (tapes) one and two are GREAT!

GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Awful","review":"Simply put, this is the most embarrasingly bad book that I have read in years. Eragon was a fun story, if a mediocre book. Eldest is completely devoid of story, and seems as if it were written by a seventh grader. I literally hate myself for plowing through 668 pages of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurly written","review":"With all the popularity of the books I expected more. But unlike books like The King's Blade and The Crystal Shard this book drags. The narrative made it hard for me to stay awake, there were unresolved issues and all of it was far too predictable.If you're looking for a fun read, try the books above especially The King's Blade, both are definitely far better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever","review":"I wasn't in love with Eragon, but I thought I would read the second book anyway. I needed something to do over spreing Break anyway. Well, this book was boring and it felt like I already read it somewhere before. Oh yeah, in every other fantasy book ever written.Save yourself a headache and try a different series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"No editor, and cookie cutter style. This is a book that is better used as fire starter. If anyone doesn't believe me, please browse a chapter first at your local bookstore. You will thank me that you didn't waste your cash. A third book is sure to hit the stands as it is selling, but Christopher Paolini will probably be retiring soon with his cash and going into hiding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inheritance Series","review":"Eragon is unusual, powerful, fresh, & fluid. Sure to be a hit with kids & young adults. Available from School Book Fairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"my point of view","review":"Eldest is an adventure-fantasy book. I'm halfway into the book and this is my point of view. I don't think it's better than Eragon but it's ok. It's not very easy to read. The book has a lot of hard words. The sentences don't make you understand those words too easily. I was disappointed when Ajihad died.(He was the leader of the Varden) He was slaughtered by urgals. I think Saphira was one most important characters. Saphira is the most important character because she helps Eragon everyway. Maybe this is a summer reading book, because it takes a long time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book belongs in Yawnsville Arizona","review":"In books there's boring, really boring, and incredibly boring. But this book is über-boring. It's beyond the tedium event horizon. It's broken the barrier of boredom.

Not if you value your sanity, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...[...]","review":"Read the [...] There are so many [] for a reason. This book is awful.

Some books are just really good, so you don't have to try to be out of the crowd by exploiting its weaknesses. This is a very well written book and I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Overall a bad expirience. The two books seem like they were written by different people. There was almost no movement of plot in the book just lots of character development which he constantly does not stick too. This was a hard book to stay interested in. I am not impressed by this poor writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter loved it, I hated it","review":"Epic fantasy is new to my daughter. So all the cliched characters and situations, all the contrived plot devices, even the poor writing style, didn't matter - it was all new. She had never read anything like it before and was swept away by the sheer scope of the book.It piqued her interest, and she is now devouring fantasy books from far better authors. For that reason alone it gets two stars, rather than one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be fooled by \\"Bad\\" Reviews...","review":"I personally loved this installment in the story, and if you liked Eragon you will like this one. It is very hard for me to find many books that capture my attention the way this trilogy has thus far. To be honest with you I really don't think it is a kids book. I was very worried at first after reading all these \\"bad\\" reviews written by kids but it can be a complex book to the younger generation. The author actually creates whole new languages and environments that I personally got totally emerged and lost in. I can't wait for the third book in the series because if it is anything like Eldest I won't be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy story.","review":"I like fantasy stories. I excepted a lot for Eldest.Unfortunately, story was stupid and characters weren't interesting. Still I read this book at the loose end. One of biggest disappoinment ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for the third.........","review":"I have to admit, after reading Eragon, I ordered and waited patiently for the second part of Christopher's Paolini. I personally enjoy the novels in their entirety. As for \\"similarities\\" with other epics, aren't they all similar in some fashion? As for the play of words with Eragon and Aragorn, anyone notice if you replace E with a D you get \\"Dragon\\"?I am a big fan of the Dragonriders of Pern, the LOTR, and numerous other sagas, they all have their uniqueness and similarities. My advice is to sit down, and enjoy Chris's story on its own merits. I would recommend this book for older children and adults.Waiting Patiently for number three.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Worse Than The First","review":"Eldest was bad. Eragon was MUCH better than this. All Eldest was about is Eragon's training and that's basically it. If it weren't for Roran, the whole middle of the book could be thrown out with no regrets from anyone. The middle part was so boring it took me three months just to get from 259 to 400! Paolini really screwed up on this. The only thing Eragon ever did was, feel the forest, in training. SO STUPID!The Good:The ending battle, and Roran's part.The Bad:Everything else.Another bad thing was that if you mix Lord of the Rings and Star Wars together, you get this. At least Eragon had more originality.People who haven't read this, just read the ending. It's the only good part."},{"rating":"1","title":"A watered down story that tries too hard.","review":"The book is full of bad dialogue, illogical events, and sloppily written prose.

Has this guy ever even taken English 101??Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"eldest was a disappointing read compared to eragon. true, it is a well sized book and looks impressive; however, this does not make up for the choppy content. Roran's \\"quest\\" was unclear and quite lame. Eragon's training and adventures were also a bit boring. I had to read it for school, and the few days it took to finish were slow. This is why I give eldest the 2 star rating it deserves. I hope paolini's next book in the inheritance is one much better than the 2nd one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me...","review":"Stupid sucker me. I bought Eldest without reading the reviews. If I had read the reviews I never would have bought it. Everyone hates this book, and for good reason. For me JUST SAY NO means no more Paolini books. Anyone reading it must be stupider than me cause this books stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless drivel","review":"I have to agree with the many readers who loathed this book. I have read a great deal of fantasy and sci/fi and in comparison, this story seemed dull and boring. With the thinly detailed characters and the predicatible plot I found myself tuning out and having to read pages again. I was sorely disappointed by this one. I kept waiting for something to be interesting, but it never happened. I won't even bother to read the third one. Unfortunately, I don't care what happens to these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Read, but Hoping Paolini finds His Stride","review":"It's awesome that Paolini has been successful in getting published when many good writers don't. I absolutely hope he refines his style and goes on to write the best books I've ever read. But this one is a low point so far.I suppose all the elements of his story are not original, but that doesn't bother me so much. And I think the truth is that most others wouldn't mind it so much either except for the writing itself. The problem that keeps making me want to throw the book down is that the writing itself is just ... clunky! It doesn't flow very well. He uses the words \\"which\\" and \\"the fact that\\" an awful lot along with many other phrases that just don't flow very well. It's hard for me to describe, but you will know it when you read it. It just doesn't settle into you easily. So rather than enabling the story, the words he uses actually get in the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way is it 5 stars??","review":"No way so many people think this is 5 stars. Is this for real? I mean if you read it like the whole complete book from start to end?? It took me 3 weeks to finish since it was so unbelevably boring. I'd fall asleep reading all the time.

Of course, some names are just silly. Come, Galbatorix! Asterix, Obelix, and Vitalstatistix are waiting for you! Oh yes, and syntax. From this century that is. Language is supposed to E-volve.I comfort myself that at least the storyline is orignally from The Wheel of TIme. Oh, whoops.The one thing I do find amazing is that Paolini, who lives in Nowhere USA and probably has never seen alcohol or women before, is miraculously able to describe their effects... in the same way every other Tor fantasy novel does.

Stick to describing moss, kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book and can't wait for the next in the series","review":"This book was less predictable than the first one.

I may be twelve but I know a good book from a bad book. This book is incredibly boring. Paolini's writing is as unimaginative as it is wordy. He seems to take great lengths to describe stupid stuff with poorly chosen adjectives. Every paragraph seems to drag on, and nothing ever happens. A potential reader would be best suited to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"It's too much like LOTR and every other fantasy novel out there.

In looking at reviews of Eldest 80% or more were/are from people who disliked this book. I wonder if the reviews of Eragon wouldn't be about the same if so many reviews hadn't disappeared into thin air.Dozens and dozens of readers have said, I'll say it again this is the last Paolini book I will ever read. Like others I'm disappointed this book doesn't have better writing and editing. There's no way this book should run so long. A good editor should have trimmed by as much as 50% or more.

But this one was more of a rushed work with stolen plotlines from lord of the rings, star wars, etc. It was slow moving with many pointless chapters that did little to progress the story. Character developments were little. Arya became more annoying and has no tolerance for different beliefs. Eragon became more pathetic and emotionally weak. The elves and dwarves were spinoffs of Tolkien's works. The best part was the end when Murtagh, the only decent character was brought back. A book that you may read once and will never want to look at it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves me flat","review":"The first book was good enough for me to continue on onto this one. To tell the truth, much of it was enjoyable. I found that the focus on training and description drawing me into the world, and with each new chapter I kept saying to myself \\"Huh, I didn't expect that\\". The characters of Saphira and Roran develop nicely. But I don't know, somewhere around 2/3 into it I stop hearing the characters giving well thought out reasons for their actions, descriptions of the world stop feeling so detailed, and I can feel the author shoving the plot along to the end. Then the ending was kind of ho-hum. I don't see me reading the last book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Youth, from Youth (by a 17 year old girl)","review":"Christopher Paolini has given youth exactly what we wanted: adventure, romance, intrigue, plot-twists to keep you guessing, clean material, .... and enough pages to keep it lasting a while. Paolini is genius!!! He took age-old characters, and shaped them into something new and refreshing. These are not your Lord of the Rings elves, or dwarves, but they sure do deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Needs to Grow Up","review":"While I found ERAGON to be an entertaining first effort, I could not get through more than two chapters of ELDEST. The author tells everything that is happening and what the characters are feeling in tedious expository, rather than allowing the descriptive imagery, action and dialogue to move story forward. I had hoped that Paolini's style would have matured since his first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"E\\" For Excellent Mate!","review":"I love books that entertain me...no matter what the genre is.

This book is well put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I have just reread all the reviews, now that I have finished the first two books for myself, and I'm mystified by all the glowing praise. I'm a long-time fantasy and scifi fan, but this just didn't grab me. I found the characters flat, unengaging, and frankly uninspiring. The events were difficult to follow, and unfold more as after the fact this is what's been going on rather than taking you along to discover it for yourself. There was no sitting on edge of the seat waiting the next revelation it was more like riding in the back seat asking \\"are we there yet?\\" \\"is it over yet?\\"I understand there will be a third book, but I won't be bothering with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first book","review":"If you like fantasy fiction, this is a great series, and Eldest is even better than Eragon. The story really pics up in this one. Of the three books so far, I liked this one the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just dull","review":"Paolini is a prodigy, no doubt, but he isn't a very gifted writer. Much of what he wrote in the first book was synthesized from other fantasy stories and from those elements he crafted a fairly interesting, albeit longwinded, tale. It's my opinion that his editors (if he has any) should've cut out at least one-third of Eragon.With that said, reading Eldest was like slogging through mud. It was so incredibly convoluted and just plain dull that I gave up midway and have no desire to go back and find out what I missed. I couldn't care less.I think his problem is that he and his parents are so impressed with whatever he writes that they don't suggest massive editing. If they do, then it doesn't show. Eragon was ok, Eldest was boring, and I'll skip Brisingr altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great in the series","review":"I bought this book for my son and he loves it.

I found it plodding. I can't help but agree with the Star Wars analogies. Also, it appears that Paolini took Philosophy 101 class in college and included several of the trite reason v. faith arguments. Paolini wrote as if his readers can't spot or understand a faulty syllogism when they see it. Please, leave that nonsense out in the next book and write an adventure story like Eragon. I'll keep reading, but for those still considering this book, get it from the library ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...........","review":"I suppose since I was mailed an advance reader copy I should extoll the virtues of this book and give it high praise like everyone else, but that would be a lie. I can't believe I waited two years for this. Such a disappointment after the promise of \\"Eragon\\".\\"Eragon\\" wasn't a perfect book, but it was at least a halfway decent read. This book is no where near as good as recent reads like Robert Stanek's magnificent \\"Keeper Martin's Tale\\". I would recommend that book (and series) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo","review":"all i have to say is: I CANT BELIEVE THIS PIECE JUNK WAS ACTUALLY PUBLISHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yewww!

Go Stravaganza!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR IS TOO GENEROUS","review":"If I had known what a rip off this book was I would have never paid one red cent for it. Besides being very very very bad, the writing is terribly dull and incredibly boring. He spends too much time running off about nothing and so little time writing about anything interesting. Too many paragraphs and pages were redundant and should have been excluded.This once again proves correctly the saying of PT Barnum, \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\" and unfortunately I was one of them to believe that this would be anywhere close to good. If you spend your money on this book, you will likely want it back after you read it. If you have this book do the public a favor and donate it to your local library so that others see what a rip-off this book really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eldest is a dud.","review":"My daughter is a voracious reader and tore through Eragon but said Eldest was a boring and couldn't finish it. Stop while you're ahead and don't buy this one. If curiosity will kill you, go to the library and borrow it. You're welcome in advance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who says we're jealous?","review":"I thought a previous reviewer had summed this up. Not all of us our jealous. Not all of us are teenagers that want to be published. Sorry, some of them might be, but saying that we are all jealous of Paolini's success is an overstatement.After all, what do you deem success? The amount of money that fills you pocket? Is success writing a boring novel and making big 'bling' off it? Is it getting a ton of attention? I personally would say that a novel that sells two copies is more of a success story than Eldest. Eldest is only 'sucessful' because it is hanging off the tail of Eragon, a better book, not like that is hard to achieve.I didn't come here to flame Paolini. That would be waste of a dragon's breathe, just like Eldest wastes the dragon story that was Eragon.Again, what do I have to be jealous of? Eragon, maybe if I liked writing, but Eldest? I would never stoop so low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Poor Content and B O R I N G !","review":"This hardcover cover version is not costly but a major source of headache. After reading Eragon I was anticipating Eldest to be a good read. But, alas, Paolini thinks he is Charles Dickens or something and has tried and failed miserably to put his latest offering into the realm of classics. Poor Poor! I won't recommend this book at all for anything except throwing it into the bin, I really hope he reads this review and writes the last book better.Mediocre to very poor book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason so many people hate this book...its bad","review":"I have been reading fantasy my whole life, and am pretty darn open minded. When I saw the great rating Eragon had, I bought both Eragon and Eldest on the spot. I was really disappointed though when my family and I tried read this. Dull, mindnumbingly boring, and that's just the beginning. I am not one of those people that has to have action all the time, but this is pure stupdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was REALLY BORING. I have \\"A\\" student, book loving (even Eragon loving) friends who read about 18 chapters and then called it quits because they were so bored. The descripions wander and leave you wondering what Paolini was trying the describe. *spoiler* Also at the end when Murtagh tells Eragon they are brothers, Eragon denies it and then what does Murtagh say? \\"Search your feelings, you know it to be true!\\"Pop in Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back and you will see Vader telling Luke the EXACT same thing! Other reviewers have pointed out many other striking similarities between Eldest and Star Wars. Paolini is a copier!Don't waste your time or money on Eldest - buy Star Wars instead for the same story but with much more entertainment value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am speechless.","review":"Absolutely ridiculous. I cannot imagine how such a cliched and boring pile of nonsense was even published. After reading the disappointing Eragon, I had hoped that the author's sadly misguided style would have improved, but I was terribly mistaken. This is an insult to Tolkien (which is blatanly ripped off of in both books) and every other notable book in the fantasy genre. The dialogue is not natural. It is constructed and awkward. The plot and events have been done a million times over (and much better executed, too). The characters are terribly cliche, and I feel no sympathy for them. The villain is boring and predictable, as are the heroes. The creatures show little imagination, and are not very well devised. The only redeeming quality about this book is the front cover art. Unfortunately, that's not enough to warrant a buy from me. In short, just don't touch this book. I'm sure whatever story you can imagine in your mind will be loads better than the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Rip-Off Quotes","review":"I'm just here to post a few quotes that were completely ripped off from LotR.~\\"I will diminish.\\" --IslanzdiGaladriel, anyone?~\\"Fly, you fools!\\" --Not sure(OMG it's Gandalf!)~\\"You are not your father, or your brother.

I only got through about 1/2 of the book. While Eragon was mindnumbing and utterly boring, Eldest is a disaster. I'd rather go to the dentist and have new holes drilled in my mouth than continue reading it. I was VERY unimpressed with the writer. I will avoid his books in the future. He doesn't seem to have even the most basic writing skills. You'd have to be pretty desperate with nothing else going on to want to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the last.....","review":"Oh man, what a great read even though it's not quite as good as the last one. This book not only tells the tale of Eragon (the last Rider), but also the story of Carvahall and of the current leader of the Varden, and includes pirates elves, a cripple who is whole, and a cursed little girl. It's such a great book I would read it again and again and still like it a bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call that a book?","review":"\\"Sé onr sverdar sitja hvass!\\"-may your swords stay sharp.

A lot of this comprehendible espacilly of the flips from the point of view that take place (Eragon to Roran to Ajihad's daughter). Augh! that mess me up so mech. If I have on word to describe Eldest and Christopher Paolini it would be pitful. He just did a horrible job from the different languages to keeping the readers attention. Well, if you did't read it I suggest you don't read it. If you read I apologies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest by Christopher Paolini","review":"Eldest, by Christopher Paolini, is the exciting second installment of the Inheritance Trilogy. In this action packed adventure we follow Eragon and Saphira as they continue to fight Galbatorix and the Empire. Watch as both Eragon and Saphira learn lessons about life and love. This endearing novel is a huge improvement when compared to the first book in the Inheritance Trilogy, Eragon. Eldest's arousing details make it a real page turner. The intriguing characters and memorable plots make this story exciting to anyone who reads it. The only down fall of reading this book is the fact that it is so time consuming. Although this 704 page book takes awhile to read, it is fast paced and takes you from one exciting event to another. From teenagers to adults anyone will enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting Blend of used plots","review":"Most have found similarities with Star Wars and Lord of the rings, and I have to say that I found much of the same. I enjoyed the book, but it had its faults. The elves came off kind of boring in all their perfectionism. Honestly I don't quite see why Eragon is in love with Aria. Well, I guess its more of a young love than a mature one. She's so reserved emotionally to the point of being stale. If she were just human and not a 'beautiful' elven princess would Eragon be as infatuated? Roran's account was more interesting and seemed more real, although I was surprised to find that katrina *spoiler* was alive in the end. The Ra-zac eat humans right, and then Katrina is no one of true signifcance. Why keep her alive? Not bad but there is room for improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Continuation of the series from Paolini","review":"Eragons journey continues in this 2nd book from Christopher Paolini. Although a great deal of time is spent in the politics of the different races the storyline progresses fairly well.

However, Eragon held up far better than Eldest. Things got very boring during Eragon's training, and by now most of the few interseting or decent characters had died or disappeared (Brom, Murtagh) or just weren't in the book enough (Roran). The last battle could've been great, but it took away from the book that Eragon was a \\"superman\\" by this time and was killing off people without moving a finger. Roran salvaged the book as best he could, but one character can do only so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommend","review":"Fantastic book from the beginning to end.

When I read this book I was in fourth grade and had alot of hope. I had read Eragon, and it was simply mediocre (sp?) But I had heard such great reviews and I decided to give it a chance. What I found was the typical fantasy book. A little too typical. When I heard Paolini was stealing from other authors, I didn't believe it. But, alas, the evidence is staring me right in the face.I wanted to like this book, I really did. It was my dream to become a writer, and this guy was only fifteen. I think he could use some more experience...It was so predictable. I would read something, and groan, wondering how I didn't see that coming. Not to mention the lack of leading ladies.Worth reading? Nope. I know there are alot of hardcore Eragon fans out there, and this is just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!!!!!!","review":"I read ERAGON and liked it, but when I started ELDEST it was very unlike ERAGON.

But as most books I've read had, it had a few flaws. C'mon Chris! At least you could cut down the middle sections instead of describing EVERY SINGLE DETAIL! Sure your teacher told you to describe things, but not that much! You just described and described and described! All you did was make us bored and turned it into a chore to read it in the middle. Like COME ON! You don't need to describe EVERY SINGLE lesson Eragon had with Oromis! I'm not saying your book is bad, but it just needs a little more editing to do. You should just write it like Harry Potter. Just keep on going and don't stop too long to describe things and keep it interesting so people won't FORCE themselves to finish it (like I did). By the way, nice battle descriptions! Those were one of the times you kept it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow up to Eragon","review":"I think this book is a good sequel to Eragon.

It follows Eragon though the \\"adolecent\\" part of the story. After leaving Farthen Dur, he goes and trains with the elfs. At the Same time, paolini follows the stories of Roran and Nasuade. Full of twists and surprises, this book is hard to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest","review":"This book tells a great story, but some of the chapters are too immersed in details and slow to read. I prefer more action and less description of the settings. Even w/ these negative comments, I can't wait for the last book in this series to be published. It is an intriguing storyline - the interaction between characters makes the story move quickly. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at times, but still worth while","review":"I loved Eragon, so maybe I started Eldest with expectations that were too high. Don't get me wrong, Eldest is a good book, it just had too many down times. I did not like the chapters written in Roran's perspective, but I do deem them some-what necessary, but come on-- do they have to be so descriptive and drawn out? I was also disappointed in the attempted romance between Arya and Eragon. I know that Eragon and Arya live in an alternate universe, but I found the times between them forced, like Paolini only longed to get back to action. Not that there was too much action either. The battle scenes and fighting that made Eragon so intriguing are all but missing from Eldest, except for the last 100 pages. Bottom line though, Eldest is worth the read, it still maintain my attention, though at times I found it wandering. I still recommend it, if only for the fact that it sets the stage for book three- Inheritance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Rave?","review":"As with Eragon, a friend of mine wrote a review of Eldest that magically disappeared. Funny how only reviews that promote this book in some way make it. Enough already!!On with the review, this book not the stupendious epic that I expected. I do like well written fantasy and I am not sure why this one is being praised so highly. The writing and the story are mediocre at best, laughable at worst. It was very slow and boring. Nothing happens in the entire book except people traveling around.

The characters were one-dimensional and bland, their emotions stereotypical in the extreme. For a classified-as-young-adult book, it reads as though Paolini swallowed a thesaurus and the obscure words take away from the story as a whole.

I dont need to know what a colony of ants and their environment do while in the midst of training. Meditation I understand but to dwell upon every single detail is overkill.

That was unfortunately the case here. Eragon gains terrific strength and power as expected and the conflict builds between the Varden and the Empire. The action in the book continued to hold my interest but the language and writing was almost unbearable at times. \\"Barges' I don't want no stinking barges!\\" Come on!

It's hilarious! And yes, a sad, sad truth to what I had heard was a unique and creative novel. Even people like me who are unfamiliar with Star Wars (I've only seen one) and Lord of the Rings (watched the first one) could see this uncanny similiarity.

With that I leave you to ponder my words......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should come with a warning label","review":"I read and then re-read the glowing reviews and am dumbfounded! I am wondering if it isn't some kind of Amazon marketing scam since Amazon posts reviews at its discretion. It worked on me I bought both Eragon and Eldest. The story wonders aimlessly. The characters are irritating and don't do anything rationally. For anyone to give this book any stars is beyond me. Maybe they were trying to review a different book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"You would hope that in a second effort, lessons would have been learned and perhaps acted upon. No such luck in Eldest. This book gasps for editorial attention. The number one thought in a reader's mind should not be the quality of the writing. Here, it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It!!!!!","review":"After I read the first few pages I was ready to rip the book into shreds. The book is unbeleivably BORING. At first, I thought the book would be kind of interesting and different from the first book. The first book was written when Paolini was only 18. And the second book was published when he was 22. DO the math. In four years he definitely should've already learned from his mistakes on the first book. But instead the second book was TWICE as dull. My local newspaper gave it an F rating and I don't even blame them. The book just drags on and on. I mean Saphira the \\"heroine\\" dragon turned into a silly schoolgirl in a few pages. If the book was edited it would be 200 pages not 700. This book is just a waste of time and money. Use your money on books you won't be able to put down. If you are thinking about reading this book or are reading it, you would be wise to put it down and get some real stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Librarians need not apply","review":"Some people seem to misunderstand what a story is meant to do, which is to entertain. Regardless of Paolini's source of inspiration, this book enveloped me into a fictional world that was so enriched with descriptional writing that at times I felt like part of the story itself. Paolini never claimed to be writing the next American Novel, he wanted to write a story that allowed people to escape their own world and transpose themselves into a fantasy world rich with flamboyant heroics and brutal honor. Read this book, regardless of your favorite genre, you will find this story refreshingly simple to read and expertly woven from chapter to chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas, Eldest (Eragon book II)","review":"The book was bad, bad, bad. It's so slow that the reader can't get into it. Page after page of rituals and minor incidents that go no where, but slow down the pace and bores one to death. I was obvious our young author has a lot of ideas & issues and decided to cram everything into this book....he even tried to teach the reader how to make lace. Too, young Paolini wrestling with his teenage sexual frustration writes his characters into several awkward and unneeded love scenes that not only include Eragon, but for poor old Sephira. If Mr. Paolini is determined to write a third book it is hope that he reads book I and tries to recapture the energy and pace, otherwise let him stop writing until he matures as a fantasy writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"to predictable","review":"I really liked the first book but was disapointed with this one. I thought that this book had no surpises and just went on and on and on ect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Eragon","review":"Eldest, the second installment in the Inheritance trilogy, is much better than the first, Eragon. Paolini was only 15 when he started writing Eragon and it shows. However, Paolini's writing has developed and matured much in The Eldest. At first I was unimpressed by Paolini's decision to tell the story from different points of view but I later decided that this helped the story extremely, really making it more epic-like. Roran and Nasuda(spelling?) really become compelling characters and Eragon continues to mature. I was dissapointed that Arya's personality was not developed more. I enjoyed the way the story progressed however, I too was not impressed by the \\"wordiness\\" nor did I enjoy all of the \\"elf speak\\" and \\"dwarf speak.\\" To a certain extent this is necessary but I believe that Paolini overused it. Can't wait for the third installment and I am looking forward to seeing Paolini's writing mature and develop even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped and unreadable","review":"After all the buzz, I finally decided to give this series a try. It is shallow, linear, simplistic and boring. Don't buy this book if you are looking for something along the lines of Tolkien, LeGuin, or even Rowling. You will be sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"When Mr. Paolini looks back on these books and related comments in a couple of decades it will be a painful experience. Writing a trilogy, no matter how bad, at such a young age is quite an accomplishment. Twenty years from now he should see them for what they are - a combination of Jr. High love letters and Philosophy 101 essays mixed into a base of rip offs from all over popular culture, not just science fiction and fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Dan Carrera. Again","review":"Sorry Dan. I missed this comment in my rebuke of you.\\"Oh, and one more thing A KID'S REVIEW. If you like the books you THINK he stole ideas from, then you must certainly like Eragon and Eldest. Only because it's like others. But im not changing my opinion about you. As well as others.\\" No, his blatant stealing of ideas angers me. He stole ideas that weren't his, chewed them up, and regurgitated them into this book, adding nothing of his own. Everywhere I read, I thought to myself \\"I've read ALL of this before.\\" What's wrong with wanting something new, Dan? And \\"im\\" not changing my opinion about you or Eldest either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-religion speech unnecessary","review":"About half-way through the book, Oromis, Eragon's teacher, gives him a lecture on the foolishness of religion. Elves don't believe in God, he explains, because it is an illogical and ill-concieved belief that leads to ignorant decisions.Eragon then becomes upset and realizes that his past beliefs were wrong and atheism is the correct path.This is a children's fantasy book, a place for fun and escapism, not a place to try and encourage atheism in children.I would highly recommend that parents read this book before allowing their children to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't add more to the Genre than it copies","review":"I got through the second book, Eldest, by skim reading and skipping whole paragraph's and pages. Too long, too verbose, with too little worth reading. But my major disappointment is similar to the reviews of many others: Paolini takes the ideas and themes of other authors so much, but adds very little original concept to the Genre. It lacks a convincing identity and character of is own to differentiate itself from much better works of fiction. But I gave it two stars because it did fill in two rainy days of vacation, and I am a sucker for adventure tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest","review":"This book was in very good condition. I really enjoyed the book very much. I wish there were more books like this one. I try to order from goodwill in San Frisco when they have the book in stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Nice bed side night time reading . Helping relax and venture off into dream land. That opens the mind to far off lands"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Quality","review":"The hardback version of this book was very nice. I purchased it used, and I couldn't even tell that it wasn't new! I bought this book for someone as a gift, so as far as the content I am unsure of. But I am certain he will be very pleased considering the fact that he read the first book in just a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I don't know why some people are criticizing this book as badly as they are. Like all fantasy books and stories, if you strip them down far enough you get the same basic story. Characters are whats important in these books, and, while Eragon has much in common with Luke Skywalker they are different people with different personalities and experiences. To give this anything less than 3 stars is pure hateration. Lay off the haterade, this book continues the trilogy very well. The training was a little dull and the romance subplot leaves a lot to be desired, but this is a good, well-written (especially for his age) novel. I look forwarded to reading the 3rd and final installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH! Dear God! WHY?!","review":"Oh why? This was a massacre of popular stories OTHER PEOPLE WROTE! I fully expected Morzan to come back from the dead Kenobi-style and announce to the world, \\"Eragon, I am your father.\\" and Eragon to anguish over it for the rest of the book. OH WAIT! That last part actually HAPPENED! Garion was also overdue for an appearance, coming in to say, \\"Why did you steal the cool mark on my hand that I have to keep hidden?\\" And for added fun, why not throw in a cute little scene where Arya's scent WAFTS toward Eragon, and she smells suspiciously like pine needles and another spicy scent. Oh wait, I think he did that too! Somebody read too many of his mom's romance novels when he was younger! This was a horrible book. If you value your sanity, IQ level, or anything else, DON'T read this. I regret actually borrowing this book from the library, and genuinely feel sorry that they spent money on this piece of cliched, predictable drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too PC for me","review":"I've liked the story for the most part. I'm not too crazy about the idea of atheist vegetarian elves (Tolkien must be spinning). Comparing the killing of rabbits to killing humans? Please... At least he didn't try making his dragon eat tofu and bean sprouts.The ending of Eldest was a let down. Eragon turned into quite the wimp at the end, begging for his hide. Lame. I'm now rooting for King Galbatorix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but not the worst","review":"I read Eragon when I was in 4th grade, at the advice of my english teacher. I absolutely loved it, and managed to get a signed copy when Paolini was in my area. I couldn't wait for the second volume to come out, and when it did, I waited for my local bookstore to open, and walked down the boardwalk to pick it up (I was at the beach at the time).That said, I was both pleased and dissapointed. I thought that some of the prose was too flowery, and too much time was spent on descriptions, but overall, it was enjoyable, and better than the first volume. I thought Paolini went a long way in developing Roran, and he seems like a very human character. Also, the ending is quite a surprise, although I will say that I correctly guessed the identity of Eragon's father, and ended up winning $5 from a friend over it. I reccomend people read it, and I look forward to the publication of volume 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic, a hero and dragons, what more could you want.","review":"For the fantasy reader this second book continues the Eragon/Saphira story with an interesting twist. While not a Hobbitt tale this Neverending Story will encourage the reader to seek the third installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eldest Book 2","review":"I found Eldest Book 2 very meticulately formed. It had a good story plot that kept a good pace. His character development good and we will all be waiting for his next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"While I was reading this book I was feeling that something is missing in this book. I was not feeling satisfied even when I finished this book. Later I realized that the author was trying to streach the story without any particular reason.I was afraid that probably he is going to streach the book in such a way that another edition will be needed. Thtas what happend. Compare to Eragon this book is very inferior. It's a huge book and take a lot of time to read. When I finished it I was just wondering; why the hell I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why has anyone in the publishing world brushed past better genius to allow this young person to be exploited? Give time to grow up, before asking someone to share what they don't have. It'll come easier then, when life is understood well enough to relate to others with some sense of humility."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pain, the pain!","review":"'Most people are other people. Their thoughts are other people's thoughts, their lives imitations, their passions a quotation' -Oscar Wilde.Mr Wilde could well have been talking about the author of this book. Slightly adapted, it could say; 'This book is other authors' books. Its ideas are other authors' thoughts, its plot imitation, its passions a quotation'.What more needs to be said? This book is soulless and hackneyed. Nothing in it is original, and if that wasn't bad enough it's also bland and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly AWFUL","review":"I didn't believe the bad reviews of this book and bought it anyway. Probably the BIGGEST mistake I've ever made. When I returned it to Hastings the lady said I was the third person today to return it. In no way does the writing achieve lyrical beauty or anything close to it. Truly awful writing with laughable cartoon characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke, I am your father!","review":"What more is there to say?I managed to rewrite Eldest in 5 words.

I expect that Christopher Paolini will continue to hone his skills, but he is doing so much better than any of you--and at his age--that you naysayers should be ashamed. The book was quite enjoyable. What was really telling is that my husband, who is much fussier than I am, stayed up two nights in a row to finish it. He almost NEVER reads fiction. Our son is still too young to enjoy either book, but I am sure happy to have read it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ZERO star rating?","review":"Everyone hates this book that's clear already. This book doesn't deserve any star. Why isn't there a zero star rating? Overrated, overhyped. I'm sending my books back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!","review":"I got this from my cousin who hates me so I should have known there was a reason. The reason is he hated the book so much he wanted to make me suffer it too. Is there any real plot in this book? After reading it I couldn't find one. To make it worse the characters talk, act, and think like Chucky and Tommy from Rugrats. Trust it from someone who got it free, it's not even worth free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After all the hype I read in the reviews, I was expecting more from this book. I found the characters very flat and undifferentiated. They seemed just to plod from place to place, and I found it hard to care at all what happened to them. There are tons of good books out there, this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are all the kid revies?","review":"How come all the adults who read it heep praise because the author is a kid? Eldest is a kids book so where are all the kids reviews? I've only seen a few AND the like me they HATE this book. How come no one says anthing about the characters talking lie cartoons or doing stupid stuff all the time? WHAT A DUMB BOOK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's settle the argument","review":"Okay I notice there is an argument on the space below me. Here's the verdict: ERAGON SUCKS. End of story. Why?1. Too much like Star wars. Period.2. Piss poor writing. My 7 year old can do better with the English language.3. Rip off of LOTR. He uses the line \\"Fly you fools!\\"4. The story is stupid. The characters are incosnistent and the concept is unoriginal.If you want a really good book about dragons, read Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate by Kenneth Eng, another young author. I mean, he's obviously not as financially successful as paolini, but he's still a better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eldest STINKS!","review":"Eldest is the worst book I've ever read in my life. For the life of me I don't know why it got published. It's sad to see honest reviews get buried by response reviewers who lavish 5 star raves on what is at best the worst book of the year and at worst the worst book of the decade. Comparing Paolini to Tolkien is only meant to further the hype. There's nothing in the writing comparative in the least. People should focus on the writing which is awful. Paolini should be glad people still believe he's a kid which at 22 years old he is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated and Boring!","review":"I enjoyed the first book, but this one's a stinker. Predictable, bloated and boring. There's virtually no action in the first 550 pages... skip to the last couple of chapters for development."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reasonable FIRST fantasy experience","review":"My kids (ages 9 and 13) are enjoying these books, but I realized it is because it is their FIRST experience with reading in the fantasy genre. My 13-year-old son and I will be using Eldest for a parent/child book report and I'm looking forward to finding out what he likes most about the book and pointing him toward some of the other (and much better) books out there that include many of the same themes. Setting aside the much discussed derivative nature of the plots in the story, my biggest beef with this book is that the big surprise twist at the end involves a storyline that would have been both compelling and heartbreaking to read, yet is explained away in one paragraph of exposition. I agree that young Mr. Paolini is impressive in his accomplishment, but I believe there is something to be said for experience and maturity in the area of story development. This book is the fantasy flavor of the month, but will not be an enduring classic in the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"ELDEST IS AMAZING!!!!!","review":"Gee! Wow! I'm giddy!!

I found myself rereading a few short paragraphs or a chapter. I didn't expect much after reading the first book, but this was even worse than I expected.I'm really disappointed at how popular this story is.

Paolini repeats lines like \\"single tear\\" and \\"strong of body, keen of mind\\" far too often. And did Eragon go for his Yoda-style training? yep.

I think that Paolini made his elves different and interesting, and HE DID NOT COPY TOLKIEN in this area. BUT, I do think he copied many names (Melian, Beor, and others) from Tolkien. It is unfortunate that such a promising writer could not think of original names!Also the plot is exactly like Star Wars. *spoiler* This became most annoying when Murtagh told Eragon who his father was. Eragon didn't like that idea and Murtagh said \\"Search your feelings, you know it to be true.\\" *cough* Vader said that!*cough*Eragon was excellent. Eldest was long, drawn out and lacked origianlity. It saddens me because I really thought the Inheritance Series would become the next Lord of the Rings.

It's an effort to listen to: not only does the reader, Gerard Doyle, use an annoying, artificial-sounding voice for the dragon, a major character, but the plot is contrieved and the language dull.

The \\"gimmick\\" of his starting to write at 15 has run its course, and I'd say that Eldest would be trashed in even an introductory college writing class.

This time around Paolini decides to inject an otherwise good plot with a lot of filler material. The narrative drags at many places.The book is entertaining in parts.Paolini decides to juggle 2 to 3 differennt storylines and in the process....He falls flat on his face. Some subplots are deeply boring. Others mildly interesting. But there is nothing here for which you would say...Hell , that was cool. The storyline is heavily inspired by the Star Wars series. Paoilini even tries to include songs ... in the manner of Lord of The Rings..Needless to say that he fails miserably. I didnt like the book one bit. I had to slog through it because I had spent money on it. If you are looking for an LOTR like experience then stay away from this book. Better read LOTR again.

With Eragon I liked, but Eldest falls sort of anything I liked for Eragon. And Eragon doesn't come close to any of the other novels I read such as: Elizabeth Haydon, J.R.R.Tolkien, George R.R. Martin, Kristen Britain, C. J. Cherryh, Anne McCaffrey, Mercedes Lackey, and Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman. I feel that all of these were shoved together to try to make an epic fantasy novel of dragonrider's. By the 20th page I immediately dropped the book in disgusts. This all seems so familar to me, and so boring. Of course, it's could be just me. But maybe Ill try it again when I have nothing else better to read.

However, most of the story was taken directly from Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. That is bad. I know that many books are similar in some way or another to the aforementioned, but Eragon and Eldest are the only books I have encountered that really really seem to have stolen from everywhere. Even some words from his made up languages are taken from Gaelic or Norse. Does he have any originality at all?

And he sucks!!!And there's Eragon and Arya, who fall in love. They resemble Aragorn and Arwen. Look at their names closely and you'll see that they are the same. Plus their character matches. In LOTR, Arwen is the daughter of the elf lord Elrond. Arya is the dughter of Queen Islandi. And both Eragon and Aragorn have long life.I read the whole thing and compared it to LOTR.

Not recommended ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Version has Errors!","review":"Please buy the newer version just called Talmud Jmmanuel. All the other versions have errors in them. This version is a bootleg of the original & is full of translation errors. The corrected version of the Talmud Jmmanuel has no 'of' in the title & is the fourth edition. just search Amazon forTalmud Jmmanuelor click the links in this review. The corrected fourth edition of theTalmud Jmmanuelhas undergone a three year review by national and international editors resulting in the most accurate German-to-English translation to date. The fourth edition also contains an addendum of new material from the prophets Jeremia and Elia who lived long before the time of Jmmanuel."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake verison","review":"The Talmud of Jmmanuel is an amazing book, but this verison is flawed, save your time.

I was interested in the Talmud of Jmmanuel because, I felt that there was much more to the story of Jesus and I always felt that there was something wrong with the story of Jesus because, many things seemed to be left out of the bible and maybe some added too. I read the background of the men that found this book and I felt that it was worth reading. Billy Edaurd Albert Meier story is a pretty good one too. Much of this information needs an open mind. I would keep an open mind, question everything, meditate on this and much of everything else that may come into question. I really love the fact that Judus is not a bad guy in this story, that it was someone with a similar name. I felt very happy after reading the Talmud of Jmmanuel. It is scripture, James Deardorff does scripture comparisons with the Talmud of Jmmanuel and Mathew scripture in the bible. You can see this on his website [...] or on YouTube [...]Have fun learning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining reference for intelligent drinking.","review":"A good reference book to have next to your home bar or wine cellar with brief but informative descriptions. Unfortunately the book is very euro-centric: hundreds of entries on French wines and British beers, for example, but no entries for Tequila, Mezcal or Caipirinha (at least in the 1996 Edition; the 1997 Edition may fare better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ghost story","review":"Thirteen year old Nick is raised by his uncle in a small New England town after his parents die in the 1918 flu epidemic. When people start claiming to have seen Nick in places he knows he wasn't, he knows something's wrong, and he soon discovers he has no reflection. A double of him is doing mischief around town and getting Nick into serious trouble--who is this other kid who looks so much like him, and what has happened to his reflection? A mystery/ghost story/and historical fiction rolled into one, this is a quick-moving story told in the first person by a likeable young narrator. The story also includes interesting details about the flu epidemic and small town life in that era.

I used app 16,000 nails on this job and consider this excellent. The handle on this nailer is taller than most nailers and more comfortable to use. The magazine holds 100 nails and is very quick to load.This is much faster to use than the other Porta nails manual nailer that I own. I will never go back to the manual version.One note this model is the updated 470A model and not the 470 as advertised. The 470A has a better mallet and the taller handle than the 470.This sank most nails perfectly and I only had the set a few with the punch. I used several boxes of the T nails and the L nails. I prefer the T nails as they were easier to set with the punch if you had one that did not fully seat. The L nails almost always bent over when set with the punch. I only had the set about 20 or 30 with the punch out of 16,000 and consider that acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid performer so far","review":"The original Portamatic clogged up after about a year of use.

Also one of the coasters had some type of black smudge on it that we had to clean off. I expected a better product for what I paid. I also don't like that there where only four coasters in this package I would have rather gotten more bulk but since I got nether bulk nor quality.I should make a note that I would not have bought these if they where not for a gift, now that I have received them I will not be purchasing anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a clear picture.","review":"I do not reccomend buying this do to the clarity of the picture.

He unflinchingly examines the effects on our lives and culture of Mexican immigration. Although his conservative viewpoint is clear he is fair in examining the vices and virtues of the immigrants, their employers and the institutions involved. It's interesting to compare Hanson's work to Thomas Frank's description of immigrant meatpackers in \\"What's The Matter With Kansas\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show Me the Sources","review":"I sympathize with the problems the author faces as a result of illegal immigration, but I found many of the chapters to be little more than a rant about those problems. I was also dismayed to see that sources for the statistics the author used were not included in a reference list. As a matter of fact, there was NO reference list of ANY kind. I would have liked to have known where his informaion was coming from."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding book on complicated subject","review":"Hanson knows more about the Mexican immigration dilemma in his little toe than all the windbag TV pundits combined. He's a farmer who has lived in the midst of the evolving California immigrant situation for the last four decades. The personal observation point from which Hanson works is at once no-nonsense, compassionate, and lucid. He writes terrific prose in the manner of William Langewiesche, graceful and immersed in finely-crafted physical impressions. Destined to be a definitive classic on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"The honest truth","review":"I wish the media and politicians would be this honest and frank.This is not a \\"trash the Mexicans\\" book.It's open and clear.

It was used and was guaranteed to be in \\"like-new\\" condition. I was amazed. It barely looked touched which is why I gave this purchase 2 stars. The condition was as promised. I am a college graduate and could barely understand this book. I needed a dictionary to read it and I still could not make sense of what the writer was saying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrutinizes the impact of massive illegal immigration","review":"Mexifornia: A State Of Becoming by Victor David Hanson scrutinizes the impact that massive illegal immigration from Mexico to California has had upon the state, its civil services, and its culture. Emphasizing the importance of making American citizenship a priority, sharply criticizing those who stymie discussion of the illegal immigration issue, and lauding the American traditions of assimilation, integration, and intermarriage, Mexifornia is a distinct wake-up call concerning a serious social issue and should be required reading for state and federal policy makers, as well as the immigration activist and the non-specialist general reader with an interest in immigration issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the statistical aspect?","review":"Although I find the diversity of opinons on every issue to be important, and in that way supported this book, I did dislike the fact that Hanson used supposed \\"proof\\" to support his theory in the form of numbers and data and yet mysteriously did not footnote any of it. I shall not in any way accuse him of making up this data, but I can't help but wonder: is his data coming from perhaps only a similarly like-minded source and not from official documents? Why else would he not have cited his sources? I can't help but feel that it is perhaps it is a bit too xenophobic towards a group of hard-working people without whom, I must say, the booming economy of California would not exist, at least not to this extent. I doubt that any reasonable middle-class citizen would prefer to pay $10 for a half pound of grapes than continue to open their doors (more or less, less really being the operative word here) to their friendly neighbors to the South."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mighty foolish stuff!","review":"There is one, and only one, reason that our borders were never really closed- and that is because we *could not* close them. We could not do it in the past, and we can't do it now. Pick your own reasons- they will all be good- but I think the single strongest one is that it was, and remains, politically impossible, and becomes only more impossible as the Hispanic vote share grows. What changed was that things did not use to be so much better in the US than in Mexico... but now the gap is so large that the flood of migration northward is on. As the gap closes- as Mexican economics improve, and our need for cheap labor declines- so will the migrant wave.So all Hanson's talk is for naught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expert?","review":"Is anyone else concerned that this professor is a professor of *Classics*? Shouldn't he be writing books about *Classical* Greece and the Roman Empire?Sure, it's eloquently written but the four \\"solutions\\" are not as \\"balanced\\" as the review suggests: if the U.S. is concerned about undocumented immigration and the benefits that corrupt Mexican officials get (such as preventing revolution or political upheaval), shouldn't the U.S. be putting pressure on the Mexican government to improve the humanitarian conditions or provide aid?One more rhetorical question: how much can you trust an author who has himself benefitted from migrant workers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"50's Nostalgia as the Solution for Today's Problems","review":"Hanson never lives up to the straight talk and objective examination of the immigration \\"problem\\" he sets out to analyze in Mexifornia. He goes to great lengths to tell the reader that he has many close friends and students that are of Mexican ancestry (even his daughters date Mexican Americans!). But this comes off as an insincere way of making his points seem objective. Rather than taking a fair and balanced look at immigration, Hanson combines personal anecdotes with unsubstantiated opinions about entire nations to explain a problem he fails to diagnose in the first place. You end the book with the feeling that Hanson preferred life in the 1950s, when Mexicans knew their place. He comes off sounding patronizing, elevating those Mexicans he believes are \\"good\\" and putting down just about everyone else. I would like to have read more examples of Hanson listening to those people he is writing about. I think he would be very surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, the racism in this book & these reviews is frightening!","review":"As a white Californian, I really feel for the Mexican immigrants who are up against the wall of racism as evidenced from this book and the sympathetic reviewers. NEVER underestimate the innate power of the \\"us versus them\\" reaction. Whew!Even for those who are racist though, on a purely pragmatic and even selfish level, we need to open the border with Mexico so that we can benefit from the influx of a young work force and thereby avoid the perils of the dropping birth rates in the First World (see Wattenberg's \\"Fewer\\" for details). Everyone will get richer simply from the influx, for as the lowest levels of the socioeconomic pyramid are filled by immigrants, the assets of those above automatically increase in value.But I'm sure I'm just whistling in the wind...so...WHY DONT YER JUST PACK THEM WETBACKS UP IN A BIG OLE BOX AN SHIP EM BACK TO WHAR THEY COME FROM DANG IT!There, did the majority of you readers like that better?Jeez!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mexiphobia","review":"Hanson's arguments in this book simply perpetuate stereotypes about Mexicans and contribute to racist ideologies that currently exist in the United States. I think a better title for his book would be Mexiphobia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mexifornia","review":"I had received several emails about this book from conservatives who indicated that it made a strong case for sending immigrants back to Mexico etc. I am for Comprehensive Immigration Reform and wanted to see what the big deal was. I was surprised that the book took a very humane position on the plight of immigrant workers. Only the last two or three pages of the book did he seem to present his alternative solutions. This may point out that there may be no real solutions to the problem, but that working together we might be able to improve our lot. He continually made the point that we need to be talking about the issue rather than taking hard line positions on both ends of the spectrum. I also believe that some things have changed since he wrote the book, including bilingual and emersion language studies for children (at least in Texas)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"This phone is a neat idea executed horribly. Generally a poor user interface. Very poor call quality - echo and static (even standing right next to the wireless router). Sound quality is abysmal, everything sounds tinny and flat.

The phone itself was not bad, however it would constantly loose our wireless signal and drop the call as well as signing out of skype. I would then have to reconnect to the network and call the person back. This was very annoying. Most of the time it would do this in 40 min intervals but sometimes it would do it more.

I wish there were some controls on the side of the phone to get into a memorized setting, or an indicator for voicemail. Wish the screen didn't smudge as much. Wish the battery laster longer. And last but certainly not least, I wish it had a cradle. That's a biggie. But it's cool and I've bragged about it to a few people, which hopefully enhances my reputation as cool phone guy.The keypad and display are nicely done.

The phone simply won't connect. I bought this for my parents so that they would have a simple, no-nonsense skype setup. Something that would be less complicated then using their computer to make phone calls. Well, back to the computer.

I had high hopes to use this product even the reviews were mixed. I tried this phone all over the world on different network configurations and different types of calls. The biggest problem with this device is the inconsistency with the call quality. Sometimes the phone will be perfect on a call and other times it will have echos, feedback, cuts, etc. I would claim to be a techie and solve most of the problems, and for whatever reason, its not the network (since my computer on Skype can have better call quality than the phone), but its the phone.I have to give this product a 1 star because I cannot rely on it at all.

Really annoying when I'm trying to sleep and it basically turns into an alarm clock, making the disconnect/connect noises over and over. It's also annoying when I get disconnected during a call because of it.There's nothing wrong with my home network.

Other thing i didn't like was the phone getting hot at the ear piece side after half an hour or more... i know that cell phone connected to adparter while talking get hot but this thing was getting hot without the wire connect, it is weird that it is getting hot for just being used and that was one major reason for my return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"I have had my phone for about a month now and am very happy. The configuration was easy and only took about 5 mins, the battery life is excellent, and the sync between adding, renaming, removing contacts from either the phone or computer is excellent. And most of all the sound quality is just like a cell phone it's next to perfect. This one item has saved me over two hundred dollars this month alone just form my wife talking to her mom on it verses the cell phone.

So most of my review is just for home use. I also don't know if there's a better phone out there. (I hope so)First this phone truly does not deliver.It:-has a short battery life-shuts down while you're on a call-resets on its own for no reason-shuts down while you have it plugged in, so everything rolls to voicemail-clock does not reflect daylight savings, it's always off-people from the other end hear echo-while my laptop shows very strong wifi connection, the phone shows two bars maxI still gave it some stars because I like the idea of a WiFi phone. But really, it makes me want to have landline phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable, looses power, looses memory","review":"This phone is a great idea but is very poorly executed... you can't login to networks where you need to confirm a key via the web...as it is the case with most hotels.Additionally the most recent firmware makes the phone very unstable, every 10 minutes in a call it just switches itself off and you can be lucky if it doesn't forget you network key...can be really annoying.I will try to return the phone even though I like the concept and the idea. The only way I will keep this phone is if Belkin comes up very soon with a new, more stable firmware."},{"rating":"1","title":"pity because its a good idea in concept","review":"I was pretty excited to see this product on arrival. I just wish I had the chance to test the product instore rather than taking the punt and believing the hype in the Belkin marketing speil!

After successfull upgrade the issue wasn't fixed and unfortunately it started to restart/freeze at least once per day.

Plug-n-play... not even close. Would not connect to my LinkSys router even with my settings as wide open as Lindsay Lohan. The user interface is clumsy and the tech support was a joke. When I started asking some tough questions about the device, the poor guy on the other line I think started to cry. Anyway, I bought the NetGear SPH200w and it worked right out of the box. Excellent job, nicely done. User interface was intuitive and setup was a piece of cake. I am an IT guy and I probably could've forced the Belkin device to work but that was not the point... the point was that Belkin represents this product as something my technophobiac parents could use and that is simply just not true. Again, get the NetGear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing experience","review":"I was very disappointed in the phone and the support is abysmal. I don't know why I should have to load a firmware update from 2007 on a new phone. The phone disconnected from my wi-fi every 10 to 15 minutes.

There is a 5 second delay between the call connecting on your end with the person on the other end. So, because of that many times the person on the other line will hang up. I tried two phones and called tech support. Was told by one rep that there would be a firmware upgrade to fix the known problem.

Not nearly as good as calling through the computer.. it drops calls all the time, even if you are standing next to the router. It also freezes all the time and has to be reset to work.

The phone appeared to have connected to Skype just fine.However, about half the time, if someone would call my Skype-In number, the phone just wouldn't ring and their call would go straight to voice mail.

I'm taking it back and just getting a standard chordless VOIP phone and use it just at home.I will say that I got almost 1/2 a mile away from my house and the phone was still connected and working, but that might be more a testament to my wireless router than the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, very poor implementation","review":"I purchased this to replace a vonage phone, which despite working well was just too expensive for a Voip phone. The idea of a wifi phone is great, however the belkin implementation falls down on:- very very poor voice quality on anything but a perfect high speed link (awful compared to vonage or skype on a PC on the same link)- very short battery life (though at least it is USB chargeable)- No skype messaging support (not even receive)- No software updates for 18 months to fix the above (appears to be a dead product)In addition the user interface is pretty clunky. I would stay away from this product and use one of the cordless products instead - they work much better.

When I made phone calls, the other side can hear their echoes, and the voice quality is bad. The earphone jack doesn't work.

I think Amazon should not sell this kind of product to ruin its reputation. I would say, if you want to talk on skype, just buy $10 wire headset and enjoy your conversation.

There was no effort made to remaster the material for CD, and worse, no effort to even out the levels between songs. The tracks are from different sources (of course), but they SOUND like it.

I was listening to the disc in my car and it really did sound like a poor homemade audio cassette of an LP! That said, the tracks are really strong. One thing that really jumped out at me is how heavily influenced by Cale that Mark Knopfler must be, particularly with regard to lead guitar style.I'd recommend seeking out a better-sourced album than this collection, but musically it's well worth seeking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"------------------------------- --------------------------","review":"Let me start of by saying I am a big Dead Milkmen fan.

It says nothing of the at least 17 million Soviet civilians murdered or starved to death by the Germans. It is not accurate either. It is offensive and some would think Seaton is a Nazi apologist. When he describes Russian atrocities, he fails to say that there was no official policy of the killing of the Germans. Many Soviet commanders often had their soldiers court martialed or executed when the commanders visited the front. The Soviets rightfully felt hatred for these Nazis who started this war in the first place. During the Cold War, this book must be highly acclaimed by us. I also guess if this book is on sale in Germany (which it probably is) it is highly popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Every historical novel needs to be at least semi-objective, and this one doesn't even come close!! People talk about communist countries and their repression of free speach, those books have more of a perspective that this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and misleading","review":"I agree with the other reviewers about the extraordinary detail of the book. However, I could not get past the author's complete bypassing of nazi atrocities during the Russian campaign. He has no hesitation in chronicling the atrocities of the red army during their thrust towards Berlin. Along with this are numerous disparaging remarks about the quality, both moral and physical, of the Russian soldier, while the German troops are described in glowing terms. I got the distinct impression that the author had an admiration for the German war machine which draws him dangerously close to being a nazi apologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely biased","review":"This book is horribly biased against Russian side. If you believe what the author wanted to say, Russian won the war just because of the aids from United States! Russian soldiers were always stupid, druken, and German soldiers were brave, smart, skilled. Also it metioned little of the atrocity and mass murder by German army and SS in occupied Russia, while wrote a lot about the same thing Russian amy did on German soil. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russo German War, 1941-45","review":"Very well written book that goes into great details about the strategies of the war on the Eastern Front. The author does a very good job of detailing what both sides were doing and the reasoning behind their strategies. Found it an excellent read for anyone interested in that part of World War II history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Loved it! 4.5 stars at least. Infamous mother directs unannounced rake to the bedroom of her unattached daughter. She and others catch him half undressed leaning over the bed. Amanda, the daughter, and Lord North, the libertine, don't want to be forced into marriage. He plans never to wed and she wants another man. They come up with a pretend engagement. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Bebo???","review":"no offense but this is the worst album by bebo to date. his first 2 cds were incredible lyrically and musically, and since then he has just gone downhill, I dont know what happened but i miss the old bebo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Atmosphere","review":"This is a great album that captures a late night atmosphere in a small town, as only John can do. This is slightly different than his later works, but it's cool to hear John use piano and do some mellow songs, as these became less common later on. This is pretty raw, but it sounds great. I would highly recomend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still getting warmed up","review":"Don't expect any great John Mellencamp songs like \\"Small Town\\" or even \\"Pink Houses\\" on this album. Recorded back when he was still John Cougar, this album, like many of his early albums, proved he still had a lot of growin' up to do. In fact, except for the excellent single \\"Ain't Even Done With the Night,\\" in which he starts to show his songwriting abilities, there is little on this album to recommend. Stick to later period Mellencamp instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music to great lyrics","review":"Like Schubert and Schumann, Ives chose to set the words of fine poets to music -- music of real distinction. Fischer-Dieskau recorded an lp of Ives' songs years ago, but I don't think DG has reissued it. Meanwhile, this is an excellent collection of very approachable Ives. Fischer-Dieskau or not, I wouldn't be without this cd. DeGaetani-Kalish are unbeatable in this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie runs away with all 5 stars!!!","review":"Pierce Brosnan so far is a great James Bond! The stunts in this movie were terrific! I think the new 007 movies with Brosnan are better than the older ones with Sean Connery-Brosnan has far better weapons and stunts that Connery used. If your not already a 007 fan-you will be once you watch this movie!!! 5 stars all the way!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See Movie for a Bond Fanatic","review":"Tomorrow Never Dies was a very well done movie and great adition to the Bond collection. I've had people tell me that they didn't like it because it isn't the way it used to be . Then I pointed out to them that it is a very good Bond movie, because the older Bond movies were always about being ahead of Technology, and James Bond saving the world. Well in this movie all of that and more happens. We see the new up-to-date James Bond. Also this limited edition DVD has many great extra features, which makes watching the movie even better. If you're debating whether or not to spend the movie for this movie, it is definetly a movie that you should highly consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good job, but not as good as Goldeneye","review":"This film is one of the best Bond films ever made. There was a lot of action but Goldeneye had that bit more.Pierce Brosnan is an excellent actor and portrays Bond's personality exactly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sound and excitement!","review":"Fast-paced with a good storyline. Brosnan does a credible job as Bond. But, the real story is in the audio and visual effects. They are big! -- If you have surround sound and a good subwoofer, make sure you have you seat belt fastened 10 minutes into the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear, What Happened Here?","review":"After proving that there was life after Dalton with the credible \\"GOLDENEYE\\", the follow up film falls somewhat short, as a stunt training video, its a masterpiece, but with only the videocover to remind you it is indeed a story, it is disappionting. The Evil press baron is more Ian Hislop than Robert Maxwell and Teri Hatcher looks decidedly pregnant a times (at the time of filming she was indeed). Pierce Brosnan tries to be more Roger Moore than Roger Moore, and fails. However, they all redeemed themselves with \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which is in a different class alltogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even DVD doesn't help this Bond film.","review":"This was perhaps one of the worst Bond movies ever! A dry plot, uninteresting Bond girls, and a silly villain, make this movie down right boring. There were perhaps two action scenes that were a little exciting, but that is it! Although, one good quality this movie has is the intro. Sheryl Crow and that computer animation were a perfect match!!! It is TREMENDOUS on DVD!!! I also commend MGM for producing DVD's the RIGHT WAY. That is using hard plastic cases, both formats of the movie (widescreen and standard) on one side of the disc, and a nice display menu. Too often you find DVD only with the widescreen or in those cardboard snap cases, which I HATE!!! Thank you MGM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brosnan's 2nd and best Bond","review":"Now that all 3 of his Bond flicks have been released, I have to say that TOMORROW NEVER DIES is the best of Pierce Brosnan's 3 007 outings. The basic plot may be quite formulaic(it is little more than a remake of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME)but the film itself is very well presented. Roger Spottiswood provides slick direction and David Arnold's music score proves him the series best composer since John Barry. I also liked the romantic subplot involving Bond and his ex-flame(who just happens to be the villain's wife) Paris, well played by Teri Hatcher. Miss Hatcher sadly isn't given enough screen time but at least she has the honor of being one of the 3 Bond girls that the cinematic 007 was ever in love with(Tracy from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and Kara from THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS being the other 2). While definitely a triumph of style over substance, TOMORROW NEVER DIES more than delivers the goods as 2 hours of diverting, escapist entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit tedious","review":"The final half hour is an overwrought shoot out aboard a stealth craft that is too long by 25 minutes. Nothing happens except a lot of fake bullets fly endlessly. Otherwise, the plot, thinly disguised as a spoof on Rupert Murdoch, involves the usual megalomaniac -in this case, a media mogul - bent on creating world havoc for his own gain. Brosnan is cool in the early going, and the opener, involving an arms bazaar and a nuclear bomb carrying jet fighter is great, as usual with Bond films. The story line overall is just so-so. The title track by Sheryl Crowe is one of the better Bonds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as there is Michelle Yeoh","review":"This show is another typical Bond shows where you will get to see cool gadgets. However, different this time is the Bond girl. An Asian bond girl that kick...Michelle Yeoh really adds colours to this show. Overall, quite a nice and exciting show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For action buffs, but no plot.","review":"Tomorrow Never Dies was quite the Bond film. It was filled with action and plenty of passion, of course. Jonathan Pryce plays a great villian, Elliot Carver, but Mr. Stamper, Carver's right hand man, is the movie's best villian.Brosnan turns in another stellar performance as Bond, and this movie brought to the table something never before seen in any Bond film. A beautiful woman who also knows how to fight. Don't get me wrong, the women in past Bond films were gorgeous, but they pretty much just followed bond around and did little to help him, in this movie, Wai Lin knew how to fight, and she was a tremendous asset to Bond's attempt to foil Carver's plan.This movie does err in one respect, however. It does not have near the plot that GoldenEye, its predecessor, did. TND is much more of a shoot em up movie, while Goldeneye made you think a little bit. This is the only reason I gave TND four stars instead of five. My advice, rent it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bond","review":"Traumatised by my ghasty experience of watching 'Casino Roayle', I decided to cheer myself up by watching a really good Bond movie. I never really cared that much for Pierce Brosnan by comparison with my favourite Bond, Roger Moore, but compared with the dreary nonentity in 'Casino Royale' Brosnan is a prince among men.This film has everything you want in a Bond movie. Among the many pleasures of this film is an outstanding performance by Jonathan Pryce, clearly enjoying himself hugely playing the mad villain, media mogul Elliot Carver (who bears a striking resemblance to Rupert Murdoch, quite coincidental I am sure). There is lots of humour, plenty of amazing gadgets, a most satisfyingly tough heroine who can do amazing karate kicks, and the most thrilling chase ever in a Bond movie, with Bond and the fesity heroine handcuffed together on a motor bike, tearing through crowded city streets, over rooftops etc, fantastic.They don't, alas, make Bond movies like this any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the DVD version for full effect","review":"The best thing about this movie was Michelle Yeoh's character. Not only was she a babe (an obvious requirement for a Bond girl,) she was also capable of holding her own. Unlike Natalya in \\"GoldenEye,\\" Wai Lin could do damage alone and didn't have to be shepherded around by Bond. There was also more of an edge to Bond in this edition (the scene where he kills Dr. Kaufmann is the prime example,) harkening back to the Bond of the Ian Fleming novels. The theme song by Sheryl Crow was very good also. A note to anyone working at MGM/UA who may happen to see this review: Bring back Wai Lin in a future Bond movie! She is the most capable \\"sidekick\\" since Felix Leiter, and much better looking;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Bond Movies","review":"Tomorrow Never Dies is one of the best Bond movies. Though I've enjoyed the later Bond movies starring Daniel Craig, I still think Pierce Brosnan was the better Bond, James Bond. Craig never seems like he's having any fun. Brosnan has the ability to show Bond enjoying himself, while still bringing a more realistic performance to a very non-realistic film genre. When Bond crashes down onto the Millennium Dome, Brosnan makes you feel Bond's pain (even if it is much less pain than a normal person would feel.) Bond teams up with Michelle Yeoh, as a Chinese secret agent, and provides an equal match for our hero. I would have loved to have seen more with that team. Jonathan Pryce is also entertaining as the main villain. His secret power is the ability to type with one hand. That's one ability I'd like to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite Bonds. Between Peirce Brosnans acting ant the storyline it is great. Some have said that it is a remake of You Only Liv Twice and The Spy Who Loved Me, but it is also different and quite memorable. The may have the same overarching plot, but the specifics are very different and every one of them is memorable for different reasons. I like the change from a villain who tries to blow up the world with a Nuke or whatever. This is a new kind of villain that is more for the 21st century. This is my favorite Brosnan Bond and is up there in my favorites of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Villian","review":"A super villian want to start a war between China and Great Britain, and the reason why is because he wants a media foothold in China? This is the worst plot for a Bond Film hands down. Trying to give Bond an equal female partner is getting old. Doesen't anyone remember Anya Amasova from The Spy who Loved Me. The only good part about this film is Pierce Brosnan. However he can't save this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the classics","review":"Lot of action in this one with very little thought going into the storyline. Not near as good as the earlier ones, this one falls flat on its face, gets a big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok movie, i guess?","review":"Ok, i like Bond movies but this one stinks I fell asleep about an 45 minutes through. Has its moments but it isn't worth buying. Spend your money on real action, like, I don't Know, TERMINATOR!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hope Tomorrow Really Isn't This Bad.","review":"Holy Moly this is a bad movie. The plot was not very interesting or even feasible. The Bond girls were horrible. If only Terry Hatcher's chest was as big as her ego, this matched might have worked. What was up with Michelle Yeoh? She's got to be the most unsexy bond girl ever. I take that back, Grace Jones (A VIEW TO A KILL), was the worst. I was hoping that TND would live up to GOLDENEYE, but I was sadly disappointed. Good Lord! Did they give him enough campy one liners? In the Bond films, you always accept a few, but this was ridiculous. The bright spots in the movie, and oh were there very few, were the decent at best car chase scene and the motorcycle scene. I hope for the Bond movies sake, that newcomers do not view this one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I would have to say this is the worst Bond Movie there is. This is not the James Bond Ian Fleming introduced some years ago. The Movie is to dark and sinster. They need to go back to the James Bond Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton portrayed. Once again I will ask the question- What Happend!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Plot","review":"All this was a explosion fiasco. It was a real disappointment. All they were trying to do was make money off of the Goldeneye, now that it is the best Bond, film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe this is a great movie!","review":"This movie is great but I believe it lacks one major potential to be one of the best Bond films. It doesn't have a good story line. It's about a mad media titan that is trying to take over the world with his media network. It is unrealistic, I think. Who would try to do this. With his power he could of found another way to take over the world. I just wanted to bring this up. Don't get me wrong, I love the movie but I believe a better story line could have been created. That is why I gave Tomorrow Never Dies a 4 star rating. I am only eleven but I thought this was a good point."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" will leave you breathless.","review":"Pierce Brosnan returns as 007 in the awesome \\"Tomorrow Never Dies.\\" There is some insane action, and it is relentless. A thrilling car chase in an auto garage, Bond and Bond girl Wai Lin's heart-stopping mid-air escape down the side of a scyscraper, and a wild helicopter-motorcycle chase across the rooftops of Saigon are among the finest action sequences ever filmed. The memorable title song is performed admirably by sexy Sheryl Crow, though one wishes the song didn't have to be cut for the titles sequence. Michelle Yeoh is a lethal Bond girl, the first to be truly an equal. Jonathan Pryce(the guy from the car commercials) is an excellent villain as Elliot Carver, and Gotz Otto convincingly portrays his masochistic henchman, Stamper. While he is not in Connery's class(who is?), Brosnan has what it takes to play Bond. Perhaps more than any other actor to take up the role, Pierce Brosnan LOOKS like Bond. Make no mistake, this movie is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great action but empty","review":"This film takes 007 and turns him into just another action hero after one of those shady billionaire villains. The lagging plot is saved by some incredible stunt work, but the characters have been \\"updated\\" so badly are hardly recognizable. Joe Don Baker is terrible in his two scenes playing the obnoxious American the British love to hate, and Dench's coquettish smiles at Bond's behavior border on silly. Bring back Connery and Moore...heck, even Lazenby and Dalton!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not the best Bond movie.","review":"This movie was very good in many ways. There was a great variety of gadgets, weapons, and villains. The car scene was also excellent. Although this Bond may have been good, it just doesn't seem to hit the spot. The Bond Girls weren't so great and the villain was very so-so. The plot was up to speed with the franchise and it is chocked full of Bond goodness, but something just struck me as awkward about this installment that I can't quite put my finger on. Nevertheless, the movie is good, and so is the DVD. Great picture and sound on this DVD with some very enticing Special Features. This movie is ideal for the Bond fan, but if you're looking for an introduction to the series or maybe to the new 90's Bonds, I suggest Goldeneye."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the smarter schemes to appear in a Bond film","review":"I love it for the fact the plot makes sense and is actually ingenious, Jonathan Pryce manipulating the media to start WWIII. To be honest, I always prefered the quiet wimpy villains to the macho \\"he-man\\" terrorist ones. While, overall, not one of the best, it's still great and fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"007 returns to the big screen armed and ready.","review":"\\"My name is Bond, James Bond\\". Pierce Brosnan delivers that most famous line without hesitation. He grew up watching Sean Connery play the spy and now it is his turn to be Bond. Brosnan had a chance to play 007, but couldn't because of prior engagements, so they handed the role to Timothy Dalton. Pierce Brosnan takes the reigns from Dalton and takes the drivers seat in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\". I felt in \\"GoldenEye\\", Brosnan wasn't real comfortable playing the character, but now he is ready and does it without even thinking about it. James Bond jumps into action right where he left off in \\"GoldenEye\\". \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" is a great movie and I feel you will enjoy as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short","review":"This Bond Movie wasn't as good as the Connery one's or even the Dalton Yes I liked him.

If you like you action fast and loud by this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD was blank","review":"The DVD won't play in any machine at all. My computer says the DVD is blank. It did arrive on time and the price was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly embarrassing Bond entry.","review":"\\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" is the absolute lowpoint of the Bond series. A moronic \\"plot,\\" half-baked action sequences and characters that serve no purpose, this is vastly worse than even \\"A View to a Kill,\\" \\"Moonraker\\" or \\"Man With the Golden Gun.\\" This film should never have been made. Brosnan is the weakest of the Bonds, and his entire point in making these movies seems to be having an opportunity to strike poses for two hours. The sets and direction of this movie make it seem like it isn't even taking place on Earth; there should be at least SOME semblence of reality, even in a James Bond movie. However, there is none here. A waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of if not THE Worst Bond Movie of all Time","review":"Although I haven't seen every Bond movie, I've seen most of them, and so call myself a Bond fan. Now I hear \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" is the worst Bond film, but I havent seen it, so I will bestow the honor on this film \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\". The title itself is terrible, makes no sense, and forbodes bad things to come.You wouldn't think this is so bad by all the cool gadgets and chases, but the underlying plot, normally thrilling in other Bond films, remains utterly lacking in this one. Terri Hatcher is hot, but boring, and Bond's nemimis in this one is weird and unimaginative (he's a media mogul, ooo scary... what ever happened to SPECTRE?). It's hard to explain why this movie [is bad], it just does, and that's coming from a huge Bond fan. But don't take it from me, take it from Moby (who did do a cool rendition of the Bond theme for the film) who called it the biggest peice of (expletive) he'd ever seen. It's just that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even my cat would have more presence playing Bond...","review":"Pierce Brosnan returns for a second stint as James Bond and while his performance is clearly superior to the one he gave in Goldeneye, he still has a long way to go before he can be taken seriously as this character. The problem is, in a word, presence. Brosnan has hardly any screen presence and this makes for a highly forgettable and boring Bond. As I stated in my review of Goldeneye, Brosnan needs to lighten up a touch and not play the role as seriously. Perhaps even a little Remington would help. While TMD has loads of action and intrigue, the film is rather boring as a result of Brosnan's lackadaisical performance. Where are you Rog? We need you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Today, Bond DIES!","review":"This struck me as a complete waste of many months work of filmmaking! The film was uninnovative, boring, and the villain, Elliot Carver (Price), was a real disappointment. Many viewers liked the fact that the Chinese secret agent in this movie matched 007 move for move, but I thought it was a complete insult to the 007 character and took away alot of the incredibility I feel when I see 007 make his unbelievable escapes!

TND was an awsome action movie with more action scenes packed into it than I've seen in many Bond movies. The one thing that upset me and why I didn't give it 5 stars was because it felt more like a typical 90's action movie rather than a sauve and sexy Bond movie. It just felt like it was missing a tiny bit of the bond recipe, like a dash of pepper or lemon or something like that. I loved Michelle Yeoh, she is the best Bond girl I've scene yet. Fits in perfect at a party or a shoot out. Totally capaple of living on her own but wouldn't mind a rough British (Not to mention sexy) British agent following her around. Awsome Movie!

Michelle Yoah (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)does a great job as she fights, claws and kicks her way out of every scenario to fight the world against a media meglomaniac played by Jonathan Pryce.Huh? What's that? You mean this is a JAMES Bond movie? But I thought the purpose of a JAMES Bond movie was for JAMES Bond to save the world. Funny - it seems here that Ms. Yoah can handle the situation quite well. It looks like that JAMES Bond character gets in the way. My bad.I'm all for great, kick-butting female characters like Lora Croft & Alias, etc. So I think they make a sequel to this movie with the Michelle Yoah character, who completely takes over the movie. But I thought this was a JAMES Bond movie. Silly me.As a new debut for a female JANE Bond, this movie gets 4 stars.As a JAMES Bond flick, it's useless.Goldeneye was 100 times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the girls weren't hot","review":"Firstly, allow me to say that I love the video game. That being established, I can go on to write the rest of this review. Granted, I'm probably not the most qualified person to be writing this as I actually fell asleep in the theatre . . . even with THX. I actually find histology more engaging than I found this movie, which is pretty amazing considering how damn boring histology is. The funny thing is that when I woke up, realizing the inappropriatness of drooling in a public place, I hadn't missed a thing. In a nutshell, James Bond has a buch of gadgets, he blows stuff up, drinks some martinis, has some sex and then saves the day. Actually, even the sex was bad. How can anyone do a sex scene without nudity? I mean without nudity, all you've really got is weird sounds. If this review helps one person to not watch this movie, I will feel satisfied.

Goldeneye and The World Is Not Enough are classic Bond flicks and would be perfectly suited to DVDs capabilities, but Tomorrow Never Dies is just an average, mindless action adventure with a ludicrous storyline that Mike Myers could use for Austin Powers Three (stolen nuclear missiles sound at all familiar?).The stunts and effects in this film are, admittedly very impressive, and are therefore worth checking out on DVD, but there's no need for a special edition, just buy the cheaper normal edition, unless you are dying to know how on earth they drove that car without a driver. Which I am not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Although Pierce Brosnan rocks, the movie does nothing for him. What happened to plots? Acting? Good dialogue? I suppose it is all a thing of the past. But in all fairness, I didn't epect \\"Tomorrow. . .\\" to be the second \\"Casblanca\\", they could of tried a bit harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate advertising machine","review":"The movie was an excellent commercial for BMW. True, there were a few action scenes and explosions between the shots of racing beemer cars and bikes. But they were a bit distracting. It would have been better to just show the 740i and the motorcycle without any of that fluff. The car is beautiful and the bike is awesome. As far as Bond movies go, the girls were..... okay and Pierce Brosnan is pretty good but he was better in Goldeneye which is a better movie anyway (Beemer gets the Z3 advertised in that one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond movie of them all.","review":"I don't want to trash Brosnan; in many ways he's the ultimate Bond(though some 10 years too late), but this film is without a doubt the worst 007 movie in history. Nothing against the cast; they do what they can, but the thing that I never thought could take place in a Bond movie, happens here endlessly. -Boredom!. It began with \\"Goldeneye\\", and it's gotten worse. James Bond movies have started to look like a big-scale Dolph Lundgren action-flick, or something. Where's the imagination of the Moore-era !?. Where are the interesting characters ?. Where's the good story ?. They've become just another big-budget \\"blow 'em up\\"-actioner. Boring!. They're too serious, too dark, running from one desperate explotion to the next, lacking any kind of humour or memorable scenes. It's the end of 007, I'm afraid. You may resign now, \\"Mr.Bore\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brosnan is the best","review":"I have always liked Brosnan's Bond films the best because they always have plenty of action through out and the graphics are very good. This movie is definitely pro BMW. A very impressive BMW car and a BMW motorcycle later on. To bad that the motorcycle was not outfitted with Q's gadgets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I think it's just a such a GREAT book...IT's one of those books that brings me in the story,takes me to a long adventourous journey.

The popish songs on this album make it worth buying mostly because easy listening stations will play more songs from this album than any other Moody album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get old","review":"When this album first came out, some people thought it was too far from the Moodies' regular fare to be any good. Fortunately I adore the quirky humor and simple beauty, and this album seriously rivals To Our Children's Children's Children as my favorite album. If you've ever heard The Voice, you understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let them take you back to school!","review":"This Cd by the Moody Blues evokes such a great period in music history that it's hard not to give it 5 stars just on nostolgia alone. But the simple fact of the manner is that on Long Distance Voyager, the Moodys earn each star! They had radio hits like Voice, Gemini Dream, and Talking out of Turn. But the cuts you didn't hear on FM radio in 1980 such as the incredibly beautiful IN MY World, and Meanwhile were just as good or better than the hits! The Cd closes out on the then popular English concept album cuts such as Painted Smile and Veteran Cosmic Rocker! Just wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thirty years on, still enjoyable","review":"One of my favorite albums from the early eighties! Somehow, I hadn't listened to this album - which I hope I still own on vinyl, somewhere - for at least twenty years, so I was only to eager to add this very nicely cheap CD to my holiday wish list... Wonderful piece of work, uplifting sound, still a very good listen today. Very much an ELO-type of sound in parts (especially on Gemini Dream, as has been noted elsewhere). If you are a fan of ELO, ELP, Yes, or similar bands... do yourself a favor: Add this to your collection. It's a goodie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Moody Blues - \\"Long Distance Voyager\\"","review":"There are better records of the band, but this is a good album (not excellent). The songs \\"The Voice\\", \\"Nervous\\", \\"In My World\\" and \\"Talking Out Of Turn\\" are the best. This last mentioned is wonderful. Perhaps the only bad track is the third (\\"Gemini Dream\\"). The disc is marked by the band's sound smooth and pleasant, joining even a little pop style of the time. The remastered version was well done and worth it for fans of the band and even for those who do not know. It's a sound easy to be accepted. Very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great model","review":"After purchasing the USS New Jersey and the Independence, it followed that a 9 yr old boy would want the Missouri as well.

It contains simple, easy to understand and follow intructions for students and many, many practice problems to choose from.

That being said, his speech [transcribed in this text] is a strong motivation to all of us who seek to know the God of Scripture. Warfield doesn't seek to run to the extreme of the pragmatist, nor does he seek to uphold the view of the separatist. What he communicates is a balanced view that in order to show ourselves as approved workman, we must engage God with our minds, our hearts, our hands, and out spirits.Personally, he's set upon me to question why my heart would grow cold in my seeking of Christ. Further, the challenge is there to devote myself to what might be called the \\"rigors\\" of the religious life and to seek the joy of the privilege it is to know and be known by God. This is an obviously short text, but it is well worth beyond its weight on the shelf of your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than no mouse","review":"I will be replacing this new mouse asap.

It especially shows on this set, a recording made when Richards was in the midst of a serious herion addiction, and when Ronnie Wood was a major league boozer.Jagger mumbles most of the lyrics. There are no background vocals. Keith was probably too stoned to remember the words to the songs.Keep your money and buy the studio recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Anyway","review":"Although this two cd set is nowhere near as good as \\"Get Yer Ya Yas Out,\\" I won't badmouth it. It's still the Stones. The songs seem a little rushed on this one.Jagger is the ultimate showman,and the Stones play a large set to please their fans.The El Mocambo tunes are a nice contrast to the arena favorites.I've seen them 4 times from L.A. to Fl. and the \\"Love You Live\\" set is in my collection to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great live album","review":"Love you live is one of the best live albums from the Stones after Get your ya ya's out.This is a fantastic live album recorded from their concert in Paris.The band was in fine form and features some excellent renditions of their hits.This album is very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three sides good, one side incredible","review":"Not as dynamic as Yas Yas, for sure, but all songs are performed dynamically and with typical Stones energy. What has always struck me as weird and extraordinary is side three (originally on the vinyl and still mixed before the main show's conclusion here), the absolutely fabulous club set at El Mocambo, the Stones away from spectacle and on a small stage, doing blues/reggae and being sweaty and intimate. These four tracks, tantalizing and far too short, represent the real Rolling Stones. Had the entire album comprised the club set, it would rate, what, SIX stars! Then again, without those precious few songs, maybe three. You will treasure those special songs and play them far more than you will the rest of the album. As you will imagine Margaret Trudeau, reportedly in attendance, sitting at a corner table in the dark, getting off on the down-in-the-basement band that rarely appears but knocks these blues out of the park here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Place In Time Album","review":"Maybe Scott Reed should think before he speaks. Granted this album doesn't shine but consider the time period. The drugs were extremely heavy at this point and let's face it, Keith wasn't there. However, to make the statement that The Stones stink live is ignorant. Have you seen them live Mr Reed? Their playing today is crisp and better than it has been in years. Maybe you should comment on a band that you like, or go see The Stones whenver they come by again. If you are a true fan, get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 4th Live Album","review":"Love You Live was originally released Sep 23, 1977. It was recorded at Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto (6-17-75), Earl's Court, London (5-21/26-76), Les Abattoirs, Paris (6-5/7-76), and the El Mocambo Club, Toronto (3-4/5-76).Interesting notes include:.....The cover is by Andy Warhol.....photos of the Stones biting each other.....Margaret Trudeau, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Piere Trudeau, was present at the Toronto shows and made international headlines when she was accused of partying with the Stones, which was especially scandalous since Keith had been arrested for heroin trafficking on Feb 27th after he arrived in town for the El Mocambo Club shows.This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels like they played at the local bar......which is great!","review":"This is not your typical recording of today's rock artists live material. The Rolling Stones, presently, are changing up their setlist's on alot of their shows daily. This is what they have done with Love You Live. I am a big fan of the Stone's, but do tire of songs such as \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" (although included in this CD) that is played for commercial success. The songs are great, but don't you like the Stones to play say, \\"Mannish Boy\\" and \\"Star Star\\" once in a while. This recording is raw and very \\"bluesy\\". Even the Stone's own songs have a blues feel to them. I enjoy this album because of the song structures and where the Stone's were going with this live recording. 5 stars all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite album","review":"\\"Love You Live\\" epitomizes the Rolling Stones at their loose and sloppy best. The El Macombo (sp?) side is my fave, with covers of \\"Mannish Boy,\\" \\"Crackin' Up,\\" \\"Little Red Rooster,\\" and a rousing version of Chuck Berry's \\"Round and Round.\\" I've read several comments about poor sound quality and I disagree. It sounds like what a live show is supposed to sound like. Listen to the audience comments between \\"Mannish Boy\\" and \\"Crackin' Up.\\" It's awesome! Mick giggles mid-way thru \\"Round and Round\\" when Ronnie or Keef inadvertently strikes a chord. Excellent versions of \\"Star Star,\\" \\"Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" \\"You Gotta Move,\\" \\"Brown Sugar,\\" and \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" make this my all-time favorite by anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sand is cheaper!","review":"Buy a few bags of sand put them in the back of your rig and tie them down right. you can use the sand as a traction device when you get stuck by emptying them onto the ice underneath your tires....this product is something that would get laughed at out here in Idaho."},{"rating":"2","title":"ShurTrax","review":"Can't beat the Amazon price!

When the CD is played in my car I have to turn the volume all the way up because it it muffled, almost as if listening from another room.The bad recording quality makes it difficult to get a true appraisal of the vocalists or the instrumentals. I will say that I LOVE the music from this show, so when I saw this CD in a bargain bin, I snatched it up. It looks like I am going to have to spend the money to get a \\"real\\" copy of the musical so that I can sing along.I can vouch for the quality of the Bette Middler version, although she's not my favorite singer, she does a fantastic job as Mamma Rose, and the recording quality is much better.

It is everyone's duty who lives in the US (and those who don't) to read this text, as well as his other works. It should be in every home. It expresses the selfishness of the world that we live in and exposes how cruel and ignorant we can be.

With remarkable deftness and detail, Kozol presents the sad state of America's schools. While the book is now over a decade old, one would never know it after reading the book. While the example towards the end of the book get a bit repetitive, Kozol shows that North, South, East, and West, all over this country school children are not being given a fair chance to succeed because of the inadequate funding structure of American schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"If more people read this book, our country would be a much different and better place. We must educate all of our children. This becomes more important everyday as we move further into the knolwedge based economy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly misleading","review":"The basic theory of this book is that America's poor urban schools are scandalously underfunded. And if the only thing I knew about this subject was the heart rending examples he digs up, I would believe it.But Kozol's examples are only a small slice of American reality. For every urban school system outspent by its suburban peers, there is another that does not. The most extreme example is the Kansas City, Missouri system which due to a school desegregation order spends twice as much per pupil as any other Missouri school, with results that have not significantly improved since the spending spree began. And nationally, the average urban school spends about as much per pupil as other schools. Because Kozol mostly ignores these facts, his selective description of the most underfunded schools is misleading.A good book could be written about American urban schools, but this ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you spot the logical fallacies?","review":"Kozol has done it again! While the book is very descriptive of the poor conditions in many inner-city schools, Mr. Kozol's thesis--that more government money should be put into education--is not borne by the facts. He presents arguments that are unthoughtful, unacademic, and unsupported. He has a very hysterical knee-jerk response to anyone who is supportive of a free-market approach to education.For those who are fans of Kozol and believe that my review may be too extreme, I refer you to the book \\"Children of the Revolution\\", also by Mr. Kozol. The book is little more than an apologia for Fidel Castro's dictatorship, a society with a conception of human rights that would not pass muster in a tribe of Barbary Apes (to borrow P.J. O'Rourke's wholly appropriate phrase.) Is this the sort of society that YOU want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm outraged!!!","review":"Jonathan Kozol has written a stinging and well deservedcritique of the American education system.

Though it is well written, the content becomes repetitive after awhile. After you read it, you tend to feel that if you ever hear another statistic about the quality of America's schools, you will vomit. This was my first experience of a book by Kozol, and I must say that it turned me off from any other book by him. I simply found this one to be completely boring. He goes to a school, interviews a few people, leaves, and writes about 20 pages worth of statistics. Completely boring. Nobody ever remembers statistics, they remember the story...so if he could have organized the book in a different way it would have been more interesting for the reader, and thus opening their eyes to the world that america's children have to face through education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even as a resident, there are some things I never knew about","review":"In the rapidly changing face of New York City fast becoming another strip mall full of chain shops and uniformity, it is refreshing to note that yes, real New York still exists--those unappreciated, and undervalued landmarks, shops, and restaurants that truly define NYC.

For me the best tracks and the first and the last. The theme from Moya Brennan is wonderfull and her voice angelic. I have the two cds from her and her voice always seems with a little bit loss of harmony in comparison with Enya, but in this song and in her contributions to other tracks, her voice is suberb and very peacefull and with harmony in the slowest moments of the movie.

Hans Zimmer provided the sound and, while it likely would have spooked the early Britons right out of their jerkins and trews, fits the pulse-pounding action of the movie to a T.While borrowing the lovely voice of Clannad's Moya Brennan for one track on the album, the opener \\"Tell Me Now (What You See),\\" the soundtrack relies far more on clarion brass and heavily percussive orchestration, blasting along with each hoof beat and sword stroke. Choral elements add a timeless feel; the score is both martial and primal, striding across the landscape like a legend.by Tom Knapp, Rambles editor"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Soundtracks I have heard","review":"I have to say, I am somewhat obsessed with this soundtrack. Never have I listed to an album over and over to the extent that I have with this one. I think it is brilliant, from the melodic opening track, right to the end, with \\"Woad To Ruin\\" being my personal favourite. I think this is Zimmer's best work; at least out of what I heard by him. If you enjoyed the movie, you need this soundtrack. It helped make the movie as great as it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail King Hans!","review":"I must say that the score for \\"King Arthur\\" is another guilty pleasure from Hans Zimmer. Starting with the beautiful song 'Tell Me Now (What You See)', as sung by Clannad's Moya Brennan, Zimmer sets the tone for the amazing adventures of Arthur, a misfit that would later become a king and the creator of Camelot.There is another theme, a more epic one, that starts the track 'Woad To Ruin' as we see a scene where Arthur and his men ride their horses. It's fantastic. And the way that Zimmer segues that tune into an instrumental variation of 'Tell Me Now (What You See)' is simply marvelous. The action music heard of this album is also terrific, and there is drama that keeps this album in good balance.This is not as much a guilty pleasure as \\"The Last Samurai\\", but Hans Zimmer keeps the listener in awe with his musical sensibilities.

She likens this new power she has to the power a boy has. Personally, I think she is a little hung up on gender stereotyping but her point is well taken. It's a tightly written little book that should be of interest to women of all types, but especially for those of us interested in butch-femme dynamics as well as the transition from wife into lesbian. One does sort of get the feeling that had she not lived in Berkeley and been surrounded by fabulously interesting people, she might never have made this transformation, but she did and has created a very nice example of autobiography as a result"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it....","review":"I picked up this book because I have an interest in transgender issues and am always on the look out for personal accounts of what it's like to live in the body of one gender while identifying with the other.

OK, they are both biting satires on the power of the media and our need for soap but I found EdTV actually (and surprisingly) more emotionally engaging. This is real world, real problems, reality. The lead actors provide great depth and helped me to really taste the 'will he, wont he' challenges faced by Ed. The end has a nice touch underlining the issues behind the 'who decides what is publicity and what is an invasion of privacy' question. Anyway - a great movie and with all these live web cams and TV shows about groups of people living together under the camera, this is not as far fetched a premise as it may have once been. My advice is if it happens to you, do not play with your balls in the morning and get your 'celebrations of boobery' well rehearsed."},{"rating":"1","title":"See 'The Truman Show' instead...","review":"After seeing 'The Truman Show', and loving it, I was intrigued when another movie of this ilk was released. And, since 'Apollo 13'-director Ron Howard directed this picture, I figured that it had to be great. 'Twas quite a mistake, matey. This is easily the worst film I have seen in the past two years. Unlike 'Truman', this film is let down by the fact that Ed auditioned to be on the show, and is aware of the cameras at all times. It makes for a movie that is tedious and annoying. Of course, not much can match the joy I felt as the ending credits rolled.

Perhaps this movie predicted a bit of that.The gimmick, however, of the main character talking to his loved ones (and the rest of the world) through the TV camera in real time (no delay -- AS IF!), gets old fast.The story hinges on the preposterous notion that the main character would sign himself into indefinite video slavery, at the will of the TV network.I could tolerate such a stretch if the characters were interesting, or I could tolerate simple characters if the plot were fascinating and airtight.

It's often compared to The Truman Show, for no good reason. Ed is fully aware that he is on television - Truman isn't. Ed is supposed to be a lighthearted romantic comedy - The Truman Show is anything but. There are more differences than similarities between them, but both are excellent movies for completely different reasons. EdTV's plot is interesting enough, the cast is likeable (with the exception of Liz Hurley), and it's amusing.

This was one of (3) new bath toys that I purchased for my five year old for tub time. All three were basically junk. In this case, the diver can't swim through the water, and just flaps its feet like your child may do at swim class while holding onto the side of the pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk is an understatement","review":"My preschooler has been wanting a diver for the bath for a while now. He saw a bin of these at a local bookstore and wanted me to get him one. Most of them were already broken and so I said I would find him one online. I could not find ANY other wind-up type diver tub toys so I called the bookstore back after they got a new shipment to have them hold one, but they said they couldn't find one that worked! So, I decided to try good ol' Amazon. Ordered it and, sure enough, it didn't work when it arrived. You could wind it up, but no movement. I called Amazon and told them what happened and they shipped me a new one. This time it arrived without a head -- and the winding mechanism STILL didn't work! Under any normal circumstance I would have never bought this in the first place, but it was the only moving bath tub diver I could find. Shame on them for making a product that can't even start out working! Calling it junk is just way too kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item","review":"This is a fairly enjoyable wind-up.

The music is all brass through-out the ablum. It is nice to hear a brass band playing Sousa but other instruments are equally important in Sousa's music.

Undoubtedly, a fragrance is a personal thing. Mitsouko has all the charme, the mystique and the history that appeals on me, but it doesn't work on me!When sprayed, it smells horribly, something urine-like, sweet , persistent and absolutely displeasing.

While this album is by no means poor, there is certainly nothing fundamentally wrong with it, it does not compare to their debut \\"Up the Bracket\\". However, the album is built on the strained relationship between the creative core of the band, Pete Doherty and Carl Bart. This tense writing style is epitomised by the album's flagship song, \\"Can't Stand Me Now\\".I think that while this record is definitely worthy of any self respecting collection, if I could only buy one Libertines' album, this would not be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and self-absorbed","review":"The second record from this \\"latest thing\\" British rock band is as boring and predictable as they come. Musically, the band is gifted with energy courtesy of a competent rhythm section, but there's nothing new or remotely interesting about the music. And frankly, the lyrics show a level of self-absorption and self-destructiveness that is nauseating when coming from these spoiled pretend-to-be-outsiders. Strictly for adolescents who are so immature as to hold on the conceit that nobody understands them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Up the Bracket, and was expecting their follow-up to have a similar vibe, a mixture of punk and pop. Instead, most of these new songs sound like pure pop outtakes. There's no punk feel to the album at all. The songs feel rushed and incomplete, as if they were recorded as they were being written, like they were just goofing around in the studio. Some of the songs are just plain unlistenable. The few decent songs don't nearly make up for the bad ones. Clearly these guys have talent - why they chose to waste it on this effort is puzzling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody throw those waifs on the CD booklet a sandwich","review":"The words \\"trendy bullsh*t\\" come to mind when I think of bands like the Libertines and Razorlight. New bands nowadays have no substance or hooks to their songs; it's all just the same bland chords repeated ad nausem. Sometimes you'll get lucky and a band like The Libertines with rearrange those same three chords Razorlight has recycled from somewhere else. Undoubtedly, the most contemptible thing about these bands is that their frontmen wish to be Kurt Cobain. The singer of Razorlight has apparently has some issues with valium, and boasted to reporters he walked out of a drug treatment facility just like Cobain. Too bad he didn't make like Cobain and put a bullet through his noggin. I f*cking despise heroin chic vane male waifs. They're all about image and looks, and couldn't rock the mic to save their lives.

Yes, they did get a little cheesy with \\"To Our Children's Children's Children and some others, but even when their attempts at depth sounded rather preachy, it is still wonderful music to listen to as the musicianship in all the songs are excellent, even when the lyrics aren't always. At least they tried at depth as opposed to the vapid bubble-gum lyrics that permeates most music.Get this set as opposed to some of the others.

Granted it's an older movie, well over 10 years, but the technology exists now to produce the best-ever transfer of this movie for the new HD formats. The fact that neither the picture or sound of this BD is scarcely better than the existing DVD transfer suggests to me that they rushed this out for a quick market share grab with barely any regards to quality.If you already own this on DVD, don't bother with the Blu-ray, at least not unless and until they produce a new, remastered transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor transfer to blu-ray","review":"I really loved this movie, have it on dvd... thought I would get it on blu-ray to really saver the experience of a fantastic movie.

Well-written and well-directed, this would capture the attention of any sci-fi lover, young and old. Even with movies like Avatar out now, \\"old school\\" sci-fis like this one will never get old.

What is this? A cruel joke by TARGET? Is this subliminal advertising? Just kidding of course, but just how many people can play 16:9 movies in their homes yet?

The heading should speak for itself. I gave Independence Day a \\"2 stars\\" rating so I could save room at the bottom for this pathetic excuse of a movie. The witless, tone-deaf script, coupled with bad turns from good and bad actors, make this movie difficult to sit through. I didn't leave the theater, but it was really tempting. The only people who might like this movie are the really young (those who are just learning a language), the really dumb, or those who don't think that good writing, good stories, and good acting count for much.

When I gave my little sister an amazon gift certificate I remembered likeing it and recommended it(I must be a jackass).

Since I first watched it, however, I have become interested in Egypt, taking courses in college, reading books and journals and even learning hieroglyphs. I must say now that the writers did NOT understand egypt and their mythology AT ALL. I know this is sci-fi and you wouldn't expect it to be realistic but this is way off. The gods look all wrong and the ancient iconography and mythology is way off and misinterpreted. But that shouldn't matter much. After all, it's just a story and it's a pretty good one and it's got the visual effects to back it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept, awesome movie, poor extras","review":"This movie is by far one of my favorites. However, Kurt Russel was a horrible Colonel O'Neil. Richard Dean Anderson, by far and wide, brought more to the character in SG1 than Russel could possibly have. If this movie would have had the cast the SG-1 series has, it would have been much better. Regarding the DVD, it's limited in it's extras, I was really hoping for some deleted scenes or makings of's. It's the earlier release, so I guess that's their excuse.

The \\"Extended Cut\\" on Blu-Ray wasn't a very good transfer - plus, it was 16:9 (1.77:1 aspect ratio)instead of 2.35:1. I really hate it when Blu-Ray discs are marketed with labeling that states 2.35, but the actual screen image is the cropped 16:9 vesion.The \\"15th Anniversary Edition\\" on Blu-Ray is spectacular! The video transfer is amazingly sharp and clear, the sound is awesome, and the wide screen grandeur of the movie is presented in the full 2.35:1 aspect ratio.I love this movie, and this release on Blu-Ray will not disappoint you.

I'd like this movie in a beautiful new cut, but why reward Lionsgate for producing an awful release and then \\"fixing\\" it for about $20 more?

When the movie was released on Laser Disk, it had a sound problem that took 3 months to get it replaced. Then when it came out on DVD, it was a straight to DVD transfer, no special features, no enhancment of the quality and it was one movie that was split on both sides of the DVD. If I wanted that, I would have stayed with Laser. I have a copy of this new release, and it has special featuresa, deleted scenes and you can watch it as a directors version. I am very impressed.

I thought the new opening scenes helped to tie the storyline in later. The other added scenes are subtle, and unless you've seen the original many times, you probably would have a difficult time noticing which scenes were added, but in my opinion, that's how good this movie is. The added scenes help to give the viewer a fuller idea of the entire story. About the extras on the disk, I wish there would have been more, like maybe some \\"making of\\" footage or interviews with the actors, producers, director, etc. But I'm not complaining (very few films of that time have many extras when converted to DVD). The one special extra they do have on the disk more than makes up for the lack of interviews, in my mind. I don't want to spoil the surprise, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It'll make you think or re-think many ideas.

As far as the series goes however, there are a few disappointing attributes, one of which being the lead role played by Kurt Russell, who although does an adequate job, I'd personally have rather seen this role cast Richard Dean Anderson, it is however a personal bias as I believe he embodies the character of Colonal Jack O'Neil on a far more believable level than Russle.I do have to ask though, 'Why is the alien not a Gou'ld?'It is really the only letdown for this movie, and a huge plus for 'Children of The Gods'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upgrading From VHS","review":"Always liked the mystery of the show - of solving the lost language and unlocking the stargate.

Due to his own unique sense of humour, the character of Jack O'Neill was re-written from guilt-ridden, suicidal soldier of the movie to a caring, handsome and funny man whom the audience can actually give a damn about.Secondly, they re-cast the role of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and added Captain Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Teal'c (Chris Judge) to make a complete team who actually seem like normal, believable characters and human beings rather than objects.I find it amazing how this TERRIBLE piece of cinema 'entertainment' produced something so great!

Even if you have seen the movie, and know what they are saying it is a huge problem.

The settings of the stories are well done. One might wonder how a desert terrain can be fun to look at, but the director did a superb job of including monuments and sites ...besides, the desert is sort of a character in the movie itself.

Then add a mix of romantic love interest, nerd versus bully imagery, and a patriotic vision of a rebellion of slaves versus evil master.

I borrowed this film from one of these sci-fi fans, and was very disappointed with Stargate.The whole plot was bad. The characters were all one dementional. Lots of stuff didn't make sense. Even the whole idea around the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Sure, I do admit that there is a possibilty that aliens built the pyramids (which is very, very, VERY unlikely), but the idea that the Egyption god Ra created all civilization on earth to enslave is absurd.My arguements probably don't sound very convinceing against the movie, but I don't feel the movie is worth writing about, even if it is listing the bad stuff..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just A Great Sci-Fi Film","review":"Being a huge fan of Science Fiction, I have to say this film is one of the best out there. I don't understand why so many people think it's second rate. Personally, I think the last few Star Wars theatre releases are terrible, containing some of the worst acting and unimaginative plots I've seen in some time, so perhaps there's a different audience praising those and leaving Stargate in the dust.The acting in this film is fantastic, the plot is complex and compelling, the special effects are quite adequate for the story, and the musical score is nothing short of tremendous. But essentially, this film is not entirely about far out adventure and action, although the characters are obviously brought through significant experiences. The film is about the puzzle of language and understanding, communication being the predominant message here.

Not only is the overall image quality not as good as it should be, but to top it off the entire film features a video burn on the right hand side of the picture. Lower end monitors may cut this area off and therefore hide it, but a good screen will feature this irritating flaw. One can only hope that a Superbit or Criterion version of this film will be released one day.

The Egyptian mythology is brought to the forefront of the story when a mysterious large ring is found on a dig in Egypt in 1928. The US Air Force, trying to discover what the device is, enlists the help of Jackson, a foremost expert on Egyptian mythology. Once he discovers how to turn the Stargate on, a strike team is dispatched to the other side of the gate to make a threat assessment. From there the film takes off with action, drama, and mild comedic moments. Jaye Davidson ('The Crying Game') does a great job as the false god Ra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Special edition verion, NOT THIS VERSION!","review":"The resason for me giving this film only 2 stars is that in the middle of the film, you have to flip it over to watch the second half.

The motivation? Raking it in from fans who expect and want more.

The story centers around Daniel Jackson (James Spader), an Egyptologist who's \\"crackpot\\" ideas have isolated him from his academic peers, and Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), a very troubled Special Forces Colonel, as they unravel the mystery of the Stargate and deal with hostile aliens (later known as the Gould). Interestingly, several of the of the actors who appear in the movie also show up in the SG-1 series, but not Spader or Russell.This is very good Sci-Fi and should be watched if you are planning on seeingStargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collectionor the spin-offStargate Atlantis Seasons 1-4.Highly Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLU-RAY review","review":"The Stargate Blu-Ray does not look good at all.

Those who like lamed-down music will like this but please don't expect anything like this when you listen to honest renditions of the songs. There are many good versions of most of them, some not at all traditional- they are just not present on this album. One reviewer said you shouldn't expect a nightingale to sound like a hawk. I don't.

If not for the arrangement of this music, Iglesias could have done that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tango","review":"Well, through no fault of Julio's, this turned into a bummer.

As many developed countries assimilate migrants from all over the world, the differences between British and Irish would seem trivial. Yet Garrett uses this book to point out that some cultural variants do persist in Irish migrants to Britain. He studies the postwar period in depth. Explaining what social services were specifically made available to these migrants, and how well these appear to have been.Some migrations were not so much due to Irish liking Britain, but to social policies in Ireland itself. Notably the dominance of the Catholic Church in effecting legislation. This drove many single Irish mothers to a more congenial environment in Britain; escaping the opprobrium back home.The book also explores how Irish migrants are an \\"invisible\\" minority in Britain, compared to so many other migrants. An interesting contrast."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasn't impressed","review":"i couldn't smell anything toffee/honey/chocolate/caramel. mine smelled sweet and herbal. the bathwater didn't look very appealing to me either. neither did the little pieces swimming around, which didn't disolve. it made a good amount of bubbles though and my skin felt pretty good after my bath. i just was hoping for something else - maybe my nose is too used to the synthetic caramel-toffee scents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells deliciously of Honey I Washed the Kids Soap","review":"This bubble bar smells fantastic, a gorgeous honeyed toffee scent that is enjoyable to many people and older kids would like (bubble baths aren't great for kids under six as it can irritate their urethras).There is a cute brown sugar cube in it that dissolves in the water, and half is a chocolatey (brown) Honey I Washed the Kids toffee scent and half is the regular toffee scent. It turns the water a light shade of cola and makes masses of bubbles.With most bubble bars I recommend using half, because the scents are lovely and strong and you get loads of bubbles from half, but with this one, the scent kind of died down in the bath and didn't linger on my skin very well, so I think you do need to use a whole one to get the full effect.I love this scent, and I am glad they make the scent in a bath bomb (Honey Bee) as well as in this bubble bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Yummy","review":"I love the MA Bar.

One wrestles, the other promotes him, another is a sleaze, blah blah. Stallone's performance as Cosmo Carboni is so horrendous you have to see it to believe it. Even several scenes that could have been good, i.e. a crew of Irish thugs from the neighborhood (lead by awesome Kevin Conway btw, who does his best with the awful script as does Assante) taunting the Italian brothers leading to long and grueling arm-wrestling match to settle the beef, are incredibly painful to watch.

My main reason for attempting to watch this picture, was because of Armand Assante. He's one of my favorite actors and thought it may be an okay picture to watch. Sylvester was annoying and hogged the picture at times. As some have said, it seemed as though a little bit of, \\"Rocky\\" came into play.On that note, I did not get to enjoy watching Armand for the distraction of Sylvester who in my opinion, talked too much in this movie.

While not politically correct in some cases the tales were related and written down about one hundred years ago so terminology of the day was used. I live in the general area that this gentleman talks about so I find it interesting that many of the family names and places are still here.

These did the job I had intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, when they work","review":"Bought a new house that came with these already installed. Light bulbs had burned out and fused to the socket inside the glass. Had to buy a whole new unit, which seemed like a waste, but these are reasonably priced.

Only complaint is that the connectors work loose about once a season and need to be clamped back down onto the power line to get them to work. 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used stroller travel bag","review":"I bought this travel bag for vacation. When I got home I noticed that the tape that closed the box was cut. When I took the bag out and looked at the wheels they were nice and used. A total inconvenience to me. Its just like Babies-r-us to take things back and not check to see if they were used. This has happened to me on more than one occasion from them. Just like the Exersaucer I bought, as well as the infant car seat, all opened and used. So just a note to everyone- check it in the store- BEWARE they take everything back and put it right back on the shelves. They probably would take back used diapers too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless after one flight","review":"We used the bag for a direct flight and packed only our stroller into the bag (it fit perfectly). Going from the parking lot to the terminal was slow going because the bottom of the bag does not have any support so the stroller was pushing the bottom down to the ground, causing it to drag. We commented at the time that the bag wouldn't make it through too many trips with the dragging problem. We'll never know how long the bottom would have survived. When we retrieved the bag after the flight, there was a huge tear at the TOP of the bag from the bag being hoisted by it's handle. Our recommendation to Eddie Bauer: Reinforce both the top and the bottom. Our recommendation to prospective buyers: Don't buy until the product is improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR POOR BAG","review":"This bag fell apart after the first flight and we gate checked!

Aside from a couple Internet cartoons that you could just watch online for free, everything else here has been previously available on other, superior collections. All I can guess is they had some old film licenses lying around that were close to expiring and they wanted more of your money.I have to sadly agree with the other reviewers here, that Spike and Mike is truly dead.

But in my point of view Balanceand Ropedancers were in pretty bad verson. Possible because of being over 20 years old. I give this 2stars because of that and there's no special features on this dvd. That's strange because almost every spike and mike dvds has aleast 2 or more speical features the only speacial feature is a short that doesn't end.

It adds a great flavor so you don't need cream or cheese to give depth. Even sliced potatoes or veggies in a pan with a little bouillon made using this will taste great. Rarely have I come across a food product to rave about but this has really made my life easier. The organic chicken version is fantastic in chicken stew - throw in some barley or wild rice and basta!

Alan Cumming as Boris is a hoot. Joe Don Baker is in this one but he has a differnt role other then his badguy role in The Living Daylights with Timothy Dalton. Judi Dench as M, Demond Llwellyn as Q, Thcky Karyo as Mishkin, Robbie Coltrane as Valentino and Izabella Scruopo as Natayla also star. look close for Minnie Driver in a cameo as Valentino's singing mistress Mina. this one has great bond moments also, like the train scene, where Bond drops Alec Trevelyn, the beginning when Bean gets shot and the chase scene in the city. hang on to your socks friends.

Sean Bean is terrific as the bad guy, though Joe Don Baker is a waste of space here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Bond film...","review":"Not only does this film reintroduce James Bond 007 to a new generation, but it provides viewers with a fresh taste to the Bond formula while still keeping all of the requirements safely in tact. In this film, 007 is up against a renegade 006 who plans to wipe out London and take all of the money. Pierce Brosnan is so perfect in the part of Bond, it's hard imagining anyone else playing him as well... that is, if you haven't seen the Connery movies. \\"Goldeneye\\" keeps the viewer on their toes and exhilerated through its two-hour runtime. It is a very exciting, action-packed thrill ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the game, another winner for Bond","review":"I never saw the movie before I played Goldeneye for N64, butthey are both great.

It is absolutely worthy of being in the series of Bond flicks and it is one of my favorites.No plot spoilers from me: The action starts right away and is well paced throughout the movie, punctuated with Bond's normal romantic dalliances, handy gadgets, and witty quips, as he races to to foil the plans of an evil mastermind. That is pretty much the plot of all Bond flicks, but it still works well in this one.The acting is above normal for a Bond movie, with good villains (for the most part), a solid \\"M\\", and new \\"Q\\". The special effects and stunts are also very good for the time the movie was made.Highly Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond in the Grand Tradition Has Returned","review":"After much time, and a few rough movies, Goldeneye brings James Bond back to his roots, as the Cold War-rior that he has so oft portrayed. Pierce Brosnan as Bond is magnificent. I won't waste your time relaying the plot and storyline here, you've all seen Bond films before. By the end of the film, Bond has foiled the master plan of some devious miscreant, and gets the girl. This DVD release features some very cool bonuses as well. There's a running audio commentary, and two rather entertaining documentaries.

His villian is about as menacing as Herve Villachaize. Second, originality. The enemy base being hidden under water is a copy of the base in You Only Live Twice. Third, a good Bond. Pierce Brosnan has the personality of that mule in Winnie The Pooh. He makes Dalton look downright cheerfull. One saving grace, Famke Jannsen, who makes the best henchman since Jaws. If you like Bond, watch real Bond movies. Watch From Russia With Love and see what made this series great. For the person who said Pierce Brosnan was the best Bond, you must like the acting talents of Jennifer Love Hewitt too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Bond movies ever!","review":"Pierce Brosnan was supposed to be in the Living Daylights but due to his Remington Steel contract it wasn't gonna happen.But if you ask me I think it was meant to happen.Brosnan portrayed the suave secret agent perfect.No other could have been better for Pierce to star in.The story is captivating which is about 006 betraying his country and a duel with James in cuba's fun to watch.I just wished there could've been more scenes involing Xenya and 006,or Xenya and 007.Oh well.The cast was perfect.Evan the music was a work of art which evan gave me goosebumps (literally).It was my #1 movie,but no it stands as a tie with Die another Day.Another brilliant Bond movie.What I like about these movies is that they're fun to watch.To me Pierce is the perfect Bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful with supposed HD quality","review":"Movie - GoodQuality of HD video = awful!!!

YEAH!!!!!","review":"Not the greatest (I still have trouble with the villain's plan and the darker feel to the film) but definately makes up for the long wait and the last disaster for a Bond movie.

However, this was the worst 007 movie of his I've ever seen! The acting is not very good. The main villian, played by Famke Janssen, isn't a good villian. Although beautiful, she really doesn't do a good job of acting. The movie is also cut poorly. I lost the point of the story after the first hour! The effects and chase scenes are great though.In conclusion,I'd only advise watching it if it's on TV. It's not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farewell, Mr. Bond","review":"After Tina Turner growls the tuneless title song, the movie begins with Pierce Brosnan's James Bond getting away in his Aston-Martin with yet another luscious babe... only now, in the politically correct '90s, she puts him down for his smoking, drinking, and womanizing.

The trouble was though that about 3/4 of the way through this film I got bored. It was just too predictable - fight, fight, kill bad girl, fight, fight, kill bad guy. Up until they got to Cuba I was really enjoying it, but afterwards it just got a bit dull. However the bit with Boris clicking the pen was really clever and tense, and I liked the bit when Bond went to see that gangster guy in Russia. Not a bad film, but The World Is Not Enough was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"For England James?\\"","review":"Goldeneye is awesume but not the best movie but a good movie.It is a good new Bond. Brosnan is the second best bond after Connery, so see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful","review":"This is a great James Bond movie for several reasons. This movie not only has the ususal action and thrills as any James Bond movie, but thsi one has a more developed plot then some of them. This one has some betrayal action happening. Janus (the bad guy) decideds to take out London for the past. The only reason I gave this a 9 instead of a ten was first, no body will ever be as good as Sean Conery, and second, there is a small error. They said 006 was a man where in one of the early movies 006 is a woman. This, as a true James Bond fan, bothers me. Over all I would watch this many times. In fact I own it and have done so. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Bond since George Lazenby!","review":"I'm sorry but it takes more than a handsome guy and one great stunt to make a good Bond movie. Brosnan brings nothing to the role, no danger, no humor, no character; he's just a walking mannequin in a well-cut suit (why did Dalton leave the series to play Rhett Butler in a TV movie is beyond me). Not only that, the movie lacks a strong archvillain (Famke's fine), a strong soundtrack (the title song notwithstanding) and a strong finale. Both Joe Don Baker and the nerdy cyber whiz-kid are unsufferable burdens, and you never get to see what the car does!By the way, shouldn't Natalya Whats-her-name and the cybercretin Boris belong to the Russian military? Do you think the Soviet Army would entrust its most secret weapon to a couple of ordinary civilian hackers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it a spoof of James Bond Movies?","review":"Dreadful.

Dalton was simply horrible as Bond and the franchise was in jeopardy. Alas, Brosnan is an extreme disappointment to say the least. He seems almost embarrassed in the role. When he utters the famous quote \\"My name is Bond, James Bond\\", he is barely audible and sounds like a complete wimp! He also needs to lighten up a touch. He tries to be as serious as Connery and, in doing so, is almost as boring as Connery himself. In conclusion, Goldeneye is a weak Bond entry that is highly forgettable. Brosnan clearly does not have the presence, wit and charm that Roger Moore had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Ordered a DVD that ended up right in the trash.

It's full of all the things that we see Bond movies for: gadgets, stunts, action, Joe Don Baker, and (if you don't mind me saying this) women. And despite his less than stellar track record for Bond films, Pierce Brosnan is easily the best James Bond since Sean Connery.This DVD is absolutely stellar. The 2.35:1 widescreen picture is flawless (as it should be) and beats the heck out of whatever dreary, pan and scan copy is circulating on TV these days. There, as usual for a Bond film, a bucketload of extras. There's an audio commentary (didn't listen), a not so good \\"Goldeneye Video Journal,\\" a really good TV special \\"The World of 007,\\" a music video, some trailers and TV spots, and a booklet.This is available in a recent 007 box set, which also includes \\"Dr. No,\\" \\"Spy Who Loved Me,\\" \\"License to Kill,\\" \\"Tomorrow Never Dies,\\" and \\"The Man With the Golden Gun.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This is James Bond isn't it?","review":"I'm sorry but this is not James Bond.

Oh, and since when does James Bond shot a machine gun?"},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond was Remington Steele?","review":"Remington Steele was just before my tv watching time so I knew Pierce Brosnan as Bond first. This is an excellent kick start to the franchise that had not produced a movie in nearly a decade. While no one will live up to the original standard set by Sean Connery, I enjoy Brosnan's portrayal more than most bonds before him and since. The action is great including a car and tank chase scene. Silly innuendoes worked in as women characters' names are still there. And i always love the opening sequence before the opening credits. This movie brought bond into the nineties when that phrase was still contemporary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guitar, Price and Service","review":"I was totally surprised at how well this purchase went.

It's heavy on quantitative research and methods- and tries a little too hard to pack it all in. You might use it as a reference but realize that you will probably get a headache from reading more that 5 pages in a sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very superficial","review":"We used this text in a graduate nursing research course. It covers materials superficially and is not useful for planning research, especially qualitative research. The statistics section was particularly useless. While it describes many statistical tests it does not provide the information needed to actually conduct the tests nor does it compare and contrast the usefullness of one test verses another."},{"rating":"2","title":"best option book so far","review":"Unlike many other books about options, this one talks a lot about the practical qualitative implications of the options approach (and compares options to other decision tools such as decision trees). These sections are highly valuable. Like the other books on the subject, though, the bits with maths in will be incomprehensible to the general manager.There is still room for a book less concerned with precise analysis that is theoretically correct and more concerned with practical real world problem solving. Trigeorgis doesn't get there, but comes closer than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not look as good as I expected","review":"I have not studied the book yet. However, I was expecting a more rigorous treatment of the subject.Since the author is known as one of the best in the field, I was also expecting to see a very good intuition.

However, when I look at the technical sophistication, I ask the question: Does the book give all the details necessary to solve actual (and tough) problems on your own? I am not sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too unstructured","review":"I did not find this book hugely helpful.

I had the opportunity just to read a few chapters from each volume, which is quite an easy read, and enjoyable (for a mathematics educator.) Chapters are written by different scholars in mathematics education. I found Usiskin's chapter shed some real light on the time, work, effort, collaboration, etc, it takes to build a \\"successful\\" secondary mathematics curriculum. However, one shouldn't think the books are based on different curricula, it's an entire history of mathematics education and different chapters shed light on a different era in history and the ideas and forces affecting mathematics education at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just could not get into this book","review":"This was a book club choice for the month, so I gave it a valient effort, but by about page 60 I'd had enough.

I now regret the time I wasted reading this highly suspect (in my opinion) \\"true account\\". While I do agree slavery was a horrible time in our history and many facts have been written about the mistreatment of most of the slaves, I think most of this story is ficticious, or at the very least embellished for storyline purposes. 7 years confinement in a floor where she could only lie down, and she stayed there for weeks on end not moving? Not to be crass, but did she never use the outhouse? never bathe? and how did she manage on her monthly? Something is not quite right about this tale. Don't waste your time unless you read it as purely a tale of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incidents in the life of a slave girl","review":"The biography brings the life of a slave to a point where the reader can truly understand the contrast of a slave life and the life of a free human being.

Her text, written as an autobiography to prove, in part, that an African American woman could be just as moral and brave as the target audience of white women who were ignoring the slave system as something they had nothing to do with, is a classic of African American literature. The story is interesting, well-written and sometimes as tense as any dramatic nail-biter. This is a historical document as much as it is a good read.

The instinct that Blacks as slaves was so ingrainged into the psychie of the slaveholder that they don't realize that the person serving them and their children are actual people.

I have recommended this to 3 others and all say they were very surprised that this was a free offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Frank-esque","review":"I downloaded this book onto my kindle because it was free.

Recommended highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This story needs to be read","review":"This is one of those stories that simply must be read by people, to realize what happened in (fairly recent) history, how severe it was, how destructive the consequences were and why it should never happen again. Hopefully people will realize that even in present day many have to live in similar conditions around the world, as slavery is nowadays often hidden or disguised. An amazing life story and under the circumstances amazingly well written by someone who was never allowed to even learn to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and thought provoking","review":"I loved finding this gem of a story in the Kiindle Free Collections.

It's not hard to look at the world today and see were this young girl felt she could never feel safe. She was a very strong young lady to hold on to her sanity while trying to save her self and family. With the love of her family she was able to keep on until she got her and her childrens freedom. Thinking at any minute she would be caught by her owner.The slave owner was a low life. I've read many stories about how slaves were treated and it never changes how I feel when it comes to how little their lives ment to these low lives. My heart went out to her and all the people who helped in freeing these people.I would have loved to seen something bad happen to her owner before he died.

In fact this is only the second time it has happened in my 48 years of living and reading. This book is not believable at all. I am not just referring to the writing because I know that many a slave was taught to write just as well as anyone else. However, the bucking against her master is what is unbelievable. Some of the things she did and said in resistance just does not make sense. Slaves were just that, i.e. slaves, and masters did not have to ask permissions to do anything with them...anything!

This is the authors' own battle with slavery and trying to buy her own freedom. Even though she served a family where she wasn't beat for no reason she had other trials to overcome.

Fed the propaganda of prosperity, every person believes they can make it in life, while most live out a modest existence. I give 4 stars because as a book it is not spectacular, but as a play, this work is brilliant. It's not a tongue-in-cheek satirical examination of insanity and lost hope. Instead, Miller grants us a bare-bones look at the psychological process of a man who's world falls apart because he puts too much importance on being 'well-liked'. Miller deftly examines the importance of charisma while providing for some values that we should all embrace; study, work, and love. What does this all come down to? Love accepts character flaws, but 'well-liked' doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"a story about the common worker with only a dream","review":"The entire story was very plain except for the ending which twisted in the most dramatic of ways.

If you like the way the masters of the day painted and you want to know how to do it, this is THE book. Written by a real, professional oil painter whose paintings are still on public display (because they are great). the book is short, to the point, and will not mislead you. The near deification of guys like Parkhurst mystifies me in the face of Colliers concise and practical teaching. If it sounds like the \\"matching colors on the palette knife\\" technique is easy, then just try it. It is harder than it sounds but your reward will be your ability to see colors you never before really perceived. Priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I was weary when I noticed this book had big print, a large amount of space between lines, and 200 pages. However, from the first pages this book draws you in. There are plenty of secrets that everyone is keeping from our main character that aren't easy to figure out. So you keep reading and reading and reading, feeling for the main character's plight and wanting to know what's going on. When all is revealed it's a bit of a shock, which is great. This book had more surprises and turns than some of the mysteries I've read lately. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy, I hope it's just as good. By the way, this book isn't just for kids, don't be turned off by it's size."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Surprising Let-Down","review":"Judging by the other reviews of this book, I thought that this book would be right up my alley. However, when I bought the book and read it it, I was shocked to discover how simple and boring it was. Although I am not in the usual age group for this book, I usually enjoy books of this nature (I still love all of Tamora Pierce's books, Harry Potter, CS Lewis, lot's of childrens' books) but this book was just terrible. Flat characters, predictable story. Worst of all, the book ends on a cliffhanger, almost forcing you to buy the second book of the trilogy. Now, we're not talking about a mystery left unknown until the next book, we're talking a real, last episode of the season cliffhanger. That's not fair to readers. If you want a good book, check out Tamora Pierce, especially her Song of the Lioness books.

It is one of the brightest signs of changing paradigm, from considering only those problems as 'economical' where prices and volumes could be estimated, to go beyond towards traditional areas of other sciences. Economics of family and of crime to name a few. Becker considers the decision making in these cases to show that it can be straight economical, the same as applied in a pricing or in a decision to produce. The judgement of Becker's 'economic imperialism', though, is a discussible point of view. To what extent economic reasoning can be applied is a matter of axioms underlying every economic theory. And these are not obvious but questionable instead. Therefore, it is my belief that this book should be read with a greater degree of criticism, just like any analysis of problems beyond 'traditional' scope of issues of economics."},{"rating":"2","title":"An immensely affordable collection of Edith Wharton's short stories","review":"Edith Wharton was a credible social satirist, drawing on her own observances of the upper class society to which she belonged to paint compelling portraits of characters struggling against the strictures imposed upon them by that very same society. The characters' reactions are all too familiar, evoking in readers feelings of sympathy as in \\"The Muse's Tragedy\\" and \\"Souls Belated\\", revulsion in \\"The Dilettante\\" and \\"Xingu\\", and a mixture of both in the other short stories featured here, i.e. \\"The Pelican\\", \\"Expiation\\",and \\"The Other Two\\".

I did get some good background material on this beatitude from this book. I also used some other expositions. I am a relatively new Christian so I need as many expounded passages as I can get.

Both are narrated well, are fascinating and they give some real thrill about the opportunities science has got. It is on the one hand like opening Pandora's box, showing a nightmare becoming true, and on the other the prospects that could be reached. Never science is alone, like in a lab. There are always other interests interfering - politics, especially in the time of the Cold War, and money, but also human features like pride or man's will to get as close as possible to the secrets of nature.

Seriously folks, don't buy anything put out by this company, Jef Films, they've been stealing films left and right, including several well-known titles, and are simply killing any potential sales of the titles to legitimate companies who will treat the films right. I am appalled that this currently (at the time of this writing) is ranked at #7,846 on the Amazon DVD charts, which means in terms of this niche market it's a success. Shame on all of you who bought this disc when you could have just burned your VHS tape to a DVD-R for $2 and still helped ensure that the film will be treated properly in the future!!

It seems that, unbeknownst to Miss Julia, Wesley Lloyd had fathered a child, a child who is subsequently left on her front porch by his mother who then disappeared. Miss Julia is bombarded by gossipmongering fellow parishioners from the Presbyterian Church, a pastor who is long on greed and ambition and short on sympathy and comfort, a televangelist with dollar signs in his eyes, and, well, Heavens, what is a woman to do? As Miss Julia reminds us readers many times over, she didn't ask for any of this! This knee-slapper is actually fairly accurate in its presentation of women \\"sheltered\\" by men, women who are \\"taken care of\\" and not allowed to \\"worry\\" about anything. The story is well paced and plotted and offers surprises and excitement. My book club was unanimous in its opinion -- this is a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Juia is great","review":"Interesting story -- lots of fun -- people I wish I could meet.

At least I did. As soon as I received this book as a gift from Joan Bochmann, the author of another page-turner,Absaroka, I plopped down on a kitchen chair, not realizing I wouldn't move again until I finished it. Everything else was suspended as I became totally engaged with Miss Julia. I delighted in watching her generous and spunky spirit emerge from the proper southern widow's place in a community where everyone knows and cares about everyone else's business.

Miss Julia and her acquaintances still wear hats to church in the middle of summer, and have hired help to come in on a daily basis to cook and clean. It's hard to feel sorry for or sympathize with Miss Julia. She is bent on only looking out for herself. She shows no compassion for the poor child that has been thrust on her; she only wishes to put the best face on things to preserve her standing in town.Miss Julia seems to have no friends in this book other than her hired help. It's no wonder, as she has no qualities which would make her suitable for friendship. She thinks and speaks in trite phrases. The plot is contrived and hard to swallow. For those who have read books in the Mitford series, you will find this a shallow imitation, lacking all the charm of Karon's characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"ISMS","review":"I choose this book because readers who read Joam Medlicott had read Ross. Big mistake on my part. Sexism and ageism as the bases of a story is not my cup of tea. Nor does Ross's writing, character development or southern flavor come through in a rich, delightful way. The dignity, insight and autonomy I loved in the Covington books are completely absent in this piece of fictional waste.

I sat up all night reading, and while there were two scenes that I found illogical given Miss Julia's nature, and the \\"disease\\" really did go on too long, I heartily recommend it. As a Southerner who gets annoyed by writers portraying our region as full of hicks and oddballs (okay, we do have our share!) this book does a great job of showing a small town like it is way too often.

When Miss Julia unexpectedly has her recently-deceased husband's illegitimite child dropped off on her doorstep, she finds herself having to leave her sheltered life and face some gritty truths. Ann Ross creates a character in Miss Julia who is on the one hand, fussy and old-fashioned, but on the other hand, frank and straight-forward. Her dry comments and turns of phrase made me laugh. While not earth-shaking literature, this was a light, engaging read that will help pass a rainy afternoon enjoyably."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are people waiting for?","review":"I saw this book recommended on one of Amazon's reading lists. I picked it up at the library and fell in love. I am the first one to read this book since its' purchase in July 1999. Why? The character of Miss Julia is at once fractured, flawed, iron-willed and rigid. I love her, quirks and all. She, as so many women, was clueless to the true nature of her deceased husband's weaknesses. Bravo for her resolve to deal with the unfortunate consequences of his indescretions. What are people waiting on, grab this book, bite in and ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh how I know you Miss Julia....","review":"I do believe all of us know a Miss Julia, and Ann B.

We also meet several local characters, from the Preacher with ulterior motives to the town gossips, and watch as the always proper Miss Julia begins to assert herself and speak her mind on several matters.This book is a quick, entertaining read that will make you laugh out loud more than once.

After living a life seemingly beyond reproof, Miss Julia discovers that her deceased spouse has sired a son. A puny, not much spunk son at that. Miss Julia is determined that she will do the right thing by the child, even though she has no children of her own, and finds them a bit bewildering. It's time she started thinking for herself. Aided by her lawyer and housekeeper, Miss Julia undertakes to untangle the mess her husband has left behind. What she doesn't see coming is the mad dash for her husband's money, and the lengths even the most respectable people will go to to try to get their hooks into that big chunk of change. Nor does she see how Little Lloyd or his mother will fit into her settled, respectable life. A wonderful characterization of life in a small southern town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Julia is a true Southern Iron Lady.

But to be in her 60s in present-day America, she was pretty annoying. She seemed much older than my grandmother, who is in her 90s and living in the Deep South. I'm sure my grandmother would find Miss Julia pretty gullible and judgmental and waaaay behind the times. And very slow on the uptake. Things that were clear to me at the very beginning didn't quite come to her for many, many pages later.Not a bad read, but I was very impatient to finish the book and forget about this backwards, overly-prim woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was definitely NOT enjoyable to me but rather frustrating. Miss Julia is a naive and annoying character. The plot lines and scenarios throughout the novel are cheesy and asinine. The ending especially. I had expected something more true to the human character. The characters are overdone in an attempt at humor but produce instead a ridiculous and predictably boring novel.

This important work records Augusta Stetson's spiritual defense of genuine Christian Science against the material concept of Mary Baker Eddy's teaching held by the Christian Science Board of Directors. Mrs. Stetson also explains the Directors' mistake in attempting to assume the prerogative of the forever Leader of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy, who spiritually guides those members of her church who have risen to a responsiveness to her constant and continuous spiritual leadership.

I would have preferred to pick up a Whiteside bit, based on how well they've done in side-by-side comparisons with other bits in a product review done by Fine Woodworking, but Whiteside does not appear to make this particular chamfer bit. The price of the CMT bit was considerably below what Woodcraft and other mail order sources are selling them for. Delivery was quick.

They knew the robots were killers, and they just covered it up and let them skate away scott-free. Any sane human being would sooner spritz the city with aerosolized Ebola than let these killing machines ever escape the lab.I just can't accept that any professional organization would be so irresponsible as to allow the major events in this story to progress. Oh, and the proofreading was NOT perfect, despite the book's lofty origin and authorship."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very different story","review":"If you are expecting the same story as in the \\"Silver Metal Lover\\" then you will be greatly disappointed. But that isn't my problem with the book. Instead my problem is that story is all too common: robots as better than humans and aware of it. Its another \\"robots = bad\\" scenario. The first book was about the acquiring of humanity by both a robot and a human; this is about the loss of humanity, the development of a pseudohumanity. The title female character is well designed, a survivor in a world where surviving is what the majority of people struggle to do day today. The robots however made little sense. Why would anyone even make robots who could do what these do? It made \\"them\\" unbelievable. I would have been happier with just focusing on the main female character and her world minus the robots."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read in it's own right","review":"Silver Metal Lover is perhaps my favorite science fiction read of all. So when I found out Tanith Lee had wrote a sequel I had to get it and see what happens next. Without going into much detail (other reviewers have covered that) I will say this new story is an interesting tale in it's own right. Not nearly as emotional/Romeo and Julietteish as the first but more grownup perhaps. The new characters are definitely different from the originals. A darker, more violent tale certainly.As another reviewer wrote, I hope this is the second book in a trilogy. I would love to see Jane and Silver reunited as lovers across time and space.As a side note, someone (I wish I could remember who) wrote an amazing piece of fan fiction on the web. It was his own sequel to SML and it was a very well written, beautifully romantic (and erotic) piece of sci fi. If anyone can find it I recommend it as an excellent companion piece to these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"As you can see from all the other reviews, this book was no comparison for The Silver Metal Lover. The first book wasn't written spectacularly well, but it did make you believe such a world existed. It would be great for a lazy weekend and overall I rate that book 4/5 stars. It was an easy, lovely read. However, half of this book made constant references to the first book; it was in no way it's own book. Just a ghost riding on coat tails of the first books' fame.This is a bit crass, but I bought this book at a used bookstore and it wasn't even worth the $3.00 I spent on it.

I ordered a large because I like dead air space between me and my outer layer, I fit medium. This coat just fits me. That is not much room to put in between layers of clothing. I suppose I should order xl or xxl next time. My third issue is a practice common among western coat designs, the sleeves are tapered at the ends with elastic cuffs. Had the sleeves been open ended as monk or desert nomad design the air flow would dry out the internal moisture created by sweat. The coat could then be used in heat and cold. With the elastic cuff design even in the cold if you exercise too much you get wet on the inside. Clothing designers need to change this shortcoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap is tiny.

I was somewhat shocked when I logged on to Amazon and read the reviews for this book. I find the negative reviews below very confusing, particularly concerning the editing. The content is well organized, the grammar is correct, and the humor is outstanding. Perhaps if someone could point out an actual example of poor editing from the book I might better understand, but as it is, this just struck me as strange.I certainly hope these odd reviews don't deter anyone from buying what is without a doubt the best book on motorcycle riding yet published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent follow up to proficient motorcycling","review":"This book is worth picking up as supplementary reading to Proficient Motorcycling.

I also found the calculation of risk values a little too theoretical to be helpful. Nonetheless, I did get something out of each chapter (even the one that was one page long). Although I didn't agree with the author on all points, I found that he did impart some important ideas and mental models to help me ride with a greater awareness of what can go wrong, and how to avoid needless risk. It's worth picking up, and taking with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Advise Hard Read","review":"Pat Hahn, has some great advise in this book and I learned a lot from it. However, it is probably the most painfully dull read I have read in years. For every two pages of hard to read material you get about one or two sentences of true gems.I felt like I was back in coledge reading boring books to try and get the few good items out of them before the test.The same matereial could have been covered in about 20 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and edited book hides some good advice","review":"I am pretty sure that Paul Hahn is an experienced, knowledgeable motorcycle rider. Unfortunately that is very difficult to be certain of when reading this book. There are some genuine grains of wisdom buried in mounds of useless, repetative verbage. Statistics are anaylized in a bewildering, confused way that results in conclusions which are tenuious at best. Anecdotal occurances are the substance of the book not the illustrative additions they should be. A ruthless editor, a few illustrations and a hundred less pages would result in a worthwhile and readable book.Should you buy it? I guess so. There are those few grains of wisdom and they were well worth the hours of drudgery to discover. Just take it in small doses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride Hard, Read it well","review":"This book contains some good common-sense lessons for the urban rider. A must read if you want to survive the street on two wheels. I finished it and loaned it to my daughter (a rider herself) and she has yet to return it. Mmmm. It wouldn't hurt to keep it on the shelf and reference it occasionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Scary Book if you dont want to ride a motorcycle","review":"I have read the entire book and have to say that 90% of it is about death and dismemberment. If you don't want your spouse to ride this is the book to give them. It will provide you with every reason not to ride a motorcycle. Lots of stats on injurys, deaths, dismemberment. Very little detail on the joys of riding a bike. I highly discourage buying or reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little bit of wheat... loads of chaff!","review":"This book was an aggravation to (try to) read. I did find a few things that were interesting and that I sometimes need reminding of, but hardly two or three paragraphs can go by without Hahn's silly rhetorical questions, cutesy remarks and flippant attitude. (i.e. chapter 7-Riding at Night. Solution: Don't Ride at Night) A better subtitle might have been \\"Street Strategies for New/Intermediate Riders\\". Writers generally hate editors, but a good editor here might have helped.I think it could have been a helpful read when I started riding almost 40 years and several hundred thousand miles ago, but I'd have to agree with some of these reviewers who seriously question the word \\"advanced\\" on the cover. At 60 years old, I buy these kind of books to enhance my skills and stay alive, but I think I could have accomplished those goals without wasting my money on this particular book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste.....","review":"Pure and simple: if you want to learn how to ride, any other book on the market is better than this one.

Biased in a lot of ways, but some good info..","review":"This book is definitely for the ultimate \\"risk-mitigator\\". There is a good deal of valuable riding safety wisdom, but much more extraneous crap that is, at times, insulted to certain classes of riders. It seems to make fun of people that like to invest money in making their bikes look good, and makes out like all riders should wear orange safety vests and have flashing headlights in order to be responsible and safe. Black leather is ridiculed and people that wear it are all apparently \\"bad boy wannabes\\"! Also tons of boring, hard to understand analysis of stats and studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books!","review":"As with all the books rated here, none of them disappointed and suppliers were great too!

Two male, homosexual, vegan protagonists, interstellar civilization, hyper-environmentalism, matriarchal civilization clashes with patriarchal one, nanotechnology. Lots of action, some sex, and interesting ideas about having pets. I could mention more, but that would spoil the plot.However, there were too many implausible things about the matriarchal society and nanotechnology. If nanotechonology were replaced by magic, it would have not have affected the story. When I read SF, I can accept one or two items where I know I should suspend disbelief. This novel had too many.My main complaint was the writing. I was not sucked into the world as I am in most good novels. There were too many things that jarred me out, making me aware that the writer messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy Young A Thousand Stars","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer - the sound is NOT GOOD at all - a fair amount of warbling on the tracks.

It even breaks off in mid-sentence. Apparently, it was digitized by an amateur volunteer -- which is praiseworthy, except that the file needs to be fixed. Of course, since it's free, I really have no cause to complain other than that I'm disappointed.EDIT: This review refers to the free edition available on Amazon, not the $3.99 edition, which I have not seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed, wanted more","review":"I listened to this interview on First Voice. I got the book and read it. He's funny and very thoughtful in his writing, which I like a lot. But I gave it four stars rather than five because I wish the chapters were longer. Of course, with short chapters it's an easy read, you can read it in sections.

Highly recommended. Liisa"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good opportunity to expand authors","review":"As you can tell form the other reviews they are mixed. I read this one because of my love for Hiaason and Hall (read them all!). Now I have a few more leads on new authors. Fair plot, but good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wacky Look at a Wacky City","review":"It was bound to happen. Only in Miami (well, maybe in Los Angeles also) could a group of writers take turns doing a nutty story and have it sound like events you'd read in the Miami Herald. Dave Barry, Carl Hiaasen, Elmore Leonard and ten other south Florida authors each contribute a chapter to a story of theft, kidnaping, and murder in a plot to overthrow Fidel Castro, and Castro's moves to thwart it. Tourists, gangsters, environmentalists, reporters, and lawyers populate the story, but weaving through it all is a huge, affectionate manatee named Booger. The story comes back to Booger again and again, and when Booger is finally happy, we know the story has reached its fitting end. The book is whimsical and tremendously funny. It's well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was funny, interesting, but somewhat confusing.","review":"Naked Came the Manatee had some very funny lines,and an original and interesting plot. Some parts were random, but they were usually amusing. The whole thing takes place in South Florida, where everyone wants proof of Fidel Castro being dead. I would have enjoyed it more if wasn't so confusing. Pretty much everything the Cubans said was over my head, but sometimes things were tied together later. The manatee was named Booger, and was a very strange character. I wasn't sure about his morals, but he was amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many cooks make a mess","review":"I bought this book based upon Hiaasen's name. Throw in some of the other authors and how could you go wrong? Well, it is a muddled, boring mess. Focus on other Hiaasen titles instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try","review":"I'm sure writing this book was a lot of fun for those involved, coming up with ridiculous plot twists without any obligation to come up with a resolution-just hand it off to the next writer.But to the reader it comes off like exactly what it is-a story written by thirteen very different writers. If you have nothing else to read, go ahead and read it...it is moderately entertaining in parts, and it's mercifully short. But I think your time would be better spent reading anything wholly written by any one of the writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete mess, but amusing for awhile","review":"Plenty of other reviewers have mentioned the mess that passes for the plot and writing; ultimately this is a parody of a hoax and so good for a laugh in places but offers little to sustain interest. By far the best part of the whole experience comes from the audiotape edition: hearing Burt Reynolds pause each time before pronouncing \\"Booger\\" with great relish is an absolute treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconnected?","review":"My whole family is a Hiassen fan (have read all) and that is why I selected this book for my book club. While as a writer, I found the comparisons between the voices interesting, I missed Hiasen's voice. Please Carl, more Lucky Yous and Stormy Weather and..... My book club yawned and went away. And they are mystery fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quilt stitched together by 13 game players","review":"A horrible read. This game should not be played often. This quilt combined together with 13 patches with very bad stitches"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time.","review":"This book is a total mess. It's obvious that collaborations seldom work well and this one doesn't at all. Booger (the manatee) evolves from having no intelligence to an IQ equal to the publishers of this book and devolves to the level of people who actually pay money for this trash and like it.If you're intrigued by the authors, they all have done much, MUCH better work in other formats. Read those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't measure up","review":"I was looking forward to this book as many of my favorites are here. All-in-all, though, it was just too cute. The attempt to link many of the familiar South Florida characters was often contrived and not believable. Chapter transitions were more like a kids game of \\"telephone\\" than a serious attempt to put a solid book together.I've always been amazed when two people can write a book together. The real test of success, IMHO, is if the reader can't tell that there were multiple authors. In this regard, the book fails.The only solice I would get about this effort would be if these otherwise very talented writers took the profits and donated them to a \\"Save the Manatee\\" foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it don't buy it","review":"Early in the 1980's team owner Gene Autry discovered that 9 superstar baseball players do not necessarily make a great baseball team. The 13 superstar authors who contribute to this book do not achieve much better results. The plot is disjointed, writers miss cues from one chapter to the next, the pace shifts from low to high (and vice-verse) way too often. I found myself wishing that Hiassen, Leonard or one of the other superstar authors who contributed to this mish-mash would have taken the story and made a complete book out of it rather than the small but sometimes good contributions they did make. Not an entirely bad read, but certainly not worth the money needed to purchase it. Borrow it from a friend or visit the library instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"In desperate need of a light read and curious about the multi-author approach used with this novel, I dove into \\"Naked Came The Manatee\\" with anticipation of the fun and excitement typical of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen writing. The story unravels the mystery behind two heads, both with a great similarity to Fidel Castro that are lost in transport from Florida to Cuba. Each of the thirteen authors writes a chapter of the novel, with Hiassen and Leonard attempting to pull the story together in the final chapters. The characters are odd and criminally inept as most characters in Hiassen's and Leonard's writing but the story is underdeveloped and lacks the immediacy of a great crime mystery. If you have nothing else to read and this book happens to be within reach give it a try. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get through it (I'm a picky reader)","review":"I'll admit, it takes a really good book to keep me engaged.

If yes, then get this book.Outstanding writers banded together to produce uniquely Florida flavored escapeism. After a short while you can smell the jungle growth, salt air, Cuban coffee, and hot streets of this tropical asylum.The characters could only exist in that humid overgrown place. The politics are an odd marriage of Miami/Havanna. The manatee is unusually thoughtful and an activist. The love interests pay dues to senior citizens.Its a fun ride through swamps, newspapers, mansions, swamp shacks, and assorted bad guys. The good guys have that Key West attitude of \\"If you don't like the way I live then don't watch and don't participate.\\" Give yourself a wonderful treat, sit back, make a snack and go to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many cooks and all that . . .","review":"If you are a fan of any of these authors, do yourself the favor of sticking with their individual efforts. Hiaasen's chapter (the final one) cracks broadly at the missteps of several previous authors. I enjoyed only 3 chapters (Berry, Hall, & Hiaasen), and I put up with the rest to see how Mr. Hiaasen would tie it up. Even his talents could not salvage this - and here, I strongly agree with other reviewers - MESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it, don't even get it at the library!","review":"First, I'd like to tell the authors that after reading this book, each of you owe me a few hours of my time which disappeared, worthlessly, from my life.What starts out as a great idea - a gaggle of writers each crafting a chapter of a novel - quickly crashes into a confusing, poorly played game of \\"telephone.\\"You know \\"telephone\\" - the kids' game where one whispers something to the person next to him or her and the words circle the room, ending in an incomprehensible string of gibberish?Naked Came the Manatee is a hobo stew of styles, with each writer leading us through silly plot moves and adding their own characters.While reading each of these authors might be fun, their collective sum only reveals a bookfull of defective parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naked Came the Manatee - Never Came the Enjoyment","review":"Don't spend your money on this disjointed waste of time. There are too many characters with too little description to make them memorable. I found myself constantly flipping back trying to keep track of who was doing what to whom.

Songs like Political Scientist and This House is Not for Sale are long-winded and pointless lyrically, and too repetitive melodically. The song Love is Hell just plain sucks. His tribute to Brit pop band Oasis with Wonderwall is better than the original, less whiny, more plaintive. But one song doesn't make an album. If you want to listen to Ryan Adams, buy Heartbreaker or Gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are people with no talent allowed to butcher good songs?","review":"This has to be the worst rendition of Wonderwall that I have ever heard. It may very well be the worst song I have ever heard. I absolutely love Wonderwall and when I heard this on the radio, it made my stomach turn and I almost cried. He absolutely butchered it. Oasis' Wonderwall is almost hypnotic with its sweeping strings and the way that it is sung. Adams' version feels like driving down the Michigan highway with it's crater-like potholes. It's jarring and unmelodic to say the least, and boring to say the most. I've never been much of an Adams fan, but this set of songs has knocked him even further down the totem pole in my opinion. Run away while you still can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"God, what an pathetic CD. His rendition of the great Oasis tune Wonderwall is simply awful. It made me cringe to listen to it. The other tracks on this one are not a great deal better either."},{"rating":"2","title":"He gets better with every album...","review":"Not sure how anyone can so easily dismiss Ryan Adams. There's no one in music who can match his prolific efforts and maintain such a high level of quality. This EP is much more intimate than the Rock N Roll album, but that doesn't make it better or worse - just different. Love is Hell is painfully insightful one moment and hilarious the next. It's easy to listen to most artists working today and not even hear their lyrics. Not so with this dude. With the recent, sad loss of Elliot Smith, I pray that Ryan keeps recording such masterful records as this one. We need a rock icon who's living the life and communicating his own turmoil while at the same time keeping a sense of humor about it.ebhp"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fragile Masterpiece","review":"How dumb are record companies? This collection of songs narrowly escaped the discard pile at Lost Highway despite being the very best work Adams has done since \\"Heartbreaker\\". Moody, intense and at times, painfully beautiful, Love is Hell 1 is destined to be a classic.Favourite tracks include \\"The Shadowlands\\" (echoes of low-fi Springsteen), \\"This House is Not For Sale\\" (which wouldn't be out of place on any Whiskeytown album) and the despairing \\"Afraid Not Scared\\". The much discussed cover of \\"Wonderwall\\" leads a catchy if fairly insipid pop song into territory the Brothers Gallagher could never have imagined. This is intelligent music by one of the most talented songwriters around. As for Lost Highway - perhaps they should find a pretty boy-band to promote - I hear they sell lots of albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"It ain't Rock n' Roll","review":"But I like it.

Beyond the posturing, the smug self-assured smirk, and the ego lies an amazing songwriter and musician.

Personally, I think this is American Rock the way it's meant to be. It may not, as a whole, represent Mellencamps best works, but lets face it, he was young and just starting out. But its still a great album. The songs on this album deal mainly with the everyday angst of youth back in the 80's, but is still relevant today. I am quite sure that most people will be familiar with the albums 2 big hits, 'Hurts so Good' and 'Jack and Diane', but the rest of the album is certainly worth a listen.

She KNEW, and made it a point to tell EVERYONE, that \\"John Cougar\\" didn't exist. Then she made me listen to Danger List. That one song sold me on his talent. Weird thing was, American Fool was not allowed to be listed on the very album named for it, but it's there, at the end, if you knew to listen for it.

My only criticism is that as a singer, Johnnie is a pretty good piano player. The KH's do most of the vocal work here though.

As for the double row, I am still not completely sure...When using a single row flea comb, the fleas are easy to spot on the tines of the comb. Once spotted, they are quickly dispatched with the back of a fingernail.While I am sure that this comb is more effective than a single row comb at lifting the fleas out of the fur of my cats, I am not sure that I am as effective at killing the little pests as many of the collected fleas are gathered in the tight space between the double rows. It is not possible to squish them there...I have taken to quickly pulling the gathered fur (and fleas) off the comb into a kitchen type trash bag. When done with all the cats, I then close up the bag and place it at the bottom of a closed trash barrel. Hopefully the fleas that survive are not escaping the barrel. We haven't seen any yet..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for very short haired dogs","review":"This comb just doesn't 'grab' the hair on my pug, and slides right over the top of the coat.

This is perfect for my weims hair (very soft, fine and short hair). The fleas get caught in the double row and I then continually dunk the comb in warm soapy water to get them off the comb and drown the flea. Eventually you will see the water turn dark red. This means you are getting fleas and flea dirt (blood). I find the when its wet the fleas stick to it better too. I use it on my dog even when she doesn't have fleas because she likes the way it feels and its not sharp so it doesn't cut her but it scratches her when she has the itchies.

It is written in such a manner--with numbered paragraphs--that you can just turn to a random page and read a paragraph or two and suddenly find insight into some aspect of life. Truly, every single time that I read this book, I learn something new that I did not know before. Maybe I was not ready for the information before, but that is how this book is: IT GROWS WITH YOU.

However, he glosses over or just ignores most of the excesses and atrocities of Vietnamese Communists.

It was interesting seeing the cast of characters described in the book in real life (circa 1981-1983).

This album is for die-hards and completeists only. It starts with the fairly good title track and goes downhill from there. The second track, \\"Might Just Take Your Life\\" starts with a ripoff of the \\"Smoke on the Water\\" riff and that's a good indication of the rest of the album. It's a poor parody of Deep Purple. You're better off going to the local bar and seeing a cover band. This was a band on it's last legs. Even Ritchie Blackmore seemed to know it since he quit after this ablum. If you're looking for something other that \\"Machine Head\\" and \\"Made In Japan\\" which are their best albums, check out \\"In Rock\\", \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\" or \\"Fireball\\".

Paul Rodgers was asked to join Purple, but he was forming his own group, Bad Company. Coverdale joined despite being unknown to the world of hard rock. Glenn H. also joined, but he couldn't fill Glover's shoes. \\"Burn\\" shows a more concentrated effort by the group. It features a bluesier style, similer to the sound Coverdale's own band Whitesnake would have in their early albums. The production is tight as well. This is really the best Purple album without Ian Gillan. It dosen't however, stand up to \\"Machine Head\\",\\"In Rock\\", or \\"Fireball\\".

For the rest, there's a couple of decent rockers in \\"Lay Down\\" and \\"You Fool No One\\" and a mildly interesting groover in \\"Might Just Take Your Life\\", but not much else.

I've heard samples of songs from the late 90s 00s, but they seem lifeless and not something I'd want to add to my collection. Perhaps it is due to Blackmore's absence since the early 90s or Lord and Glover's absence years later, but it may also be a result of their desire to become experimental, in order to show off musical talent. They say every band deviates from their roots when they get good, so they steer away in new directions that betray their fans. I do believe it is possible to show off your talent and at the same time create masterpieces enjoyed by your fans, but a band with rock roots is probably not designed for that. Relatively simple, high-energy, emotional riffs are what hard-rock/metal is all about, and Burn matches that criteria quite well.

Depending on the technology you're using, this probably won't be the way should go about doing your sever side processing. I was starting to use ASP when I picked this book. I knew that JavaScript was used in ASP so I picked up the Sams Teach Yourself ASP in 21 days along with this book.

The juicer top does not meet the refuse container completely, so there is a lot of wet refuse dripping out of the sides. It also wastes an incredible amount of fruit--the refuse is very juicey and it takes a huge amount of fruit or veg to get a small amount of juice. The strainer basket fills up quickly and I usually have to take the whole thing apart and clean it after 5 or so ounces, depending on what I'm juicing. I could just save money by smashing up fruit with a fork and throwing half of it away. You know how they say you get what you pay for? Not in this case. You get even less than what you pay for with this waste of space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for serious juicers","review":"This HB juicer was a replacement for an older one that was recalled. While I do not have some of the leaking problems described in other reviews, I find that this model is not nearly as useful as it might be. The pulp IS still very wet, and therefore you don't get all of the juice extracted. Moreover, much of the pulp remains packed around the cutter basket rather than being spun out into the pulp receptacle. This makes clean-up necessary more often than other juicers, and makes it difficult to grab the cutter basket when removing it for cleaning. Clearly, this low-powered, low-end juicer was made for occasional juicing of fruits, and not so much for a serious juicer who would be inclined to use it more often and with tougher vegetables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational?

As usual, I was wrong. While the story and FMVs are as good as ever, and there are plenty of units to choose from (including welcome sea and air units). There's just one problem to the game: IT'S A TANK RUSH. Prepare to test your \\"strategy\\" by seeing who can get more resources to fund medium tank production, because nothing else is worth building for the first 20 minutes. Unless you and your buddy are at the same skill level or you're playing a premade mission where the computer starts out with enough defenses to trash basic tanks, all you'll see is hordes and hordes of them. If you're not going to play this online and just want to try out cool missions, go ahead and buy Red Alert. Otherwise, get something worthwhile like Total Annihilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Installment Is Amazing","review":"A truly quality game, RA has survived for years because of its gameplay and resale value. The second in the CNC series, it provides some WWII mayhem with a twist. That twisted NOD dog Kane has gone back in time, and from the opening screens you know you will be in your seat for a long time. It offers a skirmish mode, which the first one didn't, along with a map editor and two vastly divergent campaigns, Soviet or Allied. The cutscenes are of remarkable quality (the Stalin actor is dead-on). The story goes: Einstein's time research has led to the development of a time machine. He goes back in time and kills Hitler, but makes history worse, as Stalin and the Red Army now want their breathing room. A momentous game that spawned an entire genre of copycats, this game holds up still, and now it is being packaged with RA2, also a very fun game. Just get this game, it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Red Alert\\" VERY BIG ON WAR","review":"This game is great it has good graphic. It is not like the boxy graphic.

In the past, you could depend on them for true professional books but now all you get is useless fluff. Guys, just because a book is thick doesn't make it the best.

The CD layer on this hybrid SACD is vastly superior to the anniversary 2 CD remaster (which is superior to the original CD release). It sounds very natural and hi-res, exactly what I'd expect the master tape to sound like. On previous versions, including the original vinyl, the mix was all jumbled with the instruments all seemingly jammed on top of each other. On this DSD remix and remaster, the instruments and vocals are all in their own space, and the soundstage has depth, plus the bass is stronger and more defined.

But this album is much more than that, this was the original Deep Purple before alot of line up changes. I can remember videos of Purple most memorable that huge organ being rocked back and forth which reminds me this is perhaps the only band besides Steppenwolf to make a organ a big part of its makeup in hard rock. Funny Im writing this mainly because for my most recent birthday my rock buddy bought me this album cover perfect and not near a scratch on it.

It of course rides the coattails of the two most well-know Deep Purple tracks, \\"Smoke on the Water\\" and \\"Highway Star\\". \\"Star\\" isn't nearly as good as \\"Speed King\\", \\"Fireball\\", or \\"Burn\\" which open other vintage Purple albums, and I could easily list at least a dozen Purple songs from this lineup that I prefer to the universally-known \\"Smoke\\". Nonetheless, it is a classic album as everyone says. Serving well in a supporting role to the more recognized tunes are such minor classics as \\"Pictures of Home\\", \\"Never Before\\", and \\"Lazy.\\" And, oh yeah, the best song on the album, hands down, no holds barred, is the jamming \\"Space Truckin'\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"an all time clasic! one the best cds i have ever bought. i love smoke on the water, highway star,and space truckin.if you don't like this cd,then your wrong. .."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Maybe I'm a Leo, but I ain't a lion!\\"","review":"In Rock, Fireball, and now this. Machine Head is one of the greatest albums ever created from Deep Purple. Every single song is almost close to perfection. The fast-paced \\"Highway Star\\" and \\"Pictures of Home\\" are prime examples of the band's undeniable lyrical/musical talents. \\"Maybe I'm a Leo,\\" my personal favorite from the album, is musical bliss from beginning to end. \\"Smoke on the Water,\\" one of the most famous classic songs ever produced, is rightfully considered to be a definite masterpiece. \\"Lazy\\" is mostly instrumental, but it gives pure listening pleasure. \\"Never Before\\" and the closer \\"Space Truckin'\\" shouldn't be left out: both are great songs.I don't think the music of today will survive in forty years or so, but the music of Deep Purple will surely live on.

I have small (male) hands, and it is swallowed in mine. - I now understand the review that complained about the length of the handle, which I didn't understand before ordering.It should be noted that the only favorable reviews refer to use with kittens. For adult cats with an adult fur coat, it is worthless.

It would have been a 5 star book if it was not so confusing at times. There were moments when the author lost his train of thought and momentum. Worth reading but there has got to be better. The best thing about this book is that it leaves you wanting more (I hate to say) DEATH! (That's not a bad thing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sausages, black pudding, bacon and conspiracy","review":"As usual Terry Pratchett's musings on humanity thinly disguised as comedic farce have produced another fine work.The dastardly auditors of reality from reaper Man are back again, this time trying to stamp out another \\"superfluous\\" anthropomorphic personality, the Hogfather.Their conspiracy involves assassins, tooth fairies, Anhk Morpork gangsters, wizards and bogie men. Against them stand Death, his grand-daughter Susan and Albert the pixie who want to make sure the sun will come up tomorrow.Their journey of salvation visits many lands of the disc but is focused on the forgotten land of childhood and the nature of innocent belief.A brilliant book easily up to the high standards of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hogfather: A Novel of Discworld","review":"Another brilliant book by this author. Having read all of his books (several times)I can't say that any one of them ranks as the out and out best, but this one certainly comes close to being my favourite. Any book featuring DEATH as the Discworld's equivilent to Santa has to be good. His attempts to understand human nature are hilarious, especially when he gets things wrong. Albert is also a favourite character of mine. The scene in the fairy grotto is the best in the book. Definitely a laugh-out-loud book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny and entertaining book","review":"After reading Mort,I searched my local library from top to bottom searching for another Discworld book about Death.i found hogfather,and was not disappointed. The Hogfather is basically their idea of Santa Clause,with a bit of a bloody twist.This year,though,Death once again meddles in human affairs and fills in for the missing spirit.You can guess how messed up things got after that. Overall,this book was hilarious.Especially the part where the wizards of the Unseen University play around with belief.it brings back some of the favorite characters,such as Susan,Ridcully,the Dean,the Librarian,Bursar,Death of Rats,Nobby :-),and,of course,Death himself.Definately worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore Susan and her grandfather","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book.

This is the story that first introduced me to the creative, eccentric, and hilarious adventures in the Discworld. The auditors are on a mission to change the world but are their changes for the best? A band of thieves and criminals find themselves involved in their most dangerous heist yet. Join Death, Susan, the wizards of the unseen university and others on this hilarious, enchanting, and exciting adventure. This is one of my favorite Terry Pratchett books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent sequal in fine Pratchett fashion","review":"First of all, let me say I don't generally like sequals, but I really enjoy Pratchett. He is very witty, thought-provoking, and his writing has gone from excellent to the-best-fantasy-of-our-time in the past years. I love his characters. I love his plots. I love the way the discworld makes you stop and think and laugh out loud. I have to read some of his books three times before I understand all of his literary allusions and humor. The ONLY flaw I can point out in this book is that it is a sequal and that puts it at a disadvantage to his original books. (ie Guards! Guards!, Small Gods, Pyramids etc) Still, an excellent book. I only wish we could get his books sooner in the US"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Pratchett's best!","review":"This is definitely one of Pratchett's best--intelligent and laugh-out-loud funny.

In addition, the unabridged audios of 8 of the books read by Nigel Planer are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, so, Death is bringing the gifts?","review":"So we start off with 1 dead Hogfather (sorta like Santa Claus). So then, there a vacuum of belief, and Death becomes the Hogfather and... okay, so it sounds philosophical... of course it is. One thing Terry Pratchet excels at is putting in nuggets of wisdom and philosophy into his books. If faith is a continual thing made up collectively of everyones faith... what happens when we stop believing? In the Disworld, all manner of wackiness ensues.I've always liked Pratchett's character of Death. Seeing him as the Hogfather was quite amusing. It's up to his adopted granddaughter to save the day once she runs into the Oh God of Hangovers. The two of them try to stop the nefarious plot of the Auditors (supernatural higher beings) who want the universe to be a bunch of rocks spinning around in circles. They hire an assassin to assassinate the hogfather, and again, all manner of wackiness ensues."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best Discworld book ever!!!!!","review":"I would give it a thousand stars if I could.

He's given me such laughs. But not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Discworld ever","review":"I was big fan of Terry Pratchett. His books seemed funny tome. But what he have done with The Hogfather is terrible. Everithing is very confused there and it isn't funny at all.

I think this is the worst Discworld Terry have written."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Discworld books","review":"Of all the Discworld novels (How many are there now? Quite a few, anyway) this is one of the best. Susan Sto Helit and the personified Death are two of Pratchett's best characters, and they're at their best here. I won't get into the plot; suffice to say that there is a plot, and it is a good one. As has been pointed out, the humor is darker in some places than is typical for Terry, but it's still the same comic personality. The end of the book has a thoughtful edge, as Terry's best books tend to at some point, but somehow it doesn't seem incongruous. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"HO HO HO","review":"This was my first Pratchett novel and I don't think that there could be a better introduction to Discworld.

Basically, she finds out, on their wedding night, he can't fufill her in marriage, so she has an affair.

This is actually the \\"Shrek 2\\" Puss in Boots costume.He was happy with this costume. It's on the nicer end construction-wise as far as current commercially available Halloween costumes.

A labor of love to view for Anglophilic cine-masochists. Not worth more than a couple of dollars used. Rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"desperation","review":"Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the \\"desperate\\", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"intense!","review":"i gave this movie a 4 out of five stars because i never seen a movie like this b4 it didn,t explain how they got 2gether but the sex scenes where like wow! it started so fast after that then the movie got rolling they both were unhappy at home they both stayed because of children so it seemed but the way the husband found out was really sad but the main characters just had this unwavering need 4 each other no words just action until the end when he wanted her to stay but she couldn,t i wanted her to leave and stay with him but she had a son and children should always come first so as the 2 would say next wednesday then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Role-Reversal","review":"Basically, I think the underlying premise of this movie is pretty sad - that 2 people are having a secret rendevous to escape their mundane and pathetic lives and this 'rendevous' becomes their primary source of happiness.

At times, a little tedious in the constant sex situations between the same partners, but in every scene, their is something new to please the eye. The accents are strange and do not match the locations of the movie, but acting is on par with a big dollar box office hit. Sex is not in your face, but shows a lot more than the average movie including a zoomed in fellacio scene. But be warned, the hardcore stuff is not but for an instant, just so you can tell whats going on. Sort of like the movie \\"all about anna\\" for those who have scene it.

While Bruford has acted in the past as the adhesive element, he now tests further the distinction between melody and rhythm as a product of the drum kit. The band is, however, first and foremost a concert band. Do yourself a tremendous justice by tracking them down, and becoming an actual part of the musical experience. The CD lacks the complexity as well as the coherence the band has been able to achieve while playing live.If you were able to catch the show, you must own the CD.

Others he sort of does with a little wink and a smile (\\"Bedtime Stories\\"), but the man can pull it off! \\"Maybe It's Just Love\\" is classic Justin and my personal favorite. \\"Crazy Lovers\\" gets replayed a lot too. Sure, some of the material is a little dated but flash back to the early 80's and have fun. It'll be worth your while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great artist; Lame record","review":"I must preface this review by saying that the Moody Blues are one of my favorite artists of all time, and that Justin Hayward is my favorite band member. His guitar work is underrated and he's a rather good vocalist, albeit with limited range, and he's generally an outstanding songwriter. That being said, this solo effort was very disappointing. The quality of the material is below anything the Moodies have released and even below Justin's other solo efforts, which says a lot. I couldn't find a single track worth putting on one of the many compilation tapes I make. That is not to say that it's not superior to much of what was being recorded in 1980 (or now, for that matter), but it pales next to even the weakest Moody Blues record (\\"The Present\\"?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got it as a cut out for $3!!!","review":"I got a deal on this album when it first came out, I bought it as a 'cut out' for like $3 at some department store. Before I say any more, I LOVE Justin Hayward, he is one of my favorites! He can sing, write and is, as some would say, easy on the eye, but this is his biggest solo stinker. With songs that would've been better for Hall and Oats (remember them?) not to mention a kind of weird combination of songs, it had no balance, no direction and it doesn't' sound like he had his heart in it. Many of the songs penned by other artists, it almost sounds like he put this album together and thew it out there because he was bored or something. \\"Penumbra Moon\\", and \\"Suitcase\\" are the best cuts on the album. \\"Nearer to You\\" and \\"Crazy Lovers\\" are songs he should avoid at ALL costs. I know this was put out when DISCO was big, but Justin Hayward is no KC and the Sunshine band! I'm so glad I got this as a cut out!!

The others don't seem to have the range of emotional urgency Hayward delivers so well - perhaps it's because it didn't pen them.

I like Bone because they brought some real vibe music to the table. This album sounds like any run of the mill trash with sub-par lyrics (esp. Layzie) and terrible beats. I mean really, Layzie is a horrible rapper. bizzy tries his best but layzie drags the album into the abyss with his usual terrible rhymes. Avoid.Okay. I'm writing this revision after a couple years since the original was posted. I have softened my stance somewhat on this album. It's still not good by any means but it's not so much that the raps are that horrible. The beats/production still stink and the concepts for the songs don't hold my attention. But the raps are mildly okay, still not good though. Still avoid this album. If you are looking for a good Bizzy joint, I suggest Alpha & Omega. It's a old album but the content is still relevant so you can bang it today like it's still new.

It's is one of my favs, but the rest of the album is SAUCE!!! I didn't understand the pop-hip-hop feel of most of the album, and a good part of it was skits. What the hell happened?

However, after E. 1999 Eternal, it was curtains for them... Don't get me wrong, \\"The Art of War\\" was a good album--just not their best. It was overly ambitious and should have been consolidated into a single disc. With albums such as \\"Creepin On Ah Come Up\\" and \\"E. 1999 Eternal,\\" it's easy to see why Bone is considered by many to be the best rap group of all time. I completely agree, and this is why it saddens me to witness Bone being diminshed to nothing more than has-beens. What the f%$# is up with this album anyways? Who the hell wants to hear only half the group??--especially without DJ U-Neek! I recently read in a Murder Dog interview with Krayzie that Dre is interested in working with them--but ONLY THE ENTIRE GROUP--no more solo bull****!! So...I'm counting on u Bone 2 pull yourselves 2gether and put Cleveland back on the map..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Close","review":"The reviewer below me has it all wrong. The problem with this album is the fact that the old Bone flow has disappeared. Most of us were looking for that high speed flow and didn't get it. If you listen to the album, you can understand every word. That wasn't the case before. Bizzy was probably the fastest rapper in the group, but now his flow is pedestrian. Just thought I'd clear that up. If you don't believe me, take a listen for yourself.Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone Thugs Forever","review":"I am over 13 but dont have a account.

I recommend this to anybody who listen to rap cause this is good and worth a listen. Hopefully bone can come back with a album cause this is not a bone album and this makes me want more of bone thugs.

It seems as if they have sold everything they represented to conform to the changing music industry. If you really want some good music, i fully support all of the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony albums (preferrably the Art of War). These albums bring the true essence of what Bone is about.

The only wrong note was the version of 'Ride my See-Saw', where they just couldn't seem to harmonize.

Compare the studio versions to these sloppy live versions and you'll see what I mean. The band even admits in the booklet for another release that 'some songs can't be duplicated on stage'. The extra 5 tracks on the disc are filler at best. 17 tracks/75+ minutes. Skimpy booklet. Sound quality is average for a 69 recording. For hard core collectors only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"Obviously a contract fullfiller while the group was on an extended hiatus in the mid-seventies. The live stuff from '69 borders on embarassing and that is mostly do to an uneven soundboard mix where the high harmony vocals that appear consistently \\"off\\" really stand out. The \\"+ 5\\" are nothing but studio throwaways.I got mine on vinyl in mint condition used for $1.00. That's a bargain and probably all this album is really worth. No need to re-buy it on CD.Stick with the studio classics (epics) Days Of Future Passed, On The Threshold Of A Dream, Search Of The Lost Chord,and Seventh Sojourn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Time Warp","review":"This album is a de rigeur purchase for serious Moodies fans, especially if you have only had the chance to see them in concert lately. The tracks on these performances at the Royal Albert Hall compare nicely with the latest live album releases, especially Red Rocks. If you want to hear the Moodies in their prime, listen especially to track one, \\"Gypsy\\", which will take you straight back to 1969 and the band in their mellotron soaked heyday. It's also interesting to hear the stage patter - even though there is very little, but mostly because it is velvet voiced Mike Pinder doing the talking - it's great to hear his songs performed live, and to hear these classic tracks as they were heard so long ago. You will notice some flubs, and frankly, the band has only gotten better with age. This album catches them at their raw best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a perfect live show, but still worth it","review":"The only real big gripes I have about this live album plus five studio tracks is that they play and sing \\"Dr.Livingstone, I presume\\" too fast and kind of off key, then with \\"Ride My See-saw\\", you can barely hear any of the instruments playing at the start of the song. They sound a little off key on some or most of the songs, but it would be hard for them to reproduce something that was made in the studio, I would guess. It's not nearly as bad as some of your previous reviewers made it sound like. The extra five studio tracks are not too bad and I think that eventually I'll really like them, so I guess I can give this a thumbs up, as a whole. It's well worth buying this if you're a completest and want everything the Moody's made."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Uninspired Title Should Be a Tip-off","review":"I love the Moody Blues and I collected all of their records but this is one I gave away. Good points: Interesting but curious cover art, impressive play list.

Don't get me wrong, I like The Moody Blues, but this CD was torture to listen to. Yes, live does sound different but these guys were having a bad night. The mixing is off, harmony terrible. I'm sure any of the other CD's are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely of it's time and does the players credit.","review":"It's hard for me to view this as Deep Purple in a meaningful context. The band's best days were behind them and the line up is solid but very much a total different direction. Perhaps if the band had remained intact and Tommy not over dosed it would have been a different tale (maybe like the Doobie Brothers big shift with Michael McDonald), but I think the band was spinning down at terminal velocity at this point.The LP was very much refelective of the time in terms of style and music and obviously the musicianship is very high. If you're not a Blackmore purist you will still enjoy this CD very much. I think much of the band gives extra effort perhaps in Ritchie's absence.You probably won't reach for this CD all the time but it is now sort of fresh sounding after hearing Machine head and Burn so many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"best purple album you've never heard","review":"This is not your Blackmore's Purple. Tommy Bolin brings a real spark of life to the beast, and it shows, here's a band having FUN! This is by far the most adventurous, most creative, and in my humble opinion, best album Purple ever did. Now don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Purple and Blackmore but the band never sounded like they enjoyed themselves so much. You can hear it, listen closely, this band lineup is tight. All of this is very noticable if you listen to Ian's drumming, he's flat out swinging! Glenn's vocals and bass is right on the mark. Tommy is nothing short of incredible and no, he doesn't even try to do Richie, he's his own man. Thank God! Lord and Coverdale are just like you would expect them, great!

Of course, since it's an album recorded by master musicians, it has a lot of quality, but nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in it can be copatred to the best Deep Purple albums!! Coverdale's voice here is annoying, and there are early signs of where he would lead his career after Deep Purple (come on, a Deep Purple song called \\"I NEED LOVE!\\"??!)The best moments are when Hughes sings, sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come, taste the album","review":"Fans of the band in the 70's could somehow live with Purple without Gillan. But Purple without Blackmore?! No way man. That was too much. So they missed \\"Come taste the band\\", and marked it, without listening, as Purple's worst ever (again - I'm talking about the 70's!!). That's the reason for that album to be such an unknown even by DP fans. But Blackmore is not God, and today we can take \\"Come taste the band\\" out of its grave, and give it an objective opinion. Though it's not equal to Mk2 best trio (Machine head, Fireball and In rock),it's better than Mk3 \\"Burn\\" and \\"Stormbringer\\". Coverdale and Hughs took the band's music style to America, far from its basic English roots, and I don't always like it. Funny, but the American guitarist Bollin took them back to England. The songs are shorter and most of them are heavier then \\"Burn\\" and \\"Stormbringer\\", exactly like we expected from an English heavy rock band. ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Another \\"DP\\" Record","review":"With ego (Blackmore) out of the band, DP began to stretch its' legs a bit with some jazz and funk with CTTB. Although an uneven album in direction, it's still great to listen to the different musical and vocal styles. Hughes wasn't trying to sing like then ex-vocalist Gillan much on this album like he had on the previous records, and sounds grand sharing duties with Coverdale. One reviewer stated Blackmore \\"rocked\\" harder than Bolin. If you know anything about Bolin, he was more than just crushing chords and turning it up to \\"11\\". As much a maestro as Blackmore but rooted in a different musical background. He was mostly restrained on this record. Given the opportunity to perform more with DP, he would have probably made many diehards think hard to remember Blackmore.

But that's not what you should be buying this for. You should be buying this to listen to the excellent group playing, and of course Peter Green's guitar. Peter is a more subtle and more soulful player than Eric Clapton, and his instrumental here, \\"The Supernatural,\\" is the blueprint from which Carlos Santana has built nearly every solo he's ever played. Even though this CD does contain one of the worst versions of \\"Dust My Broom\\" (here called \\"Dust My Blues\\") ever recorded, this CD is well worth having for fans of blues guitar, period.
