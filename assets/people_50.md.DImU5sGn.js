Ask your hospital's lactation consultant for their recommendations.I recently returned to work and bought this pump to use while at work to be able to provide breastmilk for my daughter at day care. However, this pump is very inefficient. The cups often rub and chaf my skin (very painful) and I only get 4-5 oz COMBINED after pumping both breast for 15 min each. With a good quality pump, I should be able to get 6 oz out of each breast after 15 min. If I had to do it over again, I would have splurged on a Modela pump. In fact, I bought a manual pump made by Modela and get better results from it. If it weren't for the pain the manual pump causes in my hands, I would prefer to use it on a daily basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pump for working mom","review":"I am fortunate that I have a Medela pump that I use at home and the Playtex that I use at work.

I have been working and pumping for about a month now and see no decrease in my milk production. I would definitely recommend this pump to anyone looking for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playtex Breastpump","review":"I would definitely start out on the lowest setting until you get used to it like the directions say. I would also suggest using lanolin before pumping. I tore my skin using the highest setting and speed which I thought I was used to but using the lanolin before pumping kept that from happening again. It is very comfortable for a breastpump. I like having the optiong of pumping into storage bottles or liners that go with the Playtex Nursers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add $100 plus shipping for each kid you have","review":"I love this pump, then why the 1 star? I bought this pump when my first son was born. After using it for about a month the motor died on me. Playtex was fantastic, sending me a new motor free of charge over night. I only used the pump about one more month and then it went into storage. I took it out when my second son was born and used it for about 4 months when the motor died again! I called Playtex and they informed me the motor has a one year warranty from day of purchase and so I had to shell out $100 for a new motor plus extra money for overnight shipping (didn't include 2 business days of processing). They informed me that the motor is only good for about 300 hours of use. That's really not a lot if you're a full time working mom. It should last you through one child, but if you plan to have more than one you should plan to shell out extra money for a new motor."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for active mums","review":"I used this pump every day from the day my milk came in. I take it to work, I take it on trips. It works great and fast. It's easy to clean. I love it and will continue to breastfeed for longer than I expected because I have this pump.I have never had issues due to not being able to empty the breasts completely. The suction is sufficient.Not so good:1. The lid that covers the tubing does not shut properly, eventually it breaks. But the replacement is cheap.2. The power adapter is very heavy. I got a new one for about $15 that is lighter and works with different voltage inputs (Europe/US)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working for me","review":"I purchased this pump at a Babies R Us. I got it because it was a little cheaper than the Medela. That was a mistake. I have been back to work for a week and my milk supply is decreasing.

This music lifts the spirits and makes a room smile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita Was the Already Amazing","review":"Anita's sharp, uninflected tone let her sing faster than anyone else. Her sides with Gene Krupa are almost unbelievable. In keeping with the style of that time, she only comes in midway through a song, but she swings fearlessly and aggressively. Disc 1 is my favorite here.I do have 2 caveats. I know the technology back then was not ideal, but still some of the later songs here are thick and muddy. Also, on Discs 3 and 4 she was coasting from her big-band days to her 1950's career, and some of those songs are uninspired. She was sometimes good, sometimes perfunctory. Get this one, and a Verve collection, and enjoy what no one does anymore: pure jazz singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes my daughter to gag","review":"This seemed like it would be a good teether for my 7 month old. She has similar ones that go in the fridge and are shaped like the purple wings. She enjoyed chewing on it and could hold it on her own, UNTIL she started gagging on the purple wings. They are too large for her little mouth I think. I can't let her use it on her own, only when I am holding it. She sometimes gags on her own fingers, but I'm not going to give her a toy that will cause it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A return to form","review":"Briefly, if you like his early stuff, you should like this album.

Avoid.","review":"This is a heavily denatured interpretation of this wonderful work.You will find the most infuriating aberation of interpretation eroding the core of this most loved work. A very damaging rubato and the shortest phrase nuances i have ever heard on any recorded versions of the italian concerto. Here you will get a deep pedal and often a rubato ended by a melodramaticaly attenuated note. I have heard this kind of massacre of Bach from Angela Huet but here it is pushed to a laughable degree. This is like someone who reads a language he can spell but which meaning is unknown to him so he applies melodramatic nuances and exaggerated manners of rubato. The energy and intelligence that lies at the core of this piece is lost. Vandalizing is not an exagerrated to qualify this interpration to avoid at all cost. Listen to Glenn Gould on youtube for a start to get a sense of the energy in this piece. This is not mashed potato it's a waterfall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is wrong","review":"I bought this boot for my husband as a Christmas gift. The sizing is completely off.

If you sleep on them for a while, though, buckwheat pillows can become a bit funky, so after a while I poured my old buckwheat pillow's insides into my compost pile and bought two cheap ones online. These were thin and insubstantial, and my wife threw them out almost immediately.I ordered these buckwheat pillows after that and would describe them as substantial, and non-allergenic (my wife has terrible allergies). They can be molded to any shape but can feel quite hard once shaped, and they are quite heavy. This happens to suit us fine -- if you are used to down they may not be for you, and if you are looking for something light or delicate you should probably look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cement Pillow","review":"I don't get the enthusiasm around this pillow; it is like sleeping with your head on the cement sidewalk.

It felt like someone hit me in the neck with a baseball bat and I was left with this exquisite shooting pain from my hairline down my shoulder and into my arm. Two Aleves, two ice compresses and two icy hot patches later and I'm much better but it still hurts. You see : Buckwheat pillows are not meant for restless sleepers like me who end up sleeping on little mountains of buckwheat. This puts the neck at an unnatural angle and can lead to the kind of pain that most of us are fortunate enough only to read about... I vow never to buy a novelty pillow again. \\"My Pillow\\" ended up in \\"my garbage\\" and this baby will be given to my cat when he does something really wonderful and deserves to tear something up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"King size buckwheat pillow","review":"The pillow is very heavy and ackward to maneuver. I still have neck pains. In the middle of the night when your trying to turn over and move your pillow it's not simple at all. The pillow weighs at least ten pounds.

It states in small type that some of this book is based on real events and other made up. I'm guessing the only thing REAL in this book is that the guy wrote something for an adult film. So much of it seemed like some adolescent fantasy about how the adult world works rather than any real first person account. And as fantasy it fails. It's poorly written and patently boring. Reading this book will give you absolutely no real insight into the world of adult entertainment.

Telling their stories also provides to the reader a challenge to similarly allow God to use her or him. Although these 13 people are Yancy's favorite heroes of his faith, they are also effective role models for the rest of us. Even though we may not have the opportunities for the unusual impact that these 13 people had, we are challenged to use what we have and the opportunities we are given to serve God as He wants. There is also an encouraging variety of people types and demonstrations of faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read for Searching Souls","review":"Although it was subtle, this book is a balm for those who have been rubbed raw by the church.

He has stopped short of true Christianity and has adopted a heretical form of it. His book portrays the gospel as God making ridiculously impossible demands upon humanity. When they strive tirelessly to measure up, the good people admit to being miserable failures. The bad people also fail but won't admit it and become hypocrites. God pours his greasy grace over the whole mess, forgives them all and bids them keep on uselessly trying. Yancey evidently knows knows nothing about God's supernatural power working within us, producing His divine life and righteousness in us. Yancey is on the way but hasn't arrived yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Survivor","review":"This book was insightful, thoughtful and inspirational.

First off, what's pictured is a bronze/gold colored handle; however, when I got it, the handle was actually silver. It was a little annoying, but it was no bigie for me. I bought this because it has a porcelain enamel finish so the inside would not rust (as opposed to traditional cast iron kettles without an enamel finish). Well, after about 2 months of use, it began to rust on the inside. I looked at where it was rusting and it appears the inside of the kettle was not completely finished in enamel (looks like they missed some spots in the coating process). Contacted the seller and the only have a 30 day return policy so I'm stuck with it. :( Too bad for me, but maybe not for whoever might read this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but very worthwhile film","review":"An amazing lead performance, terrific, strong, stylistic lighting and camerawork, and good supporting performances highlight this true story of a violent, sad, sexy, gay Brazilian pimp and drag queen performer in the 1930s, and his two housemates/earners - one male and one female. Touching, complex, never dull. but somehow doesn't quite add up to as much as it seems like it should. It spends so much time on some elements of 'Madame Sata's story, that it speeds by and glosses over other key moments, especially the ending. None-the less, very worth seeing for all that's good about it, and forgivable for it's flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to be enjoyable","review":"I have purchased two of Patrick's DVDs and I won't buy anymore.

Patrick doesn't break the moves down enough to actully learn them before all of the moves are put together. Unless you're an advanced dancer (you almost need professional experience) don't bother with this workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stories that have nothing to do with the earthquake","review":"These stories have absolutely nothing to do with the Kobe earthquake with the exception of the first story, which includes a female character who stares at the tv for 5 straight days after the earthquake. I was there, roughly 3 miles from the epicenter, and we all spent countless hours staring at the tv after the power came back on. But in the other stories I fail to see the connection. I am now living in Japan again after being away for 8 years and I bought this book thinking it might help soothe a pain and trauma still lurking in my soul. I was very disappointed. Perhaps it loses alot in the translation process. I warned my fellow book club members about this book. I told them to save their yen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rise Up! Young lovers of Americas' Sweetheart, Murakami!!","review":"Murakami couldn't write a shopping list!! Read Nakagami instead!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Murakami &#65533; After The Quake","review":"Murakami's stories, like his novels, take place on an earthly plane just slightly askew from the one the rest of us inhabit. His view of the world is consistently unique and fresh. I think that's what makes his work so compelling to read. After The Quake is no different.The six stories contained in this slim volume are thematically bound by 1995's Kobe earthquake. While there is a mention or two to the event in each story, these stories primarily deal with larger, more emotional issues. From beach bonfires to superhero frogs, Murakami never fails to dazzle. This collection is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Existential Delight","review":"Murakami artfully captures existentialist thought and existence in these carefully drawn characters' interactions and ruminations. Inspiring thought and intrigue in the subtle shadow of the Kobe quakes, these are remarkable stories to get one thinking about being and nothingness. Quietly compelling, exquisitely rendered existentialist delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent place to start reading Murakami","review":"\\"After the Quake\\" is an excellent entry point for Murakami. The short story collection is brief and gives the reader a sense of the author's style before tackling something lengthier and more challenging. The collection links characters distantly impacted by the 1995 Kobe earthquake, people who can't face their own internal fractures. Murakami explores his recurring themes, including: going underground, Oedipal complexes, inspiration taken from nature and music, UFOs and very \\"reality based\\" surreal happenings, like a giant talking frog who shows up in the kitchen of a mild-mannered desk-jockey enlisting him to help save Tokyo from destruction. These stories are also linked by a loss of identity and the urgent desire to be free, whether from a failed relationship, religion, responsibility or one's own lost dreams. If you are interested in taking on this excellent author, give this collection a taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful collection of short stories....highly enjoyable, but without complete closure. (who cares?)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. While reading the stories I was completely engrossed in how they would end. In hindsight, I realize that a lot of the stories did not provide me with true closure, however, I enjoyed them so much that I hardly cared. Deep within each story I found a moral to take away and although they are not outwardly stated they are there nonetheless. This book was recommended from a friend as an introduction of Murakami's writing and it worked...I would recommend this author and I will definitely be picking up more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precarious, strange route through the world","review":"After having this book on my wishlist for years, where do I finally find a copy? A library is moving to a smaller facility and is forced to purge its shelves of many extraneous books. A near perfect copy except for gigantic Magic Marker slashes through library information and a big W/D on the inside cover.Murakami takes his usual route through the world of the unusual, but the route always seems purposeful though precarious and strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Only To The New Yorker","review":"New York magazine has been around since the 1960s, and I've been reading it since then.

I've given subscriptions as gifts to family and friends in NJ & FL and they've enjoyed it too. Amazon was fast in filling my order too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching feline tale....","review":"This book brought tears my eyes and also made me smile.

I am so grateful someone has written such a lovely book about our elderly cats!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"I loved this book. It could be because I have a very old Siamese cat who has adopted a kitten, but I don't think so. It is beautifully written and the illustrations are excellent.

Read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem","review":"I read the book to my 20-year-old Siamese and Loki loved it (although the idea of a kitten was not high on his list).

Lynn Flewelling is one such author. Having only recently read Luck In The Shadows, I was thrilled to find the sequel just out on the shelves. This epic fantasy weaves together the many different threads that make for a superior fantasy novel - strong, well developed characters that you care about and believe; an intriguing plot which you do not figure out by the start of chapter two; and an appropriate blend of fantasy and reality. Stalking Darkness ties up almost every plot line started in Luck In The Shadows and mamnages to provide numerous surprises including the death of __________. Enjoy the book and luck in the shadows to you all.Michael Bank"},{"rating":"2","title":"Things are heating up...","review":"\\"Stalking Darkness\\" lives up to the promise of the first book. Actually it surpasses it. At this rate, the third installment in the Nightrunners series will be truly amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No sequel disappointment here!!!","review":"And thank god for that. Stalking Darkness picks up and revs up quickly. I was pulled back to the story and the world in a matter of pages. Seregil is as roguish as ever. Alex as endearing.

A 4.87 They just didn't have a 4.87","review":"I'm going to start being more specific in my reviews. I chose a five star because 4.87 is closer to five than to four...Excellent book. Gotta love the descriptions in this book, especially during the final battle. Interesting twist towards the end. This review is rather sucky right now, but once I get a chance to, I will rewrite this one and re-edit it...but I don't have that much time at this point.This book touches on new magic and tricks though. It doesn't contain as much culture and interesting \\"things to learn on earth\\" type stuff though. No urchin roe nor as many descriptions of exotic foods or gadgets. New magic with delightful descriptions which allow the reader to picture in their minds, what exactly is going on. So in a way, that makes up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would!","review":"This book is absolutely terrific! The characters are engaging and the plot just keeps moving at lightning speed. Just when you think you know what will happen next, something totally unexpected happens. The author skillfully weaves elements from the first book in the series, Luck in the Shadows (also terrific), into the plot of this book. Interesting but unimportant-seeming details suddenly take on new meaning as events unfold. On to book 3--Traitor's Moon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Faster moving than the first book this is another one you won't want to miss. It goes further into the characters, and you begin to love them even more! She even gives you glimpses of Thero and I love that wizard! The ending is suprising, and many of the scenes brought a tear to my eye. You definatly want this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynn does it again","review":"As I said about \\"Luck in the Shadows\\" so this goes for \\"Stalking Darkness\\" beg, borrow, or go to your local library, but don't miss this exciting sequel to \\"Luck..\\". I am waiting for the arrival of the third in this series. This has to be one of the best series writen. It handles the growing love between the two characters with infinite patience and a touching humility. Don't let the sexuality of the book (there is no overt/explicit sex) worry you. It is handled with a Master's touch with the reader cheering all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent Reading","review":"Luck in the Shadows and Stalking Darkness are two of the best reads I've had this year. A pity that Traitor's Moon is taking so long to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Awsome Book!","review":"This is a great book. It was very straight forward with a few cool surprises. I really loved reading it. I can hardly wait to read the new ones!!MZ"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't put these books down","review":"'Stalking Darkness' really feels like part 2 of 'Luck in the Shadows' and as such the action and plot are racing along at full speed. This series really is the best fantasy series I've ever read, and you'll end up clearing your schedule for the day once you start reading them because you can't put the book down until the end. The book ends in a satisfyingly dramatic ending, though it is very dark and serious.The relationship between Seregil and Alex that grows from intense friendship to something much more is what gives this series such heart. They make an amazing pair and are what make you want to return to this world over and over. May their adventures and love never end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second parts are not always good","review":"I thought this book was going to be like the first one - a 5 star new trilogy to give some air to the series - the thing is that it is full of small deviation from the plo trying to cover a minimun of pages instead of providing a good story.

It starts out cool enough (\\"All I Ask\\" by Rae & Christian, and the misfire #3 \\"Ten\\" by Fauna Flash isn't chilled in any way, as it totally houses-out the CD early on and smashes whatever mood it was going for), but it doesn't give us a really classic chill-out track until #5, Hazy Roomz's \\"Herbal Essence\\", which is a reggae dub-style grinding number with a strong, super-smoothed out vocal on top. After that, it goes in some almost-cool directions with (#6) Futuremind's \\"Thru Da Mist\\" and (#9) A Forest Mighty Black's \\"Sunday City Sequence\\", but there's simply not enough strong tracks on here to recommend for new purchase unless you're a DJ looking to pad out his or her after-3 set....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correction to my previous review","review":"The track I recommended highly, #5, was actually Smith & Mighty's track."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE......(of this movie)","review":"now as much as I like Corey Haim, I think we can all say that he's been is some BAD B-movies since his glory days of the 80's...buy my goodness does this one take the cake!Even Corey fans will find absolutely nothing worthwhile about this one.don't waste your time or $"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharing my opinion....","review":"Well I thought this movie deserved five stars, to me it was really good.

I know Corey Haim hasn't done much to do cart wheels over in many years but, I was hoping this might be at least decent!! To my sadness the reviews were very right! Avoid this one if at all possible.

Needless to say there's nothing new here and what unfolds is a pointless attempt at a horror movie that offers nothing as far as a storyline, a laugh, or a scare. Even the most diehard Corey Haim fan should avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy and confusing!","review":"I saw it on Showtime one night, and it was like a really cheesy 80s slasher--but worse! It made no sense, and the only scary parts--or supposed to be scary parts--were the last ten or fifteen minutes of the movie. It was weird and boring, and I didn't understand how it all came together. the acting was terrible, and it didn't even seem like the story was put together with any thought. I wouldn't waste my time seeing it if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars, both for Corey","review":"the only thing good about this movie is that it has corey haim. that is it, guys. also, it's laughability factor, assuming you go into it knowing that it's got more cheese than wisconsin. it's even got the white guy dressed up as an indian, who, of course, is in touch with the land and its spirits (can we say STEREOTYPICAL?). well... it's also got mario lopez, post-SBTB and pre-other half. which has to count for something.but yeah, as a corey fan, i don't regret buying this movie. had someone else played his role, tho, i'd be pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!","review":"This trash DTV horror film should have been released as a DTG (Direct-to-Garbage).

I was concerned I'd set myself up for torture during the first 100 pages or so. But after that it really picks up and I had great difficulty putting it down. Jack's journey is enthralling, as are some of the not-so-subtle lessons he learns.I've been told this is not a typical King book, and given that the horror elements are definitely downplayed (well... except for some fairly horrific people) I can understand that.

I'm very glad I re-read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable dark fantasy; superb audio performance by Muller!","review":"It's hard to go wrong with a combination like King and Straub. This is a coming of age story in dark fantasy clothes...and it's great. Jack Sawyer is 12, and sets out on the adventure of his life in order to save his mother, who is dying of cancer. His adventures take him across the US, and through Territories beyond (REALLY beyond!). In his travels he encounters good and evil in many forms, and learns what is truly valuable (love, honor, friendship). King and Straub have created a fantastic tale, full of vivid characters who make us love or hate them.The audio version of the novel is superbly performed by the incomparable Frank Muller, who could read the phone book and make it sound good. Best wishes to Mr. Muller, who's talents will be greatly missed by audiophiles like me.

What you're in for is a lot of unnecessary bloat, and \\"The Talismen\\" is no exception. King's stories are better the closer to plausible reality he keeps them and this books best parts don't take place in the mythical otherworld created by King and Straub.

I think that this should either have been a long series (7+ books) to better develop... everything... or half as long as it was to tighten it up.In summary it is a middling book with a boring plot, uninteresting and hokey characters (Right here right now it's axiomatic!), and probably the worst King book that I've read.I recommend finding this book at your local library, give it a quick read, and if you like it, borrow it. I can't recommend paying for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Talisman","review":"Quite different from what I have been reading, but it was very good! I could almost tell KING'S writing from Straub's (?) writing. All in all I really enjoyed it...I feel lost if I don't have a ' Stephen ' book to read everyday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another of my favorite books","review":"Together with It, The Stand and Weaveworld (Clive Barker) this has always been at the top of the list. I read this book over 15 years ago when it came out and since then I have read it at least eight more times. It is fantasy you can identfy with, the characters are so well drawn. I recommend it to \\"children of all ages\\", adults to, from 16 to 100 if they so wish, fantasy lovers and anyone who wants a really compelling read. I was thrilled to see the two authors have gotten together to do it again because I always wanted to know what happened when the young hero grew up. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Talisman","review":"It was with great excitement that I discovered that Stephen King and Peter Straub had teemed-up to write this book. The story and characters are absorbing and as you, and the main charater learn more of the story, it builds to the typical crescendo ending that is the hallmark of both authors. The good guys are good, and the bad guys are positievly evil. An odessey that no normal person would want to be caught up in, but that we love to experience vicariously.It is King and Straub at their unpredictable best. Thank God there is a sequal. I can hardly wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite King books","review":"This is one of the Stephen King books that I periodically re-read. With the help of Peter Straub, King takes a detour into fantasy and does it with the same style and flair that he brought to horror with The Stand. This story about young Jack travelling in two worlds to save his mother's life is a classic of the genre-- well-written, tightly plotted, and a compulsive read."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"A friend of mine bought this for me for Christmas, and I tried to read this, for her sake. I spent three months on it, and now I give up!I'm halfway through it and usually I'm a fast reader. The plots great, but he just didn't write it in a way I enjoyed. I do know a lot of people who really really liked it, so don't take my word for it, I would check it out of a library before buying it, though"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Talisman","review":"When the author name reads Stephen King, you can already expect one thing, quality. Just looking in a second-hand bookstore there fifteen number one bestsellers. King does not disappoint here in this instant classic written with Peter Straub(another excellent writer). King is a fantastic writer who can switch his genres from horror to fantasy/drama. This book is riveting and more can be expected from the sequel, the Black House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Tower Prequel","review":"Stephen King probes the depths of human imagination in this dark yet beautiful novel. He introduces the reader to the first visitings of the world in which the Dark Tower is apart of. King and Straub are excellent at sweeping the reader into the story and placing them at its very heart. The character development is wonderfully displayed and the world(S) that are described come alive before the readers very eyes. A must read for people who are fans are for people looking for an entertaining and excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to travel with Jack.","review":"This book was amazing. From the first time Jack flipped over to the other world it was like he took me there with him. Stephen King has done it again and again. This is one book I will read again and again. See you all on the other side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I read it years ago and some how through my moving I have lost it. I am def. going to order this again. I am an avid book reader/collector but usually don't read them more than once, so for me to want to read this again says it all. I have to say I usually don't write reviews but this is a must read. I also have to say that the beginning (to me) was like opening it up in the middle of the book. I was rather lost at first but when it clicked it REALLY clicked. I don't like to tell what the book is about because I think when people read the reviews they reveal too much. I did read some on here and thought some of them came close to spoiling the story. This is the only Peter Straub ( but NOT Stephen King, I am a big fan of Kings.) book I have ever read. Am looking to get some of his as well. Good reading people and when they say it is like watching a movie in your head, this book does just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Here and Now, Wolf!","review":"This story is priceless. Leave it to Stephen King to make me utterly LOVE a \\"Werewolf?\\" Wow, whodathunk ANYONE could do THAT -- but he did and does! LOVE THIS STORY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic and unexpected story, Right Here and Now!","review":"I have read about 25 Stephen King books and always new this one was out there but for for some reason I never picked it up, with the Black House now out I figured I should pick up the Talisman and I am glad I did. The story is full of fantasy, supsense, horror and wonderful imagery. I recommend it to all Stephen King and Peter Straub fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"king and Straub, Explosive","review":"I have just finshed a copy of The Talisman and I am in shock. I actually had quite a time adjusting myself to reality. The plot, the action, the places, the differences, boggles the mind. When I finally did become adjusted, all I could think of was the territories and how possible they sound. Who is to say we are not one of many worlds all connected but apart. I have never enjoyed escaping into fantasy so much and I can't wait until Sept. 15th when I can again read further of Jack's wonderful, terrifying,advenutures with his friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Be One of the Minority...","review":"Based on other reviews and people I've talked to, I must be one of the few who didn't really enjoy this book. As others have said it does start out kind of slow, then some seemed to find it picked up after Jack got into the territories, which I did, but then I found it kind of did a yo-yo between interesting and boring. I sat there going \\"Finally! Now it gets good!\\" And for awhile it did, but some parts are rather pointless (the Oakley Tap was pretty lame for example). Usually Stephen King makes interesting, complex characters which Jack started out to be--and maybe it was Peter Straub's influence--but he started to seem not so real for me. The action was too slow for my taste and all in all I just didn't really care what happened to any of the characters. I'm sure others disagree with me, sorry, but that's my two cents. Two stars for good description and because I didn't actually have to pay for the book, someone gave it to me when we were camping one time;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just young adult reading material","review":"I would rate this book in my top 5, if not #1.I've read this book over and over and enjoy it each time.Anytime I want to escape to the youth of being a young boy exploring adventure after adventure I pick up this book.Wouldn't it be nice if we all could escape to new worlds anytime we wanted.I'd like to see this duo of Straub and King team up to write another exciting book as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic...failure","review":"Even with the fantasy angle and the ability to suspend reality, this book is so contrived that it becomes quite ridiculous. Seriously, if they go and read this book again, the authors can't really be happy with the final product. Don't believe me? Then I urge you to read it for yourself. Then try and get that time of your life back. Now we've both been suckered. Don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book ever written!","review":"The Talisman is the best book I have ever read in my life! It has nonstop action and you will never be able to put the book down! Stephen King has a way of making you feel like the characters are your best friends. I've only read 4 of his books, but this one is by far the best. Besides the cursing and a few overly gruesome descriptions this book is spectacular!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated","review":"It's basically a \\"Kid Goes On a Magical Quest Through Fantasy Land\\" story but still manages to stay pretty original and fun to read. The characters really make the story. Jack, Wolf, Speedy, Sunlight Gardner; all of them very entertaining and memorable.A couple people I've talked to remarked this was somewhat along the lines of Clive Barker's A THEIF OF ALWAYS. I would have considered that an all ages book where The Talisman to me comes off more for Mature Readers. A LOT more violence than one would expect after reading the first couple chapters.In my ignorance I steered away from this for quite ahwile due to Peter Straub's co-writing. After several recommendations I finally picked it up. I'm glad I did, it's actually one of his best. Even more amazing the recently released sequel Black House is equally good.I hear they'll be making a Talisman TV mini series soon, do yourself a favor and read it before it's mangled for the small screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two many cooks (pun intended) spoiled the book","review":"It may have sounded like a good idea to have Stephen King and Peter Straub collaborate on a horror book, but the idea doesn't pan out in reality. The book leapfrogs back and forth without rhyme or reason; we don't really get into the plot; and the really interesting character, Wolf, not the book's pedestrian protagonist Jack Sawyer, doesn't remain in the story long enough to satisfy us. The real problem with \\"The Talisman\\", though, is that the writers' styles don't mesh; they clash instead of complimenting each other and it gives the book a stilted and uncomfortable tone. King and Straub are each fine writers on their own, but this book is ample testimony to the fact that two good writers don't necessarily add up to one good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy , really gets you there","review":"when i first read the cover of this book i didn't know what to expect as with some of Mr. King's books the story is not always on the back cover, but as i started to read he took me back to a place in my childhood where i fantasized and acted on impulse and felt like i was free,and before i knew it i had read the whole book and it was suddenly daylight outside, and the funny thing was i had spent all night reading and being back in a fantasy world i wasn't even tired, though that is no excuse for not getting your homework done.If you really want to feel like a kid again and remember how inherently scary some of those decisions you made when you were a kid actually turned out to be read this book, but save some for later you know too much of a good thing is like reading a King novel not necesarily bad for you but you don't feel like a virgin no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"King of the Territories","review":"Stephen King and Peter Straub are commended as being two of the world's best-selling authors, and have done nothing to retract from this statemtent with The Talisman. Being an avid King fan and purchasing Black House, I thought it prudent to read the first outing of King/Straub and was not disappointed. The amalgamation of the two writing styles creates worlds in which the reader cannot help but be totally immersed. Creativity is used to its fullest potential to bring about this collision of worlds and in the creation of Jack Sawyer and those about him. Having read to first two instalments of The Dark Tower Series, I feel as though I am discovering a whole new world of King previously unchartered and The Talisman seems to be at the forefront of those undiscovered planes, so well constructed as to be a worthy opponent of even Middle Earth. So, much so, that I can scarcely wait until the journey begins again in the Black House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great I loved it!","review":"This book is amazing! Traveling Jack is the typical anti hero who overcomes great tribulation and triumphs. This story is highly imaginative and it is very difficult to tell just exactly who is writing what becuase they tried to mimic each others styles when they wrote it. When you get wrapped up in this story it becomes very difficult to function until you finish it. I highly recommend this book to any lover of horror or adventure stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring","review":"I am a regular Stephen King fan. I love all his books (Carrie, Pet Semetary, Cujo), exept this. I couldn't even finish! I am aware that in most of his books the beginning can be a little dull, but give me a break! I love you, man, but try to do a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books EVER!","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful! Rich with imagery, this book is guaranteed to keep you turning pages. Very well written, doesn't get too \\"out there\\" like a lot of Stephen King's stuff does. This book is awesome- read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am only allowed 5, but I really give this book 10 stars!","review":"These characters are so well described that you feel that you know them. Jack's trials and tribulations are so true to life that through King's writing you live them yourself. P.S. It hurts so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST MIND STIMULATING BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!","review":"I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN! THE FIRST TIME I READ IT I WAS ONLY 13 YEARS OLD AND DIDN'T REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONTENTS, SO NOW (13 YEARS LATER) IT WAS STILL A BOOK I THOUGHT ABOUT READING AGAIN - AND I DID. THIS IS A BOOK I RECOMMEND FOR EVERY PERSON WHO LOVES HORROR AND CAN'T SEEM TO FIND A BOOK TO SATISFY THEIR CRAVING FOR IT. YOU'LL GET IT HERE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading twice.","review":"I read this book from cover to cover the fastest I have ever read a novel of this size. The science-fiction threading within the story is outstanding. I've loaned this book to four friends and they have in turn bought their own copy. King is a genious.......AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent novel!!","review":"Stephan King and Peter Straub's \\"THE TALISMAN\\" contains horror, adventure, and even some science-fiction. Full of suspense, this novel will NOT let you put it down, and whenever you do, you will be thinking of picking it up again. It also includes moments of humor at places you do not expect them. In short a well writen, hard to put down, enjoyable novel to add to Stephan King's long history of successes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the book, but not the condition it came in.........","review":"The book was fantastic, my review is not of the material in the book but on the condition it arrived in. I bought it as a gift and now am too embarassed to give it! I bought it used in \\"excellent\\" condition. There are stains all over the book, it is dirty and very well used in my opinion. Never buy a used book from amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"Ever since I first read The Talisman when I was in grade school, I've read it at least once a year since, and that's been over 10 years. This book is a departure from King's horror genre and I don't think he'll ever come close to this quality again.The story is about Jack's journey to save his mother across the country and different worlds. I don't want to say too much, but this is the best effort of throwing fantasy into the present day world. King's descriptive writing hints at the genius of Tolkien, but is completely King. I become so immersed in this book every time I read it that I'm often up until 3 in the morning reading and my copy is all but destroyed from reading it so much.I cannot recommend this book enough. Even if you are not a fan of Steven King and his horror works, I suggest this book. There are only the slightest of hints of horror. The characters are extremely rich and you really care what happens to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Two great minds come together to make this GREAT book. I was a little worried that this wouldn't have the \\"Stephen King\\" feel since he was writting along side Peter Straub in this book. However it was actually very good. I strongly recomend this book along with the next one Black House. This is easily one of my favorite Stephen King books."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it 30 yrs ago, a good reread","review":"Overall enjoyed the adventure, wonderful suspense! (sometimes a little wordy, got a little off track) However when a writer can express his story with such perfect detail that your mental images are distinctly vivid, & all your senses are heightened till all of your muscles are tense, ....Definitely the sign of a great book Wonderful Character in \\"Wolf\\" couldn't help but love and long for his simplicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good book","review":"A tale about a young boys quest to save his mother and the struggles and adversity he faces along the way. It's written by Stephen King and Peter Straub, and I felt like I could tell when King was writing vs when Straub was, probably because I've read most of King's work. The book never freaked me out or scared me, but it did make me cry out of sorrow once. I was never pulled in completely to where I couldn't put the book down, it was missing something but overall I thought it was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storytelling on a Grand Scale","review":"Absolutely incredible. Longtime readers of King will recognize his familiar touches, such as the dialogue that runs into interior monolgue and the many repeating references to music, and Straub fans will see what he brings to the table without difficulty. If there was one book that begged to be a movie (not a miniseries, like the illfated IT), this is it. I've read it cover to cover at least three times, and I am continually amazed by it. READ THIS BOOK. I wish Straub and King would do it again. and again, and again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"I have read everything by Stephen King, and this is easily the best. Even better than It. I haven't read anything by Peter Straub, so I didn't notice any conflicting writing styles, mainly because it flows along perfectly. It is very vivid, entertaining and engaging. You won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed; wonderful visualization","review":"The authors don't miss a detail; wonderful visualization; superb writing. In this present-time fantasy we get to meet a slew of interesting characters.We follow Jack, a boy of twelve, who is able to transport himself into a twin world. He is drawn to find the the healing power of the Talisman. Is this what he needs to save his mother from death; he will need to fight for it. He finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place; flipping between dual worlds as he's perused by horrible creatures. Learning as he goes, Jack realizes his unique importance.Complaints: The evil portrayal of the majority of the characters, the unnecessary raunchy dialog, feel as if authors stuck in political statements regarding pollution and religion, an overly smart 12 year old, and to many coincidences. I enjoyed the references to popular fantasy novels.So where does the Talisman's power come from? What is the true purpose and meaning? Who cares, right?Wish you wellScott"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful....Epic...I couldn't put it down","review":"This is a must read for any King fan. It was such an adventure, I got lost in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read much but glad I read this one","review":"Read this book traveling West Coast to East so probably passed Wolf at some point. It was a lot of work at first but once you get the flow of switching back and forth between planes I became addicted. Couldn't wait to find out what happened next and feared how it would end."},{"rating":"2","title":"not your TYPICAL stephen king","review":"i have to admit right away that i never finished this book, but the reason WHY i never finished it was because i had to return it to the library. i just haven't been able to get it out again! it is a FABULOUS book so far, and i definetely recommend it. it has a cool and unique fantasy theme, probably because king didn't write it all by himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all time favorite","review":"I first read this book in middle school, again in college and I just finished it again. I enjoy the adventure that Jack is sent on and the magic of the tale. A great read that really keeps going and going and even after the length of this story I was never quite ready for it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were the writers thinking?","review":"Maybe I read the wrong book but I do not think that an overall mass rating of 4 is representative. Of course there are some aspects of the plot that were interesting such as the wolves or the morphing humans but I kept waiting for a big/important moment to occur as I trudged through this book. I found the latter part of the book extremely comical with the kids using some serious arsenal and the \\"fighting\\" scenes between Jack and other characters. There are certainly better alternatives out there for fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they kidding?","review":"I read \\"The Talisman\\" for two reasons: first, because I'm a fan of Peter Straub, and second, I'd heard the book described as the equal of Tolkien's trilogy. Was I ever disappointed!!!!!I can hardly believe the reviewers who liked \\"The Talisman\\" are really serious--or that they're older than, oh, twelve. There is NO comparison whatsoever between the works of the master, J.R.R. Tolkien and the Straub-King collaboration. The latter is a book for children, period--and I believe you shouldn't bother reading it if you're over the age of fifteen. I'm 52, by the way, and I first read \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" over 30 years ago--and I think the movies pale beside the books, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"I just finished The Talisman, and, yes, I had to force myself to finish it. It was one of the worst Stephen King novels I have read (I'd say even worse than The Tommyknockers). It was wordy, the character development was terrible, it was, in general, a big snooze! I may be missing something \\"mythic\\"...but this was one bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for young teenagers","review":"This book is a far cry from King's other excellent work. The prose itself was pretty amateurish. The story line predictable. The plot of good over evil contrived. However, I would recommend this for young readers, such as teens. The gore and horror so prevalent in other King books is tame in the Talisman. In fact, a young teenager would probably really enjoy this story. Give it as a gift to a young person on your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really didn't care for this book","review":"I made it half way through this book, and simply had to put it down (I kept hoping for it to get better the whole time). The main reason why I picked it up was to get more about the Dark Tower series. The characters all seemed very superficial, and the plot was very forced. King usually does a better job at introducing and fleshing out any character in his books. His style usually is pretty continuous; no abrupt jumps or holes... I'm a huge fantasy fan, and I've read a dozen other Stephen King novels; this book was by far the worst I've read of his so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"This book starts off quite well in a grim, seedy out of season holiday resort but then just floats off into overlong cliche-ness. The chracters are paper-thin; tough, wise-cracking mother who's dying, blues playing wise old black guy, fat, cowardly but ultimately nice kid, pantomime villains, liberace-like camp villains and of course the good kid ripped off from Mark Twain (Jack SAWtelle anyone?). Any emotional envolvment this book entails is played upon like a harp (Wolfs death....) and the book is much too long. There is far too much detail as well telling of the main characters every move and breath. I suppose its alright if your in hospital or something and bored but this is mainly a pulpy, trashy, derivative piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I am amazed at the number of reviews on this site rating this book as \\"The best book I have ever read\\" and that I have read it 7 or 8 times. (who reads a book that many times anyway?) Of the King books I have read so far, this was the least interesting to me of any. You care very little about the characters and the whole story is somewhat muddled and confusing. It reads fast for a long book but mainly because the story is so uninteresting that you tend to breeze right through it. I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"O MY GOD!","review":"EVERY DAY I GENUFLECT BEFORE MY STEPHEN KING IDOL! NOT ONE SINGLE DAY GOES BY THAT I DON'T!THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!

Okay, the story alone was good. I enjoyed most of the story. Unfortunately its graphic descriptions and foul use of metaphors I could do without. The authors have a horrible time getting to the point, and filling the pages with mindless (sometimes useless graphic descriptions). It is god awful long and it could do without several hundreds of pages. NOT RECOMMENDED for anyone under the age of 16. My eyes and thoughts were frequently, offended by the VERY GRAPHIC, highly unnecessary, and often at times pornographic metaphors. I think if the authors spent less time trying to nauseate the reader with pornographic details, and more time getting to the point of the story it would be a better story. There are just too many story detours to actually make it an enjoyable story. Because of this story I will NEVER pick up a novel with Stephen King's name attached to it, again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet and scary page turner","review":"I lost a weekend when I picked up this book. From the time that we meet Jack, a real trooper of a pre-adolescent, to the climax of the book (a continent away from the beginning), the reader is making friends and enemies and experiencing unimaginable thrills. One of the things I like about King's books are his characters. And there are a lot of characters in this book to love...and hate! I can't really tell which of the chapters are King and which are Straub, but together, they write a wonderful adventure that's full of suspense, horror, and , indeed, laughter. I've read this book three times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conceptually interesting, not original, lonnnnnnng book...","review":"I've read a good number of Stephen King books and I liked the sound of this one so I picked it up. One of King's tendancies is to take a good idea and overdetail it to death. This books is a good example. Over 600 pages, I'd say it could have been comfortably done in under 400 and been readable. I forced myself to finish it, in spite of the obvious ending because I hate to put down a book unread. Read the first three books in the Apprentice Adept series by Piers Anthony for a similar theme and much better execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Tallman was going on","review":"Keep me intrigued all the way through. totally love the flipping back and forth.

I like Wolf, and pitied Richard, all in all it was an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb authors and a okay voice bring a spellbinding story","review":"Boy, nothing beats having Stephen King read to you in your car. And this is a favorite of mine. King LOVES to push a \\"world gone mad\\" vision onto his readership while Straub is successful in weaving atmosphere and notable charactors you care for. Our hero, Jack Sawyer is an unlikely Froto (standard King)who drags others into his quest through shear despiration. There is much less of Straub here that I could hope for and Muller's reading of the book brings it down to 4 stars. His voice irritates occasionally as he slips between charactors.This was an excellant stage in King's career and I am looking forward to reading their follow-up title Black House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it , reread it, reread it......","review":"Like I said reread it a few times. Amazing book. Pure fantasy, but really convincing and humane. Peter Straub's touch dilutes Stephen King's descent into frightening horror.

Loved it and still do."},{"rating":"2","title":"the talisman","review":"this is the second book that i've read by straub and king, the other being \\" black house\\". these two writers, together, are powerful...the best of both worlds. i wish they would write more together! i would buy it! loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"I liked the Talisman.

Perhaps, that is what the author is trying to prove. But, being single and looking seriously for love isn't a laughing matter. It takes motivation, preparation, inspiration, and a dose of continual hope to find the person you really want. The title makes it seem as though a reader might actually find love using \\"A.K's\\" method (and why doesn't the author use his or her full, real name?)Better to get your laughs for free on the comedy channel, and save your money for a book that can really help you focus on a love search!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classical music fan","review":"This is simply one of the best recordings of this work ever.

If it did not bear her name, I would have never recognized it as her work. As much as I've enjoyed her others, this one was even better. I thought I might miss the sprinkling of wit and humor, but, as I got caught up in the characters and their seriousness, I became enthralled. I hope there'll also be one of Josh and his quest for happiness. This is the best book I've read lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good colonial story!","review":"This was a good book, well-researched and keeping me interested. Others have given opinions in their reviews that equal my feelings, so it's not necessary for me to expound on those."},{"rating":"2","title":"America the soon-to-be","review":"American pioneer stories are some of my favorites. We see the English lady being shanghaied to the colonies to provide a wife for a backwoodsman who, himself, is forced by puritanical rules to settle the land and multiply. Life expectancy was extremely short in 1644 no matter where one lived, but especially in the wilds of Indian country.There were a few Bible verses to help support the characters and move the story along. I wasn't bored once with the 347 pages, but did find it incredible that anyone would prefer living in these hazardous surroundings than back in the motherland where life was easier, money available and relatives to help out in a pinch.I also learned about the Indian Wars of the 1640's, that 400 colonists and many more Indians were killed in just one such battle and that rowdy settlers who broke treaties was the probable cause of native attacks. I can't help but think we owe our forebears to keep their hardwon freedoms intact in this frustrating 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Message","review":"Tedious and predictable. A kidnapped noblewoman falls in love with the man she is forced to marry. How many times have we seen this plot? And what is infuriating is that nearly every man she is close to humiliates her for being educated, even her husband who begrudgingly relents in the end because she does her duty and provides an heir. Historically accurate, maybe but what is the message being sent to young women of today?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A reader most repulsed","review":"Ok, maybe if you are desparate for a Christian romance novel this might be your thing but the writing was pathetic. The author attempts to write the dialog in the style of the year in which the story is set and the experiment fails. Even if you want a Christian romance novel I don't know how this would fill the bill. There isn't that much talk of Christianity but the two romantic leads realize they care deeply for each other because of the faith each one has in God. This is never demonstrated in the book and the two characters don't even speak to each other about it, they somehow just know that about each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christy winner? Really??????","review":"I could have given this book 3 stars- except it was soooooo overrated that my hightened expectations were doubly slashed.I love to love my protagonists. I find neither Constance nor Drew to be likeable characters. While Constance makes a turn and becomes more likeable at the end she is still irritating and I wasn't really cheering for her. And Drew! Really, am I supposed to be rooting for him? HE'S the HERO?The premise of the book was excellent. I loved the idea of this book. I just think the author failed in its execution. If you want likeable characters to cheer for, hope for, this is not the book for you. Neither are very likeable from the start and they don't get much better toward the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Just my two cents. Bad history. Bad drama. Dialog and actions that don't make sense for 17th Century characters. Christianity stuck into the story like raisins in a pudding - very superficial.If you want to read a great novel of this time period , 17th C Virginia, and the story of the tobacco brides, try Mary Johnston's To Have and To Hold. It's a little dated, but much better literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"worlds best book","review":"A Bride Most Bregrudging by Deeanne Gist is one of the best books I have read in the longest of times. It is about a girl named Constance Morrow who gets captured by an evil slave tobbaco captain going from England to the United States where he sells constance as a tobbacco bride to a young handsome man named Drew. That is all the information I am giving to the interested reader but I assure you it will leave you wanting more. The story leaves you in suspense, thrills your mind and creates something amazing in you. It is on the top of my list for favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too thrilled. . .","review":"Captivating story! However, I really couldn't look over the small historical inaccuracies. Never would such sarcasm and outright rebellion have been allowed from a woman! Especially a woman who was an indentured servant in the colonies! Also, small detail, but a woman (especially royalty from London) would not have known how to swim. I did not appreciate the explicit manner in which the author described the character's sexuality. I actually have always picked up Bethany Houses' books with confidence, knowing that they didn't print anything of that manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"While the writing itself was quite nice, and the story was captivating up to about the half-way point, I couldn't finish it. I was put off by Drew's aversion to the red hair and freckles, but that wasn't the worst part. He's a total jerk -- not a guy a woman reader would swoon over. I found Constance to be inconsistent and kind of dumb for a woman who's supposed to be intelligent. The scene in the forest with the Native American guy -- not plausible in the least. I got so frustrated with the characters, I moved on to the next book in my list without finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't finish it!","review":"I have tried hard to read this book because I didn't get it for free, wish I had.This book won awards! How? It is a terrible book, characters have no real relationship, gross subject of a man having to eat a worm because he missed it on a tobacco plant, Constance isn't even close to real, Drew no better. Just a terrible book, I can't finish it.I have read a couple of Gist books that I loved but this is about the worst book I have tried to read from any author.I certainly will not recommend it to anyone. BJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at history!","review":"Some may think that Christian fiction is the same as reading the Bible or having religion forced down your throat...well, I want to tell you that this couldn't be further from the truth. The faith that the characters reflect is actually very appropriate for the times. It is the 1600s, colonial Virginia, strained relationships with Indians, and death is an every day occurrence. Not to have some sort of faith would totally seem out of place. This book worked for me in so many ways....I loved Constance and Drew, though at times I could have smacked both of them, but their growing love for each other was a wonderful thing to experience. Reading this book really made me appreciate our history, the ones that came before us, and taught me a great history lesson (one that I never learned in high school) in regards to tobacco brides and how they came to be in the blossoming colonies."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok... not what i was expecting","review":"This is a Christian novel which I did not realize when I purchased on my kindle. It was decent but obviously there were lots of religious references which i found utterly distracting. Not my cup of tea but the story beneath all of that was decent. I wish Amazon would label these these better for kindle user!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't reach the high expectations","review":"This book was recommended to me by two good friends who said it was just as good as Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers and so my expectations were high. Too high. I found this book ok as a holiday read but it was very predictable and I don't feel drawn to the characters at all. I was disappointed, I probably wouldn't have been as disappointed if it hadn't had such high recommendations but disappointed nonetheless.I actually bought this book as a 3 in 1 (The Trouble With Brides) and I enjoyed the other two stories much better so it was good to see that this author does have some talent but I wouldn't recommend this one as anything special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sense of Humor, Modesty and good plot","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a totally different time period and setting than I usually read. I needed a break from the regency smiles. 1600-1700s in America. I appreciated the Biblical scriptures mentioned in a few spots. I didn't enjoy the dogma included as far as the shape of the house and a couple other very minor things. But overall I loved the sense of humor, modesty, plot of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is religious drivel at its worst","review":"To be clear, this novel attempts to proselytize its readers, or at least convince them of Evangelical sexual values. Along the way, it completely rewrites historical ideas about sex and religion. I was left queasy by the author's vacillation between attempting to titillate and inspire her readers. In the end, she accomplishes nothing but produce remarkable cheesiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christian Novel??","review":"Love, faith, understanding, kindness. It is what I think of when I think of Christian ideals. When I got this book I understood that it was a Christian novel, so the religious language was not offensive to me like it was some other readers. I had a huge problem with the violence. I understand that America during this time was very uncertain and quite extreme, but the ending was ridiculous! Most of the book was a standard mild romance novel (badly written with characters I didn't grow to care about) but as I reached the end of the book it was like it was written by a different author. It was incredibly violent for no apparent reason and it made me like the characters even less then I already did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Ugh, ugh, ugh, I love historical fiction, but this is so poorly written, I didn't make it past the first 50 pages. Seriously, the protagonist talking to herself using words like \\"forsooth\\"? I got this for free from the Kindle store and it wasn't worth what I paid. This was the first book I ever actually deleted from my Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"christian\\" Bodice Ripper haha","review":"This book is TERRIBLE! The author has taken a Harlequin romance and put a few \\"Dear Lords\\" in there and called it a Christian novel. I agree the lust and cleavage talk is offensive. The writing was just plain painful and laughable. And the characters are as shallow as a puddle. I honestly could not give more than 1 star.Extremely unrealistic and poorly done.What a joke Constance was. She is kidnapped, sent across the ocean as a tobacco bride and forced to marry (all the while being from royalty) and yet is as cool as a cucumber and saucy to boot.Drew was a brute.And it was so boring in places. How long does it take to describe washing trenches or needing to go to the bathroom?. Arrrgh!And it won the Christy Award. Those awards have lost all merit with me.The whole book was ridiculous and very disappointing ."},{"rating":"1","title":"TMI","review":"Too much attention to physical desires and not enough to love.

It's really just a hot mess through and through.Does it come with a companion math curriculum for sorta wholesome young ladies of faith?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lust is still a sin","review":"I agree with another reader who stated that the characters never really get to know each other or fall in love with who the other person really is because of the lust factor. The Bible states that lust is a sin. Even when you lust after your wife. You should LOVE your wife but not lust after her. Lust is a selfish motivation to fulfill your own desires.. is that how God loves the church? I don't think so. Sex inside of marriage sure, but it should never be just about getting what you want from the other person. In my opinion the story lacked romance because real romance is about love and not lust. Lust is very unromantic to me. It read like a trashy novel. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Endearing","review":"This book is so refreshing and different. It is my favorite Gist book. If you like historical fiction with some Christian truth mixed with some enticing romance...you are sure to love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bride Most Begrudging","review":"Excellent book, easy read, and good overall plot. I enjoyed it immensely. Her second book in the series is even better than the first. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. My only criticism is that some of the language seemed too modern for the time period and I felt that the author ran out of steam toward the end. I recommend this book and will most likely read more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice Christian romance read","review":"Downloaded this for free when I got my Kindle iPhone app, and the beginning paragraphs didn't hook me right away, so I put off reading it for weeks. When I finally got to reading it - during a really long subway ride - I was pleasantly surprised. But that's the key: this story starts slow and dragging, but stay with it and the story picks up and the characters start to come alive. This was my first Christian romance read, and at first I doubted how they'd build up romantic tension when sanitized language was to be used. Ms Gist succeeds very well here - by the time Drew and Connie are falling into each other's arms and gazes, you are there for the ride and you are flicking the screens at a fast pace. Oh there are still dragging parts here and there, but overall it's a great read. It's comparable to Janette Oke's \\"Love Comes Softly\\" and I'm definitely going to go back and read it in the future, with a mug of hot cocoa during a rainy afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Good Inspirational and Historical Romance Book!","review":"A great read that does not preach the inspirational aspects of the story to you. A very solid read for me. I am not someone who generally reads Inspirational Historical Romance but since I got the Kindle, I have downloaded two of them, this being one of them and was really impressed that the Christian Religion aspects of this story were not too heavy and did not make me feel like I was being preached at. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good love story with a deeper message!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it!","review":"I've devoured all of Deeanne Gist's books on my Kindle...except for Deep in the Heart. . . . which isn't available yet. As a 6o-plus-year-old woman of the world, I thought I'd outgrown romance novels decades ago, however I must say I found all of Ms. Gist's books well done, very interesting and great fun. I'm looking forward to Deep In the Heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books!","review":"Deanne Gist has become one of my favorite authors. I just wish she had more books already written. I've already read them all....and loved them all! This book was laugh out loud funny for me! But at the same time very romantic and passionate. It's so nice to read a CLEAN romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful read","review":"this was a great escape from the worries of my day. I found myself caring about the characters and chuckling at them. There were unexpected twists and turns that caught me off guard. I will certainly explore Ms. Gists novels further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Historical Christian Novel\\" that really delivers!","review":"While at times cheesy and somewhat predictable, this book is charming and wholly entertaining. Much of the dialogue is simplistic and will induce an eye-roll or two, but it can be easily ignored due to the engaging characters and plot twists that keep you turning pages at a rapid rate.While reading, I kept thinking about the PBS series \\"Colonial House\\", which helped the images and settings to come alive for me, and to really appreciate the details that the author researched and included in the novel.Also, the portrayals of Christianity and God in this book are very well done: realistic and relatable, not hit-you-over-the-head sappy.It's so refreshing to read a \\"Historical Christian Novel\\" that so wonderfully encompasses all three items! All in all, a very well done and loveable book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Read Most Satisfying","review":"Gist does an excellent job in this novel. The characters are believable and endearing, the history seems accurate and the story is compelling. While I would have liked to see Constance fight a little more for her way, she does a great job of establishing her dominance in the situation. I also liked that Gist was able to take the romance aspect and combine it with the history in a way that wasn't too predictable or corny.Great read, couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first book","review":"What a delightful little book and very impressive first effort by Deeanne Gist. Compelling characters who are very real instead of the \\"holier than thou\\" types usually encountered in Christian fiction. Ms. Gist seemed precise in her research of the period so the book opens up an informative window to the very early days of Colonial America and the hardships encountered by the first settlers of the Virginia Colony. I will definitely be ordering Deanne Gist's next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt know it was a bible thumping book","review":"WAY big thumbs down to this book.I had no idea when I bought it that it was a book with a Christian message.I was a little offended and feel that there needs to be better tagging of books.

Very disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Carmine Ganucci was a retired soft drinks magnate with a nice estate in Larchmont and influence in, well, certain circles. Which was precisely why Nanny Poole, the English governess he had hired to look after his 10 year old son, had no desire to let him know that little Lewis had been kidnapped. Since he was vacationing in Capri at the time, it wouldn't be too hard to keep him in the dark. Provided, of course, the kid returned, safe and sound, before his parents did. So she asked Benny Napkins, who used to be very big in linens and garbage, to help raise the $50,000 ransom...a search that sets off the funniest and most unlikely chain of events since the mob went \\"respectable\\". Evan Hunter conducts a merry romp through the labyrinth of disorganized crime with some of the funniest characters you can ever imagine. The black and white pictures in book are as funny looking as the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"Only slighlty useful.

Now they've asked me to remove it, stating, \\"As you can see, we try very hard to make sure our customers get fair treatment and to fix any mistakes we make.\\" Actions speak louder than words. And since my experience can't be deleted, I won't delete the review. They did finally make good, for whatever it's worth. Hopefully they will do better in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Genius Failed By Roger Lowenstien","review":"What has been outlined in this wonderful book is that risk just like the future cannot be predicted accurately but can be estimated. Also the dangers of high debt and overleveraging is outlined. In short this is one of the only books that tries to mimick the real dangers of systemic risk, luckly it was avoided but the vexing question is, will it be repeated again? and are central bankers prepared for dangers like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller that keeps you on edge of your seat","review":"This financial \\"Thriller\\" would be scary and exciting if it were fictional. The fact that the story is true makes this a compelling must-read account of how wall st. greed develops to extremes. Lowenstein brings forward the emotions of all the actors in this play - something you won't read in any news account of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"story telling at its best","review":"when genius failed is an impressive narrative of how some of the greatest minds at wallstreet assembled together to create one of the greatest fiascos in the financial hostory. it is also a tale of the culture of hubris and greed at wallstreet. throughly enjoyed reading this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of Quants Made for the Non-Quants","review":"This book is fairly well-written but is toned down to suit a mass audience. Of course, with such an approach, accuracy is sacrificed. However, this book was a decent read and it was not too dragging. It actually makes a quite boring discussion (at least for normal people) into something quite interesting. How can a quant book ever become a bestseller, right?! Well, I don't think that the book presents some of the finance concepts accurately. The discussion on market efficiency contained cherry-picked quotes, and does not truly present how the academe really views the theory of market efficiency. However, for the intended audience, this is clearly definitely not a big problem. Anyway, for those who want to read an interesting part of finance history and how financial derivatives got a bad name, you can benefit from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"If you're looking for a book that teaches the perils of overconfidence in the market, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable and insightful history of LTCM","review":"The story of LTCM's rise and fall is a compelling one not only for people interested in finance, but for anyone fascinated by the spectacle of very smart people losing enormous sums of money. Lowenstein's book makes this story accessible by glossing over some of the technical details, a tradeoff of readability for depth, but still provides insight into the causes of LTCM's collapse. I recommend reading both this book and Nicholas Dunbar's excellent _Inventing Money_: Dunbar provides more technical explanations, while Lowenstein has a richer story to tell about the people involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Hedge Fund Story","review":"Chronological, detailed and informative on the LTCM fund. 236 pages including the epilogue(what eventually happened to everyone). I was entertained and wanted to read more the whole time. Seems to cover all major aspects of the fund: who the \\"geniuses\\" were, how the \\"geniuses\\" raised money, what trades they were in and how they were bailed out by a consortium of banks. The last 1/4 of the book covers the bailout situation and was my favorite part. Will probably be a classic in regards to hedge fund disasters. I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4 but it was slightly challenging to read at times because of the language and how sometimes the author would refer to this person, and that person, and this person, and that person.....at those times i gave up keeping track of who's who. I have read very easy-to-read books like \\"an american hedge fund\\" and \\"beating the street\\" so maybe im spoiled.Overall and pretty good book about a very unique fund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book in light of current events","review":"This was a well written and very interesting read. Reading this book after several subsequent financial crises definitely generated a lot of provocative thought about how the markets can be repeatedly stressed time and time again by people trying to exploit the inefficiencies of the financial system.After reading other books that chronicle financial \\"drama\\" likeLiar's PokerandBarbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, it's also interesting to see how the same characters appear over and over again. I use the word \\"characters\\", but these are in fact real people, not fictional characters... The happenings in this book are so incredible, that you just can't make this stuff up.I really appreciated the author's ability to explain to the layman how the complex financial transactions were used and how they eventually led to disaster. This clarity helps the reader appreciate the cleverness of the participants as well as the hubris and shortsightedness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Half-Story","review":"This book was a truly disappointing, disjointed, and ill-informed attempt at telling what should have been a riveting tale. It is obvious that the author does not understand much of the subject matter of the book. He totally mischaracterizes the role of derivatives traders/providers. For instance, he focuses exclusively on the risk side of an equity put seller, without recognizing that this is merely a risk transference from the put buyer. He gets some elementary points backwards, as in the time where LTCM is short volatility and, in an effort to cover, solicits other Wall Street firms to provide bids--it should have been offers.Most disconcerting was that it was obvious that most of the players involved refused to talk to the author, forcing him to piece together a half-story from a handful of sources who would talk to him, various newstories of the time, and his own Buffett book. Perhaps no one will ever have the complete story of what happened. This book clearly doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a Tom Clancy novel for financial meltdown","review":"Ok I admit it. I went into this book thinking it was going to be a long and tedious tome about derivatives and malinvestment gone mad.What a pleasant surprise. This book is extremely well written, \\"develops\\" the characters in this saga as well as most novels, and taught me everything I wanted to know about how the United States financial system was brought to the brink of collapse by an unregulated derivatives system out of control.What new LTCM's lurk out there, slouching towards Wall Street to be born? This book is a great read, and a must for anyone interested in looking behind the scenes in the US financial system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel","review":"Compelling novel.

Although you won't learn much about investing from this book, you will enjoy the ride from the beginning to the end. Long-Term Capital Management held Wall Street by its hands and thought it was on top of the world. Well, considering how much profits they made, they were. However, people at LTCM soon found out that maybe they weren't as smart as they think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight","review":"I liked the book very much. One probably needs to be in the financial sector to enjoy it properly as terminology is used all over the place.The way the story unravels is great and for someone who's not on the Wall Street it uncovers how things are done from an insider's perspective. I'd like to read more books of the same author.It also changed the way I thought about Nobel prize winners like Scholes, it shows we're all humans and can make (or get dragged into) mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable, a fun read","review":"Tremendously readable. Biggest takeaway: correlation is not stable or sticky. Don't bet on it.Lots of insight and blow-by-blow, you really can imagine yourself in this situation. This is a good treatment between narrative and mechanics, although I'd have preferred more technical detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Genius Failed,but not their Honesty","review":"The book relays the events in an entertaining manner; although the character assassinations are extensive especially when these observations are second hand. The principals of LTCM never mismarked their book during the crisis to hide the truth and dealt with it in a forthright manner.That is a truer sense of character.The markets are riddled with stories of dishonesty in the face of adversity. Was the risk at LTCM too big? In hindsight,yes. The partners paid a price for that with their net worth and with their confidence;but they never lied about the risk. This fact should not be overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like fiction","review":"Lowenstein vividly paints his portrait of a major financial failure of the 90s.

Understand that the first chapter is a downer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story and great written too","review":"The story of LTCM is absolutely interesting for everybody who's interested in financial markets and/or theory. In contrary to what some people in their review claim, the author is not saying that financial theory itself isn't useful. The story just shows how even 'the best finance faculty in the world' isn't unfailable, especially when there are ego's playing. The story is great written, with interesting details about the background and the character of the persons involved, and this makes the book hard to put down before you read it completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story and great written","review":"The LTCM-story itself is of course interesting for everybody with some interest in financial markets. What was seen as the 'most brilliant finance faculty in the world' proved to be not unfailable. I think the author explains enough about financial products to understand the whole story, even if you don't have a financial background. It includes a lot of details about the persons that where envolved to make the story really interesting and fun to read. It's hard to put the book down before you've read it completely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Financial Read","review":"WGF is a spectacular tell of the rise and fall of LTCM, just as the title reads. I was hesitant at first to read it since it was for a class, but once I started, the story never stopped rolling. I couldn't put it down. The greatest thing about the book is that you don't need much of a financial economics background to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can still enjoy this book even if you don't know much about bonds","review":"I don't really understand much about bonds(why should I?) but still managed to enjoy reading it. For me, this was a story about a bunch of really really smart guys, each an expert in the area they operate on, somehow managed to screw up royally and went broke, ouch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"but horribly mistitled. The title of the book should be \\"when greed failed\\" -- LTCM got very overconfident and overgreedy, and moved away from its quantitative base (whether or not that was that solid is very hard to tell from this book). It is clear (from the book) that the fund was not run by Black/Sholes/Merton, but by John Merriwether, who was only a genius as a salesman (additional proof of this can be found later, in that after LTCM had collapsed he started another fund [maybe two, I lost track], which had a lot of investment and lousy returns). The Nobel prize people were largely decorative.The most interesting part of the book to me was the description of the end of the fund, when it was taken over by a Fed-created consortium, and Goldman-Sachs' rather unsavory role therein. The book is worth the (rather modest) cover price just for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"required reading","review":"Although a bit dry, this is a very informative book. I would recommend it to anyone with investments, as it describes what really happens behind closed doors. Further, it gives insight into the delicate nature of our financial system."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Genius Failed","review":"WHAT DOES THIS BOOK HAVE to do WITH ME? Very much if you have a time deposit, own a mutual fund, or even just a checking account. You'll learn what all banks and funds do with YOUR MONEY by reading Lowenstein's book. Although LTCM was in a league of their own in the world of arbitrage and derivative trading, quite ordinary funds and banks follow some form of this technique. This is a book about how small our planet has become; how much the actions of a few affect us all. This is also, in the end, a gripping tale of human nature--philosopy. It's a great read, but not comforting to anyone who wants the \\"experts\\" to manage their money. Perhaps, by the end of the book the question \\"what is an expert\\" will linger in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"a page turner","review":"I find I get a lot of pleasure when I read about really smart successful people completely failing. It makes me think, as a promising failure myself, that all is ok in the world. Here we have a bunch of masters in the universe locked in a room together with their supercomputers and their supersecret formulas for derivative success lose ONE TRILLION DOLLARS! How dumb is that? A must read for stock market players like myself who don't know what they are doing and yet - I HAVE NEVER LOST A TRILLION DOLLARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"abundant facts, but lacking coherance","review":"Without a doubt, the author devoted a reasonable amount of time gathering the facts surrounding the birth and demise of Long Term Capital. However, as the author admits himself, many primary sources proved to be difficult beyond a first interview, therefore, it doesn't come as a surprise that the book packs a tremoudous amount of information pertaining to the subject, yet somehow, couldn't tie it all together succinctly. The reader may gain a clearer understanding by reading \\"Inventing Money\\" by N. Dunbar."},{"rating":"2","title":"the more things stay the same","review":"I really found this book helpful in understanding how hedge funds work.

I'm not a finance type, but Roger Lowenstein did a great job of explaining how the hedge fund operated, and the types of trades it was involved in. It certainly throws a bucket of cold water on Econometrics, and demonstrates that beyond a certain point, economics is as much of an art, as it is a science."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on Earth is he thinking?!?","review":"Utter hogwash.War is violence with a purpose not a physical phenomenon that burns itself out like a forest fire. The function of every war is not to bring peace but to acheive specific political objectives (cf. Clausewitz). If you intervene in a war, you are not interrupting some chemical reaction. You are acting politically to alter the course of the conflict: perhaps saving lives, perhaps not; perhaps helping to bring about a peaceful solution to the conflict, perhaps not.I'd like to see how \\"logical\\" Luttwak would be if it was his family and town that was being subjected to sustained genocidal attack. The clue to all this is his view that \\"other peoples' wars\\" should be allowed to run their course. You cannot but conclude that \\"other people\\" are not quite like him..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Penetrating Analysis on Strategy","review":"This book discusses the dynamic and sometimes contradictory uses of 'strategy' in five different levels: Grand Strategic level, Theater Strategic level, Operational level, Tactical level, and Technical Level. Because of the dynamic nature of strategy, conflicts of interests often arise between different levels - so that what one sees as logical at one level may not be acceptable in another. Indeed, this book sets out to address the confusing nature of the problem and puts the entire issue into perspective with the concept of 'paradox'. Historical examples are used to expound his arguments. As always, Luttwak's work is incisive and provocative. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A provocative look at the essence of strategy","review":"Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace makes for stimulating reading. Luttwak's chief argument is that strategy is conditioned by its own paradoxical logic. For example, according to the logic, any success contains the seeds of its own reversal. Thus, a highly successful weapon will soon be rendered less effective by the enemy's efforts to design countermeasures. Although much of Luttwak's ideas come from Clausewitz, the concepts are taken to a much further extreme, which results in very different conclusions. Overall, the book is well-written and readers interested in strategy will find it a must. The first section of the book (60 pgs.) outlines the main concept and is the most interesting part."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time.","review":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!

This is one of my favorite Nancy Thayer books. It has a few twists and unexpected turns as you delve into Daphne's past & present and though you can see where the story is going, you can't stop rooting for her. I was glad to see her resist Jack's overtures yet understood why things continued on as they did (I don't want to give much away). Daphne was a delightful heroine - sweet yet savvy, articulate, beautiful yet not the typical heroine beautiful. Daphne's not a skinny little thing - she's got curves (not obesity) & learns to be proud of her body. She loves her daughter and though my daughters were young when I first read it, I got a look at the complicated relationship that was to come (it did).I wholeheartedly recommend this book.

Fleming's voice has broad range and she gets a chance to demonstrate it repeatedly, as in Mozart's \\"Come scoglio\\", and then four minutes and thirty-five seconds into \\"Estrano ... ah, fors'e lui ... Sempre libera\\" her voice trills (flutters) and simply astounds. Only the introduction to Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\" seemed out of place and was a little jarring and unpleasant.

She possess a fine instrument, but if you are going to buy any of her albums, get the \\"Signatures\\" album that she recorded with Solti, \\"Visions of Love\\" (she is to die for with Mozart), the \\"Strauss Four Last Songs\\" with Eschenbach, and the full set of \\"Rusalka\\" (probably one of the best recordings of the entire opera)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classical Music is not Jazz","review":"Fleming says she has a Jazz background.

He's a less huge, more thoughtful version of Reacher, a well dressed treasury agent. I don't think I'm giving away the plot to tell you that the murder victim early in the book is Reacher's brother.Maybe Lee Child will write another book that's a retrospective with more about Reacher's brother?

This is one of the best mystery series I have ever read. Lee Child has a writing style like Robert Parker, Robert Pronzini and Lawrence Block. ; all of those authors combine great plot, compelling characters and deliberate diction that keeps you turning every page. I would highly recommend that you read every novel in the Jack Reacher series-- you will not be disppointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to continue the series...","review":"Amazing book.

This is actually the introduction of Jack Reacher. He is a terrific character, and I am looking forward to going through the whole series. The movie was fun, but not fantastic, but the books are great fun, easy reads, and quite compelling. If you like a lead man like Jason Bourne or Jack Clark, you will like Jack Reacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nonstop action!","review":"Killing Floor was a blast from start to finish!

Many claimed that David Baldacci ripped this book off in Zero Day, using the same type of hero, similar writing style, similar plot, etc.That may be true.However, I can say with authority that David Baldacci's grocery list is probably better written than this book. This book is terribly written! What are people thinking? Cardboard characters, unrealistic dialogue, ridiculous romance - this book has it all.As others have said, the one redeeming feature is that the actual plot is interesting. In the hands of a much better writer, with complex characters and realistic dialogue, this book could have been really something. But the writing, the writing! Absolutely horrible.Stay far away!

Well at least for the first few pages. The idea is pretty good: J. Reacher visits a village and get's arrested for murder which he didn't commited. I do believe some people think it is an interesting read but for me it was just to unrealistic. I mean an ex-military policeman who can fight everybody and finds every clue was for me a little too herotic. A person this perfect gives me a lack of suspense. 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?","review":"\\"I shot both of them.\\"Pretty exciting stuff.No more Lee Child for me.

The book was hard to put down. I would definitely read more Jack Reacher novels, but hope I can find a way to give a darn about the other characters.

I did not have a problem with the violence in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hook","review":"1st Jack Reacher novel. The dry cleaner, woman snatching, barn holding, Margrave Georgia is not a nice place to visit. Money laundering turns into human murdering pretty fast. And Jack's brother is one of the casualties.

Overall good action read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous from beginning to end","review":"Will admit up front that I really wanted to like this book. Jack Reacher is a no nonsense sorta guy who leaves a trail of bodies behind him. As others have pointed out, there are so many logical absurdities that you want to toss the book out the window. However, I slogged through figuring it had to get better. Sorry, but it gets worse. The Sunday \\"deadline\\" that permeates the novel is beyond absurd but is surpassed by the ending. Here is a little town that is suddenly crawling with local, state and federal agencies, to say nothing of the press, and Jack, figuring they might want to detain him for questioning (he has personally killed a lot of people including the town's mayor and the leading philanthropist so, yeah Jack, they might want a word with you), changes his clothes and hops a bus to California. Hey, no way the long arm of the law will be able to get me now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing in this book, and I mean nothing, suspends disbelief","review":"I just don't understand how this book can get ANY positive reviews. The author makes all sorts of false assumptions and ridiculous statements. I mean really... \\"The guard gives me a nod which says that if this turns out to be a mistake he was just doing his job. I give him a nod which says he's wasting his time.\\" WTF do these nods look like?If this book ever saw a real editor I'll eat my shorts. The characters are not believable. The grammar is terrible. The story is weak. The plot devices are many and seem to crop up out of nowhere.Imagine me shaking me head. Its a shake that says this book is absolutely terrible and urges people not to waste their money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, preposterous, poorly written.","review":"Implausible.

The main character cares about nothing (which is fine, it's the author's character, but I cannot relate), but the real problem is with the love interest. A police officer who falls for a transient hobo (is there another kind?) who was arrested for a brutal murder? She lets him buy her lunch and asks him to stay at her house after a few sentences of conversation across a couple of days, falling straight into bed.Even though I didn't buy into the characters, I definitely like the author's style in writing action sequences. These were well written and very descriptive, forming very clear images in my mind as to what was happening.As a cheaper ebook, I'd probably try another to see if the author evolves/improves in sketching characters, but based on this first taste of this recurring character at this price, I'll probably look elsewhere for a popular fiction series to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad For the First of a Series","review":"I read KILLING FLOOR years ago and really couldn't remember it so I went at it again. Child's hero Jack Reacher is probably too good to be true but Childs keep it interesting. Former military policeman Reacher walks into a small Georgia town and is arrested for murder.

As a Briton, it is understandable that he knows nothing about firearms, rural America, or the American criminal justice system. What is unforgivable is that he did little or no research into those subjects before attempting to write a detective novel against the back-drop of a small town police station in rural America with lots of detailed \\"gun play.\\" I have been a firearms enthusiast all my life, have lived in small town rural America (Pennsylvania, not Georgia) all my life, and have been the criminal prosecutor in my county for last five years. So, Child's cluelessness was duly noted.Detective novels are not on my usual reading menu. I thought it would be fun to go \\"slumming\\" for once. I figured this series must have something going for it, after all Hollywood made a movie based on the Jack Reacher stories. Mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Bought this book after watching Jack Reacher movie thought I would start with the first book.

I couldn't put the book down as Child had me hooked into the story from beginning to end. I specifically chose this book because I knew it was the first Jack Reacher story. I now consider myself a fan and have read two more since. There is a clear improvement in writing style in subsequent Reacher novels, but this first one is a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I was recommended the Reacher series by a friend. I was told it would be great holiday reading and she was right. Knocked it off in a couple of days. Great page turner. Not deep, but we'll written for the genre.

Sure, there were some technical flaws, but still it is better than most John Grisham books. The only thing that disturbed me was the way Jack Reacher, a drifter and stranger to town, was able to take over a murder investigation from the local police authority.

The book moves decently, though, and the action is above average. I would definitely try another \\"Jack Reacher\\" book -- at least as soon as another \\"Harry Bosch\\" or \\"Lucas Davenport\\" book -- but I would bail out if I thought Child was being this lazy again in plotting. A better book than this is the original \\"The Killing Floor\\" (70s) by Jacob Asch, or for that matter Geoffrey Household's \\"Courtesy of Death\\" (60s) with which this book shares a number of similarities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from a five star book!","review":"Look, this is just not a well written book.

It's pretty much laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much can you suspend your disbelief?","review":"To enjoy this book you have to buy into a whole lot of coincidences. Huge coincidences. The first being that the main character just happens to get off the bus in a small town in the middle of Georgia, gets arrested for murder, then finds out the dead guy is someone he knows and hasn't seen in years. You have to buy that a police officer will fall instantly in love with a murder suspect/drifter. You have to buy that the police routinely go along with the execution of the bad guys without even bothering to take them in for questioning. You have to buy huge leaps of logic that are passed off as reasonable deduction. You have to buy that no one else in the federal government would be involved with this particular investigation. I could go on, but I don't want to give away too much of the plot for anyone that still might want to read the book. I'd give it one star but I'm cutting the author some slack since this is his first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Time and Money","review":"What a total load of crap this book was. Here's the two biggest scams in publishing: 1 you don't have enough story to write a 400 page book so you fill pages with descriptions of things that really don't need describing (I loved what another reviewer wrote about using 3 paragraphs to describe a park bench!! LOL! 2 Use two page chapters like Patterson so there are lots of blank pages to fill the book out with. Every other one star review for this book was spot on. Author knows nothing about the military, choppy sentences, thin characters, over the top violence, ridiculous story, and setting a record for the use of the word \\"shrugged\\" Can't believe this guys name is above the title of the book. Don't understand how any literary minded person could like this book or recommend it. Guess I just have to \\"shrug\\" and chalk it up to to each his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"I read all of the five star reviews, then a trusted friend loaned me this book and recommended it. Still, I had modest expectations. I may strangle my friend. This book is one of the worst I have ever read, and I read a great deal of crime fiction. I hardly know where to begin. The plot holes have been aptly pointed out in other one star reviews. The writing style, and indeed personality of Reacher, is best described as \\"sophomoric.\\" Perhaps Child is trying to tap into the literate pre-teens who are graduating from Harry Potter to werewolf/vampire fiction. No intelligent adult who reads anything other than the Sunday Comics would enjoy this novel. Its only saving grace is that the print is large and one can easily skim entire pages without missing anything, so even at 500+ pages, it is a mercifully quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Maybe my expectations were too high; The Killing Floor did win the Edgar for best first novel, but I guess it must have been a weak year. Lee Child's first offering is typical of a first book, and that's the problem the story is typical. Nothing surprising or new here. It is both predictable and implausible. The book's hero, Jack Reacher, is boring. I think he is supposed to be mysterious and troubled, but I found him grating and arrogant. The book reads like a B action movie. The whole plot not only stretches the imagination, but also one's grasp of reality. It seems that Child has never left New York City and understands neither the American justice system nor small town life. Maybe I missed something, but I found The Killing Floor to be a sub-par thriller with flat characters and rather large plot holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous. Stupid. Waste of time and money.","review":"One of the worst books I've ever been exposed to. The plot is stupid, the characters are cardboard cut-out stereotypes, and the main character does the most ridiculously unbelievable things. One example - he kills two men who are following him, seemingly the first people he has killed, or at least the first ones as a civilian, and just walks away from it to go hang-out with his police officer girlfriend who is not at all concerned that he killed them. It makes zero sense start to finish. It is simply not worth writing an in-depth review of - too much time wasted on it already.Thank you Audible for implementing a returns policy - this book was the perfect candidate for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, no, no","review":"Totally unbelievable, coincidences are a sign of a lazy author who did not want to find a plausible reason for a situation. Just bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Reacher","review":"I was introduced to the Reacher series after purchasing a hard cover book while on holidays. That sent me searching on my kindle for others. I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend both it and the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This was the first Lee Child book I've read, so I intentionally picked the first one of the series. I'm a huge Michael Connelly fan and thought it was about time to give Lee Child a try. It was an interesting plot, but I found some of the situations that Jack Reacher got into were a bit unrealistic. Nevertheless, the book kept my attention. Good book, yes; great and one I'd encourage my friends to read, not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the book","review":"Really enjoyed the first of the series.

Headed out to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for ingeniuity in getting it published.","review":"Having noticed more and more Jack Reacher books at my local airport, I thought I'd give one a go. It was awful. I thought publishers were supposed to read books before letting them loose on unsuspecting customers. I will not be reading any more Jack Reacher books. Life is just too short.The books failings are too many to spend time listing them all, but a quick rundown includes:1) Ridiculously unbelievable characters2) Badly researched plot3) A constant stream of \\"no doubt about it\\"4) Inconsistent abilities of main character (crack shot who hits people at 100 feet with a pistol and then misses from 10 feet)Painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst novel ever","review":"The author obviously doesn't really know what MPs in the Army do. Or what Army service is like in general. The Jack Reacher character, the protagonist!, is COMPLETELY unbelievable. The author doesn't know firearms (revolvers? really? Snub nosed .38? He's kidding us, right?) The love interest story line was silly and adolescent in nature. The entire novel is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I shrugged, he shrugged, she shrugged","review":"Short sentences. Incomplete. He likes them. Loves them, really. Six word limit. Good for some folks. Not for me. No short attention span here. How about you? I shrugged. Why did I finish it? Dunno. I shrugged.If that type of writing appeals to you, then this is the book for you. It drove me crazy. The main character, Jack Reacher is really not very likeable. The plot is predictable and not very interesting. It just plods along in short, incomplete sentences with everybody shrugging. Blah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first of the recher series","review":"I read this bok after reading One Shot. I enjoyed it as much as One Shot and will read all of the books by Lee Child and the Reacher series. You can read any of the books in any order without missing anything.

I thought I would re-read it and compare the Reacher of then to the Reacher of now. Truthfully, Lee Child wrote his first novel with the same flair that he exhibits today. I enjoyed the trip back in time. This was a terrific read even for the second time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read","review":"Couldn't put it down.

Many thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I heart Jack Reacher!","review":"I purchased this book years ago only because I had finished my book and had a long plane ride in front of me. I was incredibly wowed by this book - I am glad I had finished that other book.I instantly adored the Jack Reacher character. Even though sometimes it seems he gets out of situations that no other human could possibly survive, I still like the character and enjoy the books. I've since read all of Lee Child's books but I think this is still my favorite.This is a fast-paced thriller that starts off with immediate action on page 1, as in most of Child's novels. The Killing Floor is definitely a page turner.I liked the character, the action, and the ending that surprised me.I always look forard to the next book in the Jack Reacher series. It never disappoints!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky me!","review":"The review of the new Jack Reacher novel says the publisher is using the slogan \\"The best writer you're not reading-yet!\\" Lucky, lucky me! I discovered Jack Reacher with this book and have read the following books with great relish! Lee Child is a great writer and Jack Reacher is a great character; someone a man would like to emulate and a woman (like me!) would love to meet. I can review 4-in-1. Read all of Child's work, starting with Killing Floor. You'll be very glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading a telegram by a toddler","review":"How did this book get so many 5 star ratings?I literally had to stop reading after two pages. The weird telegraphic writing style is VERY painful and distracting.It would be funny if I hadn't paid for it.If you can read above the level of a toddler, I'd recommend staying away from this book. If you don't believe me, download the preview and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read the next one","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action thriller books. I had not heard of Lee Child until I saw the movie Jack Reacher with Tom Cruise. A friend of mine suggested this series. I enjoyed reading this book. I kept turning the page interested in finding out what was next. Jack Reacher is an intriguing character.I am looking forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stop Action","review":"It continues on with Reacher's mission of doing that which right the wrong.Childs writing just has that Wow factor which you look for in author of skills!You always com away wanting the journey to continue!! Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"Mind you, I am a huge Reacher fan, I've read all of his books and shorts and there are some outstanding works. Of the first person writings The Enemy stands out, an absolutely brilliant piece of writing in my view. Killing Floor is also written in the first person but the style is so different from The Enemy that it gives me pause....What bugs me about Killing Floor is a) the thin thread of the story, and b) Reachers amazing bossyness -- and that everybody, even 20 year veterans of big city police work, bow in the dust in front of him and more or less ask guidance on how to tie their shoelaces (or some such).And there is nothing that stands out in the book. No sentences or paragraphs that I read again. Nothing that makes me go Aha. It puts me to sleep, is what it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killing Floor","review":"I always like the Lee Childs books. Jack Reacher is one of my favourites. The Killing floor is fast moving in her usual style"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reacher is a keeper!","review":"Lee Child's character is a big guy who cares about small stuff and is willing to help the underdog. He has the same investigative skills as Arkady Renko-Martin Cruz Smith's soulful detective and maybe even Harry Bosch. They all set it right for others and often at the expense of their own hearts. Reacher is a wanderer with one set of clothes and a bus ticket. As an ex-military policeman, he's seen it all except for the next adventure! There are 16 Reacher novels! That's good news!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Laborious!","review":"For a first novel I guess it's not horrible, but it did not meet my expectations based upon the reviews that I read before purchasing. For me, there was way too much extraneous detail. This story could have been told just as effectively in about half the number of pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard To Put Down","review":"This was my first Jack Reacher novel, but it won't be my last. The book was really hard to put down and I finished it in record time.This is not to say that it is perfect. I found several plot holes, one or two big, and the rest small. Reacher's logic for making some of his kills in the way he did flew in the face of reason, and his weapons of choice were also a bit odd. I put this down to an inexperienced author who has no prior knowledge in this area. I also question whether anyone in the book, good or bad, would have been as blood-thirty in real life as the author portrayed them.All in all, The Killing Floor was very good an well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed","review":"Good opening line. It captures you right away. A good read but a bit long. The new movie should be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic kick off to a remarkable series","review":"The first book in Lee Childs' Jack Reacher series, does a good job in setting up his grim, man of stone protagonist in this lean, well paced tale of counterfeiting, small town crime and revenge. While the emphasis is clearly on the action, Childs manages to pepper the story throughout with interesting factoids and wisdom nuggets that actually makes this read a somewhat educational experience to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and quick read","review":"Ex-military and loner Jack Reacher gets off the bus in a southern country town and is promptly arrested for multiple murders. Ever cool and unflappable, Reacher is sucked into the town's secrets and unravels the source of the town's pristine prosperity and it's murderous secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Sorry everybody but I have a problem with this plot.If any employee of any U.S. Government law enforcement agency was murdered the Feds would be all over it like white on rice.No local cops or civilian would be investigating WITHOUT the Feds taking the lead PERIOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rarity...a book I couldn't put down.","review":"This was an excellent, suspenseful, action-packed book. I really enjoyed it.Reacher, an ex-military cop, is passing thru a small Georgia town and is falsely accused of murder. He eventually is set free but he finds himself in the middle of a corrupt, organized group of thugs which includes the mayor and the largest business owner in the town. Coincidently, this group of thugs has killed his brother.Reacher sticks around to seek revenge on the killers and figure out what led him to this strange place to begin with.Lee Child does a great job on this premier. He has you at the end of your seat from the start.I am really looking forward to the next one of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"A real page turner.

I actually read this one second, and after reading Die Trying, well, it's good, but not quite as good.

I really enjoyed this change. Glad to see options."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never been so bored","review":"This book was recommended to me by my housemate who RAVES about the entire series. I started this book with high hopes as she and I have about the same taste in books and movies. I can't tell you how hard I had to work to make myself read this book. I was beyond bored. He's over descriptive to the max. He'll take 3 paragraphs to describe a park bench that has no bearing on the story. Don't get me started on the unrealistic story line. It's a bit like \\"24\\". A too long, boring \\"24\\". This could have been a short story and should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I've read.","review":"I hate to leave a book unfinished, no matter how lousy it is, and that was the only factor that got me through this one. I was embarrassed reading it, not only for the author, but for all those people on Amazon who gave it 5 stars. The story is strung together with the most unlikely and illogical occurrences. Someone said the author uses \\"shrug\\" too often. That's nothing. The dialogue is packed with sentences that end in \\"..., right?\\" or \\" ....,OK?\\" As one of the prior reviewers pointed out, this is an encouraging book to read if you've always wanted to write but felt you weren't good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Stars ? ! - I don't think so .....","review":"If this is what it takes to get published then I'm hitting the keyboard tonight. This would have to be the most disappointing read I've had in a long while. It started with enormous potential but I got a sick feeling half way through that there wasn't going to be a twist at the end - and I was right. And it's got one of those Rambo heroes - you know the ones, he has the intelligence of Einstein, the fighting ability of Tyson and Holyfield combined, and can use any weapon known to man ! The plot could have been so much more devious and more full of intrigue - but it was a clanger ! Keep away from this one - maybe Lee's others are better but I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Didn't like the prison scene or the mutilation by the psychopaths but the meat of the story was excellent. Child is a good writer who weaves an intriguing tale. I hope in future books he leaves the gross stuff behind and focuses more on the plot versus the gory details. I recommend this author but warn you that some stuff is hard to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I agree with everything the other one star reviewers said. However, I decided to write a review because I have friends who are big Lee Child fans so I bought the second book in the series, and it is just as unrealistic/bad/etc. as this book so save your money if you didn't like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hero who is also human, nice.","review":"When Mr. Child discribed the after effects of adrenaline after a life or death encounter I knew a very good author was at work. Some minor technical mistakes(firearms and military training)can easily be corrected with proper reseach and a good editor. Books this well written are hard to find. \\"Killing Floor\\" would make a great movie if not altered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thriller since Silence of the Lambs!","review":"Most of my favorite thrillers have the ability to teach me something while I stalk the seriel killer within. If you like that type of thing, DO NOT MISS Killing Floor, an instant classic of the genre. While visiting a sleepy southern town our mysterious hero stumbles into a nest of nastiness involving counterfiting, sadistic murder and greed. This fresh take on the thriller would be perfect for a young Clint Eastwood. Great"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Killing Floor","review":"The book is totally improbable from beginning to end. The characters, from the bimbo policewoman through to all the others are just cardboard cutouts and totally unbelievable as real people. The book is peppered with sickening and unnecessary violence. I really regretted buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book you wont remember","review":"An ordinary thriller with a weak story,Free violence and superman ideology.I am sure that its great success,this kind of book sell well"},{"rating":"1","title":"A paint-by-numbers action novel","review":"Uncritical readers will find this novel fun and exciting.Discerning readers will see a continuous chain of cliches and implausible events which prevent any suspension of disbelief.Author failed to do adequate research, and thus was unable to convincingly portray the protagonist's background or training. And the author's research into firearms and their use must have consisted of the Wikipedia results of a Google search for \\"what is a cool gun?\\". My 9-year-old nephew could describe the use of firearms more accurately than the author.I won't be reading any more books by this author, so I will have to live the rest of my life without knowing if the other books in this series are just rewrites of the same book, as Dean Koontz does."},{"rating":"2","title":"killing floor","review":"Great book - loved the path it took and showed conclusions to each person and the why behind it.

He has charisma and makes you feel totally safe .... bring on the entire series !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee Child/Jack Reacher","review":"Anything Lee Child writes - especially about his character Jack Reacher - is a guaranteed thriller. What a wonder character Reacher is! My husband and I cannot wait for the next book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reacher's Crazy! Don't look at 'em!!!","review":"Reacher is a good guy, in a very good way. Justice and doing the right thing is what he's about. He's like a mix of Ludlum's Jason Bourne, Eisler's John Rain, and Stark's infamous bad guy, Parker. If you've ever read Stark's, Parker novels, you know what I mean. Reacher doesn't really explain himself to anyone about anything, unless he has to, which is exasctly like Parker. He resembles Eisler's, John Rain because he's totaly lethal, and a very skilled killer. He's part Ludlum's, Jason Bourne because he used to be involved in military. Like all of these characters Reacher Kicks some major ass with the best of 'emLee Child is very good at keeping you guessing, and not making you wait too long for some action. If you like Stark, Ludlum, or Eisler, check out the guns on Child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"While the premise of the story does hinge on some unlikely coincidences, this in no way detracts from the riveting action in this gripping book. I enjoyed it from page one until the very end. Not for those who cannot handle graphic violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killng Floor Review","review":"This is the first book in the series and maybe the best. You get insight into the character, Jack Reacher, as well as a great story line, great action, and a great ending. Reacher going to prison for the weekend is quite riveting, as you can imagine it not being a pleasant place and one hard to survive in, much less escape injury. This is the first time we see Reacher in action and understand what drives and motivates him. The story centers around a small town in the south, an unidentified body, a suspect, corruption, etc. Reacher must find out who was killed, who did the killing, and stay alive the whole time. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Jack Reacher fan","review":"I downloaded Persuader when it was free for the Kindle. I found out it was number seven in a series. So, I decided to start with the beginning - sounded logical to me. I was hooked from the start. Child's does an excellent job of building the character of Reacher as well as the other main characters. I never saw the plot twist coming! I am a big Reacher fan now. Stayed up very late to finish the book - even had my Kindle reading to me in the car because I just had to find out what was going on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good parts, but not many","review":"I really didn't care for this book. I hope the second one Die Trying is better. If Jack Reacher shrugged one more time, I think I was going to scream. There were some good parts though that I was able to fly through, but a lot of the book was unrealistic even for Rambo (which Jack Reacher is not!). It was like reading a really bad script for another Dwayne Johnson movie flop. I already bought the second one, so we'll see if Lee Child story telling gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but holds your interest!","review":"We travel a lot in the car, and this book held our interest for several short trips. It was better than most we have heard lately, especially those by very famous authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"OXIGEN AND CONVINCING","review":"Child refreshes with his character the rarefied atmosphere of PI's, seems credible, with power of deduction (although miles behind Mr. Holmes) and full of action, Mr. Reacher knowledge of weapons is laudable and the plot keeps suspense and emotion. For being the first of his novels I think its a great achievement that explains the awards and recognition already granted.Blues singers of the past, southern ambiance and gorgeous police female companion (sensual, intelligent and full of desire) loks like the perfect companion for him but his fate (greek's ancient manners) is to suffer solitude and resignation makes the writing not only in solid grays but touches of color here and there. Splendid!The villians are loaded with lots of perversion and you are against them beyond common sense.For me was a wonderful \\"escape literature\\" for this summer, eager to read the second and third and fourth and...hope you enjoy the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So improbable, do people really need this just like James Bond stuff still?","review":"Move over Dan Brown and James Patterson, here comes Lee Child to sit on the bench with you. Boring and implausible. It was pretty obvious that it was all about counterfeit money as soon as he mentioned that Jack's brother worked in the treasury department. And when the great cop, Roscoe, winked at a strange man who was behind bars in her jail, that was pretty much as far as my suspension of disbelief was able to go.The most amusing part of this to me is that Tom Cruise grabbed this as a vehicle for himself. Nicole Kidman would make a better Jack Reacher, since he is about 6' 4\\". Dream on, Tom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lengthy tedious thriller","review":"Amazingly tedious for a thriller. Reacher is a good character, believable in his expertise, but a bit cold blooded in his use of violence. The book takes too long to tell everything (and I mean everything) - it seems every minute of the week long plot is chronicled as is every thought Reacher has (many repeated over and over). I hope Child fixed these flaws in later books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it wasn't my first Reacher read","review":"If this had been my first Lee Child novel with Jack Reacher as the subject, I wouldn't bother reading another. The airport scene--really? It makes it a much shorter read when you skip over some of the pages. Just cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting from the start","review":"Easy to read & easy to get into right from the start. A few twist and turns. WIll read more of Jack Reacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaws","review":"The thing that really bugged me through out reading this book was how in the world did Reacher get on an airplane to NY and back to ATL without an ID????? I just can't get passed this mistake ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrugged","review":"Lee Child loves the word \\"shrugged\\", and doesn't like commas. Jack Reacher has the potential to be an interesting alpha male, but the Child's writing needs to improve to expand the character to full potential. To be fair, this novel was copywrited in 1997, so perhaps his later work is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, adrenaline rush, despite many flaws","review":"Despite all the negatives, this is a fun read and will keep you reading.Very far-fetched and stupid coincidences. The problem is, the coincidences were not necessary- just a lazy way out for the author-- he could have come up with explanations insteadBut, the main character is fun to read. Yes, he is unrealistic and there is a lot of violence-- but that is the nature of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable","review":"The book is good enough to keep my attention, not good enough for me to want to pick up the next in the series. Big problem I had is that it's quite evident that the Author has very little first hand knowledge of several things central to the plot of the book. In his favor, he did a fairly good job with some of it. He did not do a good job researching the US Military or firearms, nor did his editor. Shame, really wanted to like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time with Jack","review":"This was the first Jack Reacher novel I read.

I've started reading the first in the Reacher series. It's fast paced and I can see how it would appeal to male and female.

If it didn't hold my interest, I'd just close the book and forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book-just loved it!","review":"The world needs a Jack Reacher, thanks Lee Child!I have recently discovered the author and really enjoy his books, also just love the character. A no nonsense drifter who solves the City / Towns problems he wonders through. The story is solid and difficult to predict which keeps you reading, thinking wow, I would love for this guy to wonder through our town. It is a very entertaining book and one I have recommended to my fellow reading friends knowing that they will be captivated by Jack Reacher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked","review":"I have to say the first book hooked me and I can not stop reading them. Glad he has written so many because I don't want them to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just OK; not enough for me to read #2","review":"I liked the suspense of this book through the first couple hundred pages but started to feel like it was just too stretched out to sustain the momentum. More importantly, I could forgive one or two of the coincidences and unlikely situations, but the last hundred pages strained credibility too much for me -- and, far worse, used too many bad thriller cliches.Spoiler-ish alert: When Reacher is given a certain amount of time to find Hubble, that's straight out of all the worst movies where the bad guy says \\"You have ONE HOUR!!\\" thus allowing the good guy time to hatch a plan and rescue everyone. These are vicious men who enjoy torturing people for fun; why wouldn't they do the same to Reacher (or Roscoe and Charlie), get an answer out of him and go get Hubble themselves? And really, no harm came to the women at all? That's just too nice and convenient.In the end I was disappointed; I was all set to buy book #2, but -- nah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be called Shrugger *UPDATED*","review":"Before I started this book I read some of the reviews.

(Give or take) Otherwise the book is quite good. Welp, back to shrugging oops I meant reading. : o )************************I originally stated that this book has the word shrugged in it 132 time but boy did I do that search wrong.

I understand that Jubilo's inability to communicate with the woman that he loved was his tragic flaw, but the author did not give me any reason to feel his sorrow and torment.

By no means is \\"Swift as Desire\\" as magical as her first novel, but I found it to be a quick and pleasurable novel to read. The plot is compelling and the reader quickly becomes invested in the outcome of the characters. Comparisions to \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" will occur, as Ms. Esquivel writes within the same genre of literature as her first book. Yet, there is a magical quality about \\"Swift as Desire\\": the author is able to effectively tell the story of her father and his life as a telegraph operator. The parallels and dualisms that operate on many different levels due to his occupation as an interpreter will keep the reader's interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical","review":"I enjoyed reading the book. It was a quick read and it covered a lot of grounds: ethnic difference, socio-economic disparities, love, desire, and that mysterious aspect of human emotion, hate.

Sounds good except that it never really goes anywhere. There are many charactors in this book. It would have been nice to know some detail about their lives. Everything is very obscure and no one is really brought to life. The love interest between Tara and Brent is so lukewarm that it's practically none existant.

The Characters started out good,but she left them all hanging with no real meaning.The only real mystery in this book was how all the characters were related to each other.The love story in the book, if you can call it a love story, was short...you would miss it.( I am not sure if this book was meant as a vampire love story or just a vampire story) The story all together was chopppy.

For the most part, their music is fantastic; however, one of the remixes on this CD just should not exist. The Sharp Boys Remix of \\"Victory\\" is terrible. They barely play the actual tune of \\"Victory\\" and lasts way too long with what they actually do play. Also, the CD seems to be too short (only 45 minutes) even though it has 2 music videos (\\"Victory\\" and\\"Fuego\\").

The topic, which most Americans have never read about, is very interesting and moving. The size of the book might scare away the casual reader, however I wished it were longer. The Isonzo campaign brought together Mussolini, Rommel, and Hemmingway, and left a mark in Italian history. Italy was pushed into the war by the powerful military elite, the fascists; it's desire to be recognized by the Allies, and its hatred of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. These factors could not save the Italian Army from being slaughtered in the mountains and valleys of northeast Italy. This book shows the human face to the war, and the futility of conflict. The Italian generals never learned how to fight a modern war, and threw a whole generation of young Italians into a senseless slaughter. The book covers the period very well, and paints a vivid picture of the campaign. I would give this a very high recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"dolinas?","review":"I haven't read the book but I read the few pages on Amazon. I learned something new.

Overall this campy film is still to banal for me to recommend. Ghost in the Invisible Bikini: GODAWFUL. Shame on Karloff for doing it. This one has more of a 60s feel, which I can't stand. I veer away from 60s films because I find the film industry really undermined the intelligence of the general public at that time, portraying them as knieve and ignorant.

The \\"I think I can...I think I can\\" concept might work well on the football field or in children's books, but it is absurd to think that it can actually affect my biological age. However, the borderline-dishonest element is that Chopra is profiting on the ignorance and fear-of-dying of the public.

While he is certainly not in the same category as Jerry Goldmsith, John Williams, James Horner or Lalo Schifrin, his work for the 'Evil Dead' movies is certainly a distinctly creepy score, one with a style that sets him apart from the rest.LoDuca relies heavily on shrieking strings and bellicose percussion; the strings, along with shrieking woodwinds like clarinets or flutes, are used heavily throughout the score. The 'quivering' nature of some of the tracks gives the audience a seriously 'creepy' feeling, almost like you're right there with the actors in the movie. The score is so fast-moving in places it's hard to follow what's going on, but the movie is kind of like that in places too.A great, fun score for Sam Raimi's horror romp.

For a man seeking a truly scientific explaination, he contradicts his own claim for the pursuit of truth with such statements. While one shouldn't expect others to agree there is no reason for such rudeness. Unfortunately, this attitude doeasn't end in the first part. Flanagan should have thought of a more professional way to state his views."},{"rating":"2","title":"reductio ad absurdum","review":"The author does a gentle job with his attempt at desouling. There is no need to take alarm once the procedure has been performed, because as the book implies, consciousness is nothing more than an epiphenomenon of the underlying physiological processes of the material brain. The word soul is an abstract theoretical entity that modern science is well on the way of proving that it's non-existent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savvy Viewing","review":"I heartily recommend this book for the home library of any parent who is concered about the content and quality of Videos your child watches. It is an understandable response to parent concerns about children and TV. The book will assist parents and children in the quest for nonpassive, more savvy viewing habits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floating oil candles","review":"The oil candles arrived very well packaged. the wick was taped to the candle which meant a lot of work to wash off the adhesive from the 66 that I ordered. They are beautiful but very labor intensive to set up especially with so many. The wick gave off black smeach even with just barely showing. It was also difficult to find the right amount of oil to keep the candle floating evenly upright. We had to cut the wicks so it barely touched the base of the lamp otherwise is tipped over. Not sure I would use them again for a business event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin","review":"These are very thin walled glass. I filled one of the floating oil candles with oil. Sank right to the bottom of the water bowel. You can only put a small amount of oil in the vessel on it sinks. They float crooked too. I will likely bury them in sand or marbles instead of thing to \\"float\\" them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining and accessible Shostakovich","review":"The conductor knew and worked with Shostakovich, and it shows. Not only that, but the orchestra is up to the task. I'm no great Shostakovich expert, but this is very entertaining.I have read that this symphony is some sort of homage to Stalin right after Stalin's death, a dedicatory of sorts -- to the composer's nemesis?? If that is true, why does Dmitri sneak in the celebratory, almost circus-like passages, that seem as though they were written by a kid just out of school for the summer? Or is it because Conductor Slovak knew that that was how Shostakovich felt -- but he still had to keep such feelings somewhat hidden? Is that why Slovak interprets those trumpet passages that way?In any case, this CD is an excellent value, and a little slice of history to boot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teachings of the Dalai Lama","review":"This latest book by the Dalai Lama is a compilation of speeches he gave in NYC in the past. It lists the main traits one should practice to fulfill a healthy lifestyle: compassion, empathy, wisdom, and so on. If you have already read 'Ethics For The New Millenium' or 'The Art of Happiness' you will find that this book repeats much of the material in those books. The main difference I see in this edition is that some basic meditation techniques are covered. Overall, it is a book that reminds us of the most important qualities one should practice to create a centered life. I also recommend \\"Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom\\" by Taro Gold which is filled with hundreds of thought-provoking and inspirational quotations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"This is an easy to read book with tons of insight into a better mindset. You should read the book slowly -- take time to reflect on each idea, such as compassion. Keep the topics of the book in mind throughout your day, whether you're a mom at home, a student at school, or working in your cubicle. It will be the first step into inner peace and practicing compassion in every day life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I just saw the Dalai Lama recently, and wanted to hear more of his teachings.

Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment. Two stories were being told simultaneously but the book focused more on Jill Ferrell and Scott Randall's interaction (both white), which was a lot more interesting than the interracial couple's relationship.Jill and Scott's romance had more depth; whereas, Kris and Tom's relationship seemed too shallow and the author completely skipped over the beginning of the relationship of \\"how they got together\\"... we are told right away that Kris is in love with Tom....how boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!! by Dorinoel","review":"I was excited to see an interracial book in this series but now that i read it I wish I did'nt. first of it really tells two storys but not one of them with any depth the author swicthes from one story two another kind of abruptly.She does not really describe the charecters to well I don't know what they really look like and I did not know their motovation for being together.

This story seeks to address a current trend of writing about interracial (IR) relationships.This story focuses on two couples - Kris & Tom and Jill & Scott. The story of the couple not depicted on the cover (Jill & Scott) is more interesting than that of the interracial \\"lead\\" of the story. This books lacks some of the basics to a good read...it fails to build or sustain an interest in the characters who are the supposed main storyline and the main couple of the book lack an intrinsic chemistry.For a good book featuring an interracial story, try others such as \\"At Last\\" by Lisa Riley.

I have found listed in a discography that a 2 CD version of \\"Exorcising Ghosts\\" was released in the >country< Japan. It's a 2 CD set which does in fact have extra tracks compared to the domestic CD release. What I got for a whopping ($$$) from ... is an import from >HOLLAND<, and is exactly identical to the domestic release, NO EXTRA TRACKS!

First of all, the writing is terrible. Even the punctuation is terrible. Now, we all know that some writers who lack technical skill can still put out a damn good yarn. Not this one. There is no emotional punch to the story. Character development is flat as the proverbial pancake. Now, at this point I must say I was so distracted by the lack in these areas, I could have missed some plot stuff that MIGHT have been interesting. But I sincerely doubt it. Oh, yeah. The romance in the book? NOT! Here is yet another author who engineers a \\"Fated Love,\\" in order to avoid the development of relationships. A total waste of money & time. Since I see no potential in this author, I will NOT be troubling to check out subsequent books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"I'm glad I took a chance on this unknown author.

Really, I did. But when the highest praise that you can give comes to, \\"I lasted halfway through before reading the end and tossing into the Salvation Army donation bin\\", you can probably guess the tone of the review. Now while this book isn't as bad as a can of munga beans, or shoes with the soles falling off, it still is very dodgy. It almost feels like a 'pay-to-publish' job.The plot is thin, the main charactera are weak and poorly developed and the only strong impression I got was that the author was trying to shove their personal bandwagon regarding the acceptace of witchcraft and SM through my poor overtaxed frontal lobe. Perhaps a little less preaching and flag waving and a little more story would be nice.In short, don't get this - watch a re-run of a REALLY bad episode of Buffy and you'll get more value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Expect A Little Proofreading to Help?","review":"The publisher proclaims \\"Now with proofreading\\" -- as though correcting a few comma splices is going to make up for shallow characters, mindless gore, and stilted dialogue.

Pybus has almost no information on Lillian Alling's life or supposed epic hike to Siberia. In fact, she doesn't even know her name. Lillian Alling is largely a guess. In the end, she finds a few tidbits and one first hand account and from that weaves a wispy fairy tale. What the reader finds instead is an often fascinating, if unintended self-portrait of the author -- a woman frightened by wilderness and unable to comprehend anything beyond her own limited and narrow world view. As when she mocks rural Americans or expresses \\"astonishment\\" that readers of Jon Krakauer's \\"Into the Wild\\" see anything more than hubris in Krakauer's protagonist.The interactions between her, her travel companion, and her thoughts along the way are mesmerizing, if often painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but could have been great...","review":"I read this book while taking a Refugee and Immigrant Perspectives class. In the first third of the book, Pybus presented a historically strong case for her heroine (statistics, archives, interviews, etc.). Then, Pybus begins to profile her own journey - nearly overshadowing her writers' pursuit of Lillian Alling. While I found the final resolution more realistic but slightly less climatic than I had been expecting, Pybus' travels and observations lend themselves to the wild Alaskan frontier and the dangers of walking/driving/living there. Overall, a good read but perhaps should be renamed: The Woman Who Walked to Russia And The Writer Who Drove to Alaska. Now I'm off to read Into The Wild..."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This isn't a good book. Frankly, I'm surprized that there are any good reviews of this book.

The novel is full of eccentric characters who create situations bursting with emotion.Rosa Fiore grows up in a rural Sicilian house where the kitchen (la cucina) is the center of life, its heart and soul. Rosa is the only daughter in a large family where cooking is a labor of love. She is an accomplished and legendary cook by the time she is a teenager.Rosa leads a self-imposed, solitary life as a librarian in Palermo after fleeing her country home when her lover is murdered. Twenty-five years later, a mysterious Englishman enters her life, captivates her, and together they have a summer of intense physical and culinary passion.This is a rollicking story of love and life as feasts to be enjoyed to the fullest."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"La Cisterna\\"","review":"It is a rarity for me not to enjoy a book about romance, about Italy, or about food, so this seemed like heaven when I read the description. I must agree that the heroine is portrayed as rather uncomely, and is stereoptyped as the \\"old maid\\" who hides herself in books and finds joy only in food. This story was UNbelievable and silly - trying to be a take off on the exquisite \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" just does not work for this authoress. I was on a six hour plane ride and read the entire book by time we were at the halfway point and was BORED by the end. Do not waste your lire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"La Cucina","review":"Don't bother reading this book. It tries to imitate Chocolat, Water for Chocolate, etc...but fails miserably. It is a trite take on cooking in Italy. You really don't get a good sense of scilian food and the author tries to keep you interested with tawdry sex scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad, but the setting/food are great","review":"I loved Like Water for Chocolate and other novels in the magical realism genre, but this one doesn't measure up. The pace is jerky (and what's the spring, summer, etc structure all about?), the texture all wrong (she gives equal weight to everything that happens to the heroine so that when events occur that are supposed to be significant, you have no idea why), and there is a distance between the reader and the main characters. Some of the writing is just laughably bad (\\"Why did he go? When would he be back? Would she ever know who he was?\\"). This woman really, really needs writing lessons and a good editor. Sicily sounds fab though, and Prior certainly seems to know her Sicilian cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written unusual book","review":"I did not expect to like this book.

The book is remarkably sensual and very tastefully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel with a mix of drama and wit","review":"After I finished reading this book, I realized that I like it more than I thought. This book is definitely an inquired taste. You want to stop reading it but you also want to keep going, at least that's how it was for me. I enjoyed the plot and the ups and downs for the character.

That part Lily Prior did very well. I was really enjoying it until Rosa went away and became... a librarian. I must agree with Bonnie Smothers of Booklist here. It was very tiresome to read about Rosa the librarian. At least there was no tightly bound hair with pencils sticking out of it. If the author was going to rely so much on stereotype, why didn't she just put Rosa in a bakery? Everyone knows that fat people eat all the time, what better place for a fat person than in a place where she could stuff herself all day. Okay, I'm being sarcastic now, sorry. And the ending. The ending! No, I'm not going to reveal the ending. But boy what a disappointment. I got the impression that the author lost complete interest herself at this point and just ended the thing. So, if you still really want to read this, go get it at the library. That way you won't waste any money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food, Passion, Italy","review":"La Cuncina was a delightful read. We follow the life of Rosa, who is a master cook growing up on a prosperous Sicilian farm. At 18, her lover is murdered and Rosa in her grief cooks and cooks. Her first person account of this is absolutely hilarious. Eventually, Rosa goes to Palermo and becomes a staid librarian for a quarter century. Then an English gentleman and chef comes to the library to do research and both he and Rosa are smitten. Their following affair is really something to read--spicy but not lurid. Throughout the story, author, Lily Prior, throws in some magical realism that ups the pleasure of this yummy read.

The characters are either silly cartoonish sterotypes dreamed up by an apparently ignorant foreigner or just plain bizarre. Yet I don't think the book was intended as pure farce. It's pretentious enough to be sprinkled with totally unnecessary and distracting fragments of sentences in \\"Italian,\\" but so sloppy that the \\"Italian\\" is not even written correctly. (And no, these so-called Italian sentences aren't in correct Sicilian either. They're just an incorrect mess.) The plot is crudely constructed, the writing is clumsy, the characters silly, the dialogue just terrible, and all in all, it reads like a young teen's first attempt at creative writing.

I taught a recent course on feminism and politics using Lorber as my main theoretical text, but found that its definitions of the different kinds of feminism were analytically muddled. Rather than clarifying differences between Marxist, liberal, postmodern and other feminisms, the descriptions blurred the distinctions and failed to emphasize the ways in which liberal feminism has been challenged on different and sometimes competing grounds by the alternatives. The result may reflect reality--feminism has become an eclectic mix of ideas--but the lack of clarity about how each type emerged and why makes the book less than helpful as a basis on which to build a course.

You know the saying...\\"if it's too good to be true it is\\". That is the case with these knifes. These are knock offs and I'm not sure how it's even legal to sell them with that stamp on the blade. Blades are flimsy and WILL rust. I do not run through dish washer because quality knives should be hand cleaned. Even with the extra care, less than two months and almost all the blades have rust. Too late to return them so shame on me.

They are beautiful and sharp! They are so thin that when I pulverize garlic with it feels like the knife will snap in two. I also learned that they stain very easily. I am not the cleanest of cooks so my knives are not washed and dried immediately after using them. They may sit out until after dinner and then drip dry in the dish tray. First night I had them I used them and found the stains. Unless you are a dainty, OCD chef I would consider a different set.

The outside box clearly said #15707 but the inside box (containing the knives themselves) was marked #15705 and only contained 12 knives rather than the 17 indicated in the ad. Interesting that it didn't appear that the box had been opened so I think the problem was probably in the initial packaging at the plant. Nevertheless, this is very frustrating.

Before wrapping them, I opened the box & I noticed immediately that these knives are less than half the quality of the forged steel Synergy knives I own. I sent them back & gladly purchased the forged knives for twice the price. These knives were very light weight & did not have any qualify feel.

At first glance the set looked great. It has all the necessary items, and it was a good price.Using the knives is another story. The chef and carving knives have a flat blade, making cutting difficult (I prefer a slightly curved blade for easy chopping/slicing). In addition, all blades are serrated, and I like smooth blades. The metal of the blades are also fairly thin.That said, after the first dishwashing of the steak knives, the blades became very rusty. If you want to hand wash and dry each piece immediately, this won't be an issue - but for the rest of us that use a dishwasher, I would stay away from this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice but.....","review":"Love the knives, but be careful. I thought that the block had a knife for each of it's slots. Not so. I did receive all of the knives it claimed to include but there are still some empty slots that need to be filled. SO!

Oh well. no big deal, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted Almost Immediately","review":"I bought this set to replace a set of bargain knives i had that were rusting. I never put this set in the washing machine, hand washed only. Didn't matter. Started with small rust spots on even unused knives within a few weeks. Now i have to scrub knives to remove the large rust spots, small ones don't come off.Aside from the aesthetic looks, this is just as bad as the $30 or cheaper sets. I live in Hawaii, so perhaps humidity had something to do with this. But i see no difference from this set and the bargain ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Bought this set about 9 months ago and couldn't be more disappointed. The quality is poor, the knives are light and flimsy, and they began rusting almost immediately. Even with minimal use, the knives have dulled to the point that we don't even use them anymore. Not sure how they got the J.A. Henckels name on them, but they are crap and a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I thought getting a set of Henckel knives meant i was getting quality. Nothing could be further from the truth, with this set at least. Two key problems: One, the knives have begun to rust in spite of the facts that they are hand washed and dried each time they are used and they are only about 3 months used. Two, they have gone completely dull. Not a quality product, and I will not buy Henckels ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Henckels...higher end knives.","review":"Wanted something above the everyday knife, but not as high-end as our $350 set of 7. We liked the expensive Henckels, so figured we would add these to our new stainless decor. After about 4 months, we started to notice rust spots and the rubber grips were pitting, slightly. We do not wash these in the dishwasher; we learned that lesson with a more expensive Soduku knife that was ruined. The micro-serrated blades are good for cutting most meats and vegetables, but aweful for rare/soft meats and cheese. Overall, they aren't terrible knives, just not worth the $70 price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had RUST almost immediately","review":"I bought these knives to replace a cheap set that I had bought at Wal-Mart. I was sooo disappointed. The knives were rusty almost immediately. In fact, some were already rusty when I first took them out of the box. Don't waste your money, buy something else.

I wanted a set that was functional,good looking and reasonably priced. This 17 piece set fit the bill nicely. I have read some of the other reviews which mention rusting and dullness. I have not encountered any of these problems. It is true that any quality steel will rust if water is left on it,but with care the knives will not rust. They remain sharp as the day I got them and I use them frequently. One note though, they really are not diswasher safe but just as I would not put my Lenox china in the diswasher, I would not subject any quality cutlery to the brutality of the diswasher. If you are a \\"Family Chef\\" like me, buy this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knives","review":"Great set of knives for the money.

Very easy to cut with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to maneuver Workhorse","review":"Bought the Milwaukee 44915 hand truck for several reasons.1) Made in USA. For me that means quality construction and, if needed, being able to contact the manufacturer.2) Large weight capacity. This truck is being used in my vintage furniture refinishing / sales business. At 800 lbs. capacity, it is doubtful that I'll come up against anything that can't be moved with the 44915.3) Large tires. This makes moving items, even over uneven lawns, floors, etc. very easy.3) The D-handle allows one hand use so it is easier to close a door while still balancing a load.4) Large toe plate. This simply makes carrying large or odd sized object a bit easier.5) Fold-down accessory bar. Great for carrying boxes or lighter furniture - but still heavy duty.This is a well made, heavy duty hand truck that is still relatively light weight and easy to maneuver.

It was absorbing, full of historical information, and devoid of lecturing or recitations of details that might bore a tween or a teen. Swear on my honor, you can smell the smells, see the streets, feel the dirt!The immediacy of London of the 19th century could make this book open a door for a young person to learn about history and travel as something other than dates and dusty monuments.

I picked this book up at a used book store (to the author's chagrin), and, even though its a young adult mystery, this 43 year enjoyed it. I read it with my 7 year old son, and his comments are below. As a mystery goes, and as historical fiction, it is quite well done.

He managed to leverage his good fortune with a style of leadership which maintained GE's strong status. I was sadden, however, with how he dealt with his life. Almost everything Mr. Welch writes of deals with powerful yet simple business concepts and a tiresome list of acquisitions and divestitures. I'd like to understand more of Mr. Welch as a human being - not the simple-minded businessman who dismisses his relationship with his first wife in a page. Although the book seems to indicate otherwise, I hope his life meant more than GE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! Will wait for Version 2.0.","review":"The first half of the book was great, but in the second half I could feel that he was getting squeezed by deadlines: the transition, the Honeywell merger, and the fact that he had to move over and turn things over to Jeff. He wrote that thanks to the book, he got out of Jeff's way up to September 7. It would be interesting how Jeff, or rather the GE team, manages in the next couple of years after the events of Black Tuesday. Overall, the book was a great great great read, especially the final chapters (less detailed, but enough to give the reader key points of Jack's last few weeks at the top). Read the whole book, cover-to-cover, on my return flight from JFK to Anchorage to Taipei and Manila. A real page-turner! I'll read it more peacefully one of these days, especially that cute chapter on golf. Tried his tip (finishing your swing) on the driving range, and you know what? It works.

My dad worked for GE for 43 years; but I had no idea of the many ventures GE is involved in. Jack Welch gave a fascinating insight into the inner workings of one of the most successful companies in the world without padding his own mistakes and foibles. I was extemely interested the in the Hudson River situtation and also the failed Honeywell merger; both told in great detail - along with the 7 year hunt for his successor.One doesn't have to be a corporate execuitve to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom Line: Execute","review":"It's a mildly interesting read, but I'm not sure it's worth the time. All you walk away with, really, is an understanding of the fact that execution matters.To be fair, there's only so much to be said for a guy who inherited a very strong balance sheet and a huge management team (where hiring clearly matters less than trimming the fat).So, instead of the 'how' (basically strong management techniques forcefully applied), it answers the 'what'. Which is why the book reads like a list of initiatives rather than how they were conceived. (Bizarre for someone who clearly prides himself on shaping the creative chaos of emotionally charged team meetings.)Anyway, it's an easy to read, albeit poorly written (repetitive). And, as other reviewers have pointed out, overly resplendent with instances of name dropping GE's executives, various golf courses, hotels, buildings etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Jack Welch is the world's most successful CEO.

He is smart and excels in chemical engineering at the University of Massachusetts and gets his PH.D at the University of Illinois. He starts his career at GE in 1960 and rises quickly to the top until his retirement in 2001.

The book itself is little more than an account of where he went and what he did, with the rare nanosecond of self-doubt always followed by self-vindication and congratulation. He could have had his diary published and gotten much the same results.However, what he did to GE and its employees is loathsome. The unbridled avarice and lack of concern for anything but the bottom line injured thousands and likely killed hundreds. I am astounded that people hold him up as a paragon of the modern businessman.Jack Welch, Robert Allen of AT&T;, Lou Gerstner of IBM are only a handful of the hundreds of greed-driven, ego-ridden businessmen who more than exemplify Gordon Gecko's motto that \\"Greed is good.\\" God have mercy on their souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Man","review":"Jack Welch is no secret he was in the right place at the right time.

This orientation leaves several questions in my mind. First, how much of GE's technology was paid for by US taxpayers? And benefited from a favorable business climate in the US? Was Jack's plan to live in the US, run corporate offices here, and move technology and jobs to China? Given this plan, why did GE get 150 billion of TARP money, paid for by our children's debt? Why not ask the Chinese for it? hmmm. (In addition, I am told GE exploited a legal loophole in TARP law so they don't pay it back. Google it if you don't believe me.)Actions speak louder than words, and if this is your idea of \\"Winning,\\" get another role model, because this pan-handling is my idea of \\"Losing.\\" Granted, this robbery of our children didn't happen during his ascendancy, but it was the house that Jack's leadership built..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel icky just touching the book","review":"In light of the new news, should the book be called \\"Jack: Straight from My Bed?\\" It's nice when a \\"hero\\" of business shows his true colors.

To me it was an interesting ride being taken from every corne of the company. I had no idea that they owned NBC, I found that very interesting. The book was easy to read, and while I probably only need about 20 year updates on GE I don't regret reading it. Of course he had his ego problem. Somehow he saw Jeryy Seinfeld as the funniest comedian in the world and believed that American has outright choosen Jay Leno as their favorite late night host.

Most of those titles portrait Welch as the successful business person everybody would like to be. However, I would like to warn the reader that the professional success of famous CEOs cost them their families. It's hard to believe how Welch was able to manage thousands of relations with millions of people at GE, while on the other side he failed on a relation with only one person: his wife. By the way, how many wives has he had??? Is that success??? In which planet???Now about the book . . . it's a good title but only read it if you have never before read a title about Jack Welch or GE; if you had, it's more about the same old stuff, and I would recommend your spending your money in a smarter way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack: Its all about Me!","review":"If your looking for ideas from this book, from the master of ideas, this book falls way short.

The middle section (approximately 100 pages) are quite good, especially the chapter about \\"the people\\".Stop again, when he starts discussing the various GE acquistions, as the art of each deal is missing.Sorry, Jack, but your book doesn't due the work you did at GE justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"TELLING IT LIKE IT IS","review":"Jack Welch tells it like it is and reads it like a pro in this resume of his business life.

He has been a proponent of Six Sigma quality, globalization, and e-business, while in the meantime raising GE's market cap by over $450 billion.

In one part he is informed of a giant hole in the accounting of the company's assets, which he promptly empties the contents of his stomach.

Unfortunately I had already read \\"At Any Cost\\" the story of GE under Jack W's rein. One only needs to read the first 50 pages of \\"At Any Cost\\" to realize what Welch is or was. The next 300 pages merely substantiates ones inital conclusion. CEO of the century? Get real; Jack was and is a jerk!!!. Unfortunately I cannot return the copy of \\"Straight from the Rut\\" remaining. I have no intention of reading what Jack thinks of himself but for those of you insisting on Jack's version, read \\"At Any Cost\\" before heralding what Jack claims. I will hand it to Jack. He's the greatest fiction writer of all time. Why isn't zero stars available as a review score?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight From the Butt","review":"I could not believe that I wasted my $$ on this book. I read through it very painfully searching for something worth reading about, but ended up wasting my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"PPO","review":"Early in the book, Jack mentions his first real job was to develop polyphenylene oxide (PPO). I think he dropped this subject after he blew up the prototype factory and was handed a plum, easy, lucky assignment, fast growing Lexan... from which he zoomed. Whatever happened to PPO?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This was interesting. I was interested how he enabled a big company like GE to grow year after year, and his methods were worth reading. I have to say that the methods he used for the company to grow and stay flexible are methods I've read in a number of other management books. So I didn't really read anything NEW. But it was worth reading to see those methods tested and see them pass the test. Welch doesn't have much subtlety in his personality, nor does he seem to be introspective at all. That makes much of this book seem like a long sequence of big bland bromides. Not much RESONATES in this book. But men of action often are not deep thinkers. That's what makes them men of action. If you liked this book, I would also recommend Richard Branson's LOSING MY VIRGINITY and David Mahoney's CONFESSIONS OF A STREET-SMART MANAGER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight from the gut, and not always palatable","review":"I picked up this book because I want to know more about GE, an American industrial icon, and its legendary leader, Mr. Jack Welch. The one thing I like about Welch is that he talked in a very straightforward and candid manner, although at times he appeared rather defensive. You may not agree with his management philosophies, but keep in mind that this is an autobiography rather than a management text. As I read along, I was somehow reminded of Al Dunlap, the discredited former CEO of Sunbeam Corporation. I observed that Welch and Dunlap are similar in a few ways. Both come across as having over-sized egos, are highly authoritarian, paternalistic and often ruthless. The big difference laid in the bottom line of the corporation each ran, but do not forget that Dunlap used to be a favourite of Wall Street too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egomaniacal ranting!","review":"As someone who has served as chairman of a publicly-traded company, I had a considerable amount of respect for Jack Welch before I read this book.Upon reading it and learning something of his personality, I discovered that he seems like a profoundly insecure, self-absorbed little man. Talk about a vaccuous personality! Of course I can appreciate his professional accomplishments at GE, but I can also respect those of IBM's Louis Gerstner, who doesn't need to wallow in hundreds of pages of self-congratulatory drivel. Alternatively, give me founder/innovators like a Bill Gates or a Steve Case, who, incidentally, avoid the limelight unless it's thrust upon them to further their aspirations. To me, this book represents the embarrassingly pathetic ramblings of a soft-handed cookie-cutter corporate executive for whom a game of golf is about as creative as it gets. Simply put, \\"Jack\\" is a rather uninteresting book about a notably uninteresting person."},{"rating":"1","title":"No epiphanies here","review":"Obviously ghost-written, this book is only of interest to those with minimal business experience. It's purpose is to make you think that Jack Welch never made a mistake. So all you GE stockholders, listen up!To those who DO have business experience, you already know that there are loads of errors, infighting and intrigue in a company the size of GE. If you expect to read about them here, you won't.If you're looking for new business concpets, try a Guy Kawasaki book. If you want to read about business strategy, read Kenichi Ohmae. If you're at Business 101 level and can tell when you're reading ad copy, try this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"It was great reading about how one person rocketted a mammoth company like GE into the halls of fame... For those that are interested in business, this book is great to find out more about wheeling and dealing and coporate cultures.I found the first half of the book fascinating, but it sometimes gets a little too 'list-like'- chronicling every small deal that they worked out; but for sure all the major ones and the issues they faced.The book is full of interesting anecdotes and gives you a bit of an insight into how Jack worked. While he was portrayed as a great 'cheerleader', I am sure that he has a ruthless, fearful side to him, but you only get a small glimpse of that. It would be interesting to hear more of that!Worth the money but maybe not in hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bloated 1 Minute Manager","review":"My dad and I can argue about this one all night long! He thinks the sun rises and sets on this book. There are indeed some wonderful tips on how to manage a business at the very back of the book, but the rest of his ghost-authored book is a puffed-up piece of boring golf course self-indulgence that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Just a flat out boring and unremarkable read. Jack Welch, or \\"Neutron Jack\\" as he is known in some circles, has long been known as a pioneer of outsourcing, exorbitant executive salaries and depressing working class wages. All this aside - I still had an interest in this man and was curious to hear his scoop on business success. I can firmly say I no longer have an interest in Mr. Welch. The writing lacks any flair and his story and advice comes across as rather pedestrian (even for a CEO). Frankly you could fill an airplane hanger full with more interesting (and ethical) CEO's."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever written","review":"I was forced to buy and read this 500+ page book for my Intro to Business class. I usually like reading pretty much anything, but this book is unbearable. The author is so full of himself and constantly throws around names, places and dates of every little meaningless event. It's very distracting when you're trying to read the story and learn something out of it. People, stay away from this book like the plague. I did learn a few things about GE, but nothing I wouldn't have learned reading its Wikipedia entry, but that was after I learned to weed through the BS.If you want to read something entertaining, this is not the book to read. If you love unimportant dates, want to learn the names of GE workers, and read a guy brag about himself, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and irrelevant. What a disappointment.","review":"This is Jack's book: \\"then George and I did this great thing; I knew he would be great; that's the value of Six Sigma.\\"Repeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"rushed\\" book that could have been much better","review":"Jack was actually interesting for the first few chapters, but then the author seemed to lose interest and just got through it, obsessing on himself. His time at GE was not put into historical context,i.e., the fall of the Berlin Wall and communism, the boom of the 90s--from which he profited greatly, terrorism attacks, etc. It's a very inward look at GE and everything that he personally did there, with lots of \\"I\\"s in th text. In the early part of the book I liked the main character, but by the end he came across as an egomaniac. Certainly not a great leader. Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a boring book","review":"One reads books like this to get insights, knowledge, and inspiration. Welch talked and talked and talked and I learned nothing. It is when I finally got completely fed up with his self-aggrandizing narration that I realized the only insight of the book seems to be: companies, especially gigantic ones with many levels of executives, tend to be very resilient (of pointy-hair boss errors). Unless the CEO is *really* stupid, he/she can't really screw up that bad. They are largely irrelevant. (I don't know if the statement is true or not. But that's what the book reads like to me.)Of course, if your goal is to climb the corporate ladder, you might draw much more than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This is a truly magnificent book that give great insight into the strategy and method of one of the most successfull leaders ever.It is very inspiring to read how Jack Welch has managed a company as big as GE with relatively simple means, and this should be an encouragement to all in senior management.Further the book is filled with good anecdotes and a humorous approach to nearly everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PERSONAL ACCOUNT, RATHER THAN MANAGEMENT LESSONS","review":"Welch is definitely one of the top managers in the U.S., at least as far as popularity goes. From this book, we are able to see that he is a man of vision and strong will, both of which he uses to lead GE in a period of great growth.I was a little disappointed by the lack of detail on many sections, such as Six Sigma and other GE management innovations, which I expected to find in this book. I found it to be much more of a history than an analysis text, which is okay for readability (hence the 4 stars), but does not help much in drawing interesting lessons.Given this man's significance to the stock market exuberance and the star CEO mania of the 1990s, I think it is an important book to help one understand the time. The concise style is also a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview of Jack","review":"Jack Welch does an adequate job of telling his story. For me, the most interesting part of the book was from his childhood to his early days at GE. It is nice to see a straight-shooter \\"make it.\\" Later in the book, Mr. Welch gives the uninitiated a nice tour of the GE review process. It is certainly a monument to his ego, but nobody forced me to read this book! Lastly, the method of goal setting he describes in this book is particularly effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"A razor's edge between self-confidence and hubris","review":"About half way through his book, Jack Welch observes that \\"there's only a razor's edge between self-confidence and hubris.\\" He implies that he rarely crosses the line, when, in reality, the unbiased observer is likely to conclude after reading \\"Jack\\" that he crosses the line frequently. If, however, the reader can tolerate the continuous self-congratulation, there are a great many insights to be gained in this book. (To be fair, diffident people do not accomplish what Welch did.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"A name dropper extrodinaire, this book basically returns the \\"back scratch\\"of those who helped him to the top.While I am engaged by his story, and admire the accomplishments, this book is a biography not a teaching tool. The one thing that everyone will come away with is the importance of \\"politicing\\" in American business.Read it for the story but not for the substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go with your gut .. read the book! :-)","review":"Can't ignore this book, a must read.

One leader assuming the lions share of the credit is misguided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a datebook","review":"This is a pretty disappointing book. A lot of names and dates put together which don't mean much - a lot of dry facts. It would have been much better if Welch had focused on a couple of challenges and discussed in detail the process he used to come up with a solution and how the solution was executed. Also, it would have been more fun if he had documented his rise in GE and how he achieved it rather than focusing the bulk of the book on his CEO days. Iacocca did this very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why read it now?","review":"To be very obvious, just read the review by Donald Wayne Mitchell. If you do that, then you might as well save your money, because he summed up just about every detail in the book. The only things he really left out are the names of each and every person he came up with (or against) that Jack details in his book. As an student/employee of GE, Jack's reign is easily visible, and an inspiration to a countless number of employees in the Company that are confident that they were lead in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Welch, a great American hero? I don't think so.","review":"Jack Welch made GE prosperous by laying off tens of thousands of American workers and transferring those jobs abroad for the sole purpose of exploitation of poor peoples and countries. His last year as CEO for GE, he earned over $200 million plus another $57 million in stock options. That is FOUR TIMES the COMBINED SALARY OF GE's 15,000 MEXICAN WORKERS. Who couldn't run a profitable company that way? Jack Welch is the kind of person that is killing our economy in the long run; by taking jobs away from American workers and by threatening our relations with other countries that GE, and many others just like it, have continuously, mercilessly exploited for cheap labor. The wages some of these workers receive makes their labor tantamount to slavery."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid money for this?","review":"Words can't express how much Jack Welch loves himself. That doesn't stop him from trying to on each and every page of this trip down ego lane. If you want to hear about all of his globe trotting vacations with friends and associates, or how he took up golf and won a club championship, or better yet all of the CEO jobs his underlings got because of his masterful tuteledge, this book is for you!! If none of this interests you - don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corporate growth strategies","review":"What makes an 'A performer'? Jack's years at GE have seen their share of successes, narrow escapes, and missteps along the way - and it is Jack's treatment of the former that makes this an incredibly insightful book to read. You cannot be right all the time, nor should you expect your peers or subordinates to be, but at the same time, it is your role as a leader to identify and cultivate the best performers continuously. Yes, that means letting go of your bottom 10%, every year.Aside from being an inspiring and educational read, the book also offers a rare glimpse of the corporate growth strategies and acquisitions made by GE - a side of corporate America that is rarely covered and poorly understood outside of the top financial circles.Highly recommended for any entrepreneur and business owner out there. (Yes, the lessons apply outside of multi-billion dollar corporate context.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"kayak","review":"The product is all right.

The light on the SC006 is poor... whether it's via the crank, sunlight, or AA batteries. And, if you need it during a blackout, you'd better have memorized the location and positioning of the confusing 'array' of the slide switches on the unit because it will take a lot of trial and error to put them in the correct position while you're in the dark.

This is just so predictable and below average, and there's a lot of other bands out there today making much more intersting music. The song Lord is pretty good, probably my favorite on this album, but the rest of the album kinda floated past my ears, nothing ever really grabbed me or got me excited.

Nothing new here. Combining parts Crichton and Cook, THRESHHOLD presents us with a standard plot and typically beautiful/brilliant characters who always seem to have just the right idea, or just the right thing in their pockets to get them out of a jam. Bolstered somewhat by a strong opening and fast-paced resolution. MOUNT DRAGON is a better novel, and that wasn't even all that good. Stick with ANDROMEDA STRAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I read this book, but I don't know why.

Is it a coincidence that readers who think Mezrich is a \\"national treasure\\" write almost entirely in cliches--just like Mezrich?

You're best off getting the full albums, especially for the \\"Radioactivity\\" cuts, which are much better when heard in the context Messrs Hutter, Schneider, Bartos, and Flur intended them to be heard in.

The performance is quite good, as is the sound, and among Slovak's recordings of Shostakovich symphonies on Naxos, only his 14th is better.

My highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories About Hypermasculinity Never Disappoint","review":"Jones' best stories here, the ones that deal with the aftermath of Vietnam, are about the conflict between the soldier's need to develop a predatory, demonic spirit to survive in wartime and how that spirit, so hypermasculine and effective in war, is tragically in conflict with civilian life as the soldiers seem to enter a demonic world of no return. Jones' title story, reading like an autobiographical essay, is about a man who tries to make that return and salvage his life and save it from nihilism. Unlike Krebs in Hemingway's \\"Soldier's Home,\\" the narrator finds at least some kind of love (he loves his dogs) as he courageously lives on with his deep psychic war scars.

It starts off with three Viet Nam stories, then eight other stories. Many of the characters and themes repeat-Viet Nam vets, boxers, epilepsy, philosophy. The stories are raw and the characters are intense, violent, very flawed heroes. Online, the majority of the criticism about the stories is that they exude a stereotypical machismo. I thought the opposite. I thought the machismo was very unstereotypical. I can't think of anyone I've read about who would break your face and then contemplate Schopenhauer. There was one story, about a woman dying, that I thought was a bit melo-dramatic, but most of the stories were quick, hard-hitting, and insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Description","review":"Since Amazon didn't provide a product description, here is the one from the rear cover of the book.

So many of my colleagues have borrowed my copy of this book that it is now in tatters. The format is simple; It provides a simple format for every type of poem you could think of, and ideas for artistic presentations of the final product. Our building has grades 3-5 in it, and I have lost count of the people who have borrowed this book when their professional observations are scheduled. It is fun, informative, and easy to use!

Fits like a Toddler sz 3/4 not for girl over 35 pounds. We were really disappointed with quality for the price. She was also mad that she could not dress herself in this cause she loves to do things independently now for dress up or fantasy play. It is like the cheapie Kmart type of custome quality. It has a velcro strip closure for the back of dress, waist is fitted and fabric cut in so not much give there. The Wings can be seperated from the outfit, they are also secured with vecro strip to the back of outfit so you could take them on and off easily. The velcro can snag the tulle skirt of the dress when taking on and off so be careful if you want this nice for pictures, take them right away :) this one gets low marks on quality, sizing, & ease of use (child won't be able to dress themselves in this for play)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book is truley one on those books that you can not put down.

You might just be shocked at what you read, and you'll be further surprised when you finally get to the end after reading Neil's odyssey across Canada to Alaska, down the west coasts of both Canada and the U.S, through Mexico, to Belize, then on his further journeys.

It could be that, as someone else said, each day that goes by is filled with what my days consist of, NOTHING.It could be that this is a page from Mapquest, repeated for 400+ pages.Neil had said years back, that people (fans) have no idea who he really is. And he is right, sadly. He has a problem with people who are not like him, and especially those people who have a weight problem.This has changed my view of him, even taking into account his losses.Rush fans, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great work from a grieving soul...","review":"I feel sad and embarrased for the people who read this book with the feeling that Neil Peart owes them something. Too bad for you if you think he needs to justify the fact that you bought all of Rush's albums. You bought them because they were great! And whether you consider his tragedy or not, this is a great book! Not only does Neil Peart deserve thanks for sharing his most private story with us, he also deserves credit for doing it so beautifully. This should be the first book people who face the loss of any loved one reads first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"This truly is a great book. After reading The Masked Rider, I was interested in The Professor's second book. Now, I must admit, the main reason why I got them was because I was, and still am, a die-hard Rush fan. Even though Neil may seem to be self-centered and not very thoughtful of others, he does entertain with his book, Ghost Rider. He may seem to be as this very serious kind of guy, but he makes remarks in his book that are quite entertaining.Reccommended for anyone who is looking for a good read, or is a Rush fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Rider","review":"I read Ghost Rider by Neal Peart. The First part of the book wasn't to bad, but when it got to the middle of the book it started to get real boring. This book has way to many letters in it that Neal wrote to his friend in jail. He should have called the book, letters to a friend in jail. I enjoyed reading about Neals rides and the different places he went, but I didn't need to read every single letter he wrote to his friend, it made for a very boring book. I'd give it 2 to 2 1/2 stars for the beginning of the book and then 1/2 a star after that. Neal should stick to music, he's much better at that.Long Way Round was a much better story of 2 motorcyclist who rode from England to New York and took the long way round to do it. That one I'd give 5 stars to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"I admit I am biased since I've been a Rush fan since 1976 but this book is a page turner. His descriptions of the natural world are wonderful and he doesn't mince words about his views of certain cross sections of society. Although he can be quite critical of others, he finds the words to describe his own short comings. It's a great travelogue that has inspired me to hit the road myself. A few more bucket list items have been added."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for insomnia","review":"I am truly for for the loss that Neil endured, and wouldn't want for anyone to go through that. However the book is 460 pages of the most boring reading I have ever done. It's mostly letters to friends whom he would bore with his days adventures. Pretty repetitive since he wrote the same thing over and over and over..etc etc (you get the picture) to all his friends. Quite surprised his one friend Brutus didn't die from boredom in his jail cell. Neil should stick to what he is best at. Music!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the opportunity","review":"It starts out engaging. Driven to the road by deep personal loss. Then the anti-social whining begins. He misses the lesson to be learned and over looks the beauty and the people along the journey.

I was entranced. I read it in 3 days because I could not put it down. To be able to tell such an account about such a reeling blow to your soul, to many people, takes courage and patience. Not only did you feel his pain, you also felt his sense of triumph in some strange ecclestensial way. If you want to read about coping and perseverence, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"I found this book rather repetitive. Mr Peart would get up early, ride hundreds of miles, meet a few unremarkable people along the way, have dinner, go to bed, get up early, ride hundred of...you get the drift.The personal tragedy suffered by Mr Peart that inspired or enforced his journey around the United States is something nobody should have to endure, and it was interesting to learn how he went about overcoming his grief. It just wasn't very entertaining or thought-provoking.In truth, if this wasn't written by one of my favourite musicians I very much doubt I would have got to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Rider","review":"Very well done. I'm now a fan of Pearts writing. He encompasses self introspection regarding the loss of his family with the travel log of an epic journey. Much more like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance than MotoRaid. Both good books. Ghost Rider is definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Rider","review":"A great, well-written account of a trip that had to be taken as a matter of survival.

I have a new found appreciation for the last few Rush Albums after reading this book.Thank you Neil for sharing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Neil...","review":"Here is another travel book I had high hopes for. I am sorry that Neil Peart lost his daughter & wife. However this tale is one big pity-party until the bitter end of the book. Sorry Neil, most of us can't just pick up and ride off into the sunset to get away from painful experiences in life. We have to tough it out. For any Rush fans, if you are expecting to learn much about Peart and the band, forget it. Rush is mainly mentioned in passing. You may be interested in knowing that Neil doesn't care much for touring and even less of his so-called fans these days. He also isn't too fond of fat people either! Those were the only revelations I came away with in the LONG boring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Rider","review":"I just finished this book and was deeply touched. I have loved Rush, and Neil's work for years and years. This book shows us a side that we never get to see about the man!

Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorcycles and Philosophy...coool!","review":"This is the book I had HOPED \\"Zen & The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" would be. A detailed and eloquent log of Neil's travels on his BMW all over North America, in hopes that travelling would help him deal with the devastating loss of both his teenaged daughter and wife. Obviously a well read, intelligent, introspective, and wryly humorous guy. As a dad and husband I had at least some concept of his enormous sorrow. As a motorcyclist I identified often with his observations from the saddle. And 55,000 miles is a heckuva ride!His frequent letters to friends present his thoughts from different angles, which was entertaining. Ideally some of these many letters could have been cut, and a number of the descriptions of the days' travels seemed redundant. Overall a very entertaining, if slightly long, philosophical solo adventure. Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Typical Rocker Book!","review":"Neil Peart is not the typical rock writer; his writing is rare in its depth. He captures the pain and anguish of his many losses, and details the road back to inner peace by providing a moment to moment glimpse of his travels. Neil Peart's books are an amazing tribute to man's frailty and resilience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"Ghost Rider is a great read. Anyone interested in Mr. Peart's lyrics and music will delight in his new book. You will laugh--and dare I say--you may even cry. The ending pleasantly surprised me."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOK SUCKS","review":"After being a big long time Rush fan and a motorcyclist I bought the book. I quickly became disgusted with the book. Plenty of U.S.A. bashing makes it no hidden fact that Neil does not like this country. But I guess U.S. dollars are OK...

But I forged on and finished the book then threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - but undeveloped.","review":"The story is tragic but the main character seems arrogant and undeveloped as he passes through his grieving.

Perhaps it is the monotony that helps him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time to Read...Unless you love getting depressed!","review":"What an self-indulgent piece of junk. As a previous reviewer said, no direction, just blather and self-pity. If he thinks he has it rough, try holding a job while going through this! THAT'S the real world, Neil. To pay twenty bucks to indulge his self-pity makes it quite a swindle. RUSH fans, don't waste your time. You'd hardly know his life as a musician by reading this book. And let's not elaborate on his boring letters to \\"Brutus\\". Absolute filler to thicken the book.

Through a series of letters Neil Pert takes you through the grieving he felt after loosing both his daughter and his mate in a matter of months.My main interest was the motorcycle journey, but was sucked unto the mental aspect of his being alone, hating others for being happy all the while rediscovering him self. This rediscovery is what the healing road is all about.One thing I suggest anyone who reads this book, is to take a note of what Neil is reading, as you can discover some great reading gems as Neil did.The only disappointment is the ending..

You are taken from grief and starting a new ride to this is how it all works out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have item for a rush fan.","review":"Neil Peart's tragedy is really sad and makes us think about the fragility of life. I think the book is really great 'cause it allow us to dive into Neil Peart's heart and mind, feel his search for healing at the same time we are able to explore along with him. His personal difficulties with the spotlights of fame are well known, and even though being a person with a strong sense of privacy, his book allows us to immerge into his private life, something inconceivable to his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book of Adventure, Love and Life","review":"I love Rush. They are a very intellectual rock band and I knew of Neil Peart's tragedy with the loss of his daughter and wife. Also, I am an avid motorcyclist so I was intrigued with Neil's story and how he used his travels on his motorcycle to help him come to grips with his personal struggles. That is what initially drew me to the book but after I got started I couldn't put it down. Mr. Peart is a wonderful writer. Through his prose he was able to completely engage all of the human senses describing the wonderful locations that he traveled. He also brought the reader into the emotional and physical struggles that he encountered as the \\"Ghost Rider.\\" This is a great book that engages the mind, heart and soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOK SUCKS","review":"After being a big long time Rush fan, musician and a motorcyclist I bought the book. I quickly became disgusted with the book. Plenty of U.S.A. bashing makes it no hidden fact that Neil does not like this country. But I guess U.S. dollars are OK... The book basically is about how a rich guy dealt with the misery of unfortunate circumstances,,, \\"roll the bones\\".. It gets old and depressing really fast.. But I forged on and finished the book then threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to writing songs.","review":"OK. I just finished this book and I am thoroughly convinced that the only reason this book is on the shelves is so Peart can offset his large bills for hotels, food, gas, smokes, motorcycle parts, and \\"The Macallan.\\" I wonder if he even tried to write off all these bills claiming it was \\"research\\" for this book? Stick to writing songs, Babe! (.... and I do have all your albums. Ach.) You say more in a five minute song than this book ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel manual","review":"Great travel manual, but Mr. Peart is very insulting to US American people, calling us fat, ugly and obnoxious.

If you are into motorcycle touring you will love this book. Neil Peart as a great writer (Neil writes the words that makes RUSH go round you know) puts you into the motorcycle seat as he travels through Canada, Alaska, and parts of the U.S. As a touring motorcyclist myself I can tell you that Neil's books both Ghost Rider and Road Show get it right in regards to the essence of motorcycle touring; the fun, the mechanical issues, the small towns, the breakfasts, the end of the day, the people you meet, as he says being excited to be alive when you are on the bike and being happy to be alive when you get off at the end of the day. It all there."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LOVE RUSH DON'T READ THIS BOOK","review":"Neil does such a good job of insulting anyone and everyone who grew up loving Rush that it makes you wonder if he should have just stayed in the tractor repair business. I still love rush, Neil is still my biggest drum influence, and I'll go see 'em every chance I get. However, I really would have been better off not reading this book. If your like me though, you'll read it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blame Canada","review":"Neil Peart hates you and wants you to know it.Life may have dealt him a difficult hand, but does he need to convert his pain into a misanthropy towards Americans--those who helped get him the luxury he has today?Some of his insulting comments were just pathetic, and I had assumed he was above such immature behavior considering his general intelligence. How can he disrespect Americans, yet still have the gall to tour here? What an a-hole.After too much of that, this book made a 'vapor trail' on its way toward my garbage can, not even completely read.Sorry about your trials and tribulations, Neil, but I've had enough of your smug self-righteousness.

She had a couple of male alters, but many more female ones. He effectively threw this poor woman to the curb and benefited financially from her. At the end of his book he seemed to think from his last interview with her that he had helped her some... then she returned to the in-patient ward after the interview... JEEEZ! Then he notes others came to try to help her after him. Sounds like this writer was just another exploiter in this woman's life. I hope she has found real help. This writer makes me incredibly sick.

It is well written (which is why I gave it two stars) and imaginative, way too imaginative. The characters and situations are grotesque. It is impossible to identify with any of them. They are unlikable, self-centered and weird. Passages apparently intended to be funny approach slapstick; in fact, just about every situation and character is cartoon-like.

Thank God the National Book Award jury decided to overlook the hype and give Franzen the prize.I just finished this book last week, and it was remarkable. Told from five different points of view and detailing the near-disintegration of an American family through a marathon of twists and tragedies, I found it an altogether fun, if complicated, read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing - What was Oprah thinking?","review":"(... This) is a story about an obviously disfunctional family(I think).None of the characters are very likeable except for maybe Chip.This is the oddest book I have ever read. The author seems to find a lot of \\"humor\\" in Parkinsons disease, which one of the main characters suffers from.He should write a book on the conclusion of the kids lives, which held my interest a little. Instead he just ended the story abruptly.

Because I have enjoyed Mr. Franzen's writing thoroughly in the past I was SO looking forward to this release, that is until I read the first few chapters, and then I was SO looking forward to the end. Yet another book about a dysfunctional family so chockful of cliches it was painful to finish. The three adult children in this family (and in particular the eldest son's awful wife) make the Manson family seem nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivial, boring","review":"I do not need to love or even like the characters in a novel, but I would like them to be at least complicated enough by their creator not to despise them instantly and throughout - or at least as far as I could bring myself to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Befuddling","review":"I read this book when it first came out, back in the fall of 2001 (one week before 9/11) and was completely blown away. I thought the social novel about an American family was dead, but this book evoked the same insights, emotions, and feelings of identification that The Winter of Our Discontent and Rabbit is Rich were so good at. It was a finalist for the Pulitzer, and in my opinion, is the best novel of the new century. Even his new novel, Freedom, could not surpass its clearness of vision and bittersweet family drama. If you are a reader, an intellectual, or a writer this book is essential. The smart money agrees...I have no idea what kind of moron would give it less than four stars.

Franzen does swing a little too hard for the fences at times, but these minor blemishes are few and far between. The characters are interesting, complex and sharply delineated as fascinating individuals in their own right -- yet recognizably part of the same family with the same shared history. Their interaction with each other and the world unfolds in a fascinating tale. Parts of this book are so overwhelmingly sad that it is difficult to go on, but it is worth the effort. (Parts of it -- especially the minor episodes of overheard conversations in a deli and an elevator are screamingly funny). Franzen has a great way with dialogue and description, to the extent that you forget you are reading a book for minutes on end and are just caught up in it. Makes Don DeLilo look like Danielle Steel. If only all contemporary writers could write like this and Tom Wolfe...I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging yet memoriable read","review":"I read this about 10 years ago, and I'm just now getting around to writing my review. That may sound like a rather large gap, but the reason I give this 5 stars (even though at the time I remember struggling to get through it at times) is even now a decade later I think about some of the characters and the course their life took them. I think I could recommend this to anyone who is comfortable with challenging themselves a bit and opening up to The Corrections."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Middle America Microcosm","review":"What more can be said about one of the most talked about Oprah choices (even if it didn't remain such for long)? The bare bones of this story sound very boring - retired Alfred and his wife Enid live in the American Mid-West - he is fading into Parkinson's disease, she is trying to ignore this fact. Their three grown children have moved East, trying to escape their boring middle American lives and now read as a catalogue of the dysfunctional aspects of modern American lives. Pretty ho-hum.But this is definitely not a boring book - it is a funny, fascinating and clever story with seriously flawed, seriously real characters. This book is absorbing from the beginning. Franzen jumps back and forth through time easily, explaining why people have ended up how they are. Never has Middle America seemed such a fascinating microcosm of human existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished it last week, still thinking about it.","review":"The Corrections is an amazing novel. Franzen took on an array of issues and situations to tackle, a daunting task for any writer, but he did it with grace and intelligence. His careful attention to rich character development has left Alfred, Enid, Gary, Chip, and Denise still floating around in my mind.A great book to examine ones family and what it means to living in the perils of American capitalism. Well done piece of work, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Big Fun Book","review":"Simply the best book I have read in years. Combines the brilliant high-minded literary style of a DeLillo with the accessability of a story to which we can all relate. Moving, hysterical, brilliantly inspiring, it is a book that never bores, never lets up and never stops taking our breath away at Franzen's tremendous talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an Oprah book, but a Franzen book","review":"Franzen has chased down the Great American Novel. He must surely rank together with David Foster Wallace and Don DeLillo, Michael Chabon and Richard Powers as heirs to a time when the printed word actually meant something, and when today's quasi-literacy was not an option for an informed citizen. Read \\"The Corrections\\" and weep, not for Jonathan Franzen, but for all the deaths of trees needed to make paper for all the other sub-standard prose out there posing as literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully hard to read","review":"I hated this book. It was completely manic and and full of characters that you just wanted to smack over the head until they snapped out of their self-involved lives. Perhaps there was some redeeming quality that I would have found in the end, but after forcing myself to get through the first 350 pages, I did myself a favor and shelved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Think So","review":"This book did not hold my attention for too long. He expounded on topics that he didn't need to and didn't expound enough on topics that actually interested me. He attacked family values just as hard as he could, and provided no resolution to anything. Sometimes as American people, we confuse reality with negative ideals. Right, there is no perfect family, but glamourizing adultery, tyranny in marriages, no respect for children or parents, just contributes to the confusion and disarray that corrupts today's family. We should make a conscious effort, as writers, to work towards rebuilding a positive foundation. With more people reading than ever before, we have to be careful about the messages we are sending across. I hold no ill will towards Jonathan Franzen, just what he wrote.GOD BLESS,Tamara Ward"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Correction Needed....","review":"Painfully slow narrative exacerbated by the dispicable characters. I forced myself to finish it in hopes that the characters were met with unfortunate ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Po Mo Pop","review":"Franzen's novel is heart-breaking. He should be commended for taking such a risk in our hip, Po Mo age. The Corrections is, at once, a rejection of postmodernism's sarcastic irony (a rejection of emotionless fiction) and, ironically, an attempted rejection of Pop fiction. Pop fiction and sentimentality are, by many accounts, inextricably intertwined, and Franzen (again, commendably) attempts to walk this fine line between the unwanted label of Pop Fictionist (hence, the famed Oprah dismissal) and a resuscitation of emotion in literature. Much of the book, however, is written like a ch(tongue)eek homage to Pop fiction, thereby solidifying Pop fiction's exclusive claim to emotion in literature. His novel, it's apparent purpose, unfortunately, defeats itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a novel at all","review":"Franzen has an amazing ability to write a (sometimes endless) scene. The scenes he writes, though, have nothing to do with each other. The parents, who presumably are central to the book -- since this is, after all, a book about a family -- are stick figured stereotypes who offer no more of a clue as to why they have spawned a dysfunctional family than that they are generically weak and flawed people. Nor is there anything about the parents that seems to directly relate to why their children have the flaws they have. All you really have learned by the end of several hundred pages is that (1) the parents are screwed up; and (2) the kids are screwed up. Not exactly a revelation. The book utterly lacks emotional intelligence or depth, which are absolutely necessary for this book to work. Franzen clearly has the talent to write any scene he wants to write; someday hopefully he will figure out how to use that talent to write a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A rich, thick indulgence into the lives of some quite boring people. Not much happens, and when it does, it's boring. I was truly disappointed. The best writing occurs in the first chapter, in a bit about a certain word that appears too frequently in the protagonist's own manuscript, and where he notes each of the word's frequent appearances. Hilarious. Other than that, totally, utterly, not worth reading.

I managed to read the whole book but I never felt like anything good was going to come out of it. Every relationship in this book was beyond dysfunctional. I generally read to escape into the life of someone else, but I did not want any part of this family. I especially disliked the relationship between the oldest son and his wife. I really hope that this was just the exaggeration of a relationship the author has witnessed. If this is at all based in fact I weep for the couple it was based on. This novel definitely made me feel better about my familial relationships. We may be dysfunctional in some ways but we don't even come close to the family in The Corrections.

Because I am sick of buying recommended books - best sellers and award winners - that are pulp fiction.This book was touted as one of the best written in 2001. On the first page I read: \\"He'd had his nap and there would be no local news until five o'clock. Two empty hours were a sinus in which infections bred.\\"A sinus in which infections bred? I'm sorry, but I can't read an author that uses that kind of analogy on the first page of a long novel. My guess is that people who devour \\"best sellers\\" and find them enjoyable will be able to overlook this type of asymmetric and awkward language.Good luck! I hope you didn't buy the book like I did. Get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing - Much ado about nothing","review":"I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype. I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since \\"Running with Scissors\\". I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This books was hyped beyond belief...it is long and boring and has no point...what a waste of time...will never read this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story!","review":"If you think your family is a mess read this! This will either make you feel better or at least know that we are all in the same boat ... The family boat.I simply adored the character development -- Excellent. From the very beginning you will be hooked. And what happens with one son in the middle of the book is nuts. Crazy good nuts!Treat yourself to this fabulous family drama. One can only hope a movie will be made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"one of the most overrated books by one of the most overrated authors i have ever read. easily could have been 100 pages shorter. the entire middle section was laborous. too much useless material neither advancing the plot nor shedding light on characters. dont read this unless you really dig boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correction...This was painful to read!","review":"Although the author has a very proficient use of the English language, the long, drawn out individual stories are too much for me! I struggle just to read 4-5 pages a night when I normally devour books. It is slow and I feel as if the characters were overly explained and overdone. I want to shout, \\"I get it already\\" after delving into every minute of a character's life. I can see the human side here, but for heaven's sake....cut about 200 pages out of this thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible, but certainly NOT a masterpiece.","review":"Well...the book is readable, but I think if Franzen was attempting to make a statement, he's failed utterly. Frankly, it's another case of \\"much ado about nothing\\". Not funny, not though-provoking...and certainly nothing new. But, unlike most of these over-hyped novels, I was able to read it all the way through without disgust or boredom. I just wouldn't particularly choose to ever read it again. And for those who compare this to Dostoyevski or Faulkner, that is really an insult to those writers (by the way,and this is admittedly irrelevant, I have read \\"Karamazov\\" three times in my life..the first time when I was in fifth grade!). Not a great American novel, and you certainly won't be missing anything if you skip this one. Dostoyevski, Tolstoi, Faulkner, etc...have nothing to worry about"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous! A Page Turner","review":"The Corrections was a wonderful 1st book of summer. It has everything, sex, drugs, and incontinence! At first, I wasn't sure where Franzen was going with the story, but by page 100, he has you hooked. It was a great read. I totally enjoyed it. And I recommend it to anyone with a family that is dysfunctional."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"Jonathan Franzen and The New York Times Magazine announced before this book was published that it was going to be the Great American Novel. Well, it's not. What it is is boring, populated with dislikeable characters who behave inconsistently with how they were decribed (in excruciatingly uninteresting detail) just pages previously. This is one of the greatest scams in publishing. We should all hire Franzen's PR person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start.....then BORING","review":"At the beginning of Corrections, I thought I would really enjoy this book. WRONG. Talk about a dysfunctional family!! There is absolutely nothing to redeem any of the characters. At times, the book was so \\"wordy\\", I scanned paragraph after paragraph. If you want to be REALLY depressed and REALLY tired of reading...try this ...it will certainly fill the bill. I scanned (very quickly) the last 100 pages or so because I was just worn out with it. Really don't know why I stayed with it that long except I kept thinking....something interesting surely will happen that caused this to be a best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or hate it","review":"I think this is pretty interesting. I read the reviews after trying several times to read this book. I finally gave up after realizing it bored me totally. I just didn't care what happended to any of them.This is the type of book I usually enjoy but I found the writing pretentious and lazy. I finally gave up. The interesting part for me is that some people absolutely loved it and gave it a great reveiw and others felt as I did. Go figure. BTW, the American Beauty test didn't work for me. I liked the movie quite a bit but obviously didn't care for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Corrections is a Masterpiece","review":"This notion that writers ought to cut all that which doesn't \\"advance the plot\\" staggers and upsets me. In my mind, this is tantamount to suggesting that Chagall or Picasso not paint anything that doesn't PRECISELY represent that which they're attempting to represent. Women don't have three eyes - so don't give her that extra one, Pablo!! Like a multilayer cake, Franzen gives us plot then character then plot again then character then . . . and so on. And he describes each of these elements perfectly. Underscore, highlight, in bright red ink: PERFECTLY. If, as Steinbeck said, \\"the real challenge of writing is to describe things exactly as we see them\\" -- then Franzen has met the challenge. And to think like this guy! Imagine! I was sad to turn the last page, because I was so hungry for more of Franzen's apt and insightful understanding of a new world filled with a new people. Read this book. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pithy, Modern-Day Portrait","review":"Franzen's writing usually fails to impress me, but The Corrections is a smash success! This novel has relit my passion for the modern novel because of the its eloquent wit, sarcasm, and drama. Franzen accurately captures the suffocation of disfunctional family relationships. The best book I've read all year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Late to the Party","review":"While this book has been out for several years, I only recently bought it to try Franzen out, given the glowing reviews of Freedom.I'll give you that he is a good writer. He really gets people, men and women alike. And he must specialize in getting people who are pretty sicko, because The Corrections is full of them.I didn't care about a single one of his characters by the time I was half-way through the book. Why I finished it, I don't know. Glutton for punishment, I guess.I actually hated this book. I usually pass books onto friends, but this one goes to a donation bag. Wouldn't wish it on my comparatively normal buddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a first .....didn't even finish .....lost interest","review":"I kept on reading, hoping the story would go somewhere, sadly it didn't.

Don't bother with this book. I don't care that it won some award..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections","review":"If it weren't for the last section of this book, I would be reluctant to give it even 1 star. After struggling through to the final page, I loaned the book to a friend who gave up after less than 100 pages. Franzen is mighty lucky to have had his book selected for Oprah's Book Club, however, it does support his remarks regarding her tendency to pick less than great books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I didn't like this book because it was boing, plain and simple. Don't get me wrong, Franzen definitely has awesome command of the English language (you might need to keep a dictionary handy), but the fact still remains that I did not find it interesting and had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disfunction at its best","review":"This book was the ultimate in disfunction! I was completely depressed from the constantly moving fog of depression that clouded each family member every day. The writing is done well enough, but it is a story over-reaching in its climb down into the depths of complex sordid detailed disfunction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully disturbing","review":"A classic it is not. Oppressive use of the English language. He develops a scene with so much detail you want to scream in agony. Nearly 600 pages with an ending that simply *happens* after ad nauseum descriptors of non-events throughout the book. Franzen also appears to be scatalogically obsessed. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Novel, But Not A Literary Masterpiece","review":"Jonathan Franzen's \\"The Corrections\\" is undoubtedly the finest depiction of a dysfunctional family I've come across in fiction. He is a splendid writer with a keen sense of imagination and excellent literary style, and he has wrought a marvellous achievement bringing the Lambert family to life. However, I found too many of the family's problems seem a bit too contrived, most notably, the strange odyssey which Chip Lambert undertakes from academia to new-style Russian organized crime in Lithuania. I agree with a previous reviewer that Franzen should have chosen another part of the former Soviet Union, not Lithuania; surely the Central Asian republics or Georgia might have been more ideal locales. Still I must commend Franzen for his enthusiastic, often satirical look, at contemporary society. However, I strongly doubt that \\"The Corrections\\" is the literary masterpiece of our time; it is clearly an accolade that veers too closely to hyperbole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and Hilarious with Just the Right Cringe Factor","review":"One of the best books I read for entertainment last year, The Corrections is much more than the sum of its press... If you can take it, that is! Ha! I kept getting this sinking feeling that Jonathan Franzen must have known my family growing up. Even so, each new chapter holds more surprises. I doubt I would want to know anyone who didn't enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply marvelous!","review":"Although I've been deeply disappointed in many recent best-seller books, this one was simply marvelous. Deeply detailed characters, marvelous word play, and important issues (end-stage Parkinson disease, quality of life issues for aging parents). I could not have asked for more in a great book. Thank you Jonathan Franzen! Highly recommended to those who enjoy books with more meat than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take Oprah out of the Picture","review":"I don't think your feelings towards Oprah & her bookclub should have anything to do with your feelings towards The Corrections. I have read many of Oprah's selections & have liked about 50%. I wish she had not nominated this book, only so people's reviews would not be muddled up with their feelings for her. I'll get off of that soapbox now and move on to the book itself. I read this book because I love family saga's where you get to really know the characters & care about them. I love getting to the point where they feel like they are your friends. I sure didn't feel this way about The Corrections. I didn't like one single character, found them boring & pretentious, & felt it was a waste of time being with them. I'm shocked it won such prestigious awards, I thought it was poorly written, which even that I can forgive, but I can't forgive such unlikeable, dysfunctional characters, and as you can tell by my one star rating, all I can say is, The Corrections is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Finish!","review":"I was looking forward to a \\"great book\\". What a disappointment. I don't like the characters and I don't care what happens to them. After letting the book sit for 3 days on page 188, I dreaded having to finish. I donated the unfinished book to the library and I went and bought Susan Isaacs new book, Long Time No See."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes, it was an oprah book, after all","review":"Franzen's self-created little tempest in a teapot over having his book selected for Oprah's book club just goes to show how unaware he really is. His book fits Oprah's template perfectly... contemporary disjointed and dysfunctional family members blunder through depressing scenarios with no redemption in sight. I found this gloomy, disgusting, and preciously self-aware by turns, and all of it turned my stomach. If I want to learn about a dysfunctional family, I'll look at my own, thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Disaffections","review":"Despite the glut of publicity and laudatory reviews, The Corrections is a dull, unimaginative story that certainly seems like Oprah fare. The characters come across as manipulated and utterly predictable. This book will be completely forgotten within a short time despite a likely movie version. Why is it that such mediocre narrative is the only thing pushed by the publishers? Oh yeah, they're all part of big corporations now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretention compromises art","review":"This book is a self-indulgent, skewed vision of family life.I could not empathize with any character. I was also bored by the introduction of plot elements that are little more than points on a social/political hot-button checklist.Franzen is obviously a gifted wordsmith andintelligent person, but his storytelling faculty needs a major overhaul.I'm glad to see that this book is being compared to Delillo's'White Noise': Never have two works been more deservingof each other's gassy company. Both will continue to age poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time it takes to read it.","review":"I cannot imagine what captured the attention of Oprah. Franzen's response is as strange as her interest. I thought this a thoroughly poor read and am sorry I kept going, trying to find out why it is being applauded everywhere I turn. I suppose because it is different. As we all know, different is not the same as better. There are many more deserving books to read. This is merely a suggestion, but, I recommend that you give this a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for bigger and better things","review":"Enjoyment is like the tingle you feel when you place your hand on the fresh ice at the bottom of an ice rink. The Corrections is the book that turned the ice rink into a swimming pool because it drained all of the enjoyment out of reading. Franzen has an amazing talent in creating metaphors out of nothing that give nothing, tell nothing, and prove nothing. He leads the reader into side views that go off nowhere and breaks ones ability to concentrate on anything that could remotely help the plot. Was this book trying to make a point? If it was it failed. This book tells a story about each of the children of Alfred and Enid. Each one of the characters is an extreme in bad lifestyles and what not to do. Without a grounded character and with no true climax this book will rest unopened on my shelf as the epitome of poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfunctional Families are Boring","review":"I found the book to be a chore to read. The characters and the story were simply boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Dissapointment","review":"This book was extremely dissapointing. After reading the first 100 or so pages, I felt let down and unsatisfied. The characters were consistantly negative and dull, and I found myself not caring what happened to them one way or the other. The plot took several unrealistic turns and I felt that the writing was un-necessarily \\"jumpy\\". I continuously pursuaded myself to continue reading hoping that it would get better. Unfourtuately, half way through the novel, I couldn't take anymore, so I jumped to the end. Almost to my relief, after reading the last 20 pages, I concluded that the overly depressing themes continue to the end. I was perfectly satisfied to put the book on a shelf to collect dust, never again to return to it. I have never left a book unfinished. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"started off great but....","review":"this book is terrible. It started off with a bang but halfway through it, I found the characters so unlikable that I didnt even care to finish it. Every single character is either crazy, depressed, or completely selfish. The mother is the worst character....she is just cheap and awful. Save yourself the time, dont bother getting this book. Even if you borrow free from the library, its a completely waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting","review":"Ugh- I tried, REALLY tried to like this book but it was exhausting. I felt like I was reading a literature grad student's first effort to get published. There were so many obtuse, ham handed deliveries of literary techniques that I literally had to set the book down and take a few deep breaths before I could go on. An exercise in tedium...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"When this book came out it was accompanied by so much hype that I figured it must be tosh, since almost anything is heralded as the greatest thing since the last greatest thing. This was a mistake on my part, and having only recently read The Corrections, I must say it��s an excellently written book, full of pithy commentary and insight, and worthy of the praise heaped upon it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted: An Editor With A Red Pen","review":"I just finished Mr. Franzen's laborious novel which took me 6 weeks to complete. Why so long one might ask? Well this verbose long winded work is not exactly a page turner. Mr Franzen is obviously well versed in character development. Unfortunately, there really is no story here. I pushed myself through the book to see how the monumental Christmas dinner would pan out. This dinner you see is the crux of the book. A whole lot of hoopla and no payoff. This last sentence sums up everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, horrible","review":"Can you sue an author for wasting your time? That is what I felt like doing after I read this book. I have to say that I felt like I was reading the dictionary due to the wordiness of the book. I read at least three or four books a week and always finish. With this one, I kept saying to myself, \\"cut your losses and put it down.\\" I also found many of Franzen's descriptions long winded and sometimes completely unnecessary. It gets one star from me mainly because by the end, I was mildly curious as to how everything would play out for each of the characters. Otherwise, it was a very boring read. Don't waste your money or your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drab and Dreary","review":"This book was not one of my favorites. There was not one character in this book that I liked or could identify with. They were all so depressing, and in my opionin, this book brought nothing to the table. I found the text to be very wordy and overly descriptive in many areas. I began to really dislike the characters. The only reason I tortured myself and finished the book was because it was for a bookclub."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the first \\"free\\" chapter.","review":"One other reviewer stated you will \\" love it or hate it.\\" I hated it. Slugged it out but finally stopped reading and deleted so it may not infect any other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing isn't even the point","review":"Okay folks, we know that the content of this book was a tad on the depressing side. However, that was not at all the problem that I had with it. \\"A Fine Balance\\", another Oprah book, was one of the most depressing books I've ever read, but I loved it. The key? The characters. Try as I might, I just could not bring myself to like any of these people. Dysfunction is one thing. But reading about a bunch of whiny people with infantile desires and poor judgment is not my idea of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tale of family woes is eerily familiar","review":"Funny, touching, and oh so familiar. While my sibling and I do not have these exact faults, the general experience of dealing with a dying parent comes off true to (my) life. That's not to say that this novel is a downer. I laughed out loud and that made it all the more human. Excellent read. I'm looking forward to that time in my life when reading this book a second time will bring a whole new look at family life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skillful but ultimately empty book,","review":"Franzen is a very talented writer, but in the end, I could not find any empathy with any of his characters. He trys to \\"show off\\" his broad areas of knowledge (food,economics,etc)to the detriment of finding something to care about in the lives of his characters as they slowly, but surely unravel. Frazen must lead a very depressing life, if he is hanging out with the self-defeating and perverse people he writes about! Also, I found that his characterization of the females in the book to be much more crtical and stinging than the males! Good for Oprah for \\"disinviting\\" him. I fear he finds himself more impressive than I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"The characters were pretty realistic and I enjoyed reading about them, even if I couldn't pity most of them. I don't think you're necessarily supposed to pity them. But there were definitely moments that tugged at the heartstrings. I'm not very good at book reviews, but this was a very satisfying read. Not the best ever by any means, but definitely worthwhile for any bookworm. It also helps that it's long."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"well written although depressing. Sometimes hilarious--true insight into family life, which is often dysfunctional. I need six more words so here they are"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you feel great about your family","review":"This may be my favorite novel ever. What begins as a quasi normal story of the intricacies of families and relationships turns into a backwards, darkly funny tale. Makes a great gift to anyone who thinks their family is crazy because it makes you realize that everyone's is! Extremely well written and nicely twisted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Did anyone except me find this book to be extremely boring? I love to read, but could only read 10 to 12 pages at a time, before putting it down. The characters are shallow, the story line drags on and on without going anywhere. Of course the family is dysfunctional, but dysfunctional can be fun and interesting......these characters are not!!Even trashy romance novels can be more enjoyable than this book. The author's writing is very much like his character, Chip's.....Going on forever without getting to the point.Most boring book I have purchased in years"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not High Art","review":"Since Jonathan Franzen has crowned himself the contemporary writer of \\"High Art\\" I expected to read the work of a newfound genius. If you must indulge your curiosity don't waste your money, borrow it from a library. He's just another arrogant American baby boomer who thinks too much of himself and his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dark side of the human heart","review":"I tried to like this book; however, I found the plot to be bleak and sad and the very opposite of noteworthy. There is not one likeable character doing one kind, charitable or generous act during the entire plodding book. I am not looking for an uplifting book with a \\"message\\" or a puerile happy ending, but I would like to think that there is more to life and living than is characterized in this book. I like books that make me think while I am reading them and, if I am fortunate, when I have finished reading them. Jonathan Franzen has created a group of greedy, self-serving characters who never deviate from our initial introduction to them. The author has talent - the characters are well defined and the plot makes sense within the confines of the structure created by Franzen. The world is surely peopled by persons who belie his definition of living within a family. This book saddened my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"The HYPE machine is working OVERTIME!","review":"I don't know how this could be called a Great American Novel. There are so many points I don't know how to begin. Only that the hype machine is ridiculous and buzz sells a lot of books. Franzen hasn't even lived an interesting life to reiterate his experiences (living cooped up in a flat with his ex-wife writing for years going out once a year <anniversary> doesn't make for an interesting human being). It's academic writing (I suspect an MFA in his past). Really interesting writers live life and don't need to STUDY their guts out to write. The New York Times review was the most accurate I saw. Kaukutani <-sp? was right on and the most honest of all critics who read this. Get real people. You could never call this the best book of the year. At best it's a really good episode of Thirty Something. And getting on Oprah's list - Nuff Said! Read James Salter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections","review":"...P>At first, I laughed a lot and thought the book was funny, entertaining and well-written. However, after about 200 pages, I became a little confused and a lot bored. What is the greatness this book manifests, I wondered. The writing ceased to be entertaining. The characters began to seem extremely foolish and unbelievable to me. The peculiar juxtaposition of dates and time seemed arbitrary and unnecessary.I still don't understand why so many publications whose reviewers I usually respect think this is such a great piece of writing. In reality, I think a great hoax has just been perpetrated on us poor unsuspecting readers. I DID read to the end but I'm not recommending this book to any of my reader friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think Mr. Franzen has to worry...","review":"...about being too much of a commercial success. I'm not interested in even picking up another of his books, let alone purchasing it. I have never in my life read anything so self-consciously literary and affected. The characters are not good, and the events so far from real life that I find it difficult to believe Mr. Franzen actually lives on this planet. Also, what is with the frequent use of just a letter and a blank line (D______ etc.) to denote colleges, rivers, and so forth? Yes, I know that Edgar Allan Poe and his contemporaries were fond of this conceit, but really! It just serves to pull the reader out of the (admittedly uncompelling) story line. Either you're trying to make up a plausible name to use when he does this, or you'rethinking, \\"Good grief; that's really annoying.\\" Plus there's his brilliant use of the word \\"corrections\\" over and over again. Wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corrections","review":"I hsted this book, didn't care about any of the characters or what was to become of them.

Unfortunately, (...) I paid full retail price for the book. The plot was disjointed, not particularly interesting and extremely wordy. At the end I was skipping paragraphs and pages at a time just trying to find anything worth spending my time on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overstuffed, but enjoyable","review":"While I think this story could benefit from a paring, I enjoyed the development of characters. There were interior \\"dialogues\\" that went on too long to be believed (and fractured the pacing). There are unnecessary or overdone sideplots (the personality changing device). But the story and characters are ultimately compelling. The style of writing is very Tom Wolfe-ish, though I don't consider Franzen Wolfe's equal in pacing and satire. Perhaps Wolfe's journalistic background makes him a more disciplined editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"I loved this book! The author creates a dysfunctional family who struggles with many common human predicaments. The siblings' attempt to \\"correct\\" the mistakes of their parents leads to many traumatic and fascinating personal and professional life experiences. Jonathan Franzen's use of language is beautiful if at times verbose. Pepperred throughout the novel are insights into the human condition which consistently have a strong ring of truth to them. If the purpose of fiction is to allow the reader to examine life in a new way or see a new truth, then the author has fulfilled his mission impeccably."},{"rating":"1","title":"borrowed too much from white noise","review":"Am I the only one who sees how much of this book has been borrowed from Delillo's White Noise (and his other books)? The same fascination with brand names, the same oddly precocious children, the same babble about psychopharmaceuticals, the same weird cast of international mystery men contrasted against the bland landscape of American suburbia...The problem is, he's not as good a writer as Delillo. As another reviewer pointed out, his characters are so totally narcisistic and one-dimensional, they're unmemorable. And boring.Also, this book is way too long and needed editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too depressing to be good","review":"I really don't mind depressing per se. However, there has to be some redeeming value to the story to make it worth the effort of slogging through. I do not want to be left, as I was with this book, with the feeling that it's all pointless. That everything [stinks] and there's no point in trying, because it's all meaningless anyway. It is well-written, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one, but certainly not worth all the buzz that it has received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correct Me If I'm Wrong But...","review":"....is this book boringly pedantic or what? I think Franzen needs a spanking for putting his readers through paragraph after paragraph, page after page of extraneous details. I simply skipped these passages until I got back to the main thread of the narrative. Alas, I must admit I did keep reading because of *all the hype* I had read about this book. NONE of the characters is likeable! I think that's the main thing that stuck with me. He's a good writer. He has a way with words, I'll give him that much. But, overall, the book is much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzled by praise for this soap opera with pretensions","review":"It must be that male writers and critics just don't read books written by women, because there are hundreds of books so much better than this soap opera of a novel. But this book has no staying power and won't even be read by anyone in a few years, whereas Marilynn Robinson, in HOUSEKEEPING has a far more interestingly dysfuntional family, the members of which all hold our interest. Many great writers write about unlikable people, but Jonathan Franzen doesn't like his own characters, and we never get a chance even to know what they're like. This is a book that makes you despair about being human, but when you finally get all the way through it you put it aside and despair of the time you wasted reading it. This book's ideal audience are white male prep school students or college English majors."},{"rating":"1","title":"so pretentious ---- such a waste of time","review":"This book won an award?!!!??? Why would anybody read it past page 20 (I needlessly suffered to the end of the book.) Boring characters, muddled writing, confused ideas, grand pomposity-- this book is a massive celebration of pretentiousness. Big disappointment. Thanks Mr. Frenzen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With This One","review":"Oprah usually selects excellent books. This time somebody goofed!! This book is drudgery. Some people may like it but I didn't think it was worth the mounds of paper it was written on.I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sorry, Oprah, but you can't please everyone with every book, but your batting average is about 90% so far!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections","review":"Franzen is obviously talented, ambitious, and far-reaching in this much discussed, too hyped novel. His reach, however, is faulty, but it's worth the read to see how faulty and to see what dubious fiction gets published these days. The book is flawed because Franzen essentially dislikes all his characters except possibly the bisexual daughter. He certainly is no profound examiner of the \\"American soul,\\" to paraphrase one favorable critic. Instead, Franzen has trapped himself between a cynical impulse and a tragi-comic one. His description of typical Midwesterners with \\"bratwurst fingers\\" is heavy-handed satire, suggesting a disturbing prejudice shown in his portrayals of some other characters and situations European and European-American. Finally, his ending is forced, unconvincing, and lays much of the dysfunctional blame on the dead father. The sins of the father visited upon...Yawn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hours of my life that I will never get back...","review":"OK, so what did I miss? I hated this book!! Actually, I can't think of many books that I hated more than this book. Perhaps I am not quite as avant-garde as other readers,or perhaps my childhood was just too functional to understand this piece of work. I enjoy suspending belief as much as the next reader, but this is asking for too much. I felt like no plot was ever really established and that the author never really got a handle on his characters - he tried to portray them in too many dimensions and ended up making me hate all of them (particularly Enid), with the exception of Alfred. As I said, this book represents wasted hours of my life that I will never get back...but it represents 7 years of Mr. Franzen's life that he will never get back. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it.","review":"This book has no soul.

I was tempted tp put it down after the passage where Chip is smelling his couch for the place his last girlfriend had an orgasm while he was masturbating. This is beyond imagination. i suspect Mr. Franzwn is a sexually depraved pervert who is sharing his pathetic life with the world. If you are a serious lover of good literature, don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Depressing Novel from Oprah","review":"I saw Franzon emblazoned on the cover of Poets and Writers, so I bought the book. They called it \\"THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL.\\" They were kidding, but as postmodernists, they're allowed to kid when it comes to ripping you off.The novel is depressing when not boring, and boring when not depressing. It starts nowhere, leaves you at the same place, and shows you nothing in-between.If the literary crowd ever wonders why nobody reads, why novels have been relegated to the fringes of modern civilization, it is because the novel has been rendered irrelevant by the con-artists and talentless middlemen who run the contemporary publishing show.It is complete waste of time and money, and yet one more product of the liberal hype machine.I have no idea who reads this and enjoys it, and most of the positive reviews read as if the publicity department wrote them.Read the classics, or the Bible, or check out Drake Raft for great modern literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Male Danielle Steele","review":"I think Franzen has a lot of good ideas about family relationships/issues, but he should steer clear of writing about sexual concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"PERVERTED","review":"Does the author think that, in our day and age, by capitalizing words like TW-T or CU-T will have a bigger impact on us? I like a little erotica, tittilation, sexuality/sensuality, and sometimes even a little pornography in the literature that I read, but this guy is bizarrely perverted. I guess Oprah (or her ghost-readers, if she doesn't personally read the books on her \\"recommended list\\") find this to be artsy...well I find it to be fartsy. I don't see how those middle-class, nothing-better-to-do housewives that watch her show and \\"can relate to her\\" could read this book and not feel that she has lost touch with reality and morality.

I've read, or tried to, several of these books, and I too thought they were lightweights. Most of them I did not finish or even get very far. (But there was the Poisonwood Bible and one or two others...) But The Corrections is no way better than any of these and a lot worse than most. I tried to give it 0 stars but it didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise...","review":"I was a little intimidated by The Correction by Jonathan Franzen, mainly because of the length. But when I read that my favorite author, Pat Conroy, gave it rave reviews, I decided to give it a try. I have to say that I was NOT disappointed! You'll follow the lives of one of the most dysfunctional families ever, as their lives careen out of control--mostly through their own doing. The characters are quirky, the plot is a page turner (even though nothing much seems to happen) and the writing style is superb. But the thing I especially enjoyed were the observations about life and about relationships. In this respect, The Correction reminded me of Richard Russo's Nobody's Fool and Empire Falls. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I felt the story got bogged down in certain sections. But overall, I was pleasantly surprised and won't be so reluctant to read Franzen's next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still depressed - weeks after reading this!!","review":"I'll make this short and sweet (bittersweet).

If you are lucky enough to make it through the first 100 pages prepare yourself for a storyteller who just wants to think of the most bizarre things that could possibly happen to individuals and a family. The dysfunction was ridiculous at times. Did it make it funny? NO. It was just a terrible way in which for the author to fill pages. There is so much wordplay. Almost everyone has some form of dysfunction in their family but this was over the top. I just don't get the hype"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't understand why people like this book so much?","review":"I did not care for it at all. It does not have chapters and it switches from character to character at the drop of a hat. It is hard to follow and very scattered. It had a goood storyline but it just need to be sectioned up better. I don't think it should be called Amazon's book of the year at all. I have read many other books this year that definetly top this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Exercise in Vocabulary","review":"I wonder if Jonathan Franzen had a thesaurus by his side as he was writing this book? It seems so - and he dipped into it a bit too often. While some may call this writing style \\"poetic\\", I found it to be heavy laden with obscure wording which did not move the plot forward in any meaningful way - and in some cases, provided an obstacle to that movement. The characters were difficult to like, the situations they found themselves in pathetic (if not mystifying as to purpose) and at book's end, I found myself wondering - \\"So what was the point of telling that story?\\" Admittedly, I read this book as it was recommended by Oprah Winfrey... Now that I've read it, I can't say I understand why she would recommend it... Not an enjoyable read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Uncorrections","review":"This is the worst book I have read in a really long time. There is not one likeable character in the book. After reading about half the book, I skipped to the end (something I never do) hoping to find out that there was something redemeaming in the ending. Not so. Enid is the same hateful character she was throughout the book. In fact they all are. This book shouldn't be called the Corrections which leads you to beleive that these people are going to have some life change during this story. It should be called the Uncorrections. No one changed and they were all awful human beings!! One reveiwer wrote he could related to every character. I don't know whom he hangs out with but these characters were all scum of the earth types to me. None of them are someone I'd want to know. This was not enjoyable or interesting reading. I can't wait for my book club meeting next month. Everyone I've talked to so far hates this book. It should be a great discussion - ripping this story apart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DeLillo has no cause to worry.","review":"This book has sweep, it has ideas, it has social commentary. But its style is tedious and trivializes everything. The sentences go clunkety-clunk. They are f-l-a-t. Sentences are crammed with predictable details. This is journalism and sociology trying to pass themselves off as literature. It's not working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and affected","review":"I am an avid reader and I cannot remember the last time I put down a book unfinished prior to the \\"The Corrections.\\" I was sucked in by the Oprah Club hype. The book is *boring*. Every character is unpleasant, whiny and someone who I would avoid in the real world, assuming such caricatures could be found here. Franzen strikes me as an affected writer who sees no obligation to tell an engaging story - perhaps such concerns are beneath a modern author writing \\"great literature.\\" I would recommend the book as a sleep aid but it is far too frustrating. More appropriate uses would be as a door stop (it goes on forever) or a toilet paper substitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with this book","review":"This book was interesting. There were times when I was bored and had to actually work to get through pages and then there were times when I couldn't put the book down. I felt so connected to all the characters (even if I didn't particularly like them) - I wasn't sure how this book was going to come together - I mean you spend so much time on each family member's life and then - the ending - It all came together and it was powerful - Throughout the entire book I found Alfred to be a pretty gross character and then at the end - I felt such compassion and understanding towards him - Read this book until the end - stick with it - It is worth the time and effort!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"The Amazing Run-On Sentence\\"!","review":"There's an interesting story hiding somewhere in this book.

I looked forward to reading it daily. The situations demonstrate Midwestern values and how the children of Midwesterns violate those norms while extricating themselves. The end actually caused me agony, reflecting on my own family and the forms that we do not live up to our parents value. Franzen truly captures the essence of Midwestern thought. Would have liked to have seen some more positivity, instead of the glib New York sensibilities that obviously overtaken the author. However, I would recommend this book to anyone, as long as they are from the Midwest. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"If this is high literary art, I must be missing something. This is one of the most tedious, overwritten family sagas I have ever read; I simply could not finish it. Try Christiana Stead's THE MAN WHO LOVED CHILDREN or Eudora Welty's THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER. They are better examples of literary art, and are more satisfying by a mile. Once again, I find the richest examples of literary art on the backlists from which most publishers earn their bread and butter. Much better books were published last year, too, and were all but ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of only two books I never finished","review":"I believe this was on Oprah Winfrey's book list. Forewarned should have been forearmed, but alas, I did not heed my own better judgement. What a mistake that was. This has to be one of the most boring books I have ever cracked open and being an avid reader I have had my share of tedious writers. It sat around my home for a while until I put it in some box for a charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I read this book before I knew there was any hype about it. It wasn't a \\"bad\\" book, but I don't understand the hype that followed it. I found it merely average. There was nothing groundbreaking, nothing particularly insightful, nothing that I hadn't read before by better-written, more entertaining novels. Perhaps the \\"controversy\\" is less about the story itself but more about what happens when someone jumps on a bandwagon. As soon as it was hailed as a Great American Novel, people began to look for reasons to tear it down. I didn't find this story interesting enough to keep my copy... I left it at an airport for someone else to pick up. It wasn't even worth dragging back home to donate to my library. That's just my opinion, of course, but I'm not planning to check out anything more by Franzen... there are too many writers I enjoy to bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even compare this person with Faulkner....","review":"I don't even dare call Franzen an author. The book was the most catostrophical waste of my time, ever. I'm not a Faulkner lover, but Faulkner won a Nobel Peace Prize because his work was imaginitive and insightful in a very complex and strange way. Most who do not like him simply cannot understand the symbolism and greater concepts in the work. I've read War and Peace twice--and loved it. I'm not an idiot; I'm a quiet well read person. I know an ignornant book when I read one. Please, don't waste your time on this sorry book....I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"This author does not know how to write a great novel but he has figured out how to promote one.....Terrible book but kudos to the advertisement campaign!At page 200, I finally said enough already!This book contains sentences that are almost a full page long but say nothing. Life is too short to waste any of it struggling through this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"After all the hype about this book, and the fact that it won the National Book Award, I expected to read a good book, at the very least. Instead, I found shallow, predictable characters, and mediocre writing. I tried to finish the book (having paid hardcover price for it), but three-quarters of the way through, I slammed it shut in disgust - disgust at the hype, disgust at the National Book Award committee, disgust at the author for wasting my time. Lines in the book like: \\"He hugged Denise and she lingered in his arms. She gave him a little bit of what men liked,\\" would have sent me off into hysterical laughter - if I didn't feel so stupid for buying the book in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mistake","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. There were no redeeming features. It was as though the author decided to think of many of the ugly, pathetic, and sociopathic societal occurances and combine them with many/all the ugly, demeaning and undesirable traits people can have and put them into one book. What was the point? Sensationalism -- voyeurism -- how much will John Q. Public believe? This is the book of the century? I hope we haven't sunk this low in what we consider extaordinary literature!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great American Novel?","review":"Everyone is calling this the great American novel, but I think you can only comapre it to The Grapes of Wrath. It is NOT a feel good book. No one is happy (probably why I kept hearing how \\"real\\" it is) and even though the author tries to brighten it up at the end a little, the whole book is so depressing that it is too little too late. It is compelling, and I did have a hard time putting it down, but do not read this if you are looking for an uplifting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too depressing","review":"Franzen is a good writer but I wasn't drawn to the family who is at the center of this story.

Think I'll go to the library and get one of Taylor Caldwell's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"What a chore it was to read this ponderous book! I had to read a section, put the book aside for several days, and then soldier on through another section. It might have been an above average novel without the excessive treatment of various uninteresting subplots, most notably the pharmaceutical company and the Lithuanian business. It is at least 200 pages too long.Buried within it, however, is a good story about the relationship between modern-day, cosmopolitan children and provincial parents whose lives are crumbling. There are some memorable scenes and some great characters. Who can fail to sympathize with Enid, the mother, as she tries to bring one last \\"normal\\" Christmas to her family? The last section of the book, when Christmas finally arrives, is moving and well done.Was it worth it? Probably not. I just finished Sue Miller's latest offering, The World Below, and enjoyed it far more in much less time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gibberish, Not Storytelling","review":"Why are people falling all over themselves to praise this book? It's confusing and boring and about as indecipherable as Ancient Greek. I guess that's what makes THE CORRECTIONS a \\"literary\\" novel instead of just an entertaining story. Oh, stupid me!

Women have been writing books about family dynamics for years (Edith Wharton, Jane Austen, Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, etc.) I think a man finally ventured into our realm and everyone got all excited.

For a book to be enjoyable, we have to be able to sympathize with at least one character!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it no stars if I could","review":"I am not going to say much about this book except that I hate it in a way that I have never hated a book before. For the life of me I cannot fathom how so many critics think so highly of this author. It is self absorbed, pretentious, un-funny garbage. The book feels like it was written by a teenager after two philosophy classes and about 20 MFA programs who oh so desperately needs to be told he is a genius. Mission accomplished: A talking turd for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsavory","review":"I was offended by this book, yet at the same time I admire his writing, which is almost delicious with on-the-mark detail and dialogue that is natural, believable and interesting.However, you can sense the contempt the author feels toward his characters and he is as obsessed as his characters are with sexual things: acts, organs, smells, masturbation, adultery--all the things that make a modern novel hip, and I find tedious. The novel was too creepy to keep me interested and actually made me angry. I stopped reading after 70 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read if you're patient!","review":"After hearing that this was the next \\"Great American Novel\\" I had to find out for myself. I have known families like this one, where the Parents have a public face and the face they wear behind closed doors. It makes you wonder how people go through life not really knowing the people they were raised by and grew up with. Jonathan Franzen spun a tale right out of Main street U.S.A. with quirky siblings and rigid parents. At times Mr. Franzen was a bit wordy and I found the book to be interesting and entertaining but I could not call it the next \\"Great American Novel\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the End, Perceptive Skill","review":"One could develop quite a migraine sorting through these numerous and disparate reviews!I'll only add this: the powerful description at the end of this lengthy work, when Alfred steadilly crumbles from the horrific grip of dementia, made for a heart heavy. I had to take in almost a word at a time, it hurt so badly. The author displays great perceptive skill to capture and reflect the mysterious internal workings of such a ravaging disease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Boring","review":"I was eager to start this book after all the hype I have heard, but am now at a loss as to what all the hype is about.

Not this book! The author's puerile, contemptuous, shallow, show-off writing had less to offer than 99.9% of books. It was a real struggle to read. (6 of the 7 book-group members agreed, incidentally -- the other really enjoyed it.)Save your time and money for the wonderful alternatives available.

Even if he didn't agree with their choices he didn't have to make them out to be nattering nabobs!I found it totally unbelievable that the brother invited, or agreed to host, his parents for a couple of hours and then disappeared the way the author wrote.The author seemed to be trying to write a book with zany characters, but he obviously doesn't care for zany people. What was so wrong with these imperfect (duh!) parents wanting to have one last holiday meal with their imperfect children?

I'm male and offended on my behalf and on behalf of my girlfriend, who' certainly bright enough to \\"understand\\" the big messages Franzen has to offer.

Franzen's book was a tremendous disappointment. The characters are unsympathetic. There is no plot. Clearly the critics were fooled because of Franzen's clever command of language. The book appears to be a vehicle by which Franzen can distance himself from his upper middle class midwestern roots and align himself with the literary crowd in New York. The author has foisted on the public a dark series of contrived vignettes that are being passed off as a novel worthy of reading. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Corrections","review":"I am half way through this book and have put it down. I do not find anything very literary in a book which turns all characters into carricatures. Yes, there is wit, but where is the compassion that books similar to this show. This book has been compared to T.Mann's \\"The Buddenbrooks\\". No way, whereas Mann's characters allowed me to identify with them on some level, Franzen's Characters lack any depth. One cannot relate to them, they are so exaggerated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brillliant style but too long","review":"I loved the writing style in this book--very bright and lively--but the book, to me, was too long because of the bitter, depressing sex scenes.

More than that, I usually need to care about somebody to read 500 plus pages. These are never likeable people. THERE IS NO REAL REDEMPTION AT THE END. At best, they seem to want to change, but they also seem too weak and self-absorbed to work hard--unless for something material. Still, when I finished reading it, I put it on the shelf of books I really liked and would recommend. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this book at a book sale for $3 in Monroe CT, and reading the back cover, and reviews, I thought that it would be good. I read 1/2 of it so far, and found it to be dissappointing. It's depressing, it jumps around too much, and there's no plot. I found the book to be just plain weird. I thought that I was getting a bargain but I wouldn't have even paid 50 cents for it. I thought for a book this bad that even $3 was too high a price tag to pay. So please, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A loathsome, boring book","review":"I'm sorry I didn't put it down, but persisted because of my book club. Speaking as a professional writer, I found it poorly written, with a self-important choice of words designed only to impress poor readers with hundred dollar words. It's a totally depressing, boring read that drones on forever. There's not an admirable, likeable character in the entire, full of unlikely scenarios. It's a totally loathesome book with no redeeming features and definitely unworthy of any praise or awards heaped upon it. If you don't like immersing yourself in dysfunctional families' neuroses, don't waste your time or money. I won't read any more of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections- Need Corrections","review":"This book was terrible! I do not care what the critics say. I couldn't get pass the first ten pages. I tried to read beyond that to see where the book was going, but I lie to you not, I just could not get pass all the rambling and empty rhetoric to understand what the author was trying to convey. There is a description for everything a character does, and the descriptions are insane. I kept saying, \\"What is he talking about?\\" Either he is dancing around the issue or wants readers to try and figure it out. The last I checked this was not a mystery book. I hoped to be entertained not try to figure out this Shakespeare-written symbolism. I do not mean that fiction shouldn't make you think sometimes, but the author almost never spell it out for you, you have to try to figure it out. If you can get pass all the useless narrations about everything and nothing \\"of point,\\" this book should have stayed a manuscript in need of \\"correction.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unknown","review":"I could not get into this book, no matter how many good rants and raves the author received about how good it was, I couldn't get lost in it.

Longer review at ImpatientReader-dot-com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible!","review":"I feel that Franzen's editor should have done a few more \\"corrections\\" of this novel. Anyone who writes sentences that go on for a page with semi-colon after semi-colon of semi-connected thoughts should be avoided at all costs! Franzen's vocabulary is advanced, but forced (as if he had a five dollar word quota that he was trying to meet). The characters are thinly drawn--Alfred's treatment of Enid belongs in a world fifty years ago, as does Gary's treatment of his wife. Chip is a screw-up of the most annoying kind--brilliant and bored. The sibling rivalry and parental preference is outlandish and sickening. I cannot imagine children being raised in such a functional dysfunctional family being this passive aggressive and jealous. There is nothing endearing or sympathetic about these characters. They are merely pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic self-intersted tripe","review":"I read to page 240 waiting for something to happen or for me to meet an interesting character that I cared about.

By chapter 2 the false notes began to accumulate at breakneck speed. We are told that the protagonist, Chip, works part-time at proofreading but can somehow afford a doorman building in New York City--in the East Village, where there are few--if any!--doorman buildings. And that this doorman, named Zoroaster, is supposedly savvy enough to call out to Chip as he leaves, \\"Goodbye, Mr. Chip!\\" Chip's parents are presented as midwestern WASPs but read as quintessentially, transparently Jewish. In this desperately overwritten tome, Franzen frantically wants to entertain but can't decide if he's William Gaddis or Woody Allen. Obviously he's neither. The National Book Award has seen far better days."},{"rating":"1","title":"total letdown","review":"I bought this book because Oprah loved it. I tried for 100 pages to get into it, to give it a chance but it is BORING. The characters are so draining. It is 100 % depressing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastating Surprise","review":"I love this book as only one can when seduced to laugh during her own evisceration. Is the Great American Novel recognized soon after its publication, or does time make that distinction? In my opinion, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads Like The Brothers Karamazov","review":"This was excellent novel however I must that it reminded me of the Brothers Karamazov. I felt drawn to Chip and his \\"fall from grace\\" due to succumbing to the charms (more like annoyance) of Melissa a student of his during his other life as a college professor. Well he screwed that one up now didn't he! And throughout the novel the characters seem to have their dreams and illusions of life, never really focusing on reality. And there's the comparision between Chip and his more succesful brother who just happens to be manically depressed despite that success. I don't want to give away the whole book but it's really good read as far as a character study (almost like a case study). The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was that reading through some dry spells in the novel took some patience other than that this novel comes highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT worth the effort","review":"I had such high hopes for this book. The next \\"great American novel\\". The last 2 chapters were by far the best, although I have to say not worth the preceding 450 pages. The characters were developed to varying degrees of completeness such that by page 567 I was still being surprised by their actions. I couldn't bear to finish the thing in one reading and had to stop in the middle for a rest. Get the thing on tape or ask a friend about it. Too heavy to carry around for what it winds up being worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and $$$","review":"Don't read this book. Before I get into why, let me tell you that I picked up the paperback and could not get through it. So, I borrowed the book on tape from the library and couldn't even get through that. Save your time and money.The novel itself is forgetable and uneven. It plods along by using numerous characters, each of which has significant psychological and emotional problems, and then tries to weave it all together as a protrayal of \\"these times in which we live\\".... The reason for the characters and all their flaws is that the author can't develop characters strong enough to carry an interesting tale. It's not social commentary, it's social exploitation. It's an easy way to write a novel, and it comes of clumsy, rude, and annoying.If you've read some reveiws that make this book sound appealing to you, pick uo Kurt Andersen's TURN OF THE CENTURY instead. Don't buy the hype on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like all the other \\"Oprah\\" boooks","review":"Many of my friends groaned when I told them that I had bought the new \\"Oprah\\" book. They all said that the books she picks are too depressing. I ignored them, much to my own peril. About 60 pages into the book, I have put it down and do not even want to go on. Even if a book is marginally good, I will read it to the end to see how it works out, but with this book, I don't even care. Every single character is a mess of a person. That wouldn't even be so bad, but the writing is awkward. I counted a sentence that ran for 1/2 the page. That is not an anomaly. Many of the sentences are stream-of-consciousness and I wind up having to reread the beginning of the sentence to refresh my memory of what it was about.I was hoping that I could relate to the characters since I come from a family that gets together at Christmas. But I don't even like the characters enough to find out what happens to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"This is a long read with only a few interesting parts along the way. The characters are not at all likable, which is what the author intended, I think. This book brings to light lots of flaws people commonly have. I don't enjoy reading about unhappy people with such characture-like unpleasant personalities. If you enjoy books with a very negative outlook on life, this one may be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate you, family","review":"I've read this one recently, shortly after reading \\"Freedom\\", published in 2010.I have missed the buzz around \\"The corrections\\" when it was released.I really like this family. Both sons and daughter are well described, as their parents.We all know people who did, say and live the same things that are described here by Franzen.If you have the chance to be part of a big family, you know how hard it is sometimes to find your place in it.But I had to admit that, like for \\"Freedom\\", it took me a while to get caught by this story. The younger son is in the heart of the beginning of this book, and he's a not a pleasant person. I felt some relief when we're finally following someone else.We believe in this story, even the most impossible twists the author is using. That says a lot on Franzen's skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, but a little on the long side","review":"It describes a malfunctining family - in great detail, with great sympathy, great humor, and with a feeling of 'true'.Only problem is it sometimes is too long, with too muc internal deliberation, and too little actual action (for my taste).Undoubtedly a very good book by a very talented writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I found it fascinating and thought provoking. He knows dementia. He knows women. He seems to know men. He understands relationships of all kind, including parent/child."},{"rating":"2","title":"the corrections","review":"There can be no doubt Mr. Franzen is an excellent writer, and I look forward to his next book. I even wrote down several memorable lines in a book I keep for that purpose. However, I had almost no sympathy for any of the characters. It's hard to get truly involved in a book when this element is lacking. I really didn't care what happened to any of them. I think it got a little tedious at times, but I kept on plowing through. All in all, a worthwhile book though not a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it and hated it","review":"I have a real love/hate relationship with this book. On the love side, Franzen is an excellent writer, and for the most part, he keeps you interested and the story hums along. There are moments of extreme clarity and poignancy in the story...especially those involving Enid and Alfred. Alfred's parkinson is dealt frankly and unflinchingly.But on the hate side, I feel like Franzen talks down to his reader and definitely comes across as superior. Also, some of the situations are simply too far-fetched and unbelievable (Chip's trip to Lithuania stands out).Overall, I would say that I liked the book. I guess that Franzen on some level has succeeded on writing a book that is at turns frustrating, thought-provoking and compelling...all at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over yourself Franzen..you are good but not THAT good..","review":"I was really, really, looking forward to this book. I thought, by reading some of the reviews that this guy was going to be clever beyond clever.But in reality, this book is overwritten, to the point of absurdity. This guy makes Cormac Mcarthy look like Robert Fulghum.I didnt like the fact that the characters were not believable, and in some cases that would be fine..but in a book about the craziness of family, I have to really be into the characters. I also find it hard to take authors that are just to cool for the rest of us. He tries to hard to let us know that he is a smart alec..elitist, know it all.This one was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franzen repetes himself","review":"After all the hype I thought I was in for a great read. I wasn't. Franzen writes no better in this novel than in his others. Obtuse, ponderous and dull. One moves from scene with the prolixity of a snail. It is a work that is touted for it's humor and well draw characters. I blink my eyes -- where in heaven's name are they? It's a rambling, cluttered novel that has been over sold with heavy advertising and precious reviews. Help yourselves, my friends, to my share of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.....","review":"I stopped reading about halfway through, picked it up again, and decided it probably wasn't worth it to finish it -- it didn't hold my interest -- and I really hate not finishing books....

I DID finish it, but if it hadn't been for that, I don't think I could have otherwise.

Every page is better then the previous one, all the way to the end.

I used to like books where the author hated his characters and the whole thing was seeing how much humiliation and physical pain he could subject them to, but nowadays I need to have some molecule of concern about the people I'm reading about. With the characters in this book, they could have lived happily ever after or been blown up by a bomb and it wouldn't have made the slightest bit of difference to me. By the time I was reading about the doctor on the ocean liner, I realized I didn't care, it didn't feel worth my time, and it even felt bad for my soul. So I quit reading it. I figured a happy ending would have felt tacked on and fake and a depressing ending would just be more of the same. Franzen's a wicked good writer, and there's lots of funny, beautifully-observed stuff in this novel, but it's a cold fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ad Nauseam","review":"What a bore. Jonathan Franzen is really taken with himself, or so it would seem. He reminds me of a salesman I know that just can't shut up long enough to hear anything except the sound of his own voice. The book is about 250 pages too long. Talk about being verbose! Personally, I found the book to be extremely boring. There wasn't one character in the book that I cared what happened to them. I cannot understand what all the hype was about. Hopefully, if Mr. Franzen decides to write another epic he will implore his editor to \\"edit\\", \\"edit\\", \\"edit\\", and not spend so much time on promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verry boring","review":"I am only half way throu this book and am struggling to even finish it.

This book is very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Oprah thinking?","review":"This is the first book that I have ever been angry that I spent the time reading it. It has no societal value, basically it was 500 plus pages of crap. It is the most wasteful use of paper and ink.

I only give it one star because there was no option to have zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections? May as well be anything!","review":"I found reading a 24+ line sentence in the very beginnning very off putting. The \\"t***\\" sequence on the cruise ship held no weight to the popular theme of cashing in on the old man's patent. I found the characters to be deep and binding: however, the longevity and \\"family dysfunction\\" too much Oprah for me. I congratulate the author for opposing his work to the Oprah circuit. He is a good writer and if left alone, will produce great works. Isn't it time for Oprah to move beyond the oppressed and empowered genre? Our book group is sick of her selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections Is A Waste of Eyesight","review":"\\"The Corrections\\" is ostensibly about a family dealing with the father's Parkinson's Disease (PD) related dementia and the progression of the disease.

Where he got his characters remain a mystery to us. Boring and depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and serious","review":"Jonathan Franzen dissects the Lambert family and its self-destructive ways. Franzen is a fine writer--his characters are fully realized and idiosyncratic, and his story is full of illuminating observations and darkly hilarious black humor. The book really takes off when Franzen is writing scenes; I love his dialogue and the interactions he constructs for the characters. I sometimes found myself losing patience during extended passages of backstory and/or interior experience. I also felt that the relatively rosy ending seemed at odds with the rest of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst books I ever read","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. In fact, I couldn't finish it as it just goes on and on and on never coming up for a breath. Franzen doesn't know how to let things pass.

It became exhausting to read and I decided I had better things to do and better books to read than wasting my time with this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"What a truly horrible book about dysfunctional characters that are completely unlikeable.

I was looking forward to reading this book way before Oprah recommended it. The stuff with Chip should have been condensed into a few paragraphs. He wasn't that interesting of a person anyway. The book wore me out and depressed me. So they had a bad childhood, who didn't. I have seen too many married couples like Al and Enid so that was the good part of the story. I just have to say I do not recommend this book at all. I finished it but felt awful afterward. I must add I will never read another book by an author who is so very stuck on himself. After the rude things he has said about Oprah he should be ashamed. I do not read books because she has recommend them. But he should be glad that she caused a lot of people to buy this book before word got around as to how bad it really is. Because then he wouldn't have sold any."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME FOR MANY...I MUST ASSUME","review":"This books is creating responses from winning the Nat'l.

With the ballyhoo I have read about how wonderful \\"The Corrections\\" is I had to get it and started reading last night (11/14). I have read up to page 55. Normally I will not quit a book until I have read at least 100 pages to \\"give the story a chance,\\" but after reading the critiques in Amazon, I will not waste my time further by trying the next 45 pages.This is a depressing, non-interesting story...and who needs that after Sept. 11th?

Why did Franzen even write about these people: it seems as though he hates them as much as I do. I have read about 1/3 of this novel and I cannot stand it. I fail to see the need to read this book, so although I am on a strict budget, I'm shopping for another!If you love composite sentances and an author who needs to consult his thesaurus every five words, or just like to read about miserable people failing at life, read this book.

If you want to read well written stories of suburban dysfunctionalism, read Cheever or Updike. Save your time with this one. The character's are cartoonish, the plot highly contrived; I am not a woman, but the female characters are clearly written from a man's point of view. You want a male writer of a female character? Read Nabokov. I cannot think of many redeeming features to this book, outside of the fact that its inspired me to write my first on line review.This book is derivative drivel. Please avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The great American novel? You're kidding, right?","review":"After several magazines and newspapers raved about this author, I thought, This book sounds great! So I ordered it in advance. What a disappointment! Unsympathetic characters, a family with contrived dysfunction, self-indulgent writing and silly situations. The characters were neither interesting nor drolly eccentric; they were simply nasty and hostile. The story kept getting worse, and the characters more obnoxious. Next time he writes a book, I'll pass, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone, but still memorable","review":"Like many readers of this book, I had to read about 100 pages until my interest was peaked--the characters are all unlikable in the beginning. But by the end, I liked nearly all of them ... and I was most surprised to like Chip. I guess nearly every character has a redemption of sorts in this book.That being said, I wouldn't think a lot of people would like this book unless they really appreciate character development and a plot that has many elements of farce (such as the Lithuania part). I did find this book realistic, especially Enid's thoughts and behaviors.In the end, I've very glad I read this book, but I would not read it again. It's a tough journey with a lot of muck to slog through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes sloppy is just sloppy.","review":"This guy belongs on Oprah. Or somewhere worse than Oprah. I mean, it's a book that plays to the worst cliches of TV melodrama, the lowest common denominator. That it is considered a \\"literary\\" book tells you just how sorry is the state of things literary. Tell you what--go to the store. Read the 1st chapter standing there. If, having read chapt 1, you want to buy it, well, more power to you. It gets better, too, after chapter 1, but it has so far to go. Too far. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing","review":"I was quite disappointed by The Corrections. While creating the most disgusting characters I've encountered in quite some time -- not one had an endearing quality -- he has so overwritten this essentially sordid situation that I found myself skipping through entire sections and skimming others, which I usually never do. I guess I just kept hoping to find some spark of humanity or some magical turn of phrase that would cause me to care about anyone or anything that happens in this book. I was sick of this ... family early on and it never improved. The subject matter (the so-called dysfunctional family) is not the problem. There are countless other books that have brilliantly captured quirky, malevolent and insane characters: The Confederacy of Dunces and, more recently, Motherless Brooklyn, come to mind as two immediate examples. I do not understand why this wretched book has won so many awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous...what an arrogant person....","review":"I read this book, but felt is was intended for an intellectual to read and not the average person who frequents Oprah's books. It was a difficult read and many phrases and words were difficult to understand or apply. I did not like it at all and gave it to my public library. I am currently reading A Beautiful Mind, it's a difficult book to get through but 100% more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just a disappointed Oprah fan","review":"...please know that being an Oprah fan does not immediately translate to blind acceptance of her book recommendations. I purchased and read the book prior to the announcement that Franzen was \\"out.\\" I, like many others, found the characters pathetic, the storyline inconceivable, and the tone simply depressing and weird. I would not recommend this book to any friend or intelligent reader; there are too many other good books out there to waste time with this one. I just wish I understood how this book generated the flurry of positive attention. . .what does that say about our culture?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book blows","review":"I've tried reading this book several times and just cannot get into it AT ALL. I typically love engaging stories written with real intellect, but Franzen just doesn't do it for me. I found myself not caring about the characters enough to read about them. I've given up and given the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should've Known Better","review":"With all the hype surrounding this book I should've known better than to buy it. I read half of it and finally had to put it down when I realized it wasn't going to get any better. There is nothing enjoyable about this book. I couldn't care less about the characters - I didn't like them, I didn't hate them - they're pathetic and uninteresting. The author goes off on meaningless tangents that add nothing to the story. It seems as if he took ideas from many different stories and threw them together. I find it hard to believe that Oprah liked it. I've read most of the books on her list and while I didn't care for some of them, at least they were cohesive stories. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Bought this on recommendation of the 5 star reviews but unfortunately found myself on the other end of the opinion curve: characters totally cardboard and drawn from cliches without sympathy or insight. Kept asking why the author wrote this book, whatever was the point? Definitely not to be read if looking for intelligence, wit, lyricism or even gritty glimpse of some reality. Nothing here but the author's passing time on his keyboard without any due diligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Must Be Siblings!","review":"I had \\"The Corrections\\" sitting on my bookshelf for several years before I finally picked it up and decided to read it. I took it on a vacation to read while sitting on a beach soaking up the sun. The book is a long one and at times difficult to get through. Then it hit me...this book is all about MY family. Yes, I strongly think that Jonathan Franzen is my sibling. The family he writes about was so familiar to me that at times the book made me feel uncomfortable, but I loved it. The story is quirky, depressing, real, but often funny. Parts of the story is so funny that it surprised me when my laughs came out of nowhere. I would love to see this book made into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was initially quite eager to read the The Corrections. My bookclub is reading it this month so it seemed an ideal way to enjoy a modern novel. Unfortunately, I have not had the rave respose to the book, or to the story for that matter, that every one else seems to have. Yes, it's a well-written story. But in no way does it soar to great or hilarious literary heights. In fact I found much of the story to be long-winded, plodding and somewhat depressing. For this kind of 30-something angst (I myself am 30-something) I would turn to \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" by Dave Eggers, or if you really want to have a laugh at dysfunctional families try books by Ann Tyler, John Irving, Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Dostoyevsky. It's not the worst book I ever read but by no means is it the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely Disturbing","review":"A number of people made comments to the effect: \\"Oh, you're reading The Corrections? I couldn't get through that book.\\" Now that I have read it, I may understand why.Reading this book is like looking at a skinned human -- you always knew that the blood and guts and bones were in there, but you generally focus on the more palatable exterior; it's disturbing at the same time that it is completely natural.The Corrections is like this. Lives laid bare; intrafamily squabbling, game-playing and meddling. Like an uncleansed soap opera, many times closer to real life than would be comfortable. I loved it, yet found it uniquely disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farcical Franzen","review":"Near the end of the book, the middle child, Chip, understands that he must rewrite his screenplay, for the 8th time, with a farcical slant. Although I am not yet familiar with Franzen's other books, I believe this is what happened to him, in his writing of the Corrections. The beginning of the book was a bit of a struggle for me, as my interest wasn't perked until Chip was headed for Lithuania. But then the midwestern foibles of the Lambert family took off and hit a little too close to home on more than a few occasions. In many ways this book reminds me of the social observations and interweaving style of story telling of Tom Wolfe in \\"A Man in Full\\". I felt there were a few too many hanging story fragments, but perhaps that just makes us sorry to have the book end. I am glad that I stuck with this book and would recommend it to most of my friends.....but not my Mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you get past the first 75 pages you'll love it","review":"I picked up this book, yes, because of the Oprah scandal. The beginning is really rough to get through and I almost gave up, but I am so glad that I didn't. I love the way the author switches the narration between characters and his vivid descriptions (something one of the previous reviewers thought was ridiculous). I am amazed at how he was able to get into the skin of an elderly man suffering from dementia; Franzen made me FEEL like I was in Alfred's skin. I thought the story was clever and for the most part consistently kept my interest. There were times where I would have to take a deep breath and pause because he was able to press so many dysfunctional buttons that I'm sure anyone with a family has experienced. Yes, there were a few story lines that were a little silly but over all this was a great book that I would recommend to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint of heart, or the caring","review":"A book whose characters fail to get inside my head is always a disappointment. Dysfunctional families can be fascinating but this family fails to come up with one person who makes me care what happens to him/her. Some of the realities of Parkinsons are well and truly portrayed, but I kept reading hoping to find some crumb of insight that would be a hook. It was a Book Club assignment and to most of us it felt like homework. Some never finished it. One or two actually enjoyed it. I considered my completion of the read as a major victory in perseverence, but this story does not linger in my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullsville","review":"The Corrections with or without the hype is the most boring book I've ever read. It's about a dysfunctional family who continues being dysfunctional until the very end. I didn't feel compassion for any of the characters. Jonathan Franzen gives too many details about using the bathroom, exactly what everyone ate, how they ate it, why they ate it. If you want to fall asleep, read this book. It's too long and extremely boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I kept reading with the hope that it would improve, there was so much room for it to have gotten better. Instead it got even worse. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply boring","review":"The Corrections is simply nothing new. It is trite, full of odd (in a pejorative sense!) one liners, and boring. There is little else to say as nothing is fundamentally wrong with the book, just very little is actually engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Franzen has a gift, stringing sentences of great detail into paragraphs that are relatable to the reader.However after reading the first 50 pages I thought, why am I spending my precious time engaged in the disfunction's of a midwest family when I have already \\"been there, done that!\\" And my own experiences tower over any folklore Franzen could spin. Read it if you enjoy wallowing away in depression, unending turmoil and a story that is very SLOW to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gain","review":"I apologize. Franzen is certainly a gifted writer. I feel compelled to point out that Richard Powers' GAIN has a nearly identical set, plot, and action line. Franzen is a read, Powers is a writer. i don't understand how Franzen bought a house in the Hamptons from this book that was already on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the hype - not at all","review":"I think this book, despite a few amazingly beautiful sentences and commentaries on humanity, is a self-indulgent piece of crap. I FORCED myself to finish it because of all the hype, because so many people spoke well of it. That was no easy task, nor did I ever feel that the effort paid off. Boring, solopsistic, (and once again) SELF INDULGENT. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great prose but not much cohesion to the story","review":"This book sounded very promising at the start, the first few chapters, then began to fall apart without taking the reader along. My mother sent it to me and I wouldn't recommend it for her to read. It has graphic language that doesn't seem to fit in and doesn't seem to have a real purpose. The author comes across as being very impressed with himself for putting together brilliant sentences and prose and saying a lot in a small space, otherwise, it's a wash that doesn't hold together in any way. It is simplistic, banal at times, and although he is quite good at putting ideas on paper, they don't come together in any powerful way. When I finished the book I was disappointed, hoping for a meaning of some sort that pulled it together. Wally Lamb far outdoes this writer in \\"This Much I Know Is True\\", for example, but I will probably read this writer if he writes another novel, but definately wait until it is in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Command of Language but not Substance","review":"Franzen has a command of language. He is able to show and not merely tell, but what is he trying to show us? Other reviews suggest that it is too depressing. I do not see that this is a criticism. I enjoy art form that is capable of making one feel. That is where this, and many other novels fail. The characters are unoriginal, and pathetic. Where Franzen fails is in his artistic vision. He is unimaginative and lacks a connection to the eternal. This book is a book of a certain place and time. It is not timeless, and for this I find Mr. Franzin is without inspiration, and is uninspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after about 100 pages.......","review":"I found many parts of this book interesting and bold. But it wore me out! I got this book shortly after 9/11/01 and simply found it required way too much concentration that I don't have right now. Maybe I could swallow this one better if I had huge chunks of free time and the quieter state of mind this book would require from me. I find paragraphs that are a page long (and there are many) simply too dense for my taste on a good day. Mr. Franzen, less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Realistic Picture","review":"Have just completed The Corrections and thought it was wonderful. Franzen takes you into this family and you feel that you know each member very well. My husband suffers from Parkinson's Disease and I could not believe how he described the father's behavior. The author must have had some first hand information on this disease. I cannot recommend this book enough. Some of the descriptions were long but they painted a picture of each character in the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the hype - you Go Oprah!","review":"I guess I am lucky in that I read this book without being aware of the hype. It was recommended to me as a great book about a dysfunctional family. (I was surprised and a little curious when I bought the book to discover I was reading \\"an Oprah.\\") Franzen develops a great cast of charachters. Each member of the family is fully realized and heartfelt. Yes, they are dysfunctional, but if you've ever been to some other families Thanksgiving, I'm sure you'd call them dysfunctional as well. What Franzen illustrates are the bonds between each family member and how a tug on one relationship will tighten or unravel another. There are sad parts and there are trendy parts, but I really wouldn't hold it against the book. The fact that a novel ranges across emotions and moods shouldn't be a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know these people!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is not \\"the feel good\\" book of the year. In fact it is quite depressing but it is so very real. Each character is someone I know or possesses characteristics of people I know. There are no far fetched plots or sequences. It is just the story of one family, their relationships with each other and with the people that come and go in their lives. The book does not end with everyone as one big happy family, totally content with their world but does anyone's life end that way? If one were to actually \\"know\\" this family one would have a fine time gossiping about their story so it is great fun to read of the happenings of The Lamberts.My advice: read this book for insight into one American family and enjoy how crazy people really are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing - not even entertaining","review":"I couldn't believe how just plain bad this book was. Reads like the drafts that Tom Wolfe threw in the trash -- or maybe a very very bad imitation of William Gaddis.Characters have no depth or reality. I can't believe that any one who reads this could ever get emotionally involved with any of them. The fact that this mess is getting generally positive reviews is a very sad commentary on the state of the novel in America today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Composition 101","review":"The Corrections was hard to read, because J.G. tried to use too much research, too many obscure words, too many incomplete sentences, and sentences that were too long. Except for the father, the characters were unsympathetic and never seemed to learn from their mistakes. A little improvement was shown in that regard toward the end of the book, but it was too little too late. It is surprising to me that this book has received the acclaim that it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry John, maybe next time","review":"This book did have potential, but unfortunaly feel quite short. The biggest problem with this book is that I hated all of the characters. This book is compared with Anne Tyler - which for the quirkiness aspect of the characters has some merrit - but with each of her characters we find ourselves LIKING them and able to empathise. Here, the characters were all dispicable whiny annoyances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get serious drugs before starting this book","review":"I, like many others, thought that this book would be great. The cover (in this case you SHOULD NOT judge a book by) made me think that I was going to read something wholesome and heartwarming. NOT!!!! This book was too long, and too boring! I finished it last night and I am still depressed! I know that I could have writen a better book about my husbands family with my eyes closed! This family is awful. While reading you really want to find something/anything to like about them -- but you can't!!...This book is in terrible need of many many Corrections! Cutting down from 568 pages to half of that would be a great place to start! I'm sorry Oprah, I hated it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-written, pretentious ...","review":"After the Oprah hoopla, I was more than excited to read this book. I mean, Jonathan Franzen ... off Queen Midas herself! It must be great! Down with the man, and all that. Then I picked it up. I got 75 pages in, and thought it was the most self-absorbed, smarmy drivel ever. It reeked of creative writing students out to prove their cool factor and indie cred. David Foster Wallace you are not, so really, Mr. Franzen, could you just spit it out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The triumph of Marketing over substance","review":"This is a very disappointing novel! The writing does not live up to the hype. I read a beautiful short piece by Jonathan about his father having alzheimers disease which was very evocative and poignant but to read the corrections maks me realise that he is not a natural writer. The first 50 pages are excrutiatingly 'forced'and I could barely finish the book. Really this is a run-of-the-mill soap opera. De Lillo he aint!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"What was all the hype about??? I couldn't bear forcing myself to plow through anymore after the first 1/3. Often I found myself finish a few pages and saying \\"who cares?\\". An unfortunate waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was AWFUL","review":"My mother-in-law gave this book to me. She left her bookmark where she had stopped reading. I had gotten a little further than her, thinking that this must get better with all the hype that it has received. It never got better. I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a book. If there is a next time I don't finish a book, I will remember this one! I have never written a review here prior to this one, but I felt compelled, hoping I could prevent at least one person from wasting their time and money on this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated, I guess.","review":"Just finished reading this. I didn't personally find it that enjoyable, and it certainly didn't make me laugh. The writing style tried too hard to be smart and was too self aware, in my opinion. It is like he's trying to be DFW but doesn't have the chops. The story itself is fine, and the characters are reasonably interesting, but there's a lot of fat in his showoffy writing style. I'd rather he lose the thesaurus and just tell the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!!!","review":"I have read most of the \\"Oprah\\" books and have generally liked, or at least, found them thought provoking. This is one of the worst books I have read in some time. If the author's objective was to make sure you disliked his characters he has prevailed triumphantly. I found no sympathy, no caring and little compassion for these nasty people. We all have some of these people in our families and in ourselves, but this took all these flaws to extreme. The only reason I finished this book was I thought it must get better to get the reviews it had (...) I don't even have the heart to let anyone borrow this book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crashing bore","review":"I made a pledge to myself some years ago never to read more than the first 50 pages of a book I can't stand. I broke my promise with The Corrections, unfortunately. What a bore! Nat'l Book Awards Board, what were you thinking? Oprah, what were you thinking? There is absolutely no compelling reason why this book is getting such rave reviews. And note that none of those reviews can state the book's theme. Perhaps, as I believe, because there is none. This book was the biggest waste of my reading time in several years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I am an avid reader and there has been only one book prior to this one that I have put down and said \\"It is so bad I just can't finish it.\\" I made it 3/4th of the way through thinking the author would put the pieces together and give me one character I could identify with or like or hate or something...but no. You don't care about these people and you don't care what happens to them and they all lead these grossly distorted lives that disgust you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Honesty","review":"The magic of this book lies not so much in its plot as in its honesty about human nature. The condition of each member of the Lambert family is catalogued in a series of rationalizations they have made to adjust to a life they otherwise don't understand. An honest reader will recognize these voices as their own, those of friends and loved ones, those of bosses and other authority figures. I would be hard pressed to think of another book that so captivated me in recent years. Perhaps Roth's AMERICAN PASTORAL or Steinbeck's EAST OF EDEN. This chronicle of dramatic inner and inter conflict and turmoil in the context of the most mundane (and some not so) of events is destined to be a book that is talked about long after Franzen, may he live to be very very old and happy, is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longueurs","review":"Franzen has persuasively demonstrated that a diligent and determined forty-something author can crank out a nice, old-fashioned, bloated novel of social commentary. The book has about it the air of a revivalist feat and museum piece. Franzen is a dab hand at the longueurs inflicted on previous generations who had sufficient leisure to devote to slogging through uncompacted narratives stuffed with make-weight details. The novel was of course written to prove a point--to show that his carryings-on in Harper's were not all bluster and tantrum--but was it a point worth devoting half a decade to? I wish he had tried to write something new, something fresh. The Corrections is reactionary stuff, a long step backward."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a horrible book","review":"I didn't like any of the characters, they made awful choices, and the plot just kept going to places that were gross and did not make any sense. I read it, then threw it away, because I didn't want to be the cause of anyone else reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to put it down","review":"A dreary, complaining story filled with whining, self-obsessed caricatures. \\"Exhilarating\\" or \\"spellbinding\\" it is NOT. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This was by far the most boring book I have ever read. Actually I only read about half the book and didn't even get half my money's worth. There was no plot and not a single likeable character and where did he come up with all those unrecognizable words. I have read a lot of Oprah's picks and enjoyed them but she sure missed the boat on this one! I HATED THIS BOOK! I gave it to the Library because I didn't even want it in my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious hype","review":"Why do we torture ourselves by reading books like The Corrections? Are we masochists who enjoy having our native tongue mangled until it is a souless corpse? I could barely get through the first page of this book without a burst of hysterical giggles at how pretentious and bloated the language is. The author spends several paragraphs in the first few pages of the book describing the characters' internal alarm without making one original observation (\\"an overlay of overtones\\" and other such nonsense.) Yet this book receives rave reviews from the critics while better written genre fiction is panned for being clear and having characters one can actually sympathize with. The only thing a book like this can teach us is how to write badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the big deal about this book?","review":"I just don't get it! How this book has been a best seller and received good reviews is beyond me!! I passed this book along to my daughter, thinking maybe I was just too old to appreciate the story, and she agreed: it was awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE DUMBEST BOOK EVER!!","review":"I enjoy reading and since this book rec'd such rave reviews from professionals I bought it as a Christmas Gift for me. I forced myself to read the thing since it cost so much (hardback). I can't believe people like this stuff. This guy just liked to use big words and sound impressive in telling a stupid story about a dysfunctional but ordinary family. The story goes nowhere and you hear way to much details about all the characters in the book. The youngest son going to Russsia is just stupid. This was one of the most over-rated books I have ever read. Give me a break. I will never buy a book again that I havent read a review by a normal person. Professional critics like pain and suffering I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"I like the idea of connecting emotional life with the irony of a Don DeLillo or a David Foster Wallace, but I don't think the writing needs to be so pretentious. Those who are bored with Corrections might want to take a look at Anne Ursu's novel Spilling Clarence. It has the pomo sensibility, but the sentences are crisp and the story compelling enough to read in one sitting. Of course it is written by a woman, so the ability to put feeling and intellect on the page isn't quite so buzz worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book was very difficult to slog through. The characters were unpleasant and the writing mannered, distracting, and at times unreadable. And it goes on for 600 pages. Where was the editor? Pages and pages of a man's hallucination of talking poop--has Franzen even seen South Park? I know this book was supposed to be a satire, but I found very little of it funny or insightful. It was mostly just painful to read. It won the National Book Award, I know, but why? Most of the people I've talked to about the book disliked it as much as I did. I can think of numerous other books that are much better written and much more of a pleasure to read than this one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, overhyped","review":"This is quite possibly one of the worst books I've read in a long time. I can only think of one other book I refused to finish, but this may be the second. The reviews call it \\"funny, moving, generous.\\" I find it nothing but annoying. There is nothing sympathetic about any of the characters, who all need a good smack up side the head. While all families are dysfunctional, I don't believe any family is truly this [messed] up. The New York Observer says its \\"unbearably lifelike.\\" If this reflects family life in the U.S., god help us! It must have been a bad year for books if this one won the National Book Award."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor has no clothes.","review":"I am writing this online (lazy) so forgive the typos, poor grammar, spelling errors, etc.Reading \\"The Corrections\\" is like making love to an extremely obese woman whom I just met in a dark bar late at night, and to whom I would never introduce my friends.I feel dirty and ashamed, and I want out of here very badly.Okay, so I was drunk and horny, but that is no excuse for my behavior.As a novelist myself, I have no problem writing the inspired part of my story, which we can call the \\"meat\\". The problem I have is writing the \\"fat\\" needed to fill out the story to publishable volume.I admit that Jonathan Franzen is a \\"talented\\" writer. I admit I finished reading \\"The Corrections\\". But I feel, in having done so, like I had to gorge on a ton of fat to get to half a kilo of meat.\\"serious fiction\\"?

Overall finishing the book was unrewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressed after I finished it","review":"The way the book is told is kind of confusing, the part about the parents I thought was slow and hard to get through, lots of technicalities that I didn't find interesting. I missed the storyline and the personal message of the book. The end was so depressing that I through it in the corner after finishing it and was mad at my friend for telling me its a good book. It didn't touch me like many other books have. Despite all this though it is greatly written in detail with lots of research involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This books stinks - hands down. The author tries to impress you with his knowledge of the English language by using obscure words, choppy punctuation, and in one case, a 19-line sentencethat left me gasping for air.

Go find a good read and avoid ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical","review":"I can't believe I finished this book. The writing was synthetically verbose, the characters and I'm assuming the writer are arrogant, bitter and shallow.

There must be a how-to one could buy: \\"A Midwesterners guide on how to become urbane\\" It's a cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't I like this book?","review":"There was so much praise for this book I actually felt guilty for not enjoying it. Then I kinda got mad at myself and the book. I mean it's not a bad book, I kinda like Franzen writing, it just seemed to go nowhere. The middle class angst, the dysfunctional family, the oh so flawed characters. It's as if Franzen took all the latest \\"hip\\" themes and just mixed 'em all up like some big bowl of Jello fruit salad.

Correction!","review":"After reading excellent reviews for \\"The Corrections\\", I pre-ordered this book from Amazon.com and very much looked forward to reading it. When Oprah chose it as one of her selections, my enthusiasm only increased. Alas! This book is torture to read. Each sentence drags on with overly poetic, overly detailed, overly worded prose. Each character a pathetic and uninteresting bore (who really cares about these people??). Midwesterners deserve a better description than this book has to offer. Trust me when I advise you not to use your hard earned money on this one.

This should have been a red flag of warning to me since she has recommended some gems to me over the years. But I took it and read it anyway.Maybe it is honest writing, but the writing just seemed to me so in love with itself, or the author was so in love with himself. My family was dysfunctional in a variety of ways, and yet I could not empathize with any of the characters in this book. Why does writing like this garner such literary accolades? I thought it was overlong and I was not impressed overall especially with the ending.Not only has this author shunned and insulted all of Oprah's reading fans, his novel has now turned me off as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone in a 12 woman book club hated this book.","review":"Our local women-only book club is entering its third year. For good or bad, most of the books we've read are Oprah books. Only one book brought about much hostility, The Corrections. In fact, I think only two people read the entire book; the others simply couldn't read the entire thing. Sure, there is great character development -- too bad we couldn't stand one single character.

Clearly there are some redeeming qualities within the pages of The Corrections. There are even flashes of genius, but at no time was I awed by the prose or impressed with the scope of this novel. Others have handled dysfunctional families better. I would suggest Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres. I am surprised that Oprah recommended this book. Because of her I have read such great novels as A Lesson Before Dying and House of Sand and Fog. I have no idea what compelled her to recommend this book.

I find the book to be both arrogant and tedious. Notable - the 5 page discussion between Enid and a fellow cruise member - Lydia - illustrating the upper class, borderline mental illness that seems to enchant Franzen. I find myself skipping pages of this tedious verbal vomit in the hopes of finding something worthwhile. I've given up - halfway through the book. My advice - save your money.

The characters are boring self-absorbed people who have stereotyped problems and the author clearly dislikes them."},{"rating":"1","title":"words, words, words","review":"I read about half way through this book and then skimmed the rest. I just didn't care about any of the characters (I really tried!) and got tired of all the endless words. Underneath all the endless words it seemed there was a great plot and great characters that would grab me from time to time, but then I would get bogged down again. Maybe this book will make a good movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seasoned Reader","review":"One of the worst books I've read. I thought the characters were boring and the book trivial. What is all the hoopla about? Don't waste your energy reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written","review":"The Corrections, after reading, was simply exhilarating. To see the amount of detail put into the family and their problems was breathtaking. It was an easy read to me and I'm sure that i'm not alone on that one. The way that Jonathan Franzen used the family to show the ways of a normal family. I knew exactly how the people in the family felt. The Lambert's, to me, felt like the typical family and I could easily relate. Chip and his problems with trying to find himself and find a job. How Denise went through so many different little obstacles only at the end to find herself. How Gary put up with his family alone to try to be there for Christmas. And most of all the way that Alfred and Enid went at eachother, and how they bickered. It was hilarious to see them fight. It was great to read how neurotic they were. Overall, this book was a good read and is well worth it. I recommend this to everyone. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, stream-of-conciousness waste of time","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, even prior to the Oprah hoopla. I had read so many wonderful reviews. However, I found it drudgery from page 1. The \\"sly humor\\" mentioned in the literary reviews I found to be obvious and not really that funny. Perhaps I'm missing out on the so-called \\"brilliance\\" of his writing, but while I found the depth of the characters interesting, I couldn't help but feel that Franzen had simply taken his character outline and fattened it up for the novel. I found the character of Denise the most interesting, but it was definitely a portrait from a male perspective; and the \\"redemption\\" of Chip at the end seemed too contrived and easy. I do give Franzen credit for making me \\"feel\\" for these characters, though. They are a sad, depressing lot. I muddled through to the end, but never have I been so glad to finish a book! Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"The writer is too visible","review":"I like a transparent author, one who disappears as his or her story takes shape. Think of Steinbeck in _Of Mice and Men_ or Wally Lamb in _I Know This Much is True_ or a host of others. Franzen is unwilling to get out of the way. He works hard to show that he's clever, to demonstrate that he's a great writer. Each of the demonstrations stands in the way.I went to a reading of Tobias Wolff's a few years back. He read some stories from his collection _The Night in Question_. I had read each of them before and, as he read, I was re-reading them again. His voice was simply the carrier, just as his writing voice was the carrier when I read them on my own. I picture Franzen reading his work in a too-loud shirt, with a voice that calls attention to his reading, and with asides and smiles throughout.All in all, it felt like a proud writer trying to show off. I wasn't carried away by it. There was too much writer and too little writing there."},{"rating":"1","title":"two words- talking feces","review":"Do not feel the need to read this book unless you are a pretentious bore so earnest to prove that you are literary and current that you look and talk like Jonathan Franzen himself. This book would be \\"quaint\\" in five years if it weren't so detail-addled and completely devoid of humor. In its desperate quest for relevance, it creates completely unbelievable characters and embarrassing attempts at existentialism. After reading this, I felt much the same way I felt at the end of Titanic... what were those reviewers smoking? Did they pop some Mexican A-? I'm mean, I'm usually a big fan of reading about old guys with incontinence and hallucinations about excrement, but this piece of doo-doo not only talks too much, it stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Character Development","review":"For me, the strength of a novel lies in how well the characters are developed. In \\"The Corrections\\", Jonathan Franzen has it mastered.I can't say I identify with Chip, Gary, or Denise, because I come from a different culture being a 40 something Black female, but Franzen does help me to see the roots of some of their dysfunction.By describing their midwestern home life so skillfully, he helps me to understand some of where Chips failures, Gary's materialistic outlook, and Denise's sexual crisis come from. Enid's struggles on the other hand, hit home for me. I could relate to her feelings for her children-love, pride,disappointment and finally acceptance-and to the painful mixed feelings she had for Alfred as he battled Parkinsons.I found the ending showing Enid's growth, revelations about her family and outlook for the future to be very positive. This is a great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Insight","review":"Jonathan Franzen has brilliant insight into the psyche of the traditional role of a mother as we know it. Where does his exactling knowlegde come from? He raises many if not all of the socially important issues of the last few decades in a sometimes page turning zeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the Worst Books I Have Ever Read","review":"I don't ever remember feeling this angry after finishing a book. Angry that I wasted time reading this tome in hopes that it would become clear why reviewers thought so highly of it. It never did. And I was angry to think that anyone with such a dim, humorless, sad view of humanity would feel compelled to share it with all of us. Don't let the blurbs from DeLillo and David Foster Wallace on the jacket fool you...Franzen is _not_ in their league. There wasn't a single character who seemed remotely real to me at any point in the novel. Instead they seemed like monsters patched together out of anger and bitterness. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS NOT NEW","review":"OK, we heard about this for months and I couldn't wait so I bought it as an eBook before publication. And I am glad I got it so inexpensively. While I found this book interesting and fast moving it is certainly NOT the great American novel as hyped (I reserve that nomenclature for books like Dreiser's An American Tragedy). Between movies and other similar novels, let's face it...we have heard this stuff before. I found it only momentarily moving, most of the characters to be flat, and the ending...what a jolt with no real prior motivation. In all honesty, this was a WHINING book with no meaning for our society. SO much better has been written over the years by other authors that I wonder why the hype here. The attempt at relating the demise of our often greedy culture was naive at best, and after the fact as we are living it now. I will quickly forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!!","review":"I had so looked forward into diving into a big, thick novel on the hilarity of family disfunction. As one who will finish a book 99% of the time, regardless of how bad it is, I've put this one down smack dab in the middle. I cannot fathom wasting another moment of my life on this ill-conceived, unfocused piece of trash.My complaints: This book goes NO where. You are stuck with unbeliveable and unlikeable characters doing nothing. And when the characters might do something it is wholly implausible. (A former college professor going to lithuania to set up a mail fraud scheme with his lover's ex-husband?! Please!) I put the book down when Franzen attributed complex thoughts to a five year old.While it appears from other reviews this book is a love/hate proposition, I cannot fathom what anyone could have liked about this book. No plot, no real characters, no direction, nothing. I would compare this book with getting teeth extracted. In a word: horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped book UNDERDELIVERS","review":"This overhyped novel was hard to get through, but I plugged away anyway, hoping the rewards were on down the line...they never arrived! The word pretentious comes to mind...surely this is not a commentary on even the most dysfunctional family in America...(?) The trashed-out characters, over-written descriptions of mental machinations (the turds?), and on and on. The only thing I will give this book and J. Franzen, is his awesome ability to use words in a humorous context. Pathetically, one of the funniest scenarios in the book, was his use of contemporary aviation news buzz-words (crash site) to describe Alfred, with Parkinson's, attempting to eat the hor'duerves made by his daughter. In summary, there are too many other fine reading experiences to partake of than to waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring!","review":"The first 150 pages or so I was engrossed in the book. Then I kept reading and I couldn't take it anymore. I started skimming over large sections of the book to get through it faster. The characters were not interesting enough to have ~100 pages written about each one of them. I started using this book as a tool to fall asleep on the airplane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Family Saga","review":"The Corrections, last year's It Book, turns out to even better than its hype would indicate. Scathing, disturbing, deeply felt, and laugh out loud funny (sometimes all one page), this novel manages to capture a very particular point in time (America at the end of the boom) while feeling generously and effortlessly universal.Each of the characters is painfully sympathetic and completely infuriating in turn, their mental landscapes sometimes nightmarish but always compelling and occasionally, naggingly, familiar. Franzen repeatedly turns the remarkable tonal trick of juggling powerfully emotional scenes with those of near farce. Wonderful set pieces abound, begging to read aloud: Chip's swordfish, Gary at the IPO, anything on the cruise.And just when you think the book too rich to be brought to any kind of satisfying conclusion, Franzen pulls off a lovely, low-key finish that carries his wide-ranging story to a graceful close."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Wanted to Like it!","review":"I had heard so much about this book and had put it on top of my summer reading list. What a big disappointment. There were many times in the book that I wanted to put it down, but did not because so many people had liked it. I am sorry I didn't.While, I thought that the story line was boring and quite frankly pretentious, the quality of the writing was good. Franzen does an excellent job of painting a picture with words. However, even this is not enough to devote the time of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about modern family relationships. Loved it.","review":"This book is truly great. The characters are interesting and may seem like people you know. The chapters are very dynamic. After reading this book you may think a while about relationships, marrying the right kind of person for your personality, how marital problems may affect our disposition and our outlook at other things in life. I highly recommend this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go home again","review":"I read this book as I traveled home for Christmas for the first time in 8 years and I found it both thought provoking and emotionally evocative. Johnathon Franzen has painted a remakable portrait of an American family at the turn of the century, and textured his work with wide-ranging commentary on political correctness, technological innovation and global economics. Underlying all of these themes is the essential paradox of our times: the more comfortable we become, the harder we strive to make ourselves, our jobs, and our families perfect, the less happy we really are.I liked the book. And I'm glad I took the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why 2 stars?","review":"I don't know....the whole experience of this book was confusing. I rushed to buy it after Oprah recommended it so highly. I started reading it and wondered what happened to that book she was so excited about. I just didn't get it. I didn't care about any of the characters and I never got involved in the story, nor was I able to really follow it so well. I guess I just didn't care..because I gave up after about 125 pages, which is something I rarely do. Maybe I will try it again one day, but for now there are too many other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulkner First","review":"If you want to read about dysfunctional families, stick with Faulkner, he's got it down pat. This novel didn't pass the first sentence test for me; Absalom! Absalom! does..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Blah, blah, blah...\\"","review":"Way too many words! There were parts of this book I absolutely loved. There were times I stopped reading to write down what I had just read because it struck me to my very core. Unfortunately, there were more minding numbing, endless pages of just 'words' to get through to reach those points. Skimming, skimming, skimming. Obviously based on the numerous awards and the high amount of rave reviews here on Amazon, I am in the minority, but it is how I feel. I told my friend I would like to give her a redacted version. Someone give me a wide tip black magic marker!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this book","review":"I wanted to love this book. After a boring start, I got into the first section and really wanted to get to know the characters... and then it just started rambling and lost me. I am trying very hard to finish this novel but might have to throw in the towel. It's just bad, boring, nonsensical, rambling... and the shame is, it doesn't have to be. I wish the author had stayed with the original characters and continued on with the story. Instead he introduces new superficial characters that I have no interest in and adds a bunch of research and boring information. This could have been a great story but he dropped the ball. Don't buy this book. Get it from the library if you must and then give it back before you finish reading it... save yourself some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've read in years","review":"I can't believe I wasted 2 days on this long, boring, sexually disgusting, depressing book! It came \\"highly recommended\\" from a reputable bookstore. After reading it, I shared parts of it with the friend who gave it to me and she was so embarrassed - neither of us can understand why anyone would EVER recommend this to anyone! We can't imagine how it got such a high rating - did these people actually read the book??The characters are cartoonish, the plot non-existant, the sex graphic and boring, and everyone is so self-absorbingly unhappy from doing awful things to each other. What a waste!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As enjoyable as having an attack of hemorrhoids","review":"This is not art. This one deserves a negative star. I had to take a break from reading this when one of the character's started to have a conversation with his excrement. Everything about this book is unpleasant: 1) Writing style was long-winded and dwelled on areas and characters I couldn't care less about. 2) I was amazed that some folks thought it was funny. Any humor in the novel was not clever--just plan mean-spirited. I had to force myself to finish it and was sorry I assaulted my senses by doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I waited four months to get this one from my library and I was very disappointed in Franzen's style. He gets too wordy for the story to flow as it should. The characters had depth, but I felt like I was drowning in the endless pool of descriptions and analysis. Don't get too excited about this one. It's only worth it if you enjoy digging through 600 pages of words to get a 200 page story."},{"rating":"1","title":"disdaining people and bizarre writing","review":"I fell for the READ IT review and lost. Having made it thru this tome, waiting for some lesson, something of real worth, I am very disappointed. One can easily do without one-third of the book with all its ridiculous fabrications. The writer clearly is or knows someone who has feelings of great contempt for one's parents and other people. Hopefully, the majority of readers won't identify. This is a book about the saddest of people who spend their lives in hatred and contempt and make attempts to punish others and retaliate for perceived wrongs. But there are no lessons learned. Its a depressing disjointed run on and I feel it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big NO","review":"This is an honest attempt to write a novel that is contemporary; hence, lots of discussion about international trade agreements, pharmacology, hollywood and the whole culture industry, academic critical theory, et cetera, et cetera.Unfortunatley, Franzen has no style. And that's enough to kill a book. And it kills this one. I second the person who said ideas and characters were lifted from Delillo's WHITE NOISE, particularly the way the young children gang up and verbally attack their parents.The dialogue is uninspired; the description is unimaginative. Franzen moves through time in a very plodding way.Again, I have to second another reviewer: if you want to read a great book on families, read THE MAN WHO LOVED CHILDREN by Christina Stead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I tried to make myself read this book but just could not. It is one of only maybe 5 books in my life I have ever started and decided not to finish. I simply did not care what happened to any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Read?","review":"I began this book with a desire to become lost in a story. But maybe I've missed something. It is full of sentences 8 lines long and many words I'd never heard of before. It probably is well written but what is the plot? I do not like to use the dictionary every 5 pages. It takes away from the enjoyment. Even though I am a college graduate, I was not impressed.If you feel as I do, try reading \\"Sing Me A Bawdy Song.\\" It is probably not as well written, however, it has a great plot and it will make you laugh and it will make you cry. Maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"literature lover","review":"This book is all media hype. You get the feeling that the author not only has contempt for his own characters, but for the reader as well. This book has one-dimensional characters, a silly plot and writing that tries hard to dazzle and falls flat. If you think Oprah's list is complex and deep literature, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Why would someone who has such obvious potential as Jonathan Franzen waste it on writing this depressing book? I kept reading in order to be pleasantly surprised but went away feeling a giant letdown. Overblown and boring with some fantastic bits stuck in randomly; but these bits are not worth ploughing through the rest of this overrated tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring and pretentious book I ever read","review":"I was determined to finish this book regardless of how boring and pretentious I thought it was. Jonathan Franzen seems to be so impressed with himself, he is not thinking at all about the reader or the story telling. Was it Freudian that I accidentally left the book on a train? Perhaps, but not wanting to purchase the book again (or read it for that matter), I finished it on audio book from the library - the abridged version. It was torture as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am very sorry to say I had a very hard time getting through half of this book. The subject (when I first bought this book) was very interesting. I thought this would be an appealing book. I think he overdid one of the characters in the plot and I felt very sorry for the main character. One of the characters in the story was hard to believe, I could not relate her to anyone or imagine her even being real.For whoever finishes this book, I hope the second half is better than the first...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Novel","review":"This story could have been good - if only one of the Lamberts was even mildly sympathetic - instead of all of them being simply pathetic. Franzen must have taken a thesaurus with him wherever he went to write the book and used the most difficult words he could find to express his point. I'm an educated, intelligent woman and I've not had to go to the dictionary while reading a novel as many times as I did with this novel - not a single trip to which revealed a deeper meaning that would have enhanced the storyline. I still have trouble realizing that this horrid story received a major literary award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I don't typically abandon a book, but I have been struggling with finishing this one. Maybe it's because I don't like Franzen's writing style, that I could care less about any of the characters, or that it's a painfully slow read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a witty, wonderful, hilarious, tragic, and philosophical book. It is important, and it should be read and thought about for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clueless people behaving accordingly","review":"If you read for pleasure, don't buy this book.

A book where *nothing* ever happens? Then this is the book for you.Somehow, the Hype Machine has convinced people that this guy has talent. People will believe anything nowadays.The book is dull as dust. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections","review":"No matter how I tried, I just could not get into this book. Franzen's flowery writing style basically bored me to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic...","review":"...don't waste time or money on this one. It is the tale of a family of overeducated fools who victimize themselves making stupid mistakes in their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Melodrama from a Grant Hog","review":"Franzen pretends to be a philosopher who will follow any commercial siren song that takes him away from the book he should be writing. In fact, this is the best he can do. Like fellow grant hog Rick Moody, Franzen believes that he has discovered an authentic Vermeer painting stuck in a dusty corner of a conterminous country squire's chilly manor. Instead he finds some cobwebs and sawdust. The Corrections truly tells us a lot about the author's capacity for trite obsession, self-deception, and his weaselly response to the lure of great art. I would rather have been mugged than reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for saving me the agony","review":"...of reading any more than the 20 pages I struggled through. I would rate this no stars if I had the choice. Too cute for words exactly but it's worse than that. The reviewers who passed on thoughtful comments about the negative qualities of this book should be applauded for warning us. Though the subject matter seems interesting at first, I think this is one of the sloppiest pieces of writing I've seen in years and its publication is an insult to the reader. Franzen ought to be embarrassed to see it in print and the professional reviewers who even suggested that the book might have any literary merit are a disgrace. Sorry, but I think the publication of this book has to do with marketing and money, and nothing else. I am so glad I didn't waste my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Nothing is ever resolved. There is no point to any of it. This book does nothing but depress and bore the reader. Don't put yourself through the agony!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars! Skip it!","review":"This was a VERY long book and I regret the time I spent trying to find the point! It is a story about a bland,dysfunctional family. The characters are not at all sympathetic or interesting. Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal book: dysfunction is not to be celebrated","review":"This book is bad on so many levels. Each member of this family is self centered and evil. None of them take responsibility for their actions, and the christmas climax made me hurt.There is no resolution to this story...no one is redeemed at all...not one character has sympathy or empathy for the others.It is NOT the American way to hate your parents, siblings, lovers, spouses. This book seems to esteem hatred of those you are suppossed to love.I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored to death","review":"My sister urged me to keep reading, so I did, all the way to the bitter end. I never cared about one of the dysfunctional characters. No one had freedom as everyone was involved in deconstructive relationships that deflated any sense of purpose. I can't believe I spent so much time waiting for some redeeming characteristic to push through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the effort","review":"As much as this is a superbly written novel, I felt it sometimes could have benefited from some further editing. It sometimes struck me as too long and too detailed. The separate and intersecting lives of a dysfunctional midwestern family are brought into sharp focus. The aging mother, Enid, clumsily searches for fulfillment in her own life as she copes with the advancing Parkinsonism of her husband Alfred. The three grown children have their own problems to deal with. Alfred's increasing dementia, his hallucinations, and his family's reactions to these symptoms are brilliantly depicted through interior monologue and fractured dialogue. If for nothing else, this book is worth it for the view that it gives of the demented father's thoughts and feelings. If you have the patience to make your way through this (sometimes) overly detailed novel, you will be richly rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book!","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise. I had been avoiding this book specifically because it was on the Oprah Book Club, however I really enjoyed it. I may have liked it better because I fit in the demographic which Franzen writes about: 30ish, educated, grown up in the Midwest, with a dysfunctional nuclear family. Like other readers I wonder when did Franzen meet my family?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This dreary book is one long chapter about slow, sluggish, dysfuctional family life. There are no chapter breaks which makes material as dull as this very difficult to read. I tried to get through all 568 pages of it, but decided life was too short and stopped at page 478. (So, see, I really tried to get through all of it.) This is probably one of the worst books I have purchased in many years. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten; better than Sonata","review":"This one was too long by a good 100 pages, frequently tedious, and would have been much better had Franzen not been so occupied with being \\"writerly\\" (a deadly boring quality in an author). In too many places, Franzen seems to forget that he's telling a story, as he's too busy exercising his vocabulary. Frankly, I don't care how many five-dollar words he knows, or how cleverly he can incorporate them into complex sentences. They don't impress. I know five-dollar words, too, and lots of clever folks can produce verbal structures fit to make one's head swim. Sadly, Franzen's verbal acrobatics serve his image of Serious Writer more than they serve his story. In fiction, story is all, story is what truly matters, and it suffers here at the hands of etymology. Let's hope he finds a stronger editor next time, who'll tell him to just bloody well get on with it. On the whole, a disappointing read but an excellent sleep-inducer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am an avid reader and find that Oprah's picks are generally on target. This book was horrible. The writing was pretentious;the plot lines rambled and dragged on and on and on and on.......I have had a very tough time finishing this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly disappointing","review":"I picked up this book after reading several positive reviews for it, and decided to give it a shot. I was fairly disappointed. It's not that the story's bad or the characters aren't believable. The writing is sub-par. Franzen's overuse of excessively, um, unique metaphors detract from the narrative and make it a painful read. Lines like \\"two empty hours were a sinus in which infections bred,\\" and \\"her open eye was like nearly black balsamic vinegar beading on white china\\" are not clever. Nor are they particularly helpful in describing the mood or the appearance of someone or something. This is the kind of writing that high school English teachers surround in red ink with words like \\"simplify.\\" I know my high school English teachers never would have let me get away with this kind of rubbish. This book would have been significantly more ejoyable if the reader didn't have to navigate around needlessly complex phraseology and flowerly writing that doesn't add anything to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hype?","review":"I can't quite figure out what all they hype about this book is? It's a rather tedious story about a family that is not particularly interesting or compelling. You won't be missing anything if you skip this one. I wish I'd quit reading at the halfway point instead of slogging through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me again why he turned Oprah down...","review":"I picked up the book minutes before Oprah did, and happened to read Franzen's comments regarding his rejection of her, and I thought they were good enough for me to give the book a shot. He thought it had enduring potential. Also, at a reading Jane Hamilton gave, she said she loved it. Here's what I thought: Jonathan Franzen is really smart, pretty funny, can put a great sentence together, and it's a great psychological study of people. But I felt the book had no soul, and I'll be quite surprised if it endures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A smart Tom Wolfe","review":"Like Tom Wolfe, Franzen writes smug. Unlike Tom Wolfe, Franzen writes masterly ... full of nuance and intracacy. My biggest hangup is that he devoted nearly 600 pages to his ego and shoe-horning in everything he knows about everything. And throughout, I couldn't help thinking Franzen is enamored with the consumer culture he sets out to criticize ... just like Chip. If powerful fiction is honest, Corrections is weak. I say give Franzen a few years. With a few experiences under his belt, he won't be so full of himself. His ability to write is masterly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much of a Semi-Good thing","review":"I recognize the human frailties that infect our society.Franzen presents them in a satirical manner. But, he does notknow when to quit. He milks each point for all it is worth; finally causing somnolence.The book is in need of serious editing. Max Perkins, where are you when we need you most?True, there are insightful and beautifully expressed passages but 500 plus pages are excessive for what is being said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding","review":"I don't know why this book won any rewards. at best it is plodding and at its worse it is boring. It is almost impossible to care what happens to the characters in this book. I would not have purchased this book, if it hadn't been reccommended by Oprah Winfrey. Once I had purchased it, I realized that I had read Mr. Franzen's previous book and hated it evenmore than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The saddest thing","review":"is the degree of artistic and cultural bankruptcy required to make this come off as anything less than a tin man's lament. The characters are cliches, without the wit of their abbreviation, the plot's as deep and undulate as a backyard puddle, and the message, which bears the watery thumbprints of an island castaway, is of the hey it's your family I guess the old man wasn't such a (...) after all your mom did her best variety that does Hallmark proud. For only one stranded on a very rare island would think this work anything but banal, or the author that gave it life anything but second-rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laborious and disappointing","review":"I can't imagine that anyone would truly enjoy this book. It is laborious to read, and it is not entertaining. The author seems to enjoy his ability to string together 60 word sentences; the author doesn't realize that someone who is reading for enjoyment will find that annoying. The characters are pathetic and while Franzen spends too much time trying to advance the plot through the characters, readers never really know the characters; they DON\\"T come alive- they are flat characters.Obviously I would not recommend this book to anyone. Unless of course they are masochistic readers. Even then, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! Shame on Oprah, this is not a book that her usual audience will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing Again","review":"My copy of The Corrections arrived via UPS ground delivery on 9/13, at a time when I felt everything that had happened or been written before 9/11 was now moot and irrelevant. Nevertheless, by the weekend I gave this book a chance. Unable to sleep last night, I awoke at 2am and absorbed myself until dawn in wry laughter and astonishment at Franzen's ability to articulate the absurdities in ordinary life as it was. A mixture of Anne Tyler, Phillip Roth, Don DeLillo and Tom Wolfe - all my favorites roled into one. I look forward to living in Franzen's pages for a week or more longer, and then sharing him with my dearest friends, who also need to rediscover laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to thoroughly depress yourself, read this book.","review":"There is not one happy thought in this entire book. It is quite painful to read. The characters are not only currently depressing, but they also have no hope of ever being any more optimistic at any point in their miserable lives. I have nothing against tragic characters, but in these characters there is nothing redeeming about the pain and suffering that they endure. The author seems like a very disturbed individual. Even when it is not necessary to make a point, he adds a depressing thought completely unrelated to the main message he is trying to convey (i.e. the hampster story in the last chapter when Denise is walking down to the basement). Don't waste your time or money with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections.","review":"This book was a great disappointment to me. I had heard about it on Oprah's TV program when it was chosen as her selection of the month, plus it has been on the Ten Best Sellers List for a weeks. It was a depressing book to read. All of the characters are dysfunctional. I would not recommend it, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another book about a dysfunctional American family","review":"Skip this book. There really is nothing to like about it. The characters are so revolting that you find yourself hating them and the book. The only reason why I finished the book is because its for our book club, otherwise I would have cut my losses after the first chapter. If I could have rated it a zero or less I would have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Second Coming of Great Literature!","review":"After all the hype, I fully expected to be in for a great reading experience. What a disappointment. Other than the fact that it's filled with current pop culture references, it's completely derivative of many novels that have come before -- read Richard Yates's \\"Revolutionary Road\\" as an example. Why he needed over 550 pages to tell this story, is a big mystery. Some of the writing is quite good, but you have to plow through so much bloated pretentious prose to get to any of it that it's really not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I can't believe Oprah selected this book. I made myself finish it because I don't ever NOT finish a book. This was filth. I tried to pass it along to friends since it is a best seller and they all returned it saying there was no way they would read it. I read a couple of books a week on average. This was awful. Worst book in years. I actually threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holiday cheer for the entire family","review":"Ok, maybe not quite. To be honest, this is a hard novel to either recomend or disparage. Franzen is obviously a very talented writer and there are stretches of really funny writing scattered throughout the book. For example, Chip's adventures in academia, New York and Lithuania could have made for a pretty good book in and of themselves (if you like cheap but easy laughs). And the passages which document Alfred's descent into dementia are truly horrifying.On the other hand, the prose in a lot of the book is simply workmanlike - trudge, trudge, trudge forward - and to be frank, boring. I can't see telling someone to go ahead and try this book when when their reading time, like mine, is probably limited....So, not bad but nothing really to write home about. If Oprah hadn't chosen this as one of her picks (incidently, did anyone even remotely connected with her show read it beforehand?), we wouldn't even be hearing about it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"Though I saw many good insights in this book, the characters and plot got lost in a sea of rhetoric. All of us stem from some family disfunction, but we need to find the glue that holds us together. This book spilled the glue and left the family in worse distress than we found them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections - not recommended for Oprah's list by our book club","review":"My book club read The Corrections and it was unanimously disliked. There is not one single character to identify with positively or one action taken by a character that was done with positive intentions. In summation, its a very dark view of humanity and leaves the reader feeling as dismal and hopeless as the characters themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections--unoriginal","review":"My biggest issue with The Corrections is that I found it unoriginal. Chip, his career, his relationship with one of his students, his drug use, his obsession with his bad manuscript, and his lack of responsibility all reminded me of Grady Tripp in Wonder Boys, only not nearly as compelling. As far as talking turds go, nothing will ever be as shocking or as funny as Mr Hanky from South Park.The sections of the book that redeem it are the ones that include Gary and his family. Not because Gary is a nice guy but because I believe the descriptions of his life. This is more than I can say for the other characters, except perhaps Denise.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I'd tell them to read Wonder Boys by Micheal Chabon, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Book Club agreed...","review":"My Book Club agreed... that we'd rather poke our eyes out with forks than finish this book. It was disturbing, disjointed, unappealing and a waste of good money. A few of our members even returned their books to bookstores halfway through. However, it does make a handy door stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Arrogant","review":"Boring, disappointing, absolutely mindnumbing- this book is one of the most overrated tomes in recent memory. The temptation to put it in the giveaway pile without finishing it was great, but I resisted, thinking it was going to improve. It didn't-and his arrogrance shone through on every pageI am not sure what reviewers saw in this muddled piece of material, and I would not recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cozy snapshot of late 20th century America","review":"(excerpted and condensed from NYTimes review)By turns funny and corrosive, portentous and affecting, \\"The Corrections\\" not only shows us two generations of an American family struggling to make sense of their lives, but also cracks open a window on a sullen country lurching its way toward the millennium.\\"The Corrections\\" is a remarkably poised narrative held together by a myriad of meticulously observed details and tiny motifs that create a mosaiclike picture of America in the waning 20th century. And while the story line is propelled by several suspenseful questions - whether Alfred's patent for a metallurgical discovery will pay off, whether Chip will escape from Lithuanian thugs, whether the shotgun in the Lamberts' basement will be put to use - the real tension in \\"The Corrections\\" stems from the characters' emotional dramas, rather than from the sort of contrived plot points found in the Franzen's earlier novels...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treats his characters like bugs under glass","review":"I could happily live the rest of my life without reading another dysfunctional family novel, but the critics were so united in their praise of this book that I had to see what all the fuss was about. Much ado about nothing, as it turns out. It should come as no surprise that Franzen looked down his nose at Oprah; Franzen looks down his nose at every character in his own novel. He manages to flay everyone from midwesterners to east coast intellectuals, conservatives to liberals--and while his wit is certainly well-honed, his utter lack of empathy or affection for his own characters makes this novel feel both cold and flat. He gives them glaring faults without saving graces, crushing losses without a hint of triumph. Then he sits back and mocks the way they flounder under their burdens. Literature with a capital L? More like Pretension with a capital P. This book is all head and no heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"I made it to page 80 and just couldn't go any further. WHY, oh WHY did Oprah want to honor this book?I gave it one star because the author knows how to put sentences together reasonably well. That's the only reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeck!","review":"What is all the hype about? I consider myself a well-read, well-rounded individual who loves all types of literature. This is not it. Knowing that Oprah has had her hits and misses, and after hearing all the accolades I went ahead and bought the book, even though the jacket description did not interest me. I should have gone with my instincts.Not only could I not identify with any of the characters, (not even the boarder characters that he details in such length) I was appalled and repulsed by them all. Having a father with Parkinson's, this books treats the terrible debilitating disease as a mere nuisance of getting older. You can't feel for the father, the mother or any of these brats they raised.Do yourself a favor; skip this book, unless you like to be depressed and sad. If you do, this book is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Could Finish This Book","review":"I reached page 341 weeks ago and haven't picked it up since. If I didn't feel guilty over the [money] I spent and the fact that I've rarely ditched a book, I'd sell it used. Franzen is a pretty good writer and there are lots of insightful and amusing tidbits about human behavior scattered throughout, but the story itself is tedious and drawn out ad nauseum: it's just not very compelling nor are the characters. Maybe the book reminds us that some dysfunctional families are in fact as boring as this one and their members equally one-dimensional. How depressing. The novel might have been better if it was more concise and the clever tidbits showcased in short stories. I'll try to finish it, but don't pull out your plastic-buy the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrections","review":"This is the worst book I have attempted to read in years! The characters are totally stupid and I could not identify or care about any of them. The writing style is long and laborious. I tried to like the book because of all the hype over it, but I couldn't finish it. I can't imagine how it ever made the best seller lists. I wish I had read the customer reviews before I wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and Boring","review":"I got through a little over half of this book before I decided that all the hype did not mean the book was good (and certainly not a \\"classic\\") and put it down for good. In fact, I thought it was bad and a big waste of my time. The sex was sick, the story a drag. I wish I had read the Amazon customer reviews before I started. I never would have started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Year's greatest fiction??","review":"Oof! Jonathan F. obviously has his craft down, and the book flows quickly enough. but I would think that for a character driven novel, 500+ pages are enough to create people whose main traits aren't the face-value facets lifted off of poor shmucks parading themselves on day time talk shows. I felt none of the characters had any depth to speak of. I'm sure my parents would love to have my copy along side their countless Dick Francis novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just put it down.","review":"I've made it to page 316. Three hundred and sixteen agonising pages of family angst and a deluge of masturbatory red herrings later, I've decided to just put it down. The two stars are for actually getting me to read this far. There may be some merit in that, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not even good enough to read on the Metro.","review":"I have almost nothing positive to say about this book. None of the characters were likeable. The situations they were put in were predictable. The language was pretentious. The only reason I read this book was because my mother gave it to my fiancee as a gift, and I was bored. I should have stayed bored. This was a terrible book. I can't believe that this got such great reviews. The good reviews, I fear, are proof of either grade inflation in today's universities, or the self-evident worthlessness of postmodernist writing. Give me \\"East of Eden\\" any old day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catch-23","review":"as a reader of literary fiction, i am appalled at the truth that this so-called writer, a man who supposedly wrote this novel blind folded and in his basement, has gotten away with one of the grandest literary rip-offs known to readers everywhere. the only thing worth saying is that this novel is funny, though it was funnier the first time i read it, when it was called Catch 22. The stylistic similarites are so obscenly close (the brother attends D--- College, J. Hellar's masterpeice has a Major De C---, Gitanis is the Syndicate)that anyone remotely familiar with Catch--22 should be able to put, well, 2 and 2 together and realize that every transitional paragraph is bitten from the great one himself. i am surprised, well, not really, that readers of this work, that reviewers of fiction, have been unable to recognize the blatent mimicing of this overwritten, underthought novel. If you want to read the corrected Corrections, read Catch 22, at least it has a moral purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I expected a comic satire on the American family and got just the opposite. This book is depressing from the beginning to the end. No one is happy with themselves or each other. They are cruel and selfish individuals. The only character that isn't totally selfcentered is the grandchild Jonah, and he too chooses in the end to do what is most pleasant for himself, rather than going to the grandmothers. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insightful but inhumane","review":"I found The Corrections to be incredibly and painfully accurate at times. Overall, however, I was struck by how condescending and inhumane it was. I struggled to like just one character in the book, to find any empathy (as opposed to pity and even revulsion) for any one. I wonder if Mr. Franzen held his creations in such contempt, or if he failed to convey otherwise to me as a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franzen sporting two day stubble in jacket photo...","review":"...is your first warning. You can skim entire sections of this book without missing anything. Lots of scenes are clearly written for big picture deal. I might not have been so severe had I not just finished reading Sijie Dai's \\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" -- a wonderful book that probably makes Franzen's writing seem worse than it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the worst thing I've read...","review":"but it's not the best either. I had a really hard time getting into the story and believing the characters. I do agree with other reviewers that it is more literary than a lot of books out there, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a great book.I do like some of the wordplay and imagery Franzen uses. He is excellent with using language to create emotion and images that make you think. However, some of his writing gets a little too over the top and it becomes hard to follow at all.The characters are really hard to understand because they are so dysfunctional and poorly developed. You really don't feel much for any of them because you just don't care.Would I recommend this to family and friends? No. I am reading it with a friend of mine who wanted to read it - I wouldn't have chose to read it otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-distance hike through knee-deep mud","review":"I couldn't wait to get this book after reading the reviews. I'm a lover of serious literature. I was disappointed to find the characters loathsome and tedious. I need at least one person in a story whom I like and am rooting for. I didn't even feel compassion for these people. They are so infuriatingly self-destructive, irresponsible, selfish, and emotionally lazy.The story itself was long, slow and unengaging. I dragged myself through it in hopes of a pay-off in the end, but the \\"corrections\\" were skimpy, simplistic, and left me frustrated and irritable. The writing itself was pretentious and tiresome. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Franzen seems skilled and smart, but defeated by his own self-consciousness. I hope to see better from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up there a bit","review":"I am not fooled by Franzen for one minute. He is an insufferably complainer, and always has been. A great writer? Okay, he is up there with Tolkien, but not with Atwood.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of time in a while....","review":"I had high expectations of this book and was terribly dissappointed. It attempts a lot but succeeds in nothing. Maybe it is a reflection of our times? I found myself truly disliking all characters, feeling no understanding towards them and being totally annoyed at their *mis*adventures. How boring! All you have to do is look in your neighborhood (or your own family) for people like this-- not a new story and nothing to be learned nor gained by reading about it. This book truly fails to soar over every-day family disfunction into something that is worth remembering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franzen could be a great writer if he wasnt so hateful","review":"I read Freedom first, then this one and will not be reading anything else by Franzen. He has talent--I loved the part early in the book about Alfred looking at the sunflowers and mistaking their reflection for children. Just one problem--Franzen seriously hates women. Every female character in both Freedom and The Corrections is portrayed to be strong and confident--at first. Then, after about a hundred pages every one of his female characters is suddenly revealed to be neurotic or evil or a bimbo or all of the three. It's as if his message is \\"See? That's what women are really like once you get to know them.\\" I quit reading at page 317 and was so offended by how stupid Franzen had made the Enid character--no woman is that stupid!--that I had to go out for a long walk. Silver lining: I borrowed both books from the library, so no money wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are stressing me Franzen","review":"Franzen's novel is intermittently captivating..about 3 pages at a grope....At the end of the day..and that comes FAR too along the path to endure..\\"Corrections\\" is an incredibly tedious whinefest about people you wouldn't cross the street to meet. And if you did you'd run whelping.This is a 3rd rate indulgfest that passes for creative literature! Spare me...The foundation of any decent literature is caring..engagement...Why anyone would care about a slurpy of senile guilt mongering and past it adolescent whiny pleading is beyond me. Any woman laying Chris has serious need issues and needs to find the real article.Disgusting characters...boring \\"life issues\\"...and a kind of \\"like me or else\\" attitude on Franzen's part. This dude is way overrated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"After all the fuss about this book I could not wait to get my hands on it. Throughout my reading, however, I could not wait for Mr. Franzen to get to the point. In the end it was an uninteresting tale about a dysfunctional family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was very excited about reading this book. Some of the reviews lead me to believe that this book was engaging. Boring ,boring I waited for something to happen and every time your interest was engaged you are let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually lives up to the hype!","review":"Don't listen to the negative reviews- this is an excellent novel. The story is fairly simple, and imagine that most of you have gotten well accquainted with it in the below reveiws, so I won't go into it. But the plot is what drives this story; rather, it is the wonderfully crafted characters of the Lambert family. Some complain that there are no likeable characters in this book, and to a certain extent this is true. But they are all sympathetic. Watching their lives fall apart is a tragic, moving experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Grandly entertaining\\"? More like stomach-turning.","review":"Struggled valiantly to make it through this supposedly \\"grandly entertaining novel.\\" Managed 120 of 560 pages, then decided life is too short to punish oneself with neverending ugly family scenes and impossible-to-like characters. Even if it *is* a National Book Award winning novel. Blecch. You've got to have a strong stomach to make it through this one. Either that, or you've got to really enjoy watching people's lives fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Corrections","review":"Franzen's descriptions are almost poetry in his use of analogies. The subject could be said to be a dysfunctional family, but it is about any family and its weakest and strongest members. The interplay of the members' lives and the interweaving of events knit a fascinating story. The book is very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling story of a weird but believable family.","review":"An enthralling story of a rather weird but believable family. It will entertain you and hold your attention. I do think though that a good editor could have cut out about 10% of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a portrait without insight","review":"I agree that this book presents a portrait of american life, but the portrait is more of an impressionist work from which we are left trying to discern details. Up close, it is blurry and undefined, like these characters and their nebulous conflicts. I realize that this aspect of intrafamilial conflict is likely what the author was trying to express- that sometimes you can't exactly pinpoint when or how your parents ruined your life, for example- but i think this book could stand to give some sort of insight beyond the extremely well-developed character studies.The characters are stereotypes, certainly, but i would have liked to see them given more humanity. Their flaws were very well developed, but what of their redeeming qualities? I'm not expecting some happy-go-lucky piece of fluff fiction, i just found the book a tad myopic.That said, i'm no book critic, just someone who likes to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disfuncional family that is impossible to care about","review":"I can't imagine how this book managed to win a national book award. Its characters take disfunctional to new heights and as a reader I could not summon any sympathy for any of them. Franzen also jumps all around making it very difficult to follow whatever plot there is. If I hadn't had to read this for a book group, I'm sure I would have given up early on."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Don't Get It, The Joke May Be On You","review":"It makes sense to me that this book is so polarizing. Half the people I talk to about the book didn't seem to get the appeal at all and the other half feel like it is one of the best books ever written. I am firmly in the latter camp. It's the Pornoy's Complaint for 30-something overachievers, the sons and daughters of overbearing mid-western parents. It's hilarious and poignant in the same cringe-and-advert-your-eyes way as Curb Your Enthusiasm is, and I'm sure for a lot of people the book hits uncomfortably close to home.In regards to the Freedom vs. The Corrections discussion: Freedom is much more mainstream and dry and filled with unlikable characters it is a struggle to relate to. The Corrections is his less accessible, incredibly witty opus with characters you may simultaneously love and hate but whose motivations you always understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition - full of typos","review":"Think twice before buying the Kindle edition of this novel. It' s full of typos that on some occations make the text incomprehensible and on a great number of occations are really annoying. As an example there are a lot of references to \\"Aslan\\" - the lion of Narnia. Most of the time this is spelt \\"asian\\" in the Kindle edition. I can see that correcting typos in a printed edition is diffucult, but I can find no excuse for not correcting this in an electronic version.

All the musicians sound excellent. My favorites are the bass playing and the drumming, very deep and intense. Lenny's vocals are great as usual.

It seemed as though he started strong and ran out of substance long before he ran out of energy and wordiness. When, at the end of one of his chapters, he reassured me that \\"Love conquers all\\" it looked as though he was finally running low on words.

My husband and I are huge zombie movie fans and this was by far the most fake, slow, and badly made film. The beginning scenes were so fake it almost made us turn it off, but we wanted to give it a real chance (for [...] bucks we expected more). 30 minutes into the movie still nothing real had happened - the scenes were cut so sloppy we sometimes didn't even know why things happened when they happened. After all we watched about 45 minutes, then we kept forwarding to scenes that looked more promising, but were disappointed also. Wasted time we'll never get back.

But it took too long, in fact 7/8th of the movie before the zombies wake up and start acting like zombies, but then the movie is over... Oh well, at least it kept the non-zombie actors safe. Outside of that there is not much tension to get the movie plot revved up to be an action movie nor a horror movie. It was more like a \\"Once upon a time movie, when all world fell asleep and woke up zombies except a few\\".

The zombies in this film aren't immediately aware of their hunger for humans...which makes this interesting. If you've watched other zombie flicks, you might find yourself yelling out to the careless, unfamiliar with zombies humans...\\"Don't make so noise! Don't go out into that pack of zombies!\\"..as I did. So we have a group of humans who make all the correct decisions, initially, who then undo every good decision through an equally bad one, all based on a lack of knowledge of zombies and a desire to treat these \\"creatures\\" with compassion. Or, at the very least, basic respect. There is less gore and more insight into how our our desire to see everything as another version of \\"us\\" can lead us astray, or even into danger. A thinking persons zombie flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Beyond Belief","review":"I had high expectatations for this film based on a couple of reviews I read (which I later learned were from the company releasing the film's PR Department). I was unfamiliar with the series of books this film is based upon, but had heard of them. If the novels are anything like the film I never need to read them. The largest problem with this film is that it's very disjointed and doesn't really make too much sense overall. The zombies are wasted. They are not scary and don't do much at all until the end when they suddenly attack for no real reason. This film feels like it was made by film students who flunked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Poor camera work, worse acting, a flimsy budget and a storyline that leaves much to be desired. One reviewer compared this movie to 28 Days Later, but the only similarities I can find is that they are both are films and they both involve a virus of some sort affecting most of the population. This is an incredibly boring movie, maybe moreso than any movie I've ever seen, and its attempts at being emotionally and psychologically captivating fall very short. Fans of the novel(s) will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad They Didn't Have A Bigger Budget","review":"Flesh eating zombie movies are always about the people trying to survive a zombie outbreak. If there's an exception, I haven't seen it. Autumn focuses almost entirely on the humans. The zombies don't even pose a threat till sometime well into the second half. It's also a very low budget film with no great actors, make up, effects or action. Instead, this is an opportunity for a bunch of young film makers and actors to test their wings. I don't expect any of these young people to become household names, but this is still a decent effort. Better action would have made this a much more watchable movie, but I still liked it. Many scenes are very effective. Carradine must have appeared for moral support and to lend his name to help sell this film. If he got paid and his fee robbed the film makers of the money to make a better movie, they screwed up. I never heard of the novel. Maybe I'll read it someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this movie to be quite boring and poorly crafted despite the positive reviews on this site and online.

The one glaring error in the whole book is when the authors are writing about Desert Storm. They write that LTG Fred Franks commanded V Corps in Germany and Desert Storm. This is wrong.

I didn't follow the invasion closely when it occurred (I saw more coverage of the protests than of the war itself as I was in Australia) and I had been curious ever since.The book is very well written, informative and the photos are terrific. It was a good read.I do have two quibbles however. The first, that the book was published in August of 2003 (when the invasion was in March-April) gives me doubts about some of the lessons written of in the book. I just think it was too close to the invasion to really give a good retrospective. The second are the maps. While yes, I love that this book has maps, and they're reasonably easy to read, I wish they were more informative.However, I really enjoyed this book and I think it is a good pick up for anyone interested in the invasion and also the state of the US military before and during the 2003 invasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"even better than the first","review":"The second issue of Lost Girls is better than the first, mainly because it is longer! Moore and Gebbie really flush out the characters and bring them to life. Lost Girls is erotica that is intended to be appreciated equally by both men and women, and I think it is succesful in achieving this goal. Reading ths comic, and looking at Gebbie's art will turn a lot of people on, but it definitely isn't degrading to women or men. Also, there is more to this book then just sex - if you are simply looking for cheap thrills, go watch a porno movie, but if you are in the mood for quality erotica, this is the book for you. Lost Girls is definitely a highpoint for the careers of Moore and Gebbie, and show that the comic book is an excellent format to create works of art.

The plot of the three books, which are really only one story arc, remains the same: the three share the real stories behind the fantasy conventions we all heard as kids. But really, you're not reading it for the plot any more than you read [...] for the articles.What may surprise you is that what will draw your attention is not all-sex-all-the-time. Gebbie's artwork is brilliantly tuned to the various stories. Even some of the d��cor changes in subtle ways depending on which one of the three is relating a tale (or if something else entirely is going on). I'll warn you, as I did last time, if you have any strong taboos, Lost Girls will, in fact, break them.

Save your money. To say I'm disappointed in the product would be a complete understatement. Understand this is just \\"my opinion\\" of the product and other \\"opinions\\" may vary. Many of the tracks are repeated at the end of the cd. The same songs, just recorded in another \\"venue\\",\\"Nashville,TN.\\" to be exact,the same quirky \\"are there any metalheads out there tonite?\\" stage to audience interactions from the band to the crowd. Hey, I heard the same scenario in maybe?Cincinnati? four songs ago, do I really need to hear it again from Nashville?? It's a little redundant. Purchasing this product was my mistake, don't make it yours too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Axe","review":"I have owned this recording since it first came out on vinyl and also purchased it on tape and have worn them both out though the years. This is nothing but 80's raw, bar sounding, head banging, lets go to a party music. It is a screaming guitar CD with that 80's screaming metal voice in the foreground. Don't pass this one up if your looking for the 'not so popular' 80's metal madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic Metal At It's Best!","review":"This debut album from Kick Axe showcases their melodic sensibilities, as well as their killer 4 part harmonies. The production work by Spencer Proffer (Quiet Riot, King Kobra) is state of the art, with the huge drum, guitar, & vocals. Check out \\"On the road to rock\\", & \\"Dreamin' about you\\" for examples of this. Of course \\"Heavy Metal Shuffle\\", & \\"Alive & Kickin'\\" are absolute, bonefide rock anthems that stand up with most anything from '80's metal land. This album is a must have for any fan of quality 80's metal that appreciates great song writing (Kick Axe also wrote songs for King Kobra, & W.A.S.P to name a few)guitar work, & kick-[butt] vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! A True Page-Turner!!!","review":"Move over, Jackie Collins! Martha Goldhirsch does a fantastic job capturing the glamour, hysteria, and social scheming of Hollywood. With wonderful characters (some whom you'll recognize), she spins an absorbing and very contemporary tale. Perfect for the beach or curling up with by the fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring... Jackie Collins wantabe","review":"Butterflies is a tamer, more boring version of the Jackie Collins books. The title should have just been Hollywood Moms. Too bad she didn't develop the characters more, they were very one dimentional, I just couldn't care about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenges of Religious Life","review":"Sister Barbara tackles the current challenges of Religious Life. I disagree with some of her proposals, and I feel that she sometimes fails to follow her own advice as to waiting to see where the Holy Spirit is leading Religious Orders. Her chapters on celibacy are excellent and help one to make sense of a difficult vow."},{"rating":"1","title":"New age genital relations","review":"Speaking rather excessively on both heterosexual and homosexual \\"genital relations\\" in her 1996 book, Wrestling With God, Sister Barbara Fiand assures her readers that she is an \\"understanding\\" proponent of homosexuality and lesbianism. She writes: \\"As most of us know, the official Church position on homosexuality accepts the \`inclination' but condemns the act. Much comment in the area of morality, Scripture study, and scientific investigation is available in response to this position... Suffice it here to take note of the almost universal plea among Catholic scholars for openness [in regard to homosexual acts] and for a willingness on the part of the magisterium to attend to scientific research in the areas of both scriptural interpretation and biology.\\" It is important to note that Sister's statements are all grounded in a \\"New Age\\" conception of the world which denies both the authority and competence of the Magisterium (the teaching arm of the Church)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTER THE TWILIGHT ZONE.","review":"THIS HAS SOME OF THE STORIES THAT BELONG TO FUTURE HISTORY, BUT OVERALL A COLLECTION OF INTERESTING AND ODD STORIES. AT ONE ONE POINT YOU WONDER IF ROD STERLING WILL POP OUT SOMEWHERE TO INTRODUCE TODAY'S EPISODE. DEFINITELY WORTH READING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking, honest storytelling","review":"\\"We Were Here\\" accomplishes something wonderful in an understated way. Using the voices of witnesses to the AIDS outbreak in San Francisco, the film brings the shared memories of an epidemic to life. Never preachy, never sentimental, but always emotionally honest, this work forms a ground for understanding with powerful storytelling reminiscent of the Civil Rights documentary series \\"Eyes on the Prize\\". Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanizes the AIDS Crisis","review":"For those who don't personally know people living with AIDS, with the now abundant information about the disease, there can be a tendency to intellectualize or underplay the severity. As the first person title suggests, \\"We Were Here\\" chronicles the effect of AIDS on the Castro Street community rather than the disease itself, unlike the PBS Frontline documentary. Both are great, but this documentary depicts the non-textbook side effects. Watching the five interviewees talk, I began to see a more three dimensional perspective of its destruction and the fear it created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit","review":"Installed these in a 2008 Nissan Aramada. These have the same issue that the front liners have, namely Husky didn't do their homework. On the Armada the door sills are actually a little below the carpet level, so when you install these you are left with a raised edge that sticks up to catch the feet of anyone entering the truck. Add in the fact that the raised edge has these super sharped nubs (intended to keep them from sliding around) and you have the potential for some serious damage to kids feet. The Twee One has already caught her feet a couple of times getting into the truck. Seriously NOT RECOMMENDED for Armada owners. If you take a look at the stock photo real close (use the larger image) you can actually see the raised nubs sticking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect buy","review":"I bought this outfit for my son and it's just perfect!

Just a perfect buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The suspenders make this outfit!","review":"The material is high quality, the outfit is unusual and it just makes my little grandson even more handsome. I could not find any dressy outfits in the store like this and the price was very reasonable! You won't regret this purchase:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"doll clothing?","review":"I bought this for my sons 6 month pictures. I read the other reviews that it runs small so I got a 12 month size for my son who is 22lbs. It wasn't right. Too small in someareas and too big in others. The shirt was so thin and didn't tuck into the pants and the sleaves were too long. He was so uncomfortable we had to take it off and use a white onesie. The pants fit the suspenders barely fit almost too small. The hat was a little too big and a disappointment as it was floppy with no firm brim. The clip on tie was a joke that didn't stay on for a second. Over all we were able to get a few pictures but I was hoping for something just a little better. If he were supposed to wear this for a whole day ot would never have worked out. The over all outfit seemedlike it was sewn for dollclothing not human baby clothes. I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nina to eight..","review":"This outfit was absolutely adorable. I bought a nine month for my 6 month old grandson and it was a little tight. I would buy the next size up because it runs a little small."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"Bought for my sons 3mth photos. It fit him perfectly. Wouldn't have fit him at 6 mths & he is around 15lbs right now.I was concerned the material would be stiff or itchy & it wasn't at all. I was very please. The only advice I would have to make it a more usable product is to make it into a onezie. The shirt came untucked a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for photo shoots","review":"We did a 1920's photo shoot and the outfit was perfect. It is however, costume quality. For the cost I did expect better quality, but it worked for our needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspenders did not hold up","review":"This outfit was perfect. My 17 month old son was a ring bearer in my sister-in-law's wedding and this outfit was so cute. Per other reviews, I did order a size larger and the fit was good. My son is in the 50th percentile for weight and height, so I do recommend ordering a size up. My issue is with the suspenders. The clasps did not stay in place. The clasp for the back broke within the hour he had the outfit on before the wedding and as he moved around the other clasps would come undone. We had to use safety pins to keep them in place until the wedding was over. No one was any the wiser, but imagine trying to put safety pins on a very active, rambunctious 17 month old boy. Not fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sure winner!!","review":"I absolutely love it!!!!! I have been looking for an outfit like this for a while I am so thrilled to have gotten this~"},{"rating":"2","title":"This outfit was a hit for Halloween","review":"This darling outfit was used for my son's halloween costume. We dressed him up as \\"Bagger Vance\\". People were running up to us, asking us to stop so they could see his outfit. The quality of the clothing was great, the outfit fit true to size (18mos). This just what I expected and the delivery was QUICK. We are going to have professional holiday portraits taken in this for the grandparents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy and disappointing","review":"Disappointing purchase. Cheap fabric, threads sticking out all over suggest shoddy construction. Suspenders have gold thread (which is not apparent in the online photo) - they look feminine and tacky. Brim of hat has no support sewn into it, so it's very flimsy. Neither the hat nor the pants are lined and the fabric is very thin. I don't expect this outfit to withstand more than one laundering. I agree with the comments re:sizing. I ordered a size 3T, which should fit my son who is wearing 24-mo. to 2T. If you like the style of this outfit, you'd be better off buying a good pair of trousers that fit your baby or child and have them tailored into knickers. I bought a nicer quality newsboy cap recently at Gymboree, but I've seen them in other retail stores, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I received the outfit just as pictured very pleased with shipment but the hat (which makes the outfit) had a small hole at top of the brim. Emailed Customer Service they said to send back the hat back which I did immediately. Emailed Customer service to be sure they received it they emailed back they did receive the hat, that was 2 weeks ago. No Hat, No Emails, No Customer Service, Now I have a $50.00 outfit without the Main portion the HAT....If they don't have it and have to order it or maybe never get a new one they should let me know, not just avoid my emails...I wanted this for his 6 month picture which is in September... Too bad for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaay too small","review":"The sizes on this outfit really do run quite small. We had a wedding to go to and wanted our little guy to look cute. The outfit was on him, a little snug, but our son is in the 95 percentile for height so we are accustomed to things not quite fitting (we typically leave a button or two undone or something). This outfit seemed fine while I had my son laying on his back and all buttoned up. But when I picked him up he started turning red in the face and couldn't breathe. I ripped the clip on bow-tie off immediately and he immediately gasped a huge breath and started crying. Of course I felt awful for forcing the outfit on ... I layed him down to start taking the outfit off when he pealed into another scream... the suspenders had come lose in back and the metal had dug into his skin (even through the shirt). I should have bought the 9 month size for my 3 month old!! I felt aweful and my poor son felt worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really 4x6","review":"I don't know if it's just the pack of paper I got, but these sheets of photo paper are not really 4x6. They're more like 3.5x7. This is extremely annoying when trying to print to 4x6 because it cuts off the top of the picture and then leaves white space on the end of the picture. For it to work you have to change your printer settings and even then, the quality is not that great. I wouldn't suggest this product to anyone. Try Cannon, HP or Epson paper. Much better quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Duhh! Why print 4x6 when it is 4x6.5","review":"This makes no sense. If the industry standard is 4x6, why did they, Kodak, cut the paper to 4x6.5 and then advertise on the carton that it is 4x6 -- yes, I see the fine print on the back side of the carton that reads \\"actual paper size is 4x6.5\\"I still don't understand why they did this.Now I have cut the pictures down to the correct size...what a waste of my time!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this paper larger then 4 x 6?","review":"The whole object of purchasing 4 x 6 paper is to eliminate some hassles. Well if you have a memory card slot on your printer and just want to print some quick no fuss pictures this is not the paper for you. You will get a to in of white space on one edge. It took me 20 minutes to figure out the paper was off and not my printer setting. Why the heck would I want to crop all of my pictures? I would like to know the genius who thought that was a good idea or better yet the person who agreed. What a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noticeably worse than canon paper with my MP500","review":"I just got a Canon MP500 and bought some of this paper because it was clearance priced and I assumed it would be good. I printed a photo on both this and the sample canon glossy 4x6 paper that came with my printer. The canon paper print looked like it came from a photo lab. The kodak paper had print lines visible, the layers of ink were clearly visible, and less detail was visible. I would recommend those with canon printers to stay far away from this paper. At least I didn't spend too much on the paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! So Beautifully Detailed and True Color!!!","review":"After reading the reviews (several negative), I wasn't sure if I should purchase this for my Canon i9900. I am sure glad I purchased this! I bought this because my Canon paper fades so quickly that I was sick of reprinting pictures to keep the colors vibrant.I printed about thirty pictures of my previous vacation and was so amazed. The color is wonderful, the detail is so much better than on Canon paper, and they all printed up without one bad picture (ie,smears-ink blobs-etc).I am definitely buying more being an obsessive picture taker.A definite must for those who take an obscene amount of pictures!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not impressed...","review":"I bought this paper to use with my Canon i550 printer and there was a HUGE difference in quality between the Kodak paper and the Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy that came with my printer. The Canon paper delivered spectacular photo-quality results, while the Kodak \\"glossy\\" paper gave me somewhat of a matte print. Side-by-side, there was more of a grainy texture to the Kodak paper, whereas the Canon paper was very even and flawless. On Kodak's defense, I do think that the printer/paper combo makes a big difference. Perhaps Kodak paper is simply not compatible with Canon printers. However, I expected better quality from Kodak, since they are the picture experts! I'll stick with Canon paper for now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior results","review":"This paper yields inferior results when used with an Epson C84 printer and Epson Durabrite inks.

Originals & covers it is all there .. this woman is very polished with a smooth velvet sound. Folk Jazz is how i would describe her intonations. I have got all her albums now & the most recent one \\"Calling for Rain\\" has certainly got to be her best IMHO. Just to give my audience an appreciation of the musicians i like to listen to it may gave you a bit of insight to the style of musician Lori is. They are (in no particular order) Tori Amos, Nina Simone, Madeleine Peyroux, Mary Black, Holly Cole, Cassandar Wilson, Sarah Harmer, Ferron, Tracey Chapman, Suzanne Vega & Gillian Welch - just to name a few. I am quite surprised to see that i am the very first person to write a review about this woman. If you like any of the artists i have mentioned i am confident you will like this woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating conjecture","review":"Based on rumor and second hand sources, this book does a hack job of Johnson's life.

I will use it for my guide on the road. Only thing, I wish the author would have covered more of the angles and pit falls of the business of gigging - the agent(s), recording studios, venue owners, and lawyers - only his personal experience; not other road-rat wisdom (in dealing with scams and dead-beats). The author should keep writing new editions of this publications (the music changes in shady colors?).

These are very comfortable with adjustable angles to wear it to your comfort level. The plastic eye pieces have been secure. The only complaint I have is the nose piece, after 3 months it has become loose and occasionally come off. The price of these are reasonably inexpensive. There really isn't much to complain about. I ordered a few on Amazon and purchased some in-store use for my friends. I get compliments to the design of these at work. I enjoy the rubber pads and adjustability of these glasses the most.

They are extremely light weight and comfortable to wear. The wrap-around shape provides good protection from flying debris. Tenting effectively removes glare, but does not make the image too dark. Anti-fogging feature seems to work too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!","review":"Boom Bip seemed like such a promising project, taking some \\"ok\\" instrumental hip hop and infusing some real instrument samples and not resorting to noise (recent Prefuse) or inane beats (most instrumental hip hop). Somehow that earlier work morphs into this, an EP that would fit right in at the 99 bin of generic house/techno releases at a record shop. Nothing of note on this album, and even if you DO like music like this, there's other artists who have been doing it better for longer. I can understand artists reinventing themselves, but it's not always for the better -- sometimes, they should've stuck with what worked in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation","review":"Although you may never have heard of any of these pianists, they're all very good and solid performers.

She loved the set and the box converts to a very nice \\"room\\" for the doll. After a month of course the box has been smashed. The shoes are small and most have been lost, but what I really liked is the clothes are easier to get on than many of the other dolls like this such a Polly Pockets. The shirts and skirts are detached and the back of the shirt is completely open for easy dressing. Also, the skirts are fabric and not rubber making them a little easier to dress. My daughter is willing to play by herself or loves to have a friend over to play with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Pit","review":"From a consumer point of view, the book takes a strong look at the effects that bipolar can have on family, friends and self. Ms. Hagerman immerses herself in the place where most Christians are, in the hand of God. Yet wondering why is this happening to me? What have I ever done to deserve this? God or not, it is a question we all ask ourselves because we feel that we need to have an answer, the one we want, and we have to have it now. From a Christian point of view we must immediately recognize that God answers, when He is ready to answer. Ms. Hagerman makes a good point of embedding this in us.Unfortunately, the later half of the book stuck tenaciously to biblical quotations and philosophy without dealing with the healing powers of a relationship with God Nor does it seem to mention the affect of God's guidance of the Medical Professionals that work through Him, to help us be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much......","review":"As a Christian who struggles with Bipolar I disorder, I was thrilled to see that there was at least one book out there about being a Christian and having Bipolar. As I read through the book, I felt that I was reading more about the author more than being a Christian and addressing the issues you face when you are one with the disorder. While I can appreciate her attempt to share her story, I think it falls short of addressing what is the real issue at hand which is being a Christian and reconciling being as such with a disorder that society has yet to accept overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odysseus, Indeed","review":"Austin's book is truly a work of love; it is clear Professor Austin has had a life-long appreciation of Homer's Odyssey, and he reflects on it brilliantly in Archery at the Dark of the Moon. His insistence that the reader should participate in Odysseus's nostos, as a joyous, inevitable act is refreshing. His acting as a scholia and taking us along for the ride gives us that rare opportunity to witness the critic in all his transparency. I agree with the other reviewer that this book should be back in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant insights, lame prose style","review":"on one page, for example, he uses \\"individual\\" several times. there are obviously many other words one could use, such as \\"man\\" or \\"person,\\" but for some reason Austin prefers to be boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another throw away jack","review":"Parts are Obsolete!

My grand daughter comes to my day care and has a special friend. They love when I read this book because they see theirselves in it.

I recommend this book to build self esteem and friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great symphonic progressive metal","review":"I was surprised and very impressed with this album. The Oslo Symphony Orchestra really adds another dimension to this album, giving it a REAL classical feel, unlike the highly enjoyable but somewhat cheesy approach of most neoclassical metal.

Anyone who likes dark progressive metal should snatch this one up in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winds..............................................","review":"Amazing, that is one word to describe this album. It is a progressive/dark metal masterwork. A complilation of some of the most renouned norweigen musicians of the past decade, winds is a musical force to be rekoned with. This album, mostly slow, dark and melodic songs with deep emotion and smoothness. The drumming is especially amazing, because it was done by metal god Hellhammer most famous for his work in mayhem, arcturus and the konvent.

This book was written by Franklin Dixon. It was about three boys going to a cabin in the woods to meet their friend Mr.Mcguire. The boys' host never showed up at the cabin, so they went in search for him. At night in what was called \\"Black Hollow\\" you could hear the shriek sound of someone screaming. My opinion of this book is very good. I really liked all of the mystery in it. If I was looking for a good mystery book and hadn't read this one, I would definately pick it. It had a lot of suspicion going in my mind of what was going to happen next. There was one thing that I didn't like about this book.It had some very difficult words in it. If those words hadn't had been in there, it would have made it a lot easier to understand.

To someone with intermediate familiarity with AS, this omission is easily negotiated but to a beginner, it could be a major hurdle.If you can tolerate and survive mistakes like the aforementioned, this book is actually a qualified \\"not bad\\" intermediate book.

The book is for experienced backhoe operators, as the techniques described are advanced. The photo's are dark and lack detail in many cases, and some of the subject matter is glossed over. The author makes too many assumptions about the skill level, and overall understanding of his readers. Is the book worthwhile, absolutely. Does it need a new addition, also a resounding yes. The new additon should start with the basics, and continue with intermediate and advanced techniques, complete with clear, detailed photography. As for me, it is part of my permenant library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and Knowledgeable","review":"It took me quite a while to find such a comprehensive and knowledgeable resource for backhoe operation.

I highly recommend the book to both experienced and new operators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"This is an extremely poor introductory work for attaining even a basic understanding of the Finnish language. The problem is that it assumes that the student is already fully proficient in the language. Instead of starting out slowly, the book launches into fast-paced conversations, with no repeats. The author should have broken the conversations down into small pieces, and provided slow pronunciations of each word.Professor Vahamaki's approach to language instruction reminds me of a piano instructor who is trying to teach a five-year-old child the rudiments of music. Instead of introducing the child slowly to the various notes, he simply sits the child down at the keyboard, points to the 88 keys, and tells the child to start playing Rimsky-Korsakov's \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" at full speed. This approach doesn't work for the piano, and it certainly doesn't work for a language as difficult to learn as Finnish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"This book is barely useful. It does not have essential charts telling you how to inflect nouns, or clear explanations of what the cases mean. Its focus is on strong-grade and weak-grade consonants, and theoretical conversations.

The insights are forthright, honest, and worthy of understanding and consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda made from Other Mainstream Propaganda.","review":"The links drawn in this documentary are little more than a compilation of Fabrications that were created by Government Intelligence Services and the Corporate Media that does their bidding. If someone wants to learn the real facts about 9/11, this is not the place to find them. I wouldn't be surprised if Friedman was on the payroll of the same propaganda machine. Science, history and Logic run contrary to this documentary. If you want to be confused by lies, shoddy story lines and connections that never really existed, then this film is for you, or you could read a book by Peter Lance.

This is a great combination. I highly recommend this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"Thomas L. Friedman seeks to explain in this DVD the factors that contributed and ultimately caused the terrorist attack on September 11th 2001 so as to help us Americans better understand the tragedy as well as prevent similar events from occurring in the future. His two big questions to analyze are (1) what motivated the 19 young men to board planes to kill 3,000 of our American brothers and sisters, and (2) why did so many of their fellow Arabs applaud their actions? I believe Friedman offers some powerful insights to these questions, and is really the perfect man for the job with his past experience covering Middle Eastern affairs. It's a very complex special that makes for an eye opening experience. I definitely recommend buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Friedman speaks I listen","review":"As usual Thomas Friedman has stopped me in my tracks with riveting insights. I'm however not sold on 9/11 not being an inside job but I still find everything else in the video to be intellectually stimulating.

The premise seemed highly captivating. And then I started reading...and I absolutely could not finish it! There are so many grammatical errors. It was so appalling that it was almost hilarious. How could this get printed?! Line after line there were misspelled words, comma omissions, fragments, run-ons, etc. I don't get it! Did anybody read this before printing it? Furthermore, the whole book looks like a mess. The cover art is nice, but there are inconsistencies in the layout of the text, weird spaces between paragraphs, and other highly distracting things. The story might have been okay but sadly, the execution of it was terrible. I love supporting smaller publication companies, but this work was atrocious and highly unprofessional.

The whole thing reads like it was translated into English by someone who doesn't speak the language. The grammar, sentence structure, etc. are horrible, and so distracting that I gave up on the story less than halfway through. The commas are in the wrong places, the indentation and paragraphs are done incorrectly, and no one in the novel says anything -- all the dialogue is \\"stated\\", even when that term is patently unsuitable for the tone and meaning of the dialogue. It's too bad, because it could have been an enjoyable, if fluffy, read. I'm not familiar with this author but I'm willing to bet she has no idea that her work is being presented in such a shoddy way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun romp","review":"I enjoyed this book for the fun and well researched character driven story it is. Helen obviously knows her stuff and makes the pirate period appropriate and still sexy.

It is a quick read and there are no wasted words here at all. The characters are all developed fully while the author still moves the story along at a fast clip.

The books is a powerful eye opener, to people who dont know what a world is like where you cant read, and your parents dont want to help you get by.

Although a lot of us go through things here like Precious did, the book was almost exiled from my library because of the language. I got curious and read it. Despite the language, this was the best book I have EVER read. The language and mis-spellings give an incite on how Precious lived. I thought this was a non-fiction book until I saw the FIC on the side. It was just an amazing story. I read it in a few hours, I couldn't put it down. I'm reading it for the 4th time right now.

She takes this opportunity and runs with it and is finally able to move forward and set higher goals for herself. I wish Sapphire had written and epilogue so we know where Precious ends up in life.

I was disappointed. The story line in itself is not particularly original. If you want a story of an inspiring teacher who appeals to low achieving kids, read To sir with love.The descriptions of the incestuous relations in my opinion were gratuitous and did not add much to the story other than to gross you out a bit. I'm not sure I feel any more aware or enlightened."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is really where amazing happens!","review":"My experience with Amazon has been absolutely incredible, they're what they say they are and more.

And the process is very fast, they really think about their customers...its the best place for online shoping, I'm hooked!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Pathos","review":"I found \\"Push\\" to be an exercise in pathos that leads to a layering of unbelievably hyperbolic situations and purple prose. The reliance on sexual language and description of sexual acts is pedantic and obnoxious. The story is written well enough for me to cheer for the focus character, but, artistically, the book is sophomoric. The style is reminiscant of an immature writer trying to gain respect through gritty language and shifts of narrative voice -- the language choices are justified given the personae of the dramatized narrator, but the voice shifts are illogical and ill conceived. Character development is simplistic. I would not recommend \\"Push\\" to anyone with a weak stomach which puts it on the level of a bad carnival ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected...","review":"I was very excited about the book, but was not at all as good as I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Push by Sapphire book","review":"Horrible reading.

Maybe you enjoy hearing EXPLICIT accounts of a father raping his daughter, down to the point of how her body reacts to his movements. Sometime too gritty and foul to be considered artistic.

The way in which Precious finds her voice through writing is truly compelling. I started reading and could not put it down. Thank you, Sapphire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing but good","review":"This book is not an easy read. The words are simple but the content is tough. The book gives an accurate, detailed, disturbing account of sexual and physical abuse and the consequences of it. It also shows how difficult it is to help someone who has been victimized so. Precious has a tremendous chip on her shoulder, very understandable considering what she had been through, yet that very anger also kept her from almsot receiving the help she needed. Also, Precious mistrusted white people, yet the people who were abusing her were black. The ending is not the greatest, it seemed as if the author didn't really know how to end, but the story is very good, although extremely disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUSH review","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel. I had first watched the movie before I read the book. I knew that there was a book but I did not know it was called Push. Since I had seen the movie already, I knew the story in a general sense. I realled enjoyed all the deatails that were in the book compared to the movie. Usually when people read a book and then watch a movie they are usually disapointed with the outcome. For me I was able to compare the difference of what they kept and what they changed. This book is very inspiring and I think that no one should put up with the abuse that Precious went through."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a must","review":"I enjoyed reading this book from beginning to end. Kept me wanting to keep reading and reading. I admire Precious' strength to be able to surpass all the abuse she experienced from her parents and conceiving children at an early age. She managed to put her foot down and stand up for herself and her children. She also managed to continue to go to school and actually learn to read and write because that was something that the schools she attended lacked. They didn't care whether she learned or not. It takes a lot of courage and motivation to be able to do what Precious did in the bad neighborhood she grew up in. Precious is an inspiration to many women, that we can do anything we want if we just try a little harder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Push by Saphire","review":"I loved the novel Push. I believe that book is an inspiration to many young girls who go through daily struggles. Precious was a very brave girl. She went through so many tragic events in her life and she almost gave up. All she needed was a little push in the right direction and a little help to get herself on the right track. I wouldn't doubt that their are many girls who weren't able to get over a hurdle in their lives and after reading Push they gained courage and pushed through their obstacles making something of their lives. Push was an absolutely beautiful story of courage and triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding work!","review":"One will enjoy reading this book and then watching the movie.

It was a easy to read page turner. Precious made me laugh constantly. The story is shocking and sad. Lots of bad language, but I think it helps identify the characters more clearly to the reader. It makes them seem more real. I heard the movie is being released Nov. '09 by Tyler Perry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and Discomforting","review":"Push is a disturbing and discomforting story which takes us out of our comfort zone. Precious Jones has never really had a childhood. Unfortunately she was abused at an early age by her overweight and trifling mother as well as her father. Sexual, Physical and Emotional abuse were all first hand experiences for Precious. The acts that her mother and father performed on her were beyond terrible. Why didn't anyone step in and take Precious from the horrific environment she lived in? After all, when Precious' child was born her grandmother stepped in to raise that child. Push's storyline is not a pretty picture; it's brutal, it's realistic and its raw. It's not a story for everyone but for those who like poignant and riveting reads written in a simple manner but filled with wonderful prose then Push by Sapphire is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I purchased this book because I want to read it before I see the movie, Precious. All I have to say is wow. I am nearing the end and have experienced a myriad of emotions throughout. From disbelief, disgust, and sorrow, to admiration and hope for the main character. I have never read a book like this; it is a perspective that really hits you with truth and emotion. I really feel for this girl even though I am a \\"cracker\\" from the suburbs. The author definitely has a way of communicating difficult situations and inspiring messages in her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I think I bought the wrong version of this book.

I was totally baffled by the character of Precious mom which made my stomach turn, my pupils enlarge, my mouth drop and an overall feeling of just wanting to open a can of whip ---. You will not be disappointed and I also recommend A Piece of Cake by Cupcake Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up and Walk In Precious's Shoes","review":"This book smacks you right between the eyes and kicks you in the groin. It's a full-body experience that you will have to earn, because if you want to sit back and be distracted by a nice story this ain't it.After reading it I wanted to be a better person. I wanted to see and listen to people that I might have been ignoring.By forcing us to witness, and thus avoid sentimentality, the harsh facts of Precious's abusive experiences, Saphire gives us the opportunity to experience the all too rare feeling of genuine empathy.One more thing, to say Push is African-America fiction sells it short. This work of art, like Duke Ellington, Jacob Lawrence, Maya Angelou amongst many other black musicians, artists and writers, is beyond category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't like it","review":"I am trying to be as objective as possible because I know so many people liked the book, but I just didn't like it at all. Like many other have said, if you take out the graphic details of the incest and foul language, you don't have much substance. I think the story line could have been developed much better. I don't agree with some reviewers who say the story isn't plausible. I know there are plenty of young girls like Precious in the world. I just think the story and her plight couldn't have been given more detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more.","review":"I saw this movie before I read the book. The books usually have more details than the movie which is why I bought the book. I know that Precious is learning to read and write, however, half of the book is filled with mispelled words and you have to try to figure out what she's trying to say. The book had nothing that the movie didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I got relly bored. Amazon also recommends the Darkest Child which is much better. It deserves 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this book to anyone.","review":"I checked this book out from the library after hearing about the movie. The story sounded like a good one, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time. The story itself was a good one I felt, but the way the author chose to tell it was ineffective. Many times, the writing felt inconsistent; in some parts, Precious (the narrator) would have decent language, then all of a sudden, it would be very difficult to read or make sense of what was written.I could forgive the book all that, though, if it weren't for the explicit sexual content. I understand that Precious was abused sexually, but did the author really have to go into SUCH detail? I literally felt sick to my stomach more than once while reading this book. I'd say skip this book and read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I bleach my brain?","review":"DON'T READ THIS BOOK unless you have some sort of memory erasing tool you can use afterwards. The level of graphic detail of incestual sex between father and daughter is disgusting, wrenching, and heartbreaking. I can't understand how anyone could enjoy this book unless they are pedophiles. Seriously people, why would anyone want to read the fine details of these horrific acts? It was like reading a porn script, except that one of the people involved was a small child. AWFUL! I realize that sexual abuse is outrageously rampant in our society. I realize that the victims of such abuse need an outlet, such as writing a novel about their experiences. I didn't need to read details in this book to know that childhood sexual abuse is bad. Don't read this unless you want haunting, detailed images of incest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was shocked","review":"I ordered the book when the movie came out and wanted to understand what it was about. But when I started to read it I got so shocked and threw it away after like 20 pages. Besides the fact that the writing is still in the style the girl wrote it (with many many grammar mistakes) it is written with such graphic details about all the rapes she had to go through... I couldn't continue to read this book. It might be a very touchy history but to read that book u put urself in either her position or the person who raped her and that was just something I personally couldn't handle!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I ever imagined","review":"I decided to stop reading this book about 2/3's of the way through. After skimming through 5 illegible pages of scribble, I had to read again about the main character's yearning for her rapist father. This was probably the 4th time in the book that she talks about liking sex with her father and this was the most detailed description of it. It's gross and disgusting. It's not based on a true story, it's just a \\"how far can I push this\\" kind of book. Do I have sympathy for Precious just because she doesn't know any better? Nope. She's racist, homophobic, not smart (and that's putting it nicely), disgustingly crude, and she yearns for the affections of the rapist whom she hated (even after she gets some horrible news about him). There's nothing good to say about Precious or this book. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"bore.","review":"i was so excited to read this book once i heard the film came out and learned what it was about. these story lines really interest me, but this book wasn't what i expect. the way it was written wasn't exciting, and the story wasn't all that drama-filled excitement either. after the beginning of the drama and intenseness, it just went down hill. its great that her life wasn't so horrid anymore, but for a book it wasn't interesting. and the writing was written as if the character was writing it herself and she is extremely ill-literate, REALLY ANNOYING. so, basically, its not my favorite book.if you're looking for more books such as this that are much better reads, try any ellen hopkins book. they're fabulous reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Dreadful","review":"This novel was so repetitous and bordered on pornographic.

I read it in a day and half. It is not a book that is limited to one culture or another, because abuse and heart ache knows no race, color, creed or religion.

While this to me isn't a literary classic, and the story haunted me for days, it was worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"This book was really raw as the movie and was hard to read as in the subject matter. But it is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is Deep!","review":"This is one of the best books I have read to date. I am so happy to see it become a major motion picture. I read it a few years back. Sapphire is an amazing author. I could not put the book down. I felt angry, hurt, I cried and I smiled. I went through so many emotions reading this book. This book should be on every shelf especially in the homes of Black Americans. A truly amazing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal Read","review":"I read this book in 2 days. I wanted to make sure I'd finished before the movie comes out. Amazon's service from ordering online to delivery of merchandise is awesome. Thank you Amazon for maintaining your integrity in a day and time when most companies integrity is questionable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!!!!!","review":"I could not belive the horror in this book.. Most importantly I could not belive I was crying over a book..this book is a must have for an avid readers collection. I finshed this book in 1 day. I have reccomended this book to all of the young ladies I know and all of them have come to me wanting to discuss this book. Sapphire has written an excellent must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Real, So Raw","review":"This is a wonderfully raw story of the affects of abuse on a very young girl. Precious learns so much in a relatively short amount of time. The story is graphic, honest, visually and emotionally real. Knowing the affects of abuse on children, I saw in this story the patterns abuse victims suffer through.To think, if there was not that one teacher who took time to nurture, care and teach Precious, what would her world be like? It is sad to think that in these times, Precious' story is not unique. Her mother's reaction and contribution to the abuse is not unique. Sapphire reminds us that the abuse is real and we must acknowledge it and finds ways to discourage it.The story makes you laugh and cry but it does not allow you to give up hope. I recommend this story to everyone to read and absorb, then maybe we can save a child's life.To Sapphire, thank you for keeping it real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph","review":"This book was very interesting. It was about a girl named precious trying to push forward and make something of her life. She was raped by her father for over 16 yrs and had 2 of his kids. Her mother provided no support and accused her daughter of stealing her man. Despite all of these obstacles (she even contracts HIV) she still pushes on and continues to try to achieve her GED. The style of Sapphire is very notable. She uses street slang in portraying Precious and it proves to be very affective. This is definitey a book to read if you love to read about triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, Blunt and Incredibly written!","review":"This book was one of the most disturbing books I've ever read. It was really hard to read about the situation that Precious was in. I had to take a couple of breaks because it was so intense. This book is one of the many important books that needs to be read. It's so powerful. It will make you cry, be angry, laugh and be inspired by Precious's never ending effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This book is a must read. It sadly is a fact of life for many teens no matter what race, income level or region you live in. I highly recommend this book, it will leave you speechless at first and then you will want to talk about it, more and more. I am still thinking about this book and I seldom do this. That tells you a lot about this Author as I read 2 to 3 books at one time, this book moved me. Precious moved me, she is still with me, I think she will always be with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best Books That I Ever Read","review":"I read this book over 8 years ago. I must say, it was one of the best books that I ever read. Didn't know that it was still in print. I just might purchase it again (loaned my first copy to someone and never got it back). Just read the excerpt. All I can say is...AWESOME. I understand that they are making a movie out of this. Will run to the theaters to see it. Can't wait. I hope that this review helps. You MUST take Precious' journey, it is one that you will not forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddy Pushis On","review":"This book is really exiting and a great pleasure to read. It's also crazy and grouse what a father and mother can do to there own child. Precious lost her virginity in the 7th grade and at the age of 17 she is living on her own in a half way house with two children from her father. The neighborhood she is living in is not to good Harlem N.Y. a lot of drugs and gangs. She is getting an education by going to G.E.D school. Her father dies from the HIV virus leaving you thinking? In the beginning I struggled to read it because of the grammar and it was really annoying me, but as I went on I got used to it and enjoyed it. The only person that precious really gets along with in the novel is Ms. Rain her teacher. Ms. Rain really cares about precious and is the one that put her in the half way home. So get out and get the book and read on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant","review":"I enjoyed this book on CD. Very interesting and uplifting to see this young abuse victim recover and make a life for her and her son."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Bummer...","review":"I was excited to read it because everyone had told me it was so great. EXCEPT for the sales woman at Boarders, I should have put it back when she winced and told me it was \\"a hard read\\" and then suggested another book instead. But I wanted to see what all the hype was about. What a bummer!!! This book was a total let down. And not just because of the depressing events that take place in the book. All the book consists of is shocking sexual abuse that makes you want to vomit and barely readable text, because the author that it would be smarter to write it from Precious' illiterate interpretation. I read 1-2 books a week and this is one of the worst I've read in a long time. A much better book that is never boring & also a true story \\"The Glass Castle\\". I really don't know how \\"Push\\" got such great reviews. Take my advice & see the movie instead, at least there is some good acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book Push was great","review":"I think Push was a excellent book.It was a girl who was getting raped by her father when she was a baby.As she grew up her father touched her in the ways she did'nt want to be touched. She became older and had her first baby by her father at the age 12.Then when she became pregant again they kicked her out of school then put her in a alternative school.Before she went there she did'nt know who to do alot of things.She became smarter and took care of her baby the best she could."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUSH..","review":"Push is what I had to do to make myself finish this book. First off the author is writing as an illiterate teen, which made it hard for me to read..and took longer. The graphic descriptions of the abuse was a bit much for me..and I am not overly sensitive or prude. I think because child abuse is touchy for me, it just disgusted me. I thank God that I didn't go through what Precious did. All that said once you get away from the abuse..you begin to root for Precious and you find yourself Pushing for her. But in all honesty, after reading the book...I don't think I want to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed more","review":"I read this book in about 2 days and when I was done, I felt like the book needed more. Something seemed to be missing. It was a good read and that is why I gave it 4 stars. I would like to have known more about Precious' mother and father. The ending seemed to be without closure as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUSH, a novel by Saphire","review":"After seeing the movie, I took a chance and ordered the original book.

It's a quick and great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A vey powerful and thought provoking book","review":"This book was recently discussed by my book club and it was one of the best discussions we've had in along time.

It looked too short. The author looked like an angry black woman. I read the first page and the content, language and style shocked me. But I kept the book and read it. Boy, am I glad I did! The book moved me to tears. The world the author created is so far from the one I live in. But I was drawn into that world and lived it for a short time. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. Everyone should. \\"Push\\" should be required reading in suburban schools where everyday life can sometimes be too easy. I will not foget Precious Jones anytime too soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning work","review":"Apart from the deceptively simple story that promotes thought, action, discussion and acceptance, SDapphire has, in one novel, cast herself into the Female African-American literary canon alongside such notable as Alice Walker and Toni Morrisson, in a work that should be read and discussed in conjunction with those books, or, read by itself, will promote enough discussion on its own"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it's well written...","review":"but I read to learn or for pleasure. This was an assault on my senses. The story is extremely sad and in some passages, I felt sick. I guess the author is a success in that regard; not an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"I found inconsistencies throughout the entire story. In addition, personally it was somewhat too over the top which made it unbelievable to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"I could not put it down.This book is a miraculous rendering of the multiple layers of abuse and neglect that lead to the disastrous reality of Precious' life. Intellectual, cultural and moral misery are here realistically presented as the result of widespread systemic malfunctions (school, health system), poverty and isolation (how the heck does a 12 year old girl give birth to her father's child and is sent back to her parents?)Sapphire's rendering of Precious' speech and mental blocks is masterful. Her insight into the effects of trauma (on the mind and body as well as psyche) is all the more disturbing that it is not thematized as such--just showed.Push should be required reading in all English classrooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"push","review":"I read the book : PUSH by: Sapphire.Great book.Sad and at times disgusting(what the young lady went through)But well worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Therone Shellman author of \\"Love Don't Live Here\\"","review":"\\"Push\\" is a great read in reference to child welfare. I feel it should be required for all High School students to read this book. Many people could not stomache the harsh reality of Precious Jones life b/c there is just not enough literature floating around which depicts hardship and struggle in such a way Spahire describes.

I use to the urban, drug related books. But after I got into it it was like i felt for Precious. Shouldn't nobody have to go through so much at the age of 12 and even am earlier ge than that. The mom was a pig. The dad was a dead beat rapist. It never was any police involved so it was just hard core for precious. This is a good book so read it"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL STORY","review":"This is the best book I ever read in my whole life, and I have read many books. I did not put the book down at all. I read it all in one day at the same time because I just wanted to know what was going to happen. I believe that this was an inspiring story and it could not have been written any better. I commend the author for writing this book because it was absolutely wonderful. Clareece Precious Jones went through many hard times including physical, sexual and emotional abuse. She was possibly exposed to the AIDS virus by her father and had two children by him. She struggled in school with a poor education but her teacher had faith in her that she would progress. Her teacher changed her life. I believe that if anyone has the chance, they need to read this book and pass it on to everyone else, until everyone has gotten a chance to read this amazing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Writing","review":"The overall story is fine. I like shocking stories about difficult subjects. Although to be honest, I felt dumber after reading the author's illiterate writing. I understand the writing style is meant to convey the atmosphere but I it was not necessary for the entire book, the main character's journal entries are more than enough.

Yes, I understand that may have been to emphasis this girl's way of speech and upbringing, but it was way overhauled.The whole story was just too much for me, you might as well go and buy \\"Go Ask Alice\\" or \\"Crosses\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Push: A Novel By Sapphire","review":"I thought this book was amazing.

The book is better. I would recommend anyone read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Push","review":"When I first started to read the book Push I just could put it down. I really enjoyed Sapphire's blunt attitude while telling this story. Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones has had more hardships in the first 16 years of her life then most of us will probably ever have in our life time. She was raped by her father and now caring his second child. Her mother verbally and physically abuses her every day. Tells her how worthless she is and how no one will ever love her. She is overweight, poor and has no education. But even with all the odds stacked against her Precious still manages to overcome some of her struggles with the help of Ms. Rain and her classmates at the alternative school. This book really open my eyes to the reality and hardships people go through. It made more aware of how lucky and blessed I am.

There are 3 pieces plus the pump. None of which fit together properly. The back piece is angled and falls off with any bump. And there are gaps everywhere.2. The pump has 4 suction cups for feet but the inside of the waterfall is textured so they don't stick.3.

Mahoney's book comes as close as I think it's possible to come in figuring out what Fermat's mathematical interests and methods were, what he proved and what he didn't. Only high school math is required to read this book easily; the writing style is clear, and the structure of the book is well organized.Some readers may be disappointed to learn that Fermat's abilities were only human, and that he made a number of mistakes. But even a genius is entitled to be less than perfect, and the real Fermat is in many ways more interesting than the myth. I recommend this book to anyone curious about Fermat's mathematical abilities and achievements."},{"rating":"1","title":"use only if you like either scalding or cold water","review":"we purchased the Brizo kitchen faucet when we had ur home built.

He tries to help those around them and is always coming up with Plans.Though there is an overall story, each chapter is almost like its own vignette about Humphrey's life in school and the weekends where he goes home with the kids.This book will appeal to both boys and girls in about the grade 2-4 range, especially those who like animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole Humphrey series is great.","review":"The whole Humphrey series is great.

(At least they'll try!)The lexile range for the Humphrey series is roughly 640-730... which translates to a 3rd-5th grade reading level, regardless of your child's chronological age. Can younger kids enjoy hearing the story? Of course. Can older kids get a kick out of it? For sure.

Eminem might have wit and flow but production is not his strong side. And why does he always have to sing the hooks, it's torture.

Ever since I heard their first song \\"Under The Influence\\" on Eminem's CD. Bizaare, talks on tracks instead of rapping, he has the sickest sense of humor, hes bizaare, thats y he is called bizaare. Swift has a nice rhyme, and a nice delivery, he is definitely one of the + the group. Kon Artist and Kuniva are often found rhymin in a duett, that also display some talent. Proof has a really hoarsy voice, but his flow and rhyme raelly brings support to the group. Em was behind production, he has the sound thats realy uniq and you can just tell is him.Delivery: B+Rhymes: B+Production: AOverall: A"},{"rating":"1","title":"D12-lose","review":"This Album is garbage only slim and proof are nice mc's but therest of the group is trash.hope the next album better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent work","review":"D12 is a great debut album for this detroit group led by megastar Eminem. Not all of the group posesses as much skills as Em himslef but all have their own strenghs as shown throughout this CD. song 5, 6 and 10 are my favorites. Sometimes the lyrics are to unreal to be taken seriously and that's a major downpoint as i tend to prefer reality rap, but most of this album could be considered reality rap. I give it 8 out of 10. Worth buying and listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"eminem and the rest of D12 shine","review":"everyone thinks that eminem just found the rest of D12 somewhere recently but the truth is they have been together for more than 4 years. They had a pact that whoever made it big first would come back and make a group project... well eminem obviously made it first and here is D12. The cd only has 1 or 2 \\"pop\\" songs (aint nothin but music) the cd has more raw beats than most of eminems other cds and might not be as popular because it has less commerical songs.Dre dre produced 4 tracks and koniva and Eminem shows off their talents as producers. Lyrically D12 is probably top 5 out of all groups and the beats are unique the whole album doesnt sound the same like St. lunitics... if you are tired of hearing how much \\"ice\\" cars , and houses rappers have pick this up. look out for these tracks --purple pils--pimp like me--american psycho--these drugs-Overall this is album is original and don't buy it if u have no sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem returns with the Dirty Dozen","review":"First of all, if you don't like Eminem, you won't like this. If you think he's offensive, you haven't heard anything yet. Backed by solid production from Em and Dre, this CD gives you more of what you wanted on The Marshall Mathers LP. There's even another disclaimer at the beginning in the form of \\"Another Public Service Announcement\\". Some of my favorite cuts are \\"Fight Music\\", \\"Sh*t can happen\\", \\"Pimp like Me\\", and \\"Purple Pills\\". The theme pretty much stays the same throughout, with the guys letting you know how they feel about different topics. All of the lyricists are pretty competent, with Bizarre standing out because of his voice. If you liked either of the previous Em releases, you'll want to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy debut for Em's group","review":"Devil's Night is no Marshall mathers lp, but it is not without it's bright spots. 'Pimp Like Me', 'Aint Nuttin But Music' 'That's How...' are some of the hottest joints Em has ever done. Some may not be feeling Bizzare, but his twisted sense of humour and mic skills do not speak for the rest of d-12. Eminem and Proof are undeniably the most talented in the group, but I'm feeling Swift and Kon Artis. The beats, by Dre, Eminem, Denaun Porter, etc are BANGIN'! I would recommend this to everyone who liked Eminem's first two albums. His name is practically written all over this cd. While I won't say it is a five-star classic it just goes to show Eminem could make good hip-hop in his sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut for D12!!!","review":"This cd is a great debut for the group. Eminem is the master of bringing this group together. My favorite songs would have to be Devil's Night and Purple Pills. I see that this group will come out with a new album in the near future. If you like Em's The Marshall Mathers, you got to buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly excellent","review":"All I have to say is that this is a very good CD. There is not one song here that doesn't have tight lyrics and nice beats. I am a big fan of Eminem. His style of rap is very unique, but that is not to say that the other members of D12 are not talented. The other members (Kon Artis, Proof, Swifty, Bizarre, and Kuniva) all have distinct voices and their lyrical flow is consistent. However, Bizarre could sputter some more meaningful lyrics because most of his lyrics don't make sense but are funny and sometimes disturbing. Despite that, this is truly a great CD for any Eminem fan and even any rap fan, for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"dirty dozen","review":"your cd rocks. you cuse alot which i like,and you keep it real. my favorite songs are- nasty mind, ant nothing but music, thats how and fighting music.your fan,flymro13"},{"rating":"2","title":"d12 - hottest collective since the Wu","review":"I was skeptical of d12 at first, thinking they were going to just ride the coattails of eminem, but i was highly impressed after just a few spins of the album.

Eminem's off da hook group \\"D12\\" have really out-done themselves this time with baggin' tracks such as: Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin but Music, Blow my Buzz, and the *NEW* off the hook joint \\"Purple Pills\\". Another slammin' track on the album is the called \\"girls\\". It talks about the angst between Eminem vs Limp Bizkit (dj lethal) & Everlast, which is a pretty hype song anyways!? So, cop tha album and tell AMAZON what' chu think of it, !Peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If 1 good MC out of 6 is good enough for you....","review":"Pretty weak album. Somehow listening to other MC's try to diss like Eminem, even ones from his own crew, just isn't fun. I don't know the names of the other members of D12, and I don't care to either, because they just aren't nearly as skilled as Eminem. A few tracks with very good beats isn't enough to rescue a mediocre album. Just not worth the money. And if you think this is the bomb, you probably think just about every other CD out there is the bomb too. For me, time to get off the Eminem merry-go-round, because now it just makes me sick. In my mind, Stan and the Real Slim Shady were the songs that made Eminem interesting and fun, but there's no Dido or satyrical, albeit controversial, fun. Just lots of stuff I've already heard from Eminem that I can listen to anytime I want to on his previous albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like Eminem","review":"I personally have liked the past 2 Eminem CD's with great beats, lyrics, and choruses.

I THINK THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS ''DEVILS NIGHT'' BECAUSE IT HAS A GOOD BEAT AND THEY ALL SING VERY GOOD IN THIS TRACK '' DEVILS NIGHT '' .

What was witty and refreshing a couple years ago is starting to sound tired. Last years Marshall Mathers LP is probably the best work Eminem will ever deliver.

Bizarre, Proof, Kon Artis, Swift and Kuniva put down some dope lyrics to some dope beats along side Eminem. Some of my favorites songs are Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, That's How..., Instigator, Devil's Night, Revelation and Girls, which is a bonus track. A lot of these songs are funny, so if your use to Eminem's sense of humor, you'll like the rest of D12. Devil's Night is one of the best rap albums out there.

Eminem is a talented producer who will soon be equal as his teacher Dre'.

Unfortunately, all those albums were mediocre, and D12's Devil's Night won't break the streak. This might be the worst hip hop album I've ever heard, and I don't say that lightly. The five guys that Eminem has brought along are pathetic; instead of trying to rival him lyrically, they only try to out shock each other, which gets old REALLY fast. The music is just not good; but of couse Eminem's white pop and rock audience will think this is the best album ever! Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment once again","review":"Ever since Eminem signed on with Dr. Dre he seems to have lost his touch with his roots.

This album will sell well but the respect of his fans will be short lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"D12 is more than back up for Eminem","review":"D12's first lp is finally out, over seven years after the group was formed. Devil's Night is one of the greatest albums released this year. Each member has lyrical talent equal to Eminem, and the beats go great with the groups delivery style. Every track is hot. Nothing drags the disc down. Not only is this album great, but it is funny as well. Just listen to \\"Purple Pills\\", the lead single and I guarantee you will crack up. \\"Chick I'm Fo real\\". Welcome to Ammityville ya'll. D12 is here to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album","review":"If there were people protesting and complaining about The Mashall Mather's LP, there is gonna be the same stuff goin on with this one. If you are easily offended or can't take a joke, don't listen to this album.However, if you just want to listen to a fantastic album, this one is for you. Eminem is back and this time he brought some of his friends (the most notable would most likely be Bizarre, who's lyrics are intended to shock even those that weren't by Eminem's previous albums).Although I only listened to about 50% of the album so far, I would have to say that \\"s*** happens\\" and \\"girls\\" are the best i've heard so far. The song \\"Girls\\" (a hidden track) goes after Fred Durst and DJ Lethal of Limp Bizkit as well as Everlast.

Tight beats & rhymes, and the best tracks are \\"Nasty Mind\\", \\"Revelation\\", \\"Instigator\\", \\"Devils Night\\" and my favourite \\"Fight Music\\" wich contains one of the best chorus of 2001, no doubt.By the way there's the bonus track \\"Girls\\" when Eminem disses Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst and DJ Lethal...I don't think these guys got balls to answer back, they probably r hidding somewhere, scared to death, that's a good one Eminem.Don't forget HipHop is entertainment, don't get these guys too serious...if u like Eminem's previous records, go pick this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"This cd is great.

Does this sentence sound familiar? If it does, it's only because it has started out every cd eminem has done! I think that is pretty dumb. Eminem should have featured D12 on his first two albums and not made this record at all. His best work were his last two albums. This one is extremely weak. Em and D12 were only concerened with shocking the listener rather than coming up with good beats. The one and only track I like is Girls, that is Eminem at his best.

After listening to purple pills about 100 times, i decided i would give the other songs on the album a try. The first half of the album is not good at all, but from track 10 and beyond the album really picks up. There are some CRAZY lyrics by Bizzare, who is one of the craziest guys i have ever seen.

I am amazed that people actually gave this a good review. The beats are horrible and as for the lyrics they just sound like old school Bushwick Bill. If you know who he is remember that song Mind of a lunatic well just listen to that and mix in some Esham, Kool Kieth, and ICP and you got M&M.

Nonetheless, as an amateur child photographer who is trying to glean as much info as possible, I definitely got a lot out of Box's discussion of techniques. He basically presents 50 of his photos, and tells the \\"story\\" of how he shot each one, complete with lighting diagrams and how he interacted with the kids. Also very helpful is his resource section at the end which gives contact info for his favorite vendors of photo supplies and accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't care for this book","review":"This book is somewhat lacking for me.

Frankly, I think game distributors are skimping on the manuals to try and make us buy more game-related goods. I don't agree with the practise. So far as I'm concerned, with I buy an expensive game, it should ship with it's own manual.This game guide has over-head maps of all the levels, in case you are interested, but actually they are printed quite small and thus are not of much use. You have to squint to try to see the details. The maps need to be much bigger.Basically, this guide is like a manual, standard stuff that doesn't really have much that will help you play the game better. Best to search out online guides for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not live up to my standard","review":"I have high hopes for this dictionary when I learned about this dictionary.

Even in the instance when the word do appear in the dictionary, sometimes I could not find what the phrase that I really wanted. Also, I found the pinyin (Mandarin translation) to be quite unconventional. Cantonese translation, however, is better than what I usually encounter in other books!

Use a toothbrush if really dirty.

I follow up with Zildjian Cymbal Polish (lightly!!!)for the deep shine. Works on my Zildian A's like a charm. Both the cymbals & logos look like the day I bought them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff stinks!!!","review":"An earlier review was right, there is some type of ammonia or non-breatheable ingredient in GJ...but man, it beats the socks off of Zildjian paste or brasso-type creams.

Always use this product near a well ventilated area, but enjoy the ease and time you saved!Hint, if you only clean your cymbals 2 times a year, store the GJ in a glass jar until ready to use it in its plastic spray bottle. The stuff goes funky in the spray bottle if allowed to set over a years time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...","review":"So I bought this thinking it would work well with all of these positive reviews, but it did not.

The chapters also are quite inconsistent. Some are well written and easy to follow, however some important chapters, mostly in the second half (70-296) are completely lacking and feel like they were written by people with little experience with the product.It seems like this book was rushed out without being properly edited.

The chapters that are aligned (in theory) with the 292 exam basically miss a lot of information that is covered in the exam itself. There is no real paralleling the exam.That included (boy, did it ever) the sample tests. There was almost no relation between the materials handled in the real exam question and the samples.

The sheer amount of patently false information (one test question on the CD actually said that you should apply a Group Policy to a security group!) makes on wonder if the authors and editors at Sybex were gassed up on nitrous when this went through. The amount of material that in the book that actually appeared on the exam was minimal, and some exam subjects weren't even mentioned in the MCSA section of the book!

The main theme for Creepshow alone is a classic worth buying the disc for. This was another old Varese Sarabande vinyl that slipped through my teenaged fingers and, for years, I thought it would remain so. Thank goodness the good people at Lalaland Records have corrected this error and one of the very best low (or modest) budget horror movie scores is now available again. That being said, the extras are not Harrison at his best and, sadly, the last three are not very good at all. Collectors such as myself will love the opportunity to have these little items, but I doubt that they will get the same amount of play as the Creepshow soundtrack will. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"CreepShow soundtrack......FINALLY!","review":"The score for this movie is bloody amazing! I have been waiting for this score to be released since I saw CreepShow in the 80's. Apparently, Varese Sarabande originally released the soundtrack to this masterpiece. I had searched for the LP but was unsuccessful in finding it.The music still gives me goosebumps. I was seven when I first saw CreepShow and the music echoed in my brain. The main theme is way cool!

Once you get the hang of the controls it's really not that hard. At one point, it became very frustrating because you get codes to start at a certain level every four levels or so, and the hardest level for me was at the last level befor another code, so I kept dying and having to go back and replay the levels I had already beat many times. In general, though, I guess this game hooks you as much as any video game. The final boss was really easy- it was kind of anticlimactic. Also: all the levels are pretty much the same, so it kind of get tedious.

You can't even save your game, you have to enter in a password (of which you might forget). There are no bonus games, except for the \\"Paint N' Print\\" and \\"Hide and seek\\". The bosses are too hard to beat, and you have to beat four stages before you get a password to the next level. Don't listen to other people who tell you that Tarzan is a good game, but most importantly don't waste your money on this game, it is an awful way to throw away $30. I reccommend the new release KIRBY TILT N'TUMBLE or any mario/wario game.

So for seven bucks, this is worth having, but there's even better stuff out there by Ottensamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good material played badly","review":"The works by Louis Spohr featured on this recording are not standard works for clarinet, which is very refreshing. One can only hear the Mozart Concerto so many times before wondering if anyone else composed anything of note. These works are quite interesting and fun to hear as well as to play. However, the performance is mediocre at best. When listening to the recording, one begins to wonder where one measure ends and the next begins. Even with a score, it is difficult to find any semblance of a steady beat. The expressive quality of the playing is also somewhat lacking, partially because the technical aspects (including tempo) are quite weak. While this recording offers the opportunity to become aquainted with different material for the clarinet, it does not provide a good representation of the true musical quality of the pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to send it back!","review":"The antenna was well made, and came with a number of adaptors to fit multiple vehicles.

I did not want to use lock tight because it should have been able to stay tightened on its own.Bottom line, I became more concerned that it would not tighten properly, and returned it. Beware because it is stainless steel, heavy, and will damage the vehicle if it fall off during travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the item!","review":"The item was as described and the shipping was fast but the only problem is that I wasnt the only one who liked it, someone stole it off my truck 2 weeks after I installed it so yea..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I admit that I purchased this CD just for the Reginald Gardiner track \\"Trains\\", but a few replayings have convinced me that it is a little gem!A good selection of tracks, mostly from the 1940's era, but with some big names like Duke Ellington, Lonnie Donegan, Glen Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and the ever-saucy George Formby, all with a Railroad / Railway theme.If you've old enough to remember riding on a steam train, and have fond memories of the \\"Old Days\\", then this CD will fit nicely into your library.A winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch printer","review":"I've had this printer for 3 weeks, and so far I'm happy with it.

This means you can print out pictures without using your computer.If you are going to use your printer quite a bit, I recommend getting good quality inkjet paper, not the cheapest brand you can find.

With Canon 4x6 glossy photo paper the quality of prints I am producing equal and even surpass 35 mm prints I have recently had developed. And I really like the individual ink tanks.

They are as good or better than prints from a photo lab, and my images are from a lowly 1.3 megapixel camera. I imagine better cameras would get even better results, though I'm not sure it's possible. This is a great deal, and the price seems to keep dropping. The price is right.

The result: magenta, blue, and non-photo black no longer printed, but the photo black now printed light. It was the usual suspect: the Canon print head. My previous Canon also had a print head go kaput. See previous review.

I made the mistake of assuming it would print quality text documents too, which seems a much simpler task. I am very disappointed in the frequent ink smears, streaks, and blotches on the pages. It takes frequent cleaning procedures to minimize the streaks and blotches. I am incredulous that the ink smears when a highlighter pen is used on the text. This happens on pages with dry ink that were printed many months earlier! Highlighter pens seem to dissolve the dried ink.

Instead of converting your spouse, just deal with the fact they are a different religion. Religion is a private thing, and it should be kept private. Also, converting is immoral. Only two major religions don't emphasize that they are the right religion and that you need convert others. Those are Bhuddism and Hinduism.

There just isn't a bad song here.For me, this genre has had way too many artists putting out bad and mediocre albums and I can only tell you that this is not such an album.

Its also the return of the Stooges for a few tracks. But Iggy's songs with the Trolls rock the hardest. This isn't a return to the classic Stooges underproduced, overdistorted primal brillance but its good stuff nonetheless. The songs are excellent and there are some real standout classics like: Inferiority Complex, Blood on Your Cool, Private Hell, Loser, Perverts in the Sun and Superbabe. Overall, Skull Ring is not as great as \\"Beat em Up\\" or \\"Raw Power\\" but its pretty cool anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is too","review":"Other than the lyrics to 'Little Know It All', which are a bit immature for us post-50 people, this is an entirely adequate addition to our hero's catalogue.

I was looking forward to this record for months, Iggy reunites with the Stooges, coulda been great, I tried desperately to enjoy it, unfortunetely Iggy just phoned this one in. The real kick in the teeth on this record to his old time fans, is that that he, Iggy Pop, unites with the enemy, Sum 41 and Green Day, the bands that have turned Punk music into watered down whinings about missing your fat girlfriend. It seems that Iggy, like many other formely great rock stars (The Stones with Justin Timberlake) are betraying their most loyal of fans in order to attract a younger audience.Well this record will most likely be talked about it for a few weeks, and then forgotten completely and lost among the piles of all the other Iggy albums, so I don't know why I'm complaining, soon enough nobody will know what I'm complaining about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great One Is Back!","review":"When the first few notes of \\"Little Electric Chair\\" slashed through my speakers I knew I was home. After a string of tepid CDs that didn't quite work the great one is back. On \\"Skull Ring\\" Iggy proves he is the Godfather of Punk leaving the armies of wannabe pretenders in the dust. Every track goes directly for the jugular. The backing bands are incredible. Although I personally would have been happy with an entire album by Iggy and the Stooges, who still sound as great they did back in 1970, the songs by new pop punk stars like Green Day and Sum 41 pack a wallop and prove that Iggy is no \\"Dead Rock Star\\" but the yard stick by which all punk shall be measured. You. Yeah you. Stop voting Republican and worrying about your...mutual funds! Go buy Skull Ring!!!!!

After all these years is Iggy trying to market himself towards a bigger audience. Personally, after all that Iggy Pop has been through over the years, no one deserves garners of success more than him, but his latest release, \\"Skull Ring\\", is a disappointment. His last album, 2001's \\"Beat 'Em Up\\" was underrated by many but was pure unadulturated rock Iggy style. \\"Skull Ring\\" for the most part just seems plain old uninspired and hastily put together. \\"Private Hell\\", \\"Little Know It All\\" and \\"Supermarket\\", all of which feature either Green Day or Sum 41, all sound like radio ready pop punk with Iggy's voice. All that aside though, there are some solid tracks to be found on \\"Skull Ring\\" like \\"Loser\\" and \\"Blood on Your Cool\\", but for the most part \\"Skull Ring\\" is far, far from Iggy Pop's finest hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad sad shadow of rock n roll","review":"Iggy pop and the Stooges should not have waited 30+ years to put something else out.

Bottom line, the Stooges still know how to kick ass with thier rock n roll. Iggy on the other hand has completely lost his edge. His lyrics are insanely retarded, he's writing lyrics like the other punk embarrassments that we have to sit through on this cd; Sum (*&^ing 41 and Green Day.Sorry, after Self titled, Fun House, Raw Power, and seeing him play his tunes live you tend to expect nothing but pure rock n roll.

Like his pal, David Bowie, he was due for a change. Bowie put out Heathen a few years ago. Now Iggy has Skull Ring. A year ago he reformed with some of the remaining Stooges and played some shows. Four new songs resulted. This is the core of the record. The collaborations with Green Day and Sum 41 are interesting. The songs with Peaches fail miserably.

And \\"Here Comes The Summer\\" is one great nod to those throw-away summer songs of yore, but with a decidedly Iggy twist. And \\"Dead Rock Star\\"? What can you say about that title? Iggy's phrasing and delivery has never been so direct, potent and vital. I was expecting inconsistency after \\"Beat Em Up\\" (a great one in my book), but Iggy has kept up the momentum. It is a shame that there are the Green Day and Sum 41 tracks, because they really do kind of suck and seem out of place.

This sentence claims that a short story just returned from Rome! I think Ms. Antrim was trying to say that the writer of the short story returned from Rome, but that's not what the sentence says. I hope the short story had a nice trip! Seriously, this is the kind of thing you learn about in high school English classes.

They put out a couple 7\\" singles as Whitey on the Moon UK that focused more on their electronic side, but this album has a lot of great rock songwriting on it. Killer stuff - check out \\"Sailing by Night\\" for a Beck or Radiohead-type melody - understated and beautiful Also, \\"Family Romance\\" would be a great single. There are still a handful of straight electronic tracks that make for an interesting counterpoint here. My favorite is \\"We Have to Respect Each Other\\" - hilarious little piece.

It is not. \\"Freedom's Sword\\" is in fact an excellent presentation of the events that historians have called the Scottish Wars of Independence, but were not seen in those terms by contemporaries. Scotland's failure to resolve its succession crisis in the late 13th and early 14th centuries had disastrous consequences, souring relations with its southern neighbor, ensuring that Scotland remained an impoverished and isolated country until the Act of Union, while many English and Scotsmen died in unnecessary wars. As Traquair demonstrates, this was far from being inevitable. The book is unfortunately let down by a large number of typographical errors, but otherwise an entertaining read and an excellent debunking of the grotesque distortions presented in popular histories, most notably the film \\"Braveheart\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm back for more","review":"I purchased this product to help me in my gym workout.

If you enjoy reading MFK Fisher and Angelo Pellegrino and respect the body of work of Julia Child, Simca, Richard Olney and James Beard, you will probably enjoy this book.As the title indicates and Ms David notes, this is bourgeoise food; it is not haute cuisine. It is not fussy or esoteric and Ms David has approached it accordingly.The value of this book as a traditional cookbook will depend on the skills, experience and the mood of the cook. However, the book does provide an overview of regional bourgeois cuisine which, when combined with the small paperback format, makes it an excellent travel book. There is also an exceptional bibliography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rising for the Moon","review":"How sad that so many fans of Fairport Convention are mired in the sixties. The fact is, the band has maintained its musical quality many times BECAUSE of the personnel changes, not in spite of them. No one appreciates the extraordinary talents of Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson more than I do, but the fact is Fairport continues to produce some of the finest folk/rock available today. To ignore the contributions of people like Simon Nicol, Trevor Lucas, Jerry Donahue, Ric Sanders, Maartin Allcock, Chris Leslie and others is to cheat yourself of some really fine music. \\"Rising for the Moon\\" contains some of the more emotional songs fairport ever produced: The title cut, \\"Restless\\", \\"White Dress\\", \\"Stranger to Himself\\", \\"Iron Lion\\"; well, the fact is you would be hard pressed to find a weak cut on the record. Unless, I suppose, you can't get your head out of 1969!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rising For The Moon - Fairport In New Form","review":"This album moves away from the \\"traditional\\" Fairport music. It keeps the same types of melodies and harmonies, but deals with more contemporary themes. Having said that, it is my favourite of all their albums.

When it is time to switch to the next teaching drill/game I nearly always have multiple kids asking, \\"Can we do it one more time?\\" We worked on kick off and kick off returns for 45 minutes yesterday using the \\"games approach\\". The kids learned a lot and they were begging to do it again. It was 95 degrees and these kids are begging to run the full length of the field over and over again!!!

Basically, I found them to be a cross between a Twix bar with cookie wafers and caramel, and a Nestle's crunch bar. They have the cookie wafers and caramel, and then it's coated in rich, milk chocolate, which has rice crispie bits in the choclate. It's a very solid candy bar, and it requires some chewing.

The city touting a \\"gold rush\\" that beckoned to countless fortune seekers, including their well-intentioned father, is nothing but a muddy village of tents and framed structures. With no ships leaving the coast, no home and no income, it is up to Rachel to protect her family from this hedonistic city overflowing with lost souls and failed dreams.The Measure Of A Lady is a poignant novel filled with honesty and revelation.

I highly recommend this book for any adolescent or adult readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read","review":"Another hit from deanne gist! was a very enjoyable read. I can not wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked first book, disappointed with this one","review":"I kept looking at the credits of this book to see if it had been revised from a secular novel because that's just how it reads. It was too explicit regarding characters thoughts about sex...by secular standards I guess it would be considered tame but it ruined the book for me. For a great book that deals with temptation in a smart/funny way, tryLost in NashVegasby Rachel Hauck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"First off, I have to admit when I bought this book at the big warehouse store I wasn't aware that it was Christian fiction, as there was nothing on the book jacket noting that fact. I didn't realize until I was well into the book that it was not only about the love between Rachel and Johnny but about their faith in God and the conflicts with trying to adhere to that and live in lawless San Francisco in the 1840's.That being said, it was a very enjoyable tale as Rachel comes to terms with her faith and her love for Johnny. I give the author kudos for having the courage to write some sexual tension into the book, along with the \\"downfall\\" of the younger sister Lissa.A very enjoyable, albeit quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible. A re-read, over and over again.","review":"One of my favorites of all time. I have re-read this book multiple times and it has a permanent place in my home library. You'll learn about history in so many ways, you'll have to answer questions about how you would deal with situations, and you'll find yourself struggling alone with the characters.Stick with this book until the end, and it will stick with you forever.Love. Love. Love.History, beautiful romance, character development that will change you, and faith of the most inspiring kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really surprised at the drastic difference between this book and the author's first book, \\"A Bride Most Begrudging.\\" In the first book, the relationship between the two main characters began sweetly and gradually. In this story it seems crude, forced, rushed and awkward. Other than that, it just lost my interest, not caring what happened to the any of the characters, so I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. I would recommend the author's first book, as it was much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Measure of a Lady","review":"The Measure of a Lady was fun and well written like all of Ms Gists books. Hope she never stops writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sucked me in...","review":"You have to admit that a book is good when you don't want to put it down. Deeanne Gist creates characters you want to see together and grow closer to God. They are flawed in a very believable, human way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike any other work of Gist's","review":"I thought this book was very surprising for so many reasons. Gist's stories are usually so smooth sailing and unmessy. Two people with Christian values and beliefs meet and presto... you have a couple. But this one was interesting because it taught me about how even the best of intentions can get lost in our own agendas. And being Christian doesn't mean you have a license to judge others. The hero being a former missionary was also a big surprise. And the way he grew to love the heroine was a lot less mushy. I like mush. The book was all in all really good, but it wasn't hilarious like the synopsis promises. The only funny part I thoroughly enjoyed and still smile about is *SPOILER ALERT* the part when Rachel gets into the carriage with her suitor and Johnnie. And Johnnie keeps winking at her and blowing in her ear to annoy her. I just grinned full out at that. So cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Really a good read - surprised at the low price. Have now ready several books by this author andhave enjoyed all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian fiction with an edge!","review":"While \\"Bride...\\" was my favorite by this author, I enjoyed Measure of A Lady as well. Rachel is a young woman trying to raise Christian siblings in a non-Christian town. Many are giving her a hard time but cut her some slack, she just wants what is best for them. What Lissa and Michael do is exactly what she was trying to keep them from doing. Remember that she did not have a mother to guide her and so her misunderstandings about sex and other issues are not all her fault. I think she and Johnnie came out very well in the end...what if she had compromised herself b-4 Johnnie came to Christ again? I think it is a heart-warming tale with some sexual tension and maybe should be avoided by young teenagers...but overall a 'can't put it down' read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Measure of a Lady","review":"The Measure of a Lady had all kinds of wonderful history and colorful word pictures of the scenery, but this was definitely not a rated G book.

Quite bland, listen to it a few times and it really starts to fade from memory. At least 'Can Our Love\\" took some chances, this goes nowhere. I'll also mention that I saw them on the tour to support this album and it was a very dull show as well. Saw them live after albums one and two and they were magnificent (even though Stuart was very drunk at one show I saw). The new songs are weak, they sound like out-takes, there's no way around it. What's happening? Disagree? Then I'll ask you-if you wanted to turn a new fan on to Tindersticks would you play them ANYTHING from this album? No way!

However, when I first listened to \\"Waiting for the Moon\\" I felt really disappointed. It seems flat, uninspired, and the band seems to be working in all too familiar territory. Gone is the passion and force behind such albums as \\"Tindersticks 2\\" and \\"Curtains\\".

The first 4 books - 1. Beneath a Blood Red Moon, 2. When Darkness Falls, 3. Deep Midnight and 4. Realm of Shadows are excellent books!

Having said that; I must say that The Awakening is awful! Yes, I said AWFUL! I haven't yet finished the book, at this point I am almost 3/4 of the way through it and I keep skipping pages to get through it faster! I have found the two main characters \\"Finn and Megan\\" to be redundant and just plain annoying! I want to say \\"GET OVER IT ALREADY\\"!

The Awakening isn't a very good title for this particular book, it should be called The Sleeping. That's just what you want to do while reading it. She brings back her characters from her first 4 books which is a good thing.

And theirs is the love that is supposed to conquer all, including a centuries old demon that even Lucian doesn't know how to deal with. Whatever.I also think this series of books has the same (really terrible) editor.

It's blue on the last page.It's blue on every page in the middle. Wiccan's are good, satanists are bad. On every page. Don't worry if you don't get it the first fifty times, it will be explained over and over to you.Third: There's nothing really sexy about it.

I have read books on singing, by many prestigious teachers and singers, none of which come close to this one! This book is unique in its field , simply because the author is unusually gifted. Not only is she intimately aquatinted with the voice, and an incredible communicator ,she is also able to view and treat the voice from a spiritual perspective. The culmination of these talents in this book , makes it a three dimensional work of art . For any one who aspires to sing , in any capacity, this book is almost as essential as your voice.

N sync makes lame videos and box covers. If you watch making the video, most females weren't even attracted to them. They walk away when they came by or slept through the whole time. This proves nsync would stoop this low to make a corny video and dumb song.

Object detection is the way to go. I'm angry about the way this joker discusses CSS2 positioning properties such as float, clear, and position. He simply says, \\"These aren't supported the same way in all browsers, so just avoid them for now.\\" I guess he has no faith in his own flawed cross-browser techniques! Hah! There are a couple good examples for beginners on how to hide and animate menus, but they are all heavily based on his terrible cross-browser javascript code. Finally, this book is very short. To make things worse, the pages are small, and the font-size is big. I recommend the 1400 page \\"Dynamic HTML - The Definitive Reference\\" second edition by Danny Goodman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very essential CSS or DHTML","review":"The name of this book is not descriptive. While it is written on CSS & DHTML, it by no means includes anything essential on these techniques. The book is limited to a few code examples. With the help of these snippets, it discusses how to write some nice effects on your web site. While the examples look nice, they are no good for learning CSS, nor DHTML. If you're about to make animated menus or interactive quizzes with JavaScript, this code might be a good starting point, but don't expect to learn the CSS & DHTML in full. Not for beginners. The appendices include references on CSS + JavaScript, and are probably the best this book has to offer. However, they are based on the now outdated browser versions 4.x. That's amazing since the book was published in 2001, when most people are already using versions 5 or 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit for my '02 DRZ400S","review":"The throttle cables were fraying on my '02 DRZ400S.

It is extremely easy for the first, maybe, 4 or 5 levels, and then after that, it gets so diffucult that it gets to the point where you're just running around not knowing what to do and getting killed along the way by vicious bugs.

Much of what he writes is pure conjecture and easily refuted when using simple investigative principles. It is said, at other sites about his Lindbergh book, that Fisher is a former FBI agent. I wonder why he is a former agent? Was it his inability to follow through and complete the task at hand? Finding out what caused this Amish man to kill his wife is all his job was and he failed to solve this mystery for the reader.Fisher's conclusion is overly simplistic. Sure, not taking his medicine could have contributed to his murderous rage, but what was the underlying factors that truly contributed to his killing?

With the exception of the notibly awful Gottle of Gear, Babbacombe Lee is Fairport's worst effort. How can it be so bad if you're a fan? Well, it's a concept album with not much \\"concept\\". The story-line could have fit nicely into one 4 verse song, that's it. Weak song's about nothing. Pretentious, boring and uninspired. Okay, you're a fan and you want it all, right?

I had read \\"Midnight's Children\\" (great), \\"Shame\\" (pretty good), \\"Satanic Verses\\" (very good) and \\"the Ground Beneath her Feet\\" (not good)....and wanted to read \\"Grimus\\" having read that it incorporated scifi elements. I agree with the critics who say that \\"Grimus\\" is not perfect. The plot feels unnatural or laboured at times and there are flaws in the style that Rushdie corrects in his later writings. However, for a fan of scifi, it is a great book. I loved it and could not wait to finish it. The style reminded me of one of my favorite writers, R. A. Lafferty. I think it is the way he draws the characters, in a flat but sophisticated manner that reminded me of the genius from Oklahoma.--Christien Gagnier"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the strangest books I've read.","review":"This novel is unsettling, in the way that the short stories of Borges or Poe can be unsettling, but the increased length is matched by an increased degree. This reality, in which assorted characters pursue their perversities and obsessions, has melted a bit around the edges. The mystery and suspense elements keep it an interesting read. The integration of an extremely peculiar epistemology as a key plot element is clever, and not at all strained, as is so often the case when a book tries to deal with Big Ideas. The book is certainly not as well-polished and engaging as Rushdie's later works, but it is just as thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime Dream","review":"While I have to admit that the narrative is probably a little too loose for many readers, I thought this novel was incredibly beautiful.

There's a lot of love amidst the hatred, especially between young men whose loyalty and devotion to one another speaks of a quite hope in the power of a love that can emerge between desperate people in desperate circumstances. Particularly moving stories include \\"Tilt-a-Whirl,\\" \\"Let Them Love!,\\" \\"Cul-de-Sacs,\\" and \\"Pray For Beans.\\" They're ugly, and lovely, and terribly terribly sad.

Brian Pulido's feature debut is completely devoid of character development and is filled with meaningless dialog, making it impossible to side with either of his two female protagonists when they do little to garner the audience's support. It is far more foolish than clever, and almost every attempt at humor falls flat. The deaths are equally unimpressive, providing mild amounts of blood, but very little gore.

The worst part, though, was that it couldn't figure out what kind of movie it wanted to be. Let the record show, it is possible to be way too ambitious. They could've gone the crazy murderous rednecks route, but decided to throw in a crazy religious cult angle, and just for good measure, a smelly demon.

The instrumental skill is simply allowed to show through on the exceptionally-written songs.Buy it. Thank me later.Oh, you should also pick up their other two discs...\\"Music Machine\\" (their phenomenal debut...an instrumental disc), and their most excellent Christmas CD, \\"Bah Humbug,\\" which really shows off their diversity as they give their own interpretations of Christmas classics, in different styles ranging from progressive metal to country to blues, and everything else in between.

There was no rain where I was, however we were on the beach and it held up perfect. The rain fly fits great. There was 2 of us and with no instructions (didn't find them until it was up) it took us about 15 minutes to put it up. Another 5 on the rain fly and done. Tons of room. Window are big, it's almost a screen room with everything open. Zippers are great. The one big thing is the zippers. The awning is a bit quirky, but it did do it's job. Over all we had 2 queen bed and 4 people in the tent and there was still a ton of room. I have nothing bad to say about this tent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Upon setting up the tent the first time I discovered a small hole in the floor and another in the back wall of the tent.

These seams were taped. None of the other side leaked.Even though the warranty states Eureka would repair or replace the tent Support stated they had nothing to replace it with.It will also take 6 to 8 weeks to repair.

I put a queen size bed in there and had plenty room for a hanging clothes rack, a nightstand and assorted other items. I was able to make full use of the space in the tent because of the vertical walls.The second night I was in the tent we had a fairly steady hard rain for most of the night. The tent was solid and did not leak.The only issue I had was that the provided stakes did not do well for holding up the awning. Luckily, I had extra stakes that held for the rest of the week. I might look into buying a duffel bag to keep the tent in. The provided bag seemed kind of flimsy for the weight of the tent. When I carried it by the straps I worried that they would rip off...but they didn't.I highly recommend this tent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best family camping tent yet!","review":"I have been tent camping for 40 years and I thought the rip stop nylon and shock cord dome tents were the end all, be all for tent camping but I hated the dome wherein you really could only stand in the center. This tent utilizes the best of both worlds, rigid poles for vertical walls and the shock cord poles for the roof support giving you a very usable floor to ceiling, true to sixe 15x12 tent. I have been using this tent for 3 years. Like the other reviewers said, the tent poles are cheap but who uses them, I have always bought the 3/8 aluminum steaks and use them for tents, Ez-ups, tarps, dog lead hold down, etc. The floor cover is highly recommended.

Great quality and design. The instructions were off a bit as the color of the poles did not match the instructions but it went up ok (needing 2 people) even with a strong wind. Once up, the space was awesome and we setup a queen air mattress and a single cot with plenty of room to move around in. The height and vertical walls made it seem like a motel room and the full size windows opened it up for viewing and ventilation perfectly. The sky light added to the outdoors feeling. The doors and zippers worked great without a single snag. We had rain 2 days and not a leak. A great tent. My other nit is with the lack of a single ground cover or tent saver to protect the seemingly thin floor material and fit the 12X15 size."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Luxury Tent, if you have the space for it. Eureka!","review":"I love this tent. I just wish I could use it more often. With a queen size air bed, this is Lux. The only problem is that this thing is so big it doesn't fit a lot if campsites. You need a pop-up trailer site or a large clearing. We most often car camp with aEureka Sunrise 11, but there are some places where I prefer to bring this one, especially in the middle of summer and if there is no shade. I have specific places where I know this will fit. I never use the extra awning. I think it isn't worth the trouble. This tent is huge so it is nice and breezy. I haven't had to deal with any harsh weather or winds with it yet, but it seems solid enough. I can set it up solo, but of course it's easier with some help.

One thing that I did find amazingly helpful was the family tree in the front (many a time I had to use it to figure out who they were talking about because sometimes they would use nichnames and other times they wouldn't).

Unfortantely, because of my lack of familiarity of the uncles, aunts, cousins, children, grandparents, etc., etc., I kept returning to the concise family tree. The authors show a wide variety of activities of these relatives before and after the revolution and convey how some were \\"hanger-ons\\" and lived the life of royalty, while others kept the dream alive of returning to a czarist Russia. But all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed learning of the after affects of being driven out of Russia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It begins with czar nicholas and takes you right up to the present day romanovs. There are loads of similiar names, in fact all the romanovs seem to be called nicholas or alexander, but theres a family tree at the beginning of the book and i was constantly flicking back and forth to keep track.A fascinating read and one that'll keep you gripped. It deals with the history of all branches of the royal family and what has become of their descendants. The title may be a little misleading, the actual flight of the romanovs doesn't occur for some time into the book. Id recommend the book if you're a novice like me and really hadn't a clue about the romanov history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Perspective","review":"There are not many books about the majority of the Romanov clan. This one is good in the respect that it tells the story of many of the little known members. I had to question the research behind the Grand Duke and Duchess Kyril, however. Perry and Pleshakov state that the Grand Duchess Kyril(\\"Ducky\\") was a Angliphobe. They also point that she was to force behind her husband's claims to the Russian throne in the 1920's and 30's. There is too much evendience to the contrary, namely resources that have been used in biographies on Ducky and her sister Queen Marie of Romania. They point to how she was very proud to be a Princess of Great Britain, which was more important in the end than being a pretender to a non-existant throne. She was only supporting her husband, not his cause.

The museum doesn't even have a notice posted that it's fictional. When questioned, they said that if someone asks they will tell them that it's not real. Who goes into a museum, asking, is this real?The book isn't any better than that exhibit because clearly people think it's a real story. People review it as if it's real, but it's not. There's a fictional movie about the Holocaust called \\"the boy in striped pyjamas\\", so if you like fiction on the Holocaust that'd be a good movie. I just don't think people realize this book is as realistic as Disney's Bambi and that museum should be boycotted for pretending something is real. As for the book, it should be more clear that it's FAKE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel's Story","review":"Daniel's Story is a book about a boy named Daniel, who, at 14, is put on a bus and transported from Frankfurt to a ghetto in Poland, to Aushwitz to Buchenwald. Throughout his journey he loses most of his family, except his dad. He spends most of his time looking through a photo album, with pictures of his family, nazi's doing harsh things, and other things. When he looks at these pictures he has flashbacks.There was only a few things I didn't like about it. It was really sad, and a lot of people died. The author did explain everything very well, though. But I did like the fact that there was always something interesting going on, and a lot of action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, but Inspiring Tale","review":"This story has touched my life and has effected me deeply in my thoughts about the Holocaust. Having to read this for an 8th grade journal project, this became my favorite book of the year. This book supplies excellent information about the Holocaust and gives you an insiders view on how the Jews really felt. Daniel is a young Jew in Germany, who is strong enough to defeat Hitler. This book will make you become stronger and more hopeful. The characters are very well detailed and the story has vivid details on horrible events. This is a terrific historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for teens and up","review":"There are many excellent autobiographies of Holocaust survivors. However, this is historical fiction, drawing on the experiences of many. This short book, written toward a young teen audience, not only tells a personal story but includes historical references to make it highly accessible and educational. It is a great complement to autobiographies, such as Night and Diary of Anne Frank, which are also accessible to teens. One of the reviews recommends this for grades 4 and up. Though this is a hopeful story and not graphic, many kids younger than 12 are not ready to read about this much darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kyle Gruning's review","review":"Daniel's story really caught my eye on what halocaust book I should read.

I just could not justify the price ($62) to my students. Unfortunately, the quality of the book itself was not good; pages came off easily, and there were several errors throughout the book. I also came to regret this book's narrow historical scope; it's important to give students a broader spectrum of the literature's development, especially since most don't even realize Latinas/os have been producing literature in America since the 16th century. Moreover, there are much more exciting, significant Latino writers in the contemporary scene completely neglected by this anthology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is a wonderfull compilation of short stories and poems from the Latino culture.

When I took it out of the box, I could see that the metal is much thinner and more flimsy than my older steamer. The \\"ring\\" is a piece of wire which is not even soldered together. I poked my finger on the rough ends of the ring when I took it out of the box. One of the leaves already seems loose.

It was obvious when I took it out of the box that it was a flimsy, badly made product, but for the price I thought that if it lasted me a year, it would serve its purpose. I was 11 months shy of that goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pull tab broken right out of the box","review":"The concept is right, but the construction is flimsy. The pull tab, which you would use to lift the steamer out of a pot, would not stay attached. I'd send this back if it weren't such a hassle.

The only thing close to that is the fact that this product is a steaming pile of Chinese crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is the steamer I wish I'd bought years ago - big enough to hold lots of veggies, sturdy, cleans easily, works with a variety of sizes of pots and pans.

I had the exact same product from another manufacturer and used it for years without any sign of rust. Within 30 days of using this brand, it was showing signs of rust.

Recently I needed a new one. I bought this one which looked exactly like my old one and maybe it is even the same brand but the quality definitely was not the same: one of the leaves separated immediately so I returned it. Amazon graciously sent a replacement. I have exactly the same problem with the replacement basket. The leaves are not secure. Big problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Boy, A Dog, and a Frog","review":"This is a fabulous children's video. It has 3 stories in a half an hour: A boy, a dog, and a frog; frog goes to dinner, and frog on his own.

I'm astounded this doesn't show on more top 10 lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Beaverbrook","review":"Eisner's book is a wonderful reflection of his experiences over many summers at a prominent northeastern \\"sleepaway camp.\\" Being a northern Californian, I was not exposed to this particular genre of camp experience, but my brothers and I were fortunate to attend a wonderfully similar enclave three hours north of us called Camp Beaverbrook, which featured most of the same experiences (save for the wonderful natural lakes) that Mr. Eisner recounts. Our camp directors, \\"Amee and Niha\\" (Bob and Marion Brown from Orinda, California) built the place by hand and created a wonderful place for young people (\\"Beaverbods,\\" we called them) to grow up and learn to live with others. Mrs. Brown even wrote her own reflective book called \\"Past Tents,\\" which is unfortunately out of print.

Putting all Hollywood matters aside, this book is laughably horrendous in how it is conveived and executed. Most of Eisner's experiences are \\"you had to have been there\\" ordeals (and yes that very phrase litters the text.) Not to sound bias, but do parents really want their kids to turn out like Michael Eisner? And I know that currently this is the only negative review to be posted on this book, extremely suspicious since the critics lampooned it for its mawkish and mediocre writing. N.B.: All those who did write flattering reviews for Eisner only commented on this book alone. Interesting...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I thought the book was extremely inspiring and thought provoking. I thoroghly enjoyed this special look at how camp life helped shape one of today's most provocative and successful corporate leaders. So many of us have such wonderful camp memories...and this book gives us a chance to reach back to our childhood and remember how our lives were shaped.

Good reading for prisoners and Russian cosmonauts."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow","review":"&#65279;It may have been the best of times or the worst of times, but it was certainly the slowest book I ever red. Though the book was slow, Charles Dickens made some great symbolism within the book, Like when the wine flooded the streets, or Madame Defarge's knitting, he symbolized the greatness, and the horror of the French revaluation. But alas, the book was slow, much to slow, but that was understandable, he wrote it as a weekly column in an American newspaper. So for the times, it was the closest thing they had to a soap opera.

I began with two recipes, one \\"un buon spaghetatta\\" and the other a white bean soup. The recipes are so explicit that even a novice cook will have success, yet they are written in a friendly, smart style that neither condescends nor leaves anything out. If you have ever traveled to Italy, you will recognize the results as so authentically Italian tasting that you will be astounded. I now think differently about many things (garlic - less is more) and balsamic vinegar (used to add a subtle punch to pasta dishes!)... and I love the flavors and textures this book has brought to our meals.

No. 60, an incredible masterpiece","review":"If you are a classical music lover, the Haydn 60th Symphony should be a part of your collection. Unlike most Haydn symphonies, this work is in six movements. The 6th movement, which is essentially a second finale, has moments where the orchestra sounds like it is simply warming up. It is hilarious. Also on this CD is the famous Symphony No. 22, nicknamed \\"The Philosopher\\". Instead of the usual format where the first movement is fast, here Haydn begins with a gorgeous slow movement, followed by a powerful allegro, a wonderful minuet and a great finale. One of Haydn's greatest symphonies. The third symphony here is No. 29. It is hard to believe that this very beautiful symphony is so rarely played or recorded. At the very low Naxos price, this CD is an exceptional bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This product stinks, I spent time sanding down a queen size headboard and I have put two coats of this rubbish on and it's still only about 60% of the shade of what it's supposed to be on the can. It's totally unforgiving with regard to blotchiness, streaks and drips. It is certainly not a time saving product in fact it's completely the opposite, I would have been quicker using a penetrating stain and three coats of poly.

Do not touch this stuff with a bargepole!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blotchy and Uneven...","review":"Like the previous two negative reviews, I had the same experience. Contrary to what the reviewer who positively used this item stated, we DID use the pre-stain treatment recommended by Minwax and still had a terrible time with this stain. It is incredibly splotchy despite multiple different techniques we used to apply it. I had a feeling this product was too good to be true, and I was right. I would highly recommend taking the extra time and money to buy a can of good quality stain and a can of sealant. It is well worth it to not attempt to make this shortcut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap lazy route for a cheap finish","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!I do LOTS of projects and I am a big fan of minwax stains but I don't know what they were thinking in making this product. I was skeptical when I bought it and for good reason. It's not like staining and poly-ing is a hard job, but combining the two equals disaster. It is IMPOSSIBLE to put on evenly and you will work yourself to death only to be still disappointed in the finished product. People who rate this product high obviously have no idea what good finished products look like. I was an idiot. I said, \\"hey, I can cut some time and effort by buying this stain+poly\\". Bad idea.

It made this reader wonder why anyone would fear vampires at all! Indeed, there are characters in the book who welcome the opportunity to be hunted by this breed of vampire. The author appears to be a bigger fan of furniture than the paranormal/supernatural. So why two stars? Somewhat interesting use of historical background in describing Desmond's past generations.

I'm a sucker for both love stories and the supernatural (big X-files fan!) and I definitely reccomend it to anyone who feels the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money ...","review":"Don't waste your money or time with this DVD. This is like a home video poorly made. The DVD is like Master Odo is trying to teach a class of Kobudo. I have to be fair with Master Odo because I don't know him. Due to his age, the techniques are poorly executed. The students that were trying to follow him, even though they have a blackbelt on, but judging from their stances and movements, they seemed like they are at a beginner's level. You won't learn anything from this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odo Sensei was great - DVD is not","review":"Don't waste your money. This DVD should have never been made. It should have remained a personal treasure for whoever made the tape. Odo Sensei was not in his prime and the angles are poor moveover, the other karateka on the DVD, just don't have a clue. Who trained them????? Save your money and learn karate from a local Sensei near you."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEKICHI ODO KARATE KOBUJUTSU","review":"A historical treat for anyone who fallows the late Grandmaster.

But the material here presented is lousy at best, and, like much of what is taught in Brazil on knife combatives, nonsense fantasy. Knowing that there are better material in Brazil concerning the subject than what is actually being distributed and made available abroad, I'd advise you to keep your money with you. Better times will come, eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but...","review":"This product does exactly what it is supposed to do but I've found that a 2\\" strip of hockey tape does the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUCH a great product","review":"This product works so well! Unlike the small plastic silencers, that fit poorly and often fall off after limited use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit using","review":"I bought this mainly as a means of insulating the metal tags on our dog's collar from the electrodes on his electric collar when I put it on. I only put the electric collar on when he is in the yard. It worked for that but I have discontinued using it. Even on our 35# dog it is is bulky and he repeatedly was able to get it in his mouth to start chewing it. If you must use something I think tape would be a better and much cheaper solution.Bought directly from seller. Experience was positive. At my request they made last minute color change, confirmed this by Email and still shipped the same day. Shipping was free, unlike Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of trimmers","review":"I have a set of these I use in my beauty shop..I LOVE it...it uses one AA battery and lasts quite awhile..I use it for trimming neck lines, ears and eyebrows.

I used it as per manufacturer's instructions. I checked that the batteries worked. This item \\"feels cheaply\\" manufactured and I would not recommend it to anyone. I ended up returning it to the manufacturer for credit towards a more expensive model that charges with a cord, and have been using it ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery killer.","review":"Cuts very well. Nice and sharp! Its small size makes it great for travel, but not so good for regular use because after every 2 or 3 uses, I have to change the battery. It eats batteries so fast, you can hear it slowing down the moment you start using it. You'll do much better to get a rechargeable one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work","review":"Took it out of the box, put the battery in, didnt switched on.

Most of the topics he covered would be a bore to read by itself but Gould masterfully entertains & educates with his adroit prose & humorous side comments.It is a bit on the long side and some of his comparisons used fads of the early 90's which are not relevant today; but all in all, the book is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gould's Seminal Work","review":"Stephen Jay Gould's writing is always fascinating and this book was equally engrossing.

I have been patiently waiting for the band to release \\"The Dark\\" and I haven't missed a Chicago show since I first saw them jam.Mark this album down as a strong buy and be sure to catch a live performance if you can. You will be impressed by their strong vocals and unique sound. This record would be a five star production if the band had better songwritting."},{"rating":"1","title":"not soo fun","review":"This game was cool at first but then it started to get boring. You just wake up in the morning and go to school. You get to have a job but you can't see yourself doing it at all. You just shop and talk to people. It's a waste of time. You can't have a real boyfriend or actually do something like if you ask a friend to go to the pet shop, 2 seconds later the game says \\"went to pet shop\\" The things that you buy for your room like the TV, video game console, or DVD player, u can't even use! It's soooo boring. You do the same things every single day. Soo if you're planning on buying it... it's not a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I was really excited about getting this game BUT, when I finally got it was really fun at first but after 10 game days I realized you just keep repeating the same things over and over and over, it got REALLY BORING.

Plus you also get to make your own Best friend so you can talk about boys and your crushes I higly recommend this game if you want something like the sims but cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy- review by an 11 yr.old","review":"This is a great toy but I don't see how it is educational. I got this for Christams and it is fun, you get to make your own character and pick out clothes. Doing the chores isn't educational because all you do is click on it and *tada* it's done with some money to reward you for all that *hard* work. The job doesn't really matter in the game besides the fact it gives you money for nothing is great because who really wants to spend time doing work? I do have a question: How do you get a crush or boyfriend? Some of the clothes are a little pricy but, are really cute. Whoever said it was a battery eater and uses up all the batteries in one day must have weak batteries because I have been playing for three days and haven't needed to change my battery. I recommend you purchase this. It is great for girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter found this game boring","review":"I bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday. After playing the game once, she asked me if I could take it back. She said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game. My daughter has always played a lot of \\"simulated life\\" video games (i.e., the Sims, Animal Crossing) and online games (i.e, club penguin). I suspect this is why she found this game limiting. Other games that she has played portray a more intricate \\"life\\" and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree. My advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this. If your daughter has no experience in these types of games, this game will probably be fine. However if your daughter has previously played simulated life games, she will probably find this one lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy is ok","review":"i bought this toy for [...] 2 days ago. I didnt listen to my cousin when she said that at first the game is fun but then it gets boring. You dont even get to see the actions or go to your sports tournaments. The sims are so much better because you can actually see what they do. I couldnt even buy the computer and cell phone because i needed permission from my parents they never said i could get it and i nevereven saw them! well if you want to buy this buy it but wait until the price goes down"},{"rating":"1","title":"The toys no Dream Life","review":"At Christmas I recieved the toy, because I wanted it so much I hooked it up to my TV and played it. First of all when you go to school it just says \\"went to school\\"!! Yoou don't learn anything by playing this game. When you do a sport you just click it and says \\"practiced sport or won tournament\\". You can go shopping at the mall like 8 stores and when your closet gets full you have to sell stuf!!!!!! You can only play to different games on Dream Life and then you have to delete them. You also can't have a real boyfirned you just have boys that like you. And when a friend asks you to go to a party and you say yes you don't actually go, same with school dances. This game was like fun for the first 3 days after I got it, but now I don't even play anymore. You should not by this game i isn't fun and it costs to much. Please take what I said into consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't wait!!","review":"well... i get this toy in about 2 weeks or so and it looks much fun for starters you do things you can't do in a few years example:dye hair,make-up, go shooping on your own,boyfriends and so on and so on when i get my system i will pay 24 hours 7 days a week i hope that every girl will buy this toy it's so cool and so real!!ps:from a girl that can't wait!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun for 1 kid at a time.","review":"I purchased the Cosmo Girl for my 8 and 10 year old daughters and I did not like it at all, so we returned it and we bought the dream life. This game is so fun - they get to create their own look and buy clothes (good for educational purposes) They chat with friends, get a job, etc. The only bad thing is they can only do it one at a time - it is kind of boring for the other child to watch. Overall it was well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once","review":"This is not very intresting. I only used it a few times and i got it for my birthday.

Some reviews say it's a great interactive program and then others simply say it's crud. I think that someone who actually has played the game and just wants to explain the ups and downs of it should be writing an reveiw soon, instead of 20 excited tween girls my age saying that they \\"reeeeeeaalllllyyyy\\" want it as a gift. Do you follow?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't work at all...twice","review":"I bought this for my daughter's 8th birthday. She was so excited. Put the batteries in, hooked it up to the TV and....nothing. Changed batteries, reset it a few times, got the splash screen then it just froze up again. Repeated attempts resulted in us getting as far as the main selection menu , then it would frizz out again. I returned it, got another and got the same result.

She was so excited, she ripped the box open and ran downstairs to play. After 30 minutues she said, \\"I don't understand the reviews we read on Amazon, there is nothing to do in this game.\\" You don't really \\"go\\" to school and there's nothing to \\"learn\\". The game just says, \\"you've been to school.\\" No lessons, no nothing. It's been 30 minutes and she wants to return it already.I'm not surprised. I actually think the first 20 reviews on here must have been written by Hasboro employees. Parents beware! Unless your daughter is from the stone ages and has never seen a video game, this game will bore her to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Really Is A Dream Life!","review":"I had to buy it with my own money, but I love it! You create a dream you, create your room and your best friend. You can sign up for activities, go to the mall, go to your bff's house, go to the salon, and go to school. There are parties and dances. You get a lot of money for doing chores, though. This game teaches you that you have to work to get money and that homework and tests are important. This game may freeze sometimes, and I do agree it should be more like [...]$.

I think the clothes are more decent than expected(I don't think I ever once saw a miniskirt) and it has rewards for doing good things. I only played about two hours and earned my own phone!

They are suggesting that it's perfectly normal for girls to take part in virtual activities (making friends, extracurricular activities, going to school, playing sports) when they should be taking part in these activities in their REAL LIVES.PARENTS: PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING and encourage your children to make their dreams come true within their REAL lives. This may mean giving up some luxuries like having them appear the way YOU want them to (their \\"dream\\" may be to dye their hair blue) but if it means that they will GO OUT INTO THE WORLD and BE THEMSELVES and try their best and not sit around on the couch all day, IT WOULD BE WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN."},{"rating":"2","title":"uuuggghhhh","review":"ok people who think its gross to have a boyfriend, thats just stupid.

But hopefully, I will find out more by reading the other reviews!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream life game...pretty good so far","review":"I purchased this game for Christmas for my 9 year old daughter and she loves it.You have to pick a name for your character and also get to design everything from her skin tone and hairstyle to how you want her room to look. You also get to create her personality.During the game you can meet friends, do chores to earn money so that you can buy clotehs and nice things for your room. You also have the chance to join activities.The only drawbacks to the game IMO are the graphics aren't the greates (I'm so used to PC games).Also your person doesn't really get a chance to do much.

It's not perfect, but for the price it's very good. It's lovely to hold and operate, especially with the BP400 battery grip attached. Knobs and buttons are well-placed and easy to operate.I'm not going to go over all the things I like about the camera. Instead I'll point out the few things I think could be better:- An LCD that would swing out to the side, and tilt up and down more (like on the A200). Some times it would help me take shots easier if I could move the LCD around more.- Less noise at higher speeds. At 400 the noise is trouble some and at 800 it's not very nice at all. Although this is pretty much the same as with comparable cameras.- Faster and more accurate autofocus in low light. Again, many cameras suffer from this, but when there is little light, the A2 doesn't focus very well. Luckily manual focus is pretty good, but you can't always use that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am surprised and disappointed with amazon.com","review":"I have been a customer for many years, and never has amazon not delivered what they promised This product was advertised as one would recieve all of the product shown in the ad.

I had to sent my almost new A2 to Minolta repair center in NY, and it has been waiting for repair for over 4 weeks!Their service center is the only one in the US and it seems they don't even have spare parts to fix A2's. They have been waiting for ~4 weeks just to get some spare part and all they can \\"guarantee\\" is up to another 4 weeks of repair time! I am wondering if I am just unlucky or other A2 owners shared the fate. With all the respect to many possitive reviews I have seen for A2, I will never buy Minolta again because of their service. It's not exactly a cheap camera to get such a poor support.There are other A2 users reporting problems with this camera (just google Dimage A2 problem), so maybe it's anot an accident and Minolta has some production quality issue with A2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for serious photographer","review":"If you are interested in taking black-and-white photographs for creative photography, A2 is the perfect choice!

Almost all of them are compared (usually negatively) to the author's hometown system of New York. The two systems that received the greatest complaint from the author are Chicago and Toronto, Chicago for having a low proportion of subway mileage in its total, and Toronto for not having express tracks. The pictures in this book are mostly from the last 20 years (although little effort was made to identify when in that time the pictures were taken) and are generally fairly limited in their variety. In all I was somewhat disappointed with this book; good thing it was inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"World Subways","review":"Really enjoyed the good overview of the subways of the world.

These Dewalt glasses are well built and comfortable but the magnification areas of the lenses are in the wrong location for my liking. They are situated too low and not large enough. They would be ok if all you were doing were reading a book, but when working in an industrial control cabinet or on a laptop, they are unsuitable. For example, the keyboard is in the magnification area but the screen is not. I will instead look for a pair that magnifies over the entire lens. The protective sleeve that comes with these glasses works well.October 2011 update: I have purchased a pair of VS Eyewear, clip-on 0.75x full-lens magnifiers to clip-on to these Dewalt safety glasses. A bit bulky, but it works.

My work takes me to the production floor of various manufacturing facilities. I have found it difficult and in some case's a safety hazard performing normal things such as going up and down stairs. For me, the \\"magnifier\\" part of these safety glasses is too high. Unfortunately they do not have an adjustable nose bridge or temple setting. So in order to get the magnifier area low enough I need to put them much lower on my nose, which in some sense defeats the purpose of wearing safety glasses in the first place. Another complaint is that the inside edges of the lenses stick out slightly further than the rubber nose piece. After a couple of days of use the bridge of my nose was sore. On the positive side the quality of the lenses are good and had no issues with the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"Nose pads are serrated and bite into your nose.

He is a carpenter by trade and has been using regular reading glasses instead of safety glasses for about a year. He thinks they're great. And the DeWalt name just makes them better. They came with a pouch, but that was lost within a day. He keeps them on a sport eyeglass holder that he wears around his neck at work and when he's doing tasks around the house. He's had them several weeks and they have no scratches on them. I know they get abused, so I think the product is great. Even if I have to get him a few pair per year, they are worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bifocal safety glasses","review":"I now own several pairs of these bifocal glasses, both clear and sunglasses. They work well as safety glasses, and I like the sunglasses for regular use as well, especially for driving. It's nice to have good wrap-around type sunglasses and you can also clearly see the dashboard. Like most safety glasses, they will get scratched up somewhat in the shop and when doing construction work, especially when doing gritty-type work, like concrete or tile sawing and setting. If you take special effort to clean them often in running water, this will extend the usable life substantially.The one failing is that the rubber nose pieces can slide off if you're not careful. Don't loose them down the sink drain.

Think about it, 360 million plus sales with ABBA and a few million more under her own name, no other female singer comes close. So being very familiar with Agnetha's voice I wasn't really sure what to expect from this solo album but I wasn't disappointed. Certaintly the material isn't as good as what she recorded with ABBA, but the voice and production is still there. Her soaring vocals and high range sound as superb as ever amongst a wide variety of styles. Stand out tracks include the title track, Stand By My Side, Can't Shake Loose. Definitely well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best....","review":"Agnetha sure know hows to sing, doesn't she? Personally, I like Frida's voice better, but I think her vocals for ABBA were fantastic, and also on this album, she sings very well. However, the songs selected for her first after-ABBA solo album do not interest me at all. Maybe it's because they sound so old-fashioned and somewhat childish to me. I often play ABBA and Frida, but Agnetha's solo work remains unplayed. Too bad, as she's a great singer. I recommend Voulez-Vous by ABBA for Agnetha's best songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agnetha sounds great, but the songs do not","review":"Agnetha sure know hows to sing, doesn't she?

Example: Total Eclipse of the Heart. I would love to hear her rendition of that song and others that she could reach. When the songs were being recorded more emphasis should have been on Agnetha rather than the instrumental. I purchased the album to hear Agnetha sing, not be over whelmed by the instrumental. Also I wish she done some of the songs in the ABBA mode. Being as I am a sucker for her, I still believe Agnetha is and was one of the best female singers ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agnetha at her worst","review":"Okay. Agnetha's first album was number one in UK or whatever, but I think that this is just another Abba album ...I love the catchy song: I Can't Shake Loose (No 65 UK), Wrap Your Arms Around Me (No 45 UK), Man, and Take Good Care of Yor Children. After this album, Agnetha produced some better work which were never released as a single in UK. A very disapointing album, and it was recorded with an excellent producer-engineer too quickly (from the first recording to the release was 5 months!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good start...","review":"The album was pretty good, but to compare it to ABBA... makes it a lot less attractive. But I'm sure Agnetha worked hard on it and gave it her all. I'd like to say that the song The Heat Is On is one of the ugliest of Agnetha's so I don't know why reviews on the net say it's good or even the best??? I think that people will agree with me that the love songs are all this album has to offer. So if you hate love songs, stay away from this one. The rock songs are a poor attempt... But I love love songs so I liked it. But all songs have an old sound. Personnaly, I liked the second and third better.

It simulates a club appearance. Backing is provided by Lasse, Mats and Rutger. The songs are The Heat Is On, Can't Shake Loose, Wrap Your Arms Around Me, I Wish Tonight Could Last Forever, Mr. Persuasion and Shame. Agnetha emerges from the warm and safe cocoon of ABBA, a radiant butterfly spreading her wings in the sun. I waited seven years to see this show. It was rain in the desert. Wrap Your Arms Around Me is plaintive and sensuous. Agnetha is an angel in a blue dress. I Wish Tonight Could Last Forever is my favorite. There is eye contact in Mr. Persuasion. Sexy! She shakes her hair! She chastises us in Shame, shaking her finger. \\"Naughty boy!\\" She expresses herself so well in song. Her style is marked by distinctive phrasing, predictable trills and pauses. Every gesture is in harmony with the lyrics. Agnetha soothes the savage beast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor rendition of the lovely concerto","review":"[Note: I have the SACD version, which is identical in its program as this regular CD version]This is Nishizaki's 7th recording of the famous Chinese violin concerto -- and of the five recordings from her I've heard, the worst. The pace is too slow, and, unlike in her previous performance, Nishizaki did not employ techniques derived from the Chinese instrument erhu, techniques necessary to give the concerto the perfect blend of East and West. Her playing sounds almost perfunctory, disinterested, lazy. The orchestra does a fine job, but since this concerto is all about the soloist, the performance sucks.Breiner's 8-piece suite based on Chinese melodies from the Silk Road is disappointingly banal and nothing more than an album filler.I only give this CD 2 stars because the concerto is so beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Book","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated book with a well written story, but that's not the only reason to buy this book.

They continued making albums, but the music publics taste were constantly changing, and Manfred MAnn's music was left in the way side.But in 1986, The Band came out with an effort that is unbelieveable to the ears. This album should have put Manfred Mann back on the map, but sadly they didnt have the push from a major reord label to get them noticed. This album is full of energy, and is complimented from the vocals of Chris Thompson, who sang on Blinded by the Light.

This is not a manual or reference book that you can consult for simple directions on correcting grammar or streamlining sentences. Instead, the authors examine the fundamental questions that underlie the stylistic choices we make. (For example, what is the nature of truth? what is the relationship between language and the truth?) The book focuses on the style they call \\"classic prose,\\" but they also describe (and give both good and bad examples of) other prose styles, and they are honest about the shortcomings of classic prose and the situations when other styles are better suited to the purpose of writing. The book would be more useful if there were more direct discussion of how specific surface features of an example relate to the author's philosophical stance, but it is a rewarding and thought-provoking text that may well change how you think about writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stuff.","review":"Contrary to what another reviewer said, most of the book is indeed written in the Classic Style, and it does in fact tell you how to write in it, at least to the degree that that is possible: it tells you the mindset that must underlie it. Any writing consistent with the classic prose mindset, crafted according to its assumptions, must perforce be classic prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Example of How NOT To","review":"This book is puzzling. It's a contorted read that breathes platitude after platitude, but does more to demonstrate how to write obscurely than with clarity. At first, I thought the book was a satire, deliberatly using ambiguity, the absence of punctuation, and the lack of clarity to make its points. But, that's clearly not the case. The authors seriously believe they are about making \\"truth\\" clearer, but then fail to make a single argument to support any of its propositions. This is one of the worst books on style and clarity I've seen. Not only is it superficial, but its grammatical and syntactical mistakes are glaring. Do the authors know anything of punctuation? IF they do, they don't show it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great functional item","review":"This device has a nice sturdy design.

I can not believe that the Judge could out compile that first album of the Clubbed series, but he has definetly done it this time. The first CD is a hard house and big beat annual. There is this \\"Monkey Lover\\" track on there that you cant help but get up and shack your arse too!! Also, Mauro Picotto helps out with 2 of his own tracks on it and a one from his group. The second disc starts out pretty trancy with tracks like 10 in 01 by \\"Members of Mayday\\"....Nick Warren's group, and Tall Pauls latest work \\"Precious Heart\\" the INXS dub!! After about 8 or 9 great trance anthems the Judge gets hard again and ends the compilation on body moving hard dance note!!!

The main reason is when you select play it plays the first episode and ONLY the first episode OVER AND OVER AGAIN!! Even if you select Part A of another episode it goes right to the first episode once again. In order to start the next episode you have to go to thr episode list and select Part B and rewind it to the beginning of the episode. TERRIBLE BOX SET!

I still play and I watch the diamond and pearl whenever it comes on. I missed the first few (5) seasons of pokemon on tv, so I started a collection of dvds(this being the first.) The episodes are great but the menu lacks special features and there is no japenese track. I always have to keep the remote in my hand because the theme song comes on twice an episode (and if I want to skip through the team rocket intro that appears in every episode.) The cases of the three dvds feel very flimsy and breakable. The outside cardboard is nice though and you dont get a dvd for its case so thats nothing to complain about. Seeing the episodes in order was great and if you're a fan of pokemon I suggest that you go to walmart, or any other store, and get these episodes today."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay!","review":"I was completely obsessed with Pokemon when I was a kid.

Shame on you, Amazon, for flat-out lying to your custsomers. Had I known only the English track was available, I would have never preordered it.

The first half is ridiculously out-dated and over-acted. In fact, it is hard to watch. I kept thinking it would get better, or I kept hoping it would speed up through the ridiculous parts- but the ridiculous parts were the whole first half and it did not speed up. The second half concentrates too much on the little daughter and there is too little of Shahrukh. It also went on and on. Although this movie was a big success when it came out, I would put it at the end of my list for watching - even below \\"Yes, Boss\\", if that is possible!!

Will know that in a week or so when I finally hook up the rest of the speakers.Now the bad: The video is terrible! The picture quality is grainy throughout the movie. This is worse than DVD quality.

Why the hell couldn't the mom have just adopted when she knew pregnancy complications would result in her death? I dunno, in a country with loads of orphans I can't see any harm in taking one in...

The book is nothing but generalities or suggestions the average investor can not use.

To be honest, I couldn't even finish this book! To begin with, I never felt love between Cole and Jonet. Lust, you bet, but love, tender and sweet, not for one moment.Then there was a deeply disturbing sex scene. When Cole tells Jonet \\"I'm going to tie you to the bedpost and give you the ( ) you've been begging for since the first time I laid eyes on you\\", I felt ill. Yuck. It gets even worse when the heroine thinks: \\"To her undying shame, a little thrill chased up her spine and out of her mouth.\\" Double Yuck. But then when the heroine begs Cole to continue with the degrading treatment, I couldn't take anymore and tossed the book across the room.I read romance for ~romance~, not to see women degraded. I can honestly say that I will never again purchase a book by Liz Carlyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apallingly bad","review":"Cole as a hero is easily the most dull man anyone could ever have the mistfortune to meet in a romance, and Jonet is a cow of the first order. She wants to have sex with him but doesn't trust him and is a most unpleasant person right the way through the book. Even her love for her sons does not redeem her.As for the supposed villain of the peace, the whole thing is so flimsy and ridiculous as to be totally unbelievable, and ayone with half a brain would know her and Delacourt's secret. A light read for people who really don't care too much about anything other than plot.The violent SM Bondage scene is really totally out of keeping with character and is not in the least sexy. In fact the book has about as much sizzle as a damp firework. Her debut novel was good, this was appallingly bad. She breaks the basic rule of any good writing, show not tell. She gives details about her characters and situations with all of the pompousness of Dickens and none of the flair or interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"shrew does not equal strong...","review":"I find it amazing that so many romance writers seem to feel it necessary to have \\"strong\\" female heroines behave as shrews. There was not a soft bone or emotion in Jonet's body. Cole, our hero, is a sweetie of a man. Hunky, admirable, noble, he realy is all a hero should be but why, oh why, would he even be interested in Jonet? Geeze, she throws temper tantrums, things at him? Yuk...get real. What a bore of a novel. I have yet to figure out why so many romance readers think that women who nag and are shrews to be strong. Poor Cole - doomed to a life with her. He deserved far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite the intense couple...a fun and emotional ride","review":"The sparks fly from the outset in this early offering from Liz Carlyle. Widowed Captain Cole Amherst is a scholar, a former curate and an ex-soldier (what a combo!) who comes to tutor the widowed Lady Jonet Mercer's two boys. He's tightly wound and she's wound up, and there's a bit of a class difference, but they have clearly met their match. Ultimately, Jonet is the wiser of the two. She realizes she must take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and move things along with the reluctant Cole. The resulting love scenes are very touching and funny, but a little less erotic and more hard-edged than in her later books. There's also some danger and a murder mystery thrown in, but mostly this is the story of two deserving people offered a second chance at love. Nicely done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More! I just want more!","review":"It's hard to believe this is only Liz's second book! I just want MORE books to read by her! She writes with such passion & feeling that you are in love with her characters from the first pages.Jonet & Cole are wonderful, their feelings for each other are there from the beginning & they take you along for the ride of your life. I'm generally not a mystery reader but Liz's ability to mix romance with mystery has made a fan out of me. I resented each & every thing (like work & family) that took me away from this book! The children are touching & believable, the mischief they get into is delightful to read, you have no trouble imagining the looks on their faces as they plot & plan the next prank! This book kept me on the edge of my chair from the beginning. Cole is a blonde hero to die for & you'll be in love with him just as Jonet is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, but only a lust story...","review":"That about sums it up.A disappointing read for both the \\"love\\" story and the mystery. The mystery I figured out the first time the \\"villain\\" was introduced, the love story was nonexistent. Both h/h disliked/hated each other through most of the book, yet lustful thoughts (which the author makes us privy to ad nauseum) abound.I could buy that Jonet & Cole wanted to screw each other senseless; what the author NEVER made me believe was that they loved each other.Also, I like strong heroines as much as the next person, but Jonet was just a plain witch. A grown woman throwing temper tantrums? Please. Tossing any object not nailed down and attacking people with riding crops does not denote strength--just hysteria, arrogance and lack of self-control.I will say the hero was a likable fellow. He deserved a better heroine--and a better story."},{"rating":"2","title":"As simple as his films","review":"I found two volumes of this \\"Conversations With Filmmakers Series\\" at a university library in Japan, and as soon as I could, I bought both for my personal library: Jim Jarmusch and Peter Greenaway. The reason: I think that, if you do a map of contemporary filmmaking, the North Pole and the South Pole would be these two gentlemen. Everything else is somewhere in between. I don't know if any of these two directors is actually so clear, so witty and so self aware, or if it is just good editing work, but very few times you'll find books of film criticism to be so insightful, so revealing and yet, so simple.

Money hasn't changed this family, there's no one upping or trying to keep up with the neighbors or showing off. Nope just good old family who love one another.

The look is pretty stylish, especially considering sweatpants are typically not considered as such. The outside is somewhat shiny/smooth, not like your everyday sweats. There is no elastic band on the bottoms, so they hang loose and dug hug your ankles. The inside is fleece, so I personally wouldn't use these to workout in, as I feel it'd be too hot. But that's just my preference. I generally wear them when it's too cold for shorts and I'm too lazy to wear jeans.One word of advice: Don't be a dope and run them through the dryer! Clearly not paying attention, I threw two pairs of these into the dryer after washing them. Result: Two pairs of medium men's sweatpants now fit for a small child. Looks like I'll be buying a few new pair come fall..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for Boyfriend, he loves them.","review":"I bought these for my boyfriend who's in the army and he loves them, every time i'm with him, he's wearing these.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"While awaiting this recording on CD","review":"I've not played this in awhile as it is on vinyl, but I remember it quite fondly especially No Eye Communication.This was the second album produced by Mark Mundy Miller, which when new Marianne regarded Broken English as emotion in the basement, this as being emotionally on the first floor. Marianne in late interviews, while agreed that It was a cheerier album than \\"Broken English\\", was quite vocal in her dissatisfaction with the sessions and the finished album and regarded Miller as the perfect producer for Broken English, and the wrong producer for this and I'm kinda mystified why. I wonder what she thinks of it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"needle in the groove","review":"Wow, this is a real stink bomb. The band is bland--Steve Winwood was somewhere playing something, probably on Track # 6, because he shares the writing credit. No soloing at all from anyone. The lyrics make me want to down a bottle of Jack.It's just an attempt to capitalize on the success of \\"Broken English.\\" The sound is there but not the heart. (The genuinely talented) Marianne Faithfull would go on to make much better music than this.The only good thing about this CD is the cover. She kind of has that English public school \\"spank me\\" look about her. Use the CD as a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed","review":"Full contact fighting with no gloves or foot padding! I love allGeorge Alexander's stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings the past to life","review":"As a baby-boomer raised in this archtypical post-war suburb, I was engrossed by the hundreds of photos and informative captions that this book captures. The photos and schematics of the Park Forest Plaza, America's first planned post-war shooping center, were especially evocative. Seeing once again the throngs milling about the at the annual Art Fair, the Marshall Fields and Sears stores, and the Holiday Theatre in their heyday set off a flood of nostaligic memories.The only downside to this delightful book is the lack of any substantive text. That said, the president of the Park Forest Hisotrical Society, author Jerry Schnay, has done an excellent job of organizing and annotating this photographic record of our hometown's childhood, adolescence, and maturity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticks With You","review":"It has been three years since I read \\"Agent of Byzantium\\" and after reading many more books of the same genre, I regard this short book among my favorites (along with \\"Lest Darkness Fall\\", and The Belisarius Series). Turtledove combines intrigue, technology, warfare, romance, and of course, Byzantine politics to make a great collection of short stories recounting the adventures of an ancient James Bond character. My favorite story recounts how the Empire gets their hands on gunpowder. The femme fatale Parthian spy clearly seemed created to support sequels, of which there have been none ... which is my only dissapointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Alternate History Fun","review":"A great collection of seven stories set in an early fourteenth-century version of Earth where Islam is absent. The Byzantine Empire retained its eastern holdings and swallowed up most of western Europe as well. Their main rival is the Persian Empire which also never fell in Turtledove's well thought-out alternate world. The stories span 15 years in the life of Basil, a soldier and eventual \\"agent\\" (read spy) for the Byzantine Empire. Great fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1st rate story telling","review":"If you like the Eastern Roman Empire and would like to read some good make believe stories about it. Then get introduced to Basil and his adventures in this slim little book. It seems to me that the Author has a great love and grasp of the ins and outs of that old and somewhat ignored Empire. I also feel that this is when the Author has really hit his stride and it shows in this labor of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russian-American mystical aesthetics.","review":"Roerich, Nicolas. Shambhala. This is a collection of dispatches during travels in Tibet and the borderlands of the eastern Russian frontier by the Russo-American painter, poet and mystic which date from the late 20's and early 1930's. If you like Gurdjieff, Roerich will interest you. He believed that Beauty was a divine principle that could be used to transform the world.Though the central section did not hold my attention, the first chapters about a Tibet long gone were fascinating. This was partly due to Roerich's idiosyncratic spelling which cast a new light on the meaning of certain Sanskrit words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic performances at any price","review":"A wonderful collection of works for guitar and orchestra. Norbert Kraft has to be one of the best classical guitarists around today, and we should be hearing more from him in the future. Coupled with a bargain price, this CD is a must-have for any classical collection. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, just perfect I tell you.","review":"A beautiful collection of classical pieces. These perfect performances are incredible. I find it very impresive that Concierto de Aranjuez is played so well. It's a very difficult piece, trust me I have the music to it. Tracks 1 and 4 are my personal favorites. A must for any collector of any classical music and a great start for a collection. The concert is just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just in time for the holidays","review":"\\"The Art of Mingling\\" is a godsend! I dread parties as much as the next minglephobe, especially those boring business gatherings where the risk of seriously damaging your career outweighs any fun you might have. I read this book partly for advice, but also for laughs -- above all, Jeanne Martinet is a very funny writer. No one should leave home without this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the Pathetically Shy","review":"This book reads like Ms. Martinet's attempt to stretch a few sentences of advice into a 190-page book. A lot of it is useless fluff and can really be boiled down into the following: \\"Start talking to anyone you don't know but keep it light and non-threatening. If the conversation bores you, excuse yourself politely.\\" Everything else is just cutely worded examples of how to do those two things.If you are really paralyzed by the thought of meeting new people then perhaps this book can help. If you are like me, someone who doesn't fear socializing but looking to polish your skills, you likely will gain nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I am so glad that the author has given us an updated version of her book.I loved the original, and am enjoying this new edition just as much. Her witty and humorous approach to mingling is refreshing and amusing...and her techniques do work!!!She really makes mingling adventurous and fun. I have already used the \\" human sacrifice\\" technique several times at recent gatherings!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Time","review":"Very sad book. I was shocked that this author claims to be a master of mingling when at the end of the day she is a master at lying. She has little tips to lie about yourself to make yourself sound interesting, etc. I think anyone who starts of with this premise is destined for failure. Terrible. The publisher should be embarrased by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sammy Hoelscher's Review of \\"The Art of Mingling by Jeanne Martinet \\"","review":"I added this to my collection of books on CD and there is a lot of information she gives you, but it gets a little old quick. My favorites I will listen to a couple times a week while driving, but I only managed to get thru this one once."},{"rating":"1","title":"What everyone else said","review":"Basically bounce around with a completely false sense of who you are, tell stories that are completely untrue and lie to make everyone like you or at least get interested then quickly move on before they realize how fake you are or you become normal and unexciting. Worthless advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent exits","review":"I'm so glad the author included a lenghty chapter on various means of escape, because if I ever meet a group of people like the author, I will want to escape from them as quickly as possible.Also, avoid the audio version at all costs. It's painful to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Act Like an Airhead","review":"If you want to act like Phoebe from FRIENDS, then this is your bible. Otherwise, avoid it. The jist of this is lie, manipulate and generally behave like a ditzy deb. Oh, and it's utterly useless for even the most effeminate men. I honestly did not find even one thing in it's entirety that I could use, and as a business man and church security staff, I mingle constantly. If she ever got invited back to parties based on this behavior, it was probably for laffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and bad advice!","review":"This has some good advice but this also has some advice that I would consider to be very rude and antisocial. She said in the book that it is ok to LIE and spill food on people you do not like. What? That is awful advice!I would not suggest you read or buy this book for that reason. People who don't know any better may not be able to understand that the author is a bit on the eccentric side and doesn't have any real degree in sociology or interpersonal communication; therefore you need to be very critical of her advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only useful for the really challenged","review":"I do not look down on self-help books. Many people dismiss them as irrelevant because the advice they give is straightforward; but oftentimes we need straightforward advice, explained in sufficient detail for us to own up to it. Personally, I have often introduced useful changes in my life after reading self-help books that are by no means rocket science.Having said this, and lathough I am open to new ideas, I really regretted spending money and time on this book. I found absolutely no valuable insight in this book; as for the advice it gives, it is either completely obvious, or potentially risky. Some recommendations are really disputable. Furthermore, many of these tips are only suitable for women.Overall, the impression I get from this book is that it's an amateurish exercise from a rather superficial woman who likes cocktail parties. Several readers enjoyed its humor; I didn't. I definitely would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing........","review":"I expected more seasoned approaches to engaging socially. Many of the techniques given are cliche-ish, tired or \\"cute\\". If I had browsed the book, I wouldn't have purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome lines!","review":"I don't know why some people wrote such negative reviews on this book. I thought the \\"icebreaker\\" lines were some of the best I've ever read (for friendly icebreakers, not picking women/men up).It can be a little corny and a little dated in places but overall, this is a good book and I highly recommend it over the other \\"how to talk to people\\" books on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for those with true social disabilities","review":"Sure, the techniques are all proven; even the most dedicated introvert has learned most of these by college. If you're a fairly average person looking to improve your game, this isn't the place to go; you'll find nothing new. In fact, you'll find everything to be almost insultingly basic.If you truly have a challenging time with almost any group social situation -- and I'm not putting anyone down here, that describes some of my friends, but it's not the average person or even the person one standard deviation below average -- then you'll find this book has those tips that you find everyone else in the room knows, and you wondered how you missed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Talk 101: Practical & lighthearted guide","review":"Author Jeanne Martinet pens a playful guide to breaking ice and initiating small talk. These are useful social skills in settings that often make people feel awkward. The Art of Mingling offers a buffet of tips to choose from; graze at your leisure and try them out. Some are over the top and others are clearly designed just for women in mind.Not just for \\"social cripples\\" but for anyone looking to improve their communication skills in the art of small talk, a talent for which can yield a big impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was excited when I heard that a new book came out about the incident in Bhopal, but extremely disappointed in this book. It is a great story, written in a terrible style. The authors write as though they are anticipated a hollywood screenplay. Needless to say, this makes for an unconvincing storyline that never truly engages the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"if used no good","review":"all under the tank heaters become a fire hazard after being removed from a tank.

The only people this would be good for is those that do not have internet access. It is not comprehensive at all and the information could easily be obtained online and it would be alot more complete. I guess I'm not sure what I was expecting but I thought that it would be a lot more informative on how do deal with family issues and the like with having destination weddings which it does not.

Otherwise, obtain your information online, for FREE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful yet serene music.","review":"Any fan of the classical rock genre would be proud to own this CD. BJH bring to mind so many influences yet remain unique in a wonderfully positive way. In my humble opinion, there are no weak songs on this CD and the final track, \\"Suicide\\", is one of the most stunning songs I've ever heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal","review":"Barclay James Harvest is one band I came across by accident. I heard a song of theirs on the radio and their name stuck with me. I picked up this album and instantly loved it. Good writing, excellent playing and great voices. The string sound, a mellotron I believe, adds a very ethereal element to the songs. I just love the way the songs flow. They just seem to wash over me. This music soothes me and I believe it can do the same for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Price Around for a Excellent Product.","review":"My Red Ear Sliders aren't too picky about what they eat. However when it comes to a consistency Tetra's Reptomin sticks are the best. I tried others in large or bulk quantities and this one in my opinion, is best in food quality and consistency. I bought others and I get big clumps of sticks stuck together or product variations. The Tetra turtle sticks dissolve a little slower, giving my turtles more time to eat them whole. These sticks work great with my auto feeder, allowing more equal distribution each time it's on. My turtles are getting bigger so I had to buy bulk. Amazon has the best price around PLUS free shipping. At pet stores I've seen this 2 pound bag cost almost $50."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"The best food out there for the cheapest price.

Even though these pet supply companies keep making them...it has to be a money thing.

Supposedly I am supposed to kow tow to a deity who slaughters innocents for a \\"greater good.\\"All of the explanations about the problem of evil are circular and rely on biblical testimony. The Bible was written by Men and NOT by God. It is not infallible. Strobel cherry-picks the Bible--choosing what is to be taken literally and what is a metaphor for something else. If I were to believe even SOME of the Bible, I would have to conclude that God is at least partially evil in nature.I also have to say that the analogy of the bear in the hunter's trap is the most pathetic thing I have read in a long time.I can punch holes through all of the arguments presented in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative and inspiring","review":"this book guides the reader through some of the most troubling questions that has haunted mankind for ever. and afterwards i was left with a stronger faith and boundless hope.a definite read for skeptics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Start","review":"A good start to answering questions for those who question faith.

The book tackles, among other things, why God kills children. Specifically, why would God order the killing of children?The book gives two excuses for God's behavior. First, children are not really innocent (born into sin), so God is not killing an innocent person. Second, God gave everyone life so, in the same way that we can uproot the shrubbery in our own back yards, so God can kill us anytime he likes. He owns us.Only a Christian would find these answers satisfactory.

The first 7 have a lot of good scientific theory and philosphy, not enough to qualm all my lingering doubts, but good, especially taken as a whole. The last question, Can I be a Christian when I still have all these doubts and the closing chapter, the Power of Faith, are the gold in the book.The problem of doubt has vexed me in my entire time as a Christian, and is particularly painful right now as I face some personal issues. The chapter on doubt in Lee's book was both a comfort and a challenge to me: God loves me despite my doubts, and a challenge to seek out the rebellion in me that is the true source of the doubts. THe Power of Faith chapter motivated me to push past the doubts and simply decide, every day, or every hour if need be, that I have faith in God and I can trust Him with my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep disappointment","review":"I wanted CD's and received cassette tapes.

However, the arguments presented are not sufficient. All the chapters are based upon the existence of God except the first one, which does a poor job of making a case. Many arguments here are wrought with falacious reasoning, and circular arguments are a plenty. I do not need to point out them out for they are easily spotted, and some are even contained within the chapters titles. There is no real reason here to believe in God, or believe that Chrisitanity is \\"the true path.\\"The point that really pissed me off is that faith is never discussed.

I read this book in no time, telling me that either it was dumbed down to the lowest common denominator or it made absolutely no sense. For me, I understood what he was trying to prove, yet his solution didn't close the voids. Strobel brings up some very good issues, many of which are stumbling blocks for those who doubt.I do not recommend this book for someone seeking answers to their own doubts about religion/faith/God/etc. The evidence leaves a lot to be desired.

(Case for BS...!)","review":"I read this book and I am not at all moved by Lee Strobel's arguments (especially the ridiculous one where he justifies why good would send good people to hell). Strobel hides his fundamentalistic bible thumping Christianity in a so called scholarly way and tries his best to convice the read that the valid objections to the Christian faith can be overcome. He just made a greater skeptic out of me. I gave it 2 stars because at least it was presented in a scholarly manner and it convinces many christians and people who believe Jesus is the way to God. They all gave 5 star reviews.I am going to sell this book to a Christan bookstore and at least get some money back. It definitely wasn't worth my time. Lee Strobel needs to find a better way to spend his time rather than argue about the objections to Christianity. Why doesn't he volunteer at a local youth group.

While it does seek to answer immensely important questions regarding the Christian faith, it is not quite as engaging as its predecessor. Though the interviews are well done, I didn't get the sense that Strobel was involved in a personal quest in asking this set of questions, in comparison to the questions in his previous book. Additionally, this book focuses almost exclusively on claims that must be supported by philosophical arguments, such as the problems of evil and suffering. In contrast, _The Case for Christ_ included interviews regarding the medical evidence for Christ's crucifixion, as well as other, more \\"objective\\" approaches to establishing that Christ was a historical figure, and actually went through the things the New Testament claims he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient for deeper thinkers","review":"These are mild answers to people who have clearly not looked into these matters before. His basis is that Jesus is the only way to Heaven because Christianity is more \\"unique\\" and \\"straight-forward\\" than other religions. Even if that is true, it does not validate any claims made by Jesus. The biggest problems they run into is trying to answer the questions by simply citing evidence that supports their claims.

As a Christian trying to give an answer to that question to either a skeptic or another Christian is a tough one.

The author uses old tired apologetic arguments to bolster his case that, of course, Jesus is God and you should just shut up and obey. The mysteries of the Bible and God are just too much for a small minded human to comprehend so don't even try - its just God's mysterious ways.

As in his first book \\"The Case for Christ\\", he tries to portray himself as a skeptic and advocate of agnostics or \\"seekers\\". In fact, he is and was for both books a deeply religous man who had an obvious agenda for both books. Both books are strongly biased - the second book more so than the first. This would be OK if the author did not try to portray himself as balanced. Not one single person with an atheist or skeptics view is \\"interviewed\\". As reviewers have used the analogy of a \\"trial reporter\\", these books are comparable to making a court judgement based on testimony only from the plaintiffs.

Basically what the author did was go to a lot of people, theologians, etc, and ask them the difficult questions that keep people from accepting Christianity.

This is a very well written and researched book. I am very impressed with the quality and the style that Mr. Strobel uses. This is an excellent book for believers and new Christians. Skeptics should read this book as a basis for understanding the true defense of Christianity. Believers will be comforted and skeptics will find good challenges in the pages of this work.I do have one concern for the book. The section about Hell presents the \\"flames\\" as symbolic for the judgement of God and I see the \\"flames\\" as literal and part of the judgement.

If you are looking for a very good point and shoot digital with great photo quality, this IS your camera. As I've heard from my piano teacher, \\"Practice! Practice! Practice!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera","review":"I never had a problem with the battery latch... only thing is when I am turning it off and on, the lens squeaks when it comes out.

I purchased the extended warranty. The battery latch broke and they claim it is from customer abuse.

I have seen the same issue on other sites.<br /><br />I received this camera as a Christmas gift from my husband. It is an upgrade from my previous easy share. It is simple to use and takes great photos. The software is user friendly too.<br /><br />Big bang for the buck.<br /><br />I am just disappointed that piece broke. You would think a great company like Kodak would have had that problem figured out before they mass produced them. So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another broken battery latch.","review":"Batery latch broke just opening the lid to access the SD Card & Battery compartment. I sent it back to Kodak for fixing, but when it comes back, I'm returning it and getting something else.

I am a complete novice so I needed something \\"easy\\" but still wanted beautiful pictures, of course. I've had this camera for 6 or 7 years and have just one complaint. My battery latch broke also, and that's why I gave it 4 stars. It just broke last year though, so I've lived with it. Because of that, the battery compartment door would come open by itself at times and the battery would fall out. Really inconvenient because then you would have to go through resetting the time and date...etc.I took it on my recent honeymoon to Tahiti and you wouldn't believe the colors it captured. Absolutely amazing for a fairly inexpensive camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's great...if only the shutter button worked!!","review":"This is a wonderful camera, but, read on.Just over a year from purchasing this camera, the shutter button stopped working. I took it to a local camera store, who would not look at it; they wanted $225 before they would touch it. I then turned to Kodak, who wanted $135 just to look at it, or, for $199 they would take my camera and send me a \\"reconditioned\\" camera of a different model (talk about adding insult to injury; send me someone else's lemon!). Such a deal!! So, this really beautiful camera sits in a drawer.Kodak, what happened to your quality??!!

The visualization that Scott provided my very active imagination was fantastic and all I kept thinking was \\"boy... I hope they make a movie out of this and get an awesome director to direct it...\\" maybe the dude that wrote Lord of the Rings?....anyway...

I got the book in the mail and dove into it. 95% of the reviews I read gave it a 5 out of 5. Theres no way it could be bad right?? WRONG!I understand creating character development, I would rather have it than not. But for one thing if your gonna write a book about monsters don't wait 150 pages before you bring them into the picture. Second, when the monsters showed up. ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? They were so laughably stupid had I not paid 10 bucks to read this book and went through 150 pages I would have laughed hysterically. Their medicine balls with tenticles and they cary knives!

Now I have to pay to have it shipped back to the U.K. I tried to e-mail the shop where it came from but they don't take e-mails or phone calls, only orders.

Some of the humans Scott Sigler rights are more frightening than the monsters you can conjure in your mind. The story starts out simple enough, an old prospector hears about a place rich in silver but where no one will mine. What's a guy to do? Check it out of course. Enter a crooked business associate, greedy big business types, a biologist, an archaeologist and one mean ex-NSA agent and you have Earthcore. Let's just say there was more to that mountain than superstition, the stories about that place weren't just fairy tales, especially the ones about those that died. The employees of the Earthcore Corporation probably wished their bosses were less concerned about finances and more concerned about their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting read, and very highly recommended for all science fiction enthusiasts","review":"Earthcore is an exhilarating science fiction thriller in which Earthcore, a courageous mining company, determines themselves to be in charge of harvesting the world's largest platinum deposit ever discovered. Readers will follow Earthcore's young executive, Connell Kirkland, as he dives into the increasingly costly project as the three-mile-deep mine shaft becomes home to more then just platinum. An exciting read, and very highly recommended for all science fiction enthusiasts, Earthcore would be a popular addition to community library SciFi collections and documents Scott Sigler as an effective, entertaining storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular adventure!","review":"This book, all 600 pages of it, was one of the best novels I've read. Sigler mixes thrillers, adventure and alien invasions in an exciting page-turner.An archeological/mineral dig is the site for this story, and he keeps the thrills coming. Some odd typos detract, but only slightly, from the story. The novel reaches toward status as \\"The Great American Horror Novel\\". I recommend all of Sigler's work, having also enjoyed Ancestor as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so story, horrible writing.","review":"The story was okay. I bought and listened to the podcast version. I was disappointed with the writing. I found it distracting. The language used by the characters was unrealistic. (I spent four years in the infantry, and I would never have addressed friend, subordinate or enemy in the language these characters use. Can anyone say \\"Law suit\\"?) The overuse of bad similes was silly.Sigler is to be saluted for his imagination and his industry, but he might want to befriend an editor.As I listened to the audio version, I suggest he check on the pronunciation of his words as well. One example: The word is SUBsequent, not sub-SEE-quent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read.","review":"If you like a swift paced yarn with a sci fi / modern day spin, then Earthcore is for you. I enjoyed the pod cast and the paper book very much. Scott Sigler is a welcome addition to my library.I could see this as a decent movie or mini series as well. Earthcore II is coming, but I am not sure how well that will play out as the ending of Earthcore seems to close the doors on that possibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read!","review":"Mr. Sigler let's out all the stops on this entertaining thrill ride of terror and suspense.

I did not connect quickly with the characters, which is rare for me, although after about 225 pgs I did. Perhaps it's the time and the area that didn't catch me.

Alais was an enchanting character, and I felt transported through the times of her life as much as I did through time itself with the whole Alice/Alais link thing. Reviewers are right when they say there were a lot of unanswered questions,,, like how did Orianne know about the books at all in the first place? The \\"myth\\" of Mosse's novel doesn't knit together as a puzzle the way a Dan Brown novel does. But her character development was better, and her portrayel of the real, if imperfect, love of Guielleme & Alais was beautiful. But overall you have to hand it to Mosse for imbuing such a sense of love for the region and the Cathar history. Audric/Sajay was a bit one-dimenstional and boring, though I know the author meant his character to be compelling. The only characters that ended up to me to be compelling or piqued my interest were Alais, Guielleme, Will, Grace, and Espelamonde (sp?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to reading Labyrinth as it had come recommended by a friend and I am a devotee of the game Carcassonne. How disappointing! I thought the plot preposterous, the characters too one-dimensional (good or evil and no in between) and the writing sloppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Medieval Historical Novel","review":"Good story for lovers of French medieval history and specifically for those who have interest in the Albigensian Crusade. I recently visited the cities used for this novel's setting and was able to absorb the local history and culture. Kate Mosse's accuracy in depicting the culture, locales, and true medieval characters Trencavel, de Monfort, and others is accurate and most satisfying for both the historian and the lover of historical fiction. A very good read for lovers of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Scattered","review":"While the Da Vinci Code brought some long needed respect to the \\"sacred feminine\\", this book takes 5 giant steps BACKWARDS.Good premise, could have been an interesting, intriguing book - but I think it failed miserably.I didn't feel that the main character(s) commanded attention, and the flipping back and forth was tedious and distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and involved","review":"I am not going to regurgitate the plot or characters as that has been done sufficiently in other reviews.I enjoyed the recent spate of novels about Templars, hidden Christian codes, and the like. This book, however, droned on and on until its eventual conclusion and not that good a one at that. The use of of a foreign language was annoying and not necessary for the tale to progress and the constant flux between present and past was disrupting. It no way compares to the pace in Brown's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark: at once tedious and violent","review":"One of the few books of historical fiction I can remember that I do not look forward to picking up. I think I will finish it because I am thrifty and do not want to have wasted the money. The device of switching between times is neat, but the overall work is labored. The air of gloom and frequent acts of violence do not enliven the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I loved the Da Vinci Code and thought this would be similar, but I just couldn't keep with it. I would read some and stop and start I even skipped like 5 or 6 chapters to see if it got better and it didn't. There are much better historical fiction books out there than this if that's what you like. I do not reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good \\"girls\\" were so incompetent, I was siding with the bad!","review":"I listened to this CD, and I know the author spent probably years researching and writing this book, but the two sets of heroes, from the thirteenth century and the present, were so totally incompetent I yelled at them while listening, which must have looked very funny to people passing by. And Mosse waited until Disc 13 to explain who exactly the Cathars were and why the nasty French hated them. Both Alys and Alice were smart but so young and naive as to be beyond belief. They and their companions kept having their secrets stolen, being lied to and beaten up and rounded up and knifed and and and . .Enough already! If this is a feminist DaVinci code, give me rewrite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I approached this book with enthusiasm, based on all the hype. Unfortunately, I found a poorly executed version of what could have been a terrific story. Huge plot holes abound- what was with Alice's dream of being pursued to the cliff, wearing the yellow cross? If she was truly dreaming Alais' experiences, then the editor must have left this one out. I enjoyed reading about the Languedoc, and though the French/Occitan smatterings didn't bother me, having a child in 1209 say \\"Okay\\" absolutely did. Overall, long on possibilities, short on execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising, but.......","review":"The idea was promising, but I had a hard time muddling through all the MINUTE historical details (w/o explaining the over-all history), the overwhelming amount of french words, & the sudden changes from one character to another, (that I had a difficult time keeping straight anyway). Maybe if I knew the places and the history of that time in France as well as the author seems to, I might not be so confused; but, it was unknown to me & though I was interested, I had to ck other websites to try to understand the history period better. Also, there were gaping holes in many of the characters' motives and I still don't understand the ending. There were times when I thought the story was getting better, only to shift suddenly and leave me disappointed. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me out of this Maze!","review":"A pair of incredibly stupid women separated by time and re-incarnated, who are supposed to be the \\"good gals.\\" But they are so dumb as to be completely unaware of the plots around them. And the plot? To get the three book of the old, weird, ancient, and holy \\"Trilogy.\\" Which will lead the lucky person to the Holy Grail, which in turn allows them to, dare I say it? Live forever! Ah, that pesky Holy Grail is at it again. It will not stay lost or dead. And a word to Kate Moss, I am really happy you speak French, but most of us don't want to. And Watch out! As for our heroines, Xena and Gabrielle they certainly are not. This soap opera is basically Katherine Neville's \\"Eight,\\" but not as well traveled geographically, nor does it have funny cross-desert jaunt in a convertible by the two gals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm done with it. No more books by this author for me!","review":"I actually enjoyed the first couple of hundred pages of the novel. The character-development was rather slow, but the people in the book were reacting in ways that made sense. Then, in an effort to get the story from point A to point B, Mosse suddenly flattens the characters to two dimensions, forcing them to do things that are completely out of sinc with who they are. At that point, my reading rate slowed because I just wasn't that interested in picking up the book anymore.There were two unforgivable flaws, as I saw it. First, I could feel the writer's impatience to get to the end, in the way that she forced the plot for so much of the book. Second, she was lazy in checking for errors. I mean, when a character goes to sleep in a cottage, and then wakes up the next morning in a hotel, you've got to wonder.The story might have been good if a more mature writer had written it and more importantly, if it had had an editor worth the name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer read","review":"This is a great read, I live in the area which makes this book even more real.Dan Brown has nothing on Kete Mosse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, but execution didn't work","review":"I'm attracted to suspense and adventure thrillers regarding the Grail legend (and other religiously oriented thrillers). The reviews looked promising for this book and it started out well.But sadly the execution just did not work. The constant back and forth between present and past was jarring. The convenient name similarities were simply too convenient. And due to the past-present switching, the motivations and attractions of the characters just never develop deep enough for me to care about any of them. The only thing I did begin to care about was the south of France, which sounds wonderful and mysterious.Worst of all, the ending just did not make sense. I don't mind endings that are left open for the reader to wonder - but this just ended, with such vague descriptions and flat execution, that I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A-maze-ingly mediocre","review":"This preposterous mishmash of a DaVinci Code ripoff wastes the skills of a decent writer and the promise of a fascinating period of history. The first scenes, set at an archeological dig, are Crichton-level silly, but I was interested enough to keep reading into a pretty absorbing parallel plot set in medieval France. Mosse's skill and research shine in the first episodes of this plot, but soon her awful attraction for cinematic \\"action\\" kicks in and the whole thing degenerates into one far-fetched chase scene after another. Worst of all, she doesn't bother to extend her obviously extensive research into the period beyond daily-life details--we learn nothing about the Cathars or why anyone would want to kill them. Two stars just for interesting me enough in the subject to put this book down, unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I tried to like this book, I was very excited to read it with all the hype and reviews. It was so slow and boring. I started it over and over but could never get into it. I finally just gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patchy, with a good end","review":"This is a well written book, but I found the switching from one era to another every two or three chapters, rather like being interrupted by adverts on a good TV show - very disruptive.However, it is a good read, a captivating story and has a good ending. I enjoyed the last third of the book best.If you are not troubled by era switching you will love it. Otherwise, plough on, it will be worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long.","review":"This book could have done with being half as long, I had to force myself to finish it, as it was it left huge plot holes, was often tedious and went at a snails pace. It also left the reader with a load of questions, I still don't get what the grail really was, and if the books were so dangerous and brought only unhappiness to the people whose life they prolonged then why didn't someone sensible destroy them and prevent the deaths of thousands of people?I give this book 2 stars because the story itself could have been interesting if written differently. As it is it's farfetched and boring. If you want to read something good, go read the Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was pretty good","review":"I bought this book because I am hooked on grail legends. I loved the Da Vinci Code and I thought this would be somewhat like it. It's not and actually that was ok. Although it was a little slow at first it definitely picked up once you are about a third into it and overall I thought it was a very good read. Although it's not non-stop action like DVC, I thought it was a story that was very well told. I do have one small compaint, though... there is dialogue between the charcters in French that are not translated into English. I don't speak French so I was at a loss as to what the charcters were saying. Nonetheless, I would still definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tragic misfire","review":"Characters, concept, pacing, arc, structure, editing, pacing. This is MY subject, and I'd read nearly anything about it. I've NEVER put a book down mid-way. Till' this... what a sad, disappointing waste of months, reading aloud with my beloved wife, both of us actors, stuggeling in vain to breath understandable life into this messy tom. Editor, you should hang your head in shame... author, don't quit your day job. Sigh... trashbin. Grrr!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Books like this upset me; it upsets me because there are so many good out there and I was fooled into reading one that isn't. This is 500 pages of trite, clich��d, anachronisms. The book is a waste of time. There is zero character development, just uninteresting two dimensional characters doing the same thing seen in hundreds of television shows and movies. Labyrinth demonstrates a total lack of imagination.There are too many other great books in the world to waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not great","review":"Don't come to this book expecting the pacing of the Da Vinci Code. While it is not as clear cut or gripping as DVC, it is still entertaining.That being said, it is incredibly long and drawn out in the beginning, and the end is incredibly muddled. Again, not horribly so, but it is confusing and the reader is left in the dark about many things.If you are planning to read something weighty on a plane, this is your book. Of course, if you mind having some significant plot holes and confusing characters, go for it. Not a total waste, her descriptions of things are good and it is a fairly romantic book. But not exactly something that will win any awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"DaVinci Code meets Outlander and has an ugly child","review":"With the reviews this ponderous book received I was expecting something worth reading. I was disappointed and then some. The chapters were choppy and irritating. The premise is ridiculous. The characters were tiresome. Too complicated for a mindless beach read and too trite to enjoy otherwise. Many things about it irked me as you can tell. I guess the cover is pretty but otherwise a total waste of trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult read","review":"I'm halfway through Labyrinth and questioning whether I will bother to finish it. I wanted to like this book, but it has never really captured my imagination nor given me any reason to care about these characters. I wish I could explain (to myself) what makes one work of fiction so involving and so compelling and another so flat, even though both authors seem to be reasonably competent. This one just doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible,Terrible","review":"Back & forth 800 years difference,but still the story line sucked. The ending was impossibly stupid.Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it","review":"it's rare for me, but I couldn't finish this book. by page 150, I simply did not care at all about the characters or what was going to happen to them. I actually bought the book for my husband, who asked for it for his birthday, even though all I had to do was read the cover and realize he'd hate it. which he did--he stopped at page 150 too. Everything was incredibly predictable, the characters were one-dimensional (at best), and completely unsympathetic. The heroine(s) were the kind of women who only exist in ridiculous bodice-ripping romances, and, apparently, this book. typos were way too frequent, which makes me think they rushed this book out to ride on the coattails of the Da Vinci Code. Just bad. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought the book to read on a business trip to Toulouse with a chance for a quick visit to Carcassonne. Having always been interested in history, and wanting to read about the Cathars, I looked forward to reading this book. I was vastly disappointed. The plot is very badly executed, suddenly there is talk about the gral. The reader is not led towards finding out about the gral, there is no hints, no real explanation till the end. The idea behind the book is not bad, but the way the book is written was not enjoyable at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labyrinth is a Labyrinth of Characters and Story","review":"Labyrinth is a labyrinth of characters and story. There were too many characters to keep track of, especially considering the two main characters live several hundred years apart, adding to the confusion. Also, a good portion of the diaglog, names, etc. are in French, leaving me having to work way too hard. The extra work keeping track of everyone, every place and every thing would have been worth the effort had the story been exciting or interesting (i.e. Da Vinci Code). However, the story dragged on and on, and didn't really go anywhere. And, the final disappointment comes at the end....after forcing myself to finish the book, there is no reward, because no secret is actually revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other \\"Grail\\" stories are better","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It was bogged down in too much detail concerning the battles that took place and was otherwise disjointed and confusing. Your time would be better spent reading \\"The Eight\\" by Katherine Neville."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent read...","review":"I picked up the book, mostly for its sections dealing with heresy and such like stuff; I liked the historical aspect and how skillfully the author weaved between the two time periods. What I like is to learn from books, to discover new ways of living, and little facts I never knew before. In that aspect, this book was packed with information. What I didn't like was the present timeline. The historical parts from Alais's point of view were well-done, interesting, and fast-paced, whereas the parts from Alice's points of view (or Authie's, Marie-Cecile's, or Will's) were jumpy, annoying, and not at all interesting. The book so easily could have been shortened by 150 or so pages. But it was a decent read. Alais's scenes boosted the book's score from two to four, but if it had been completely her novel, it probably would have been a 5. Alice and her team just weren't interesting enough characters for me to want to read further. Only finding out about the past kept me reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through this.","review":"This book starts out good but just fizzles out. It didn't hold my interest at all. Too dry. I like to be inside a story, not outside looking from a distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"I read this book because I was told it was interesting and good. After the first couple hundred pages I was asking, \\"When does it get interesting and good?\\" 50 pages from the end I was still asking the same question.This is a story split in time. You are jumping back and forth between characters moving through time in a similar manner. Kate Mosse did a good job of getting both stories across. Alice, who is in some ways in both times, leaves much to be desired. She is supposed to be the strong female character that drives the story. That keeps the trilogy together. That answers all the questions. But, in reality she fumbles from place to person and around (in both times). She was not the strong character that was promised.In the end the story leaves more questions than answers and you will wonder, \\"Why did I just read that.\\" The Labyrinth, Holy Grail, or whatever it is supposed to be is never really decided on, you'll only see bits and pieces of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many twists and turns","review":"I have just finished this book and I can honestly say I really grew to like the characters and was left wanting to know what happens to them next. The historical facts appear to be accurate and are combined with the fiction in an interesting and exciting narrative. Although in some parts the editing was a bit off, mostly it is superbly written and the 2nd half really picks up the pace. Readers who are comparing this to the Da Vinci code are missing the point - this is an enchanting and intelligent story of love and loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointeless novel","review":"This book is pointless, overlong, under plotted, and is \\"much ado about nothing\\". Unidimensional characters trapped in a maze of nothingness. For me, it was a stupendous disappointment from start to finish.I kept reading it, expecting (hoping, really) about some kind of development or originality. I'd even welcomed silly plot twists! But you end up with plenty of descriptions of places and things (gotta fill those pages!) and pretty much nothing else.My only consolation is that I did not pay for it.STAY CLEAR OF THAT BOOKThanks.C."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"This book takes a while to get going and in my opinion you must love historical novels especially detailed and use of purple prose too but it is worth sticking with and the denoument is...... well read the book. I shall definetly read Sepulchre after this thank you Miss Mosse."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Story","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I found the two interwoven storylines, one past and one present, to be intriguing. I highly recommend checking it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MANY ADJECTIVES","review":"Two women are caught up in the same riddle despite being separated by 800 years of history. At the center of the mystery is a stone ring, a carving of a labyrinth, a cave with two skeletons and the Grail. Sounds like this would be a truly interesting read doesn't it? If you are a reader who enjoys voluminous pages of description interspersed with small bits of action....you will find it in this book. The jumps through time are clumsy and weaken the story, not to mention that far more questions are posed than are answered. If you have an interest in French history, this book may be to your liking, however if you like more action in your reads, than you should pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book for so long, and unfortunately I was disappointed. The narrative is so confusing! For the first 75% of the novel I was struggling to make sense of what was going on. It is one thing to try to create suspense, but it is entirely another thing to leave the reader in suspense of what is happening for over half of the book! Only towards the end did the novel start to become more descriptive in what was actually happening and who all the people were.I do see what the author was trying to do- with the skipping back between time periods and leaving each part on a cliffhanger- but unfortunately it was done to extremes. I was just so confused. I wanted to finish the book more to make sense of things than because I was interested in the outcome.However, one positive thing is the descriptions the author gives of the south of France- they are lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Wonderful","review":"I picked this book up at a train station as a way to pass the time. I initally had no interest in it, until i sat down and dedicated time to it.It is an AMAZING book. The switching between time periods is a bit confusing, and may cause you to re-read the last page (of the last chapter you read) a few times, but as it continues it makes things really click.It is a wonderful format for this book. I love it, and will keep it in my library as a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story still hasn't started","review":"I'm about 20 chapters into the book, and I'm still waiting for some kind of plot to develop. I understand the characters, I think, but there is no connection. There are two time periods involved, and there is no way to mentally connect the two at this point. I want to keep reading, but getting past the foul language, sexuality, gore, violence and finally the rape of a girl... and I'm done. I'd much rather read a story than be dragged along, made to endure details and events that have no application other than grossing out the reader. Good try, but no thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a good editor!","review":"Highly researched, but it feels like after an acceptable first draft the author ran out of time.

After reading several chapters devoted entirely to her point of view, it would be nice to know.I also found some of Alice's lapses infuriating and inexplicable. A cop gives her a message with a phone number and then is run over, and she doesn't think to call the number to see why he might have given it to her? Later that same number turns out to be connected to the missing Shelagh, and she still doesn't call it until she's outside the corresponding address?

It makes Dan Brown look high-class. Turgid writing style, hackneyed plot devices, characters with the depth and complexity of kitchen towels, deliberate obfuscation, and no real ideas behind it (not to mention historical and archaeological inaccuracies on just about every page). The writer notes in the acknowledgements that her grade-school son contributed plot lines and ideas - I find this entirely believable. I cannot imagine why anyone is making a fuss about this book.

And the so-called eternal life of specified Guardian doesn't make any sense to me. WHY Harif, WHY Sajhe? Why died finally? And the so-called Reincarnation nature which seems to be appeared in Alice herself but the story explained nothing and seemed care nothing about this kind of details.I appreciated the detail works on Cathar history and albigensian crusade.

The drama around these three, Cammie, Anna, Sam, Adam, Parker, and Ben (thank God for him!) is incredible.Absolutely perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in Black","review":"I love the A-List series, but this one wasn't the best. Although I did like the change of scenery from L.A. to Las Vegas, not much happened in the book. Also, I wish the secrets that were revealed were secrets that the reader didn't already know. However, I did like the development of the characters of Cyn and Scott. The ending was also good. This book probably deserves four and a half stars. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...What Happened To Django?","review":"I'll keep this short, not so sweet and to the point. I've read all of Dean's books up until this point and this is the very FIRST time where I couldn't finish one of her books in 2 days or less. I don't mean to suggest that book #5 was intellectually challenging, it just did nothing in the stimulating department. When I discovered that Django was absent throughout this entire book, I discovered something else...he's the only character that truly interests me. It's odd because even the books he does appear in, that appearance is shortlived, which only leaves you (or at least me) wanting more.Therefore, allow me to make one request to the author if she should decide to care what her readers really think....PLEASE BRING BACK DJANGO.*keeps fingers crossed* (It's alot safer than holding my breath)Signed,Somewhat Hopeful"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must\\" for all race car driver Jeff Gordon fans!","review":"Beckett's Jeff Gordon presents the notable young race car driver as observed through the words of Dale Earnhardt and fellow racers, packing in color photos of Gordon, his team, and race events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mid 80's roadkill","review":"This is not a good album. The choice of songs is simply bizarre and begs the question: if this is the short-list, how bad must the other offerings have been?! As has been commented elsewhere, Agnetha barely gets out of the lower registers, and therefore, gets little opportunity to showcase her great voice. Over-production only adds to the woes. There is no sparkle here, no soul and for the most part, this is not like any other Agnetha record. Easily the worst offering from any of the females post-Abba. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tools","review":"This was my first real set of chisels. I ordered them from amazon.de (where you'll find my earlier review). They are excellent tools. I've been using them for almost a year now (as someone who has renewed an interest in woodworking). They keep their edge very well, feel great in my hand, do not tire my hands out when chopping, and they work well for paring. I expect to be using these for the rest of my life as my standard set of general-purpose bench chisels. The set of six will come in a cardboard box and will require lapping, sharpening, and honing before use. Some of the chisels will have residue on the ferrule and/or the base of the tang--which may turn some people off. It doesn't affect how well they work, though. Note that these are metric, not imperial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust me. It's awesome.","review":"If you like trance, this is a MUST HAVE cd. If you are new to trance this would be a great first purchase. It wouldn't be fair to say he's better than ATB, van Dyk, Oakenfold, Nick Warren or whoever. But Tiesto's has compiled what I believe is the best mix of trance tracks. True, many of his tracks have been used in other compilation albums, BUT no one has ever mixed like Tiesto did here on this album. The album tracks are consistently tight, and melodic--it starts out great and ends even better. Get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"I was an Oakey fans since 1999 and never got into Tiesto. It just seemed that his sets were too cheezy and did not have the trancey flow that oakey and others could do, thus I never bought a tiesto CD until now. God was I a fool.This CD is just so supurb I can't even describe it. The ebb and flow of the tracks are flawless and the tracklistings are absolutley amazing (Sun is Shining+Walhalla=best tracks placement i've heard since Another World).This CD defintly shows the heyday of trance really was 99-00, and you can exerience it again. Must buy for any trance/dance lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant & Beautiful","review":"After listening to this stunning masterpiece, you will KNOW that Tiesto is the greatest DJ in the world, hands down. I started listening to him during his \\"Magik\\" days (which I still listen to more than five years after some of them were released), and this album cemented him as #1 in the minds of millions. His \\"In Search of Sunrise\\" series (three volumes thus far) is unbelievable, and this is the album that started it all. There is no reason on the face of this earth for you to not go and buy this album right now.

I'm always amazed at the new sounds and techniques Tiesto employs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's that good...","review":"I must admit that when I first played this I began to worry that it would turn into typical techno drivel so common today. Y'know, get a bit going on a drum machine, throw in a few keyboard riffs, some angelic divas singing and call it \\"trance\\".But I gave it a chance (I'm listening to it now). I see what all the fuss is about. Tiesto obviously knows his game. Just when it seems as if he's about to let the music go nowhere he drops in a surprise or two.Sure you'll find the best of trance - the spooky keyboards, the ethereal voices, the obligatory happy sound - but he makes it work so that it doesn't sound like the big cheese that techno has become (y'know silly kids with Day-Glo and whistles). No, this is really good stuff with a beautiful title that really sums it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Tisto","review":"I haven't heard all of Tisto's CD's, but out of the 4-5 I have heard this is my favorite so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"In search of Sunrise ROCKS!","review":"What a great CD! a lot of great vocal trance in here! but of course, the best part of the whole CD is the Magikal Remake of \\"Sparkles\\" by DJ Tiesto himself. awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah blah blah","review":"I picked this book up because I'd only read good things about it and what a wonderful writer Anne Tyler is. However, I guess she's just not my cup of tea. I had no feelings for any of the characters, the storyline was all over the place. One page, the characters were one age, the next they had suddenly aged 10 years with no warning. I found my mind wandering too much while trying to follow this boring story of a loveless marriage that I put it down after 100 pages or so. I don't think this book represents a \\"typical\\" marriage in any sense of the word---if it does, then that just makes me sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly mediocre","review":"This is, to borrow from the suburban imagery that Ms. Tyler loves so dearly, a novel of microwave-rewarmed ideas that were only half baked in the first place. Nothing in the novel -- not the characters, not the writing, certainly not the plot -- commands the reader's attention, and while that may have been Tyler's point, then at the very least she needs to come up with some thought-provoking ideas. Unfortunately, she fails on this count as well; the bit about marriage as fruit trees is just a hollow echo of what de Bernieres said, much better, in Corelli's Mandolin a decade ago! Not worth the read, unless you're an inveterate Tyler fan, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very distracting read...","review":"I don't know as I've ever read a worse book...the writing is absolutely terrible. There is no continuity and no flow to the story...in one chapter the son is 16 and in the next, he's graduated from college, has a wife and a child! How can you skip 10 years? You are taken all over the place except for the one person you really want to know about...the daughter that ran away. For three quarters of the book she is gone and then suddenly reappears and everyone is a happy family again after 25 years...give me a break!I guess I should have known better than to read this after thinking \\"The Accidental Tourist\\" was the worst book I'd ever read...this one takes over the top spot! If you absolutely feel like you have to read this, borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative Storyline, Shallow/Cliche Characters","review":"Thank goodness this book was given to me; I would not have wanted to waste my money on it. Tyler's characters are shallow stereotypes with little emotional development. Her glib treatment of the controversial issues surrounding WWII shows how little she was concerned with a \\"thinking\\" reader and simply geared this book to people who want a fast read that won't tax their minds. I didn't even care what happened to the characters by the end of the story. After the first 50-100 pages, I could see exactly where the plot would end up; very unimaginative. No one is happy. Characters do things for no apparent reason. I could go on, but don't want to waste any more time thinking about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, yes, now I remember why I didn't like Accidental Tourist","review":"This book was a choice for our book club, so I felt obligated to read it. About three quarters through, it just became too dull. I just abandoned it. It is an ordinary book about some ordinary people. Nothing special. I would pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book goes from interesting to boring and boorish","review":"This book started out interesting enough but over the years, the characters become so stale and predictable, by the end I could have cared less. And the one character you do have some vested interest in (Pauline, the lead female) completely disappears for endless, countless pages, while we hear how well her milk-toast husband does without her. Pauline, the source of fire in the book, completely loses out on life on pretty much every level, the husband ends up with the nice wife, the happy home - and ultimately he bored this reader half to sleep. How I even got through the last 10 years of their story is a testament to having books on CD and their soothing nature when stuck in heavy traffic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"I am so disappointed in this book. I am a faithful Anne Tyler fan. I've read all her books and loved them. I was so looking forward to The Amateur Marriage. I bought the hardcover as soon as it was available. I'm halfway thru and can't find the motivation to finish it. I don't care about the characters; the story is plodding and uninteresting; and the writing is sophomoric. I find it hard to believe that Anne Tyler actually wrote it. It just doesn't measure up to her previous work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sad, emotional rollercoaster","review":"Tyler delivers another literary tour-de-force about a \\"perfect\\" couple and their sad struggle through marriage.This book really hit home for me not because of the story, which many other writers would turn into a snoozer but because of Tyler's amazing ability to write. If this was a book about someone just walking a dog, she'd find a way to make it interesting.I'd really like this as a Oprah book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was captivated from beginning to end.","review":"I got so involved with this story that I thought these were real people. I laughed and I cried. Anne Tyler is my all time favorite authors. I wish she wrote 2 books a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply insightful, just short of a masterpiece","review":"I can see only one flaw in Ms. Tyler's otherwise excellent novel--she observes and narrates with an affection and respect for each of the characters, and her insights into people are uncanny and brilliant, but she doesn't provide hope or inputs on how to cope with a mismatched marriage. So it created despair in me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A change for Anne Tyler","review":"It seems to me that The Amateur Marriage marks a change from what I\`ve come to expect from Anne Tyler. I\`ve read most of her books but was greatly disappointed with this one and those that followed. The absurdities of life, as pointed out by Ms Tyler, made her books a must for me. In this book that playfulness seems to be gone and what is left is a description of sad lives with little relief. In the past, much was said without hitting the reader over the head."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-observed slice of life","review":"The two central characters - stolid Michael and quicksilver Pauline - are beautifully drawn, and this is the story of their unhappy marriage, their daughter Lindy who vanishes for 22 years and whose son they bring up ... All this against the background of very ordinary daily events, minutely but arrestingly described."},{"rating":"2","title":"The melancholy of the human condition","review":"The United States is about to enter WWII when Pauline meets Michael and they fall in love.Pauline is impetuous and dramatic, Michael staid and unimaginative so this was never going to be a marriage made in Heaven. However, marriages between incompatible personalities can succeed and this thoughtful account of how a relationship gradually fails and how even family members living in the same house inhabit totally different spaces is compelling.A reflective book but with a strong narrative interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to be depressed, then this one's for you....","review":"In \\"The Amateur Marriage\\", Anne Tyler captures the truth of a group of people -- but there is nothing redeeming in this bittersweet portrayal, as there is in so much else of what she has written. I have just ended the book and find myself unable to go to sleep. It makes me remember all the long-gone people of my life, the transitoriness of life itself. I found myself asking, why couldn't this couple get it together? There was no explanation offered by Tyler. The only positive thing I gained was an appreciation for my own dear husband and my own life, which is not plagued by the sad unhappiness of Michael and Pauline's. I just wonder what Tyler hoped to accomplish with this book. If she wished to unsettle her audience, well, she did so with at least one of her customers -- me. But I don't mean that as high praise for the book. I say, avoid this book unless you want a gray and sad reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"No point to the story","review":"I have never read an Anne Tyler book before, so I guess this was not the best one to start with. The story line was so vague. Tyler never really developed any of the characters or the story. After I was finished with the book, I had so many questions that never got answered. The ending was so anticlimatic. It was almost as if, she just got tired of writing it so she just decided to end it all of a sudden. Based on all the reviews, it sounds like Tyler really has written some good books, but I don't think this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Amateur Novel","review":"Not one of my favorites. Did not keep me engaged. I did like the way she revealed the story. The plot line had a unique pace. Felt that she failed to develop a few of the minor characters (who ended up with greater roles). My suggestion: If you area a diehard Tyler fan, wait for the paperback version. Otherwise, skip it. Read Running With Scissors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Soooo boring---tedious! Characters are predictable....the book just goes on & in & on with nothing of any substance! I cannot understand how it received so many high ratings here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters that don't have an ounce of truth to them","review":"This is perhaps the third Anne Tyler novel that I have read, none of my own volition, mind you (this one was a book club pick over my objection). I wish I understood the basis for this author's fanatical following. I found the characters in this book, as in the other Tyler novels I have read, to be wholly unlikable and bear not even a passing resemblance to folks in real life. Has Tyler written any novels featuring a heroine who is not \\"madcap,\\" \\"flighty,\\" or somehow \\"delightfully batty??\\" Please. It was a chore to read this book. I could not connect with any of the characters. Tyler (perhaps unintentionally) does a fairly good job of making each character seem to have no redeeming qualities, but then in the next sentence she seems to want you to empathize with them. If I could have given this book a zero rating, I would have. Don't waste your time with this just-barely-above-a-harlequin-romance book. It's a \\"Lifetime\\" movie waiting to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I'm on chapter 4 and I'm going to return this book to the bookstore. I just can't get in to this book, it's really boring to me. I should have bought the newest Elizabeth Berg instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Amateur Novel","review":"First of all, this book was written on such an elementary level in its prose and format. There was absolutely NO character development. You see no discussion of how Pauline or how Michael and Pauline's marriage impacted their kids lives. Why didn't Karen marry, isn't it ironic or not that Sally (George's wife) is so much like Pauline. What was it exactly that led Lindy to leave? If Michael's second marriage was a dessert and the first one was a missed entree, what was the lesson?This book was so underdeveloped in every way. The reading level, the characters. I kept hanging on thinking that Anne Tyler would tie it all together in some fabulous way. It was pedestrian at best. If this book was written by a newcomer and a first time novelist, then fine. What a huge waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"What a delightful novel! Original, moving, and stimulating, I can't recommend The Amateur Marriage enough. The book reads as a series of interspaced episodes of Pauline and Michael's marriage, and every one of them is a little gem, in which through the perfectly natural dialog between the characters we observe their frustrations, hopes and strains. The writing is precise and enjoyable. It's been a long time since I read a novel which described a family's dynamics with such honesty and acuteness. A solid 5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good work of fiction","review":"I really enjoyed this book. This was a good, solid story that kept you turning the pages (or, in my case, pushing \\"play\\" since I listened to the unabridged audio book version). There was so much realism in the book which showed the story behind the facade (representative of many marriages).The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the ending was a little disappointing. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars as it really didn't take away from the book that much.Overall, I definitely recommend this book! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb story about ordinary people trying to sort things out...","review":"After a quick and intense romance on the onset of World War II, Michael and Pauline find they've been disillusioned about what a life together really means. Children quickly enter their world, and they must deal with in-laws and the family business, but find there's always a little something empty and unhappy within themselves. It might be better to split -- but if so, why is there still a longing unhappiness inside?As with her other novels, Tyler has captured the writing style that makes a compelling story seem flawless. Although Michael and Pauline struggle to find actual answers, this only duplicates what any of us are searching for in our own lives. How can there be a neat, happy ending in a novel when life itself so often fails to present that for us? Tyler gets an A+ for this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I usually love Anne Tyler's books, but I found this one very disappointing and depressing. I kept wondering when the two main characters would move on with their lives to a separate and better place. Divorce is very painful, but it is preferable to living in continuing misery. Or, if you find a more suitable partner, life can become wonderful instead of depressing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-baked Novel","review":"Ann Tyler's latest novel was a big disappointment and once again it leads me to wonder what the professional critics were thinking when they wrote their rave reviews. The only possible explanation is that the disconnected, superficial, unspoken, unexplained relationships in this sad family were symbolized in the disconnected, superficial and poorly developed characters, composition and story line. It has however continued to hang in the back of my mind, inviting me to make my own sense of the many missed opportunities each person had to look honestly at themselves and each other. I would appreciate some candid comments from the author as to where she was taking this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unbearable","review":"I keep coming back to Anne Tyler because of \\"The Accidental Tourist\\" and \\"Breathing Lessons,\\" but I've finally lost faith. The opening chapter is nearly unreadable, with its fake folksiness that leaves you feeling like your mind is coated with sticky syrup. This stilted, phony prose seemed vaguely familiar, and then I realized that it sounded like the narrator of the play in \\"Waiting for Guffman.\\"It loses some of its false sweetness after the first chapter, but then we're stuck -- once again -- with an uptight, orderly man and his ditzy wife wondering whether they're totally incompatible or perfectly complementary. She's written this book so many times, she gone from perceptive and insightful to cliched to self-parody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best...","review":"I have read at least 10 of Tyler's books, and have loved almost all of them. Unfortunately, this one just falls short from the get-go. I stuck with it, hoping it would pick up, but it just never happened for me. The characters are just not very likeable; I did not find myself endeared to any of them. Let's hope this is not the beginning of a downward trend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read Better...","review":"The Amateur Marriage is probably one of the most boring books I've read in years. With that said, Anne Tyler manages to drag it along with her lively descriptions, true-to-life settings and what seems like some heart-felt emotion. At every scene, I kept wondering why Tyler was taking me there only to be let down when I realized there was no climax building--it was just the end of the scene. Borrow it from the library if you must read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tremendous change for Anne Tyler and I like it !!","review":"I've read every Anne Tyler book or maybe I should say novelette. This book is, to me, her first full length novel. A tremendous change for her but, perhaps, one for the better. Some of her books of late have not had the incredible mesmerizing characters of her earlier stories and the plots have started to seem somewhat repetitive. For me, this story was a smashing sucess and I'm back in love. If you are an Anne fan expecting one of her usual novelettes with zany characters, this book will surprise you. She has taken a totally new direction with a story covering several decades and I fully approve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Tyler is a genius","review":"Do not miss this beautifully written story of a marriage. Two mismatched young people meet in the 1940s, and we follow their lives and family into this century. Anne Tyler is an American treasure. No one else writes with the detail and heart that she does. Thanks, Anne, for another wonderful novel. The last two pages had me in tears, and I hated to close the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed Anne Tyler fan","review":"I love Anne Tyler for her quirky but totally believable characters. In this book the characters were quirky, but totally unlovable. In short, I really didn't care what happened to any of them. The book is like eavesdropping on one long argument between two people I don't care about. I had been waiting for her to write a new novel, and was really disappointed by this one. Try Saint Maybe instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable characters, contrived & flat","review":"I hated this book. The characters were flat, contrived & unlikeable. The story went quickly enough & had enough plot twist to keep me interested, but the characters seemed only concerned with themselves & their own feelings. For all their self involvement they were not the least bit self aware let alone aware of the people around them. What a miserable bunch!! Life just sort of happened to them & when they were unhappy it was always someone else's fault. Just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and insightful book","review":"I had held onto this book through five moves without reading it, so something was obviously pulling me toward it. Left with a Sunday afternoon to myself, I pulled it off the shelf and could not put it down. Well-written with three-dimensional characters, this book takes a look at marriage and family life in a way few writers will attempt. Not a romantic love story, but a glimpse behind the doors of suburbia and one of the greatest generations marriages. The lace curtains are pulled aside and the family relationships are laid bare on the kidney-shaped coffee table. A read that will stay with you long after you turn the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meanwhile, back in Baltimore","review":"Beats me how Tyler keeps turning out such great novels; obviously, the well of her imagination is very deep. The Amateur Marriage is her 16th, and like its predecessors, it deals with one of society's outsiders: Pauline, who is too impulsive and querulous to fit into the tightly knit, Polish Catholic Baltimore community in which she find herself in love (and at war) with Michael. They marry, perhaps too quickly, and live upstairs from his cantankerous, embittered widow mother. Being good Catholics, they quickly saddle themselves with 3 children. Years pass, thirty of them, and we get painful, poignant, quirky, and humorous (all qualities at which Tyler excels in portraying with her writing skills) character development as these two misfits make each other progressively more and more miserable.Not Tyler's best effort, but you know, I've read anything she's written and have never been really disappointed. This one gets a B."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's Lost Her Keen Eye","review":"This is perhaps the fourth book by Ann Tyler that I have read and I realized after completing it, I continue to look for and hope for the bite, the razzle-dazzle keen eye she had for the human condition found in her earlier work.Alas, it isn't in The Amateur Marriage. This book has a cast of completely forgetable and unlikable characters, mundane plotlines and conflict, and no real developmental arc to any of them. If this is her subtle metaphor for life and marriage, well, thanks, but that's not my experience and that's certainly not why I shell out 25 bucks to read fiction! I like real life portrayed presented through the language of a gifted wordsmith--someone who can take \\"ordinary\\" and hold it up as extaordinary--she's done that before! Life's too short and I'll probably not waste another minute of it wading through another Anne Tyler novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amateur Marriage - Professionaly written","review":"This was yet another wonderful novel written by the wonderful Anne Tyler. But what else would you grow to expect from such a wonderful author of her excellent caliber. Basically the 2 people involved are quite the mismach but they get married anyways. Its a marriage not quite made in heaven, but they are pros at dealing with this (no pun intended). Alot of interesting things continue to happen and the characters are developed quite well. Despite being a great novel, this novel also is almost a history text of american life thru out the last century. The only part I didn't like was that the child was named pagan. But what would you expect from a hippy."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BETTER BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ","review":"I AM AMAZED AT ANNE TYLER'S ABILITY TO PRESENT EVERDAY LIFE WITH SUCH INSIGHT. THERE IS NO INTRICATE PLOT HERE-JUST THE UPS AND DOWNS OF AN ORDINARY MARRIAGE OVER A LIFE SPAN BETWEEN TWO VERY OPPOSITE MINDED PEOPLE.MOST MARRIAGES CAN THRIVE AND GROW IN SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE BUT OBVIOUSLY MANY CANNOT. THIS IS A BOOK THAT WILL STAY WITH ME FOR SOME TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Annoying Marriage","review":"This novel simply follows a bickering couple and their inabilities to let anything go. I became very frusturated with the book but finished it with complete relief that it was over. Not recommended if you want a real read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares?","review":"I have always enjoyed the way that Anne Tyler develops characters. At first glance they appear offbeat, eccentric, and \\"different\\" but as they unfold before us we realize in them the humanity that connects with our own experience. You care about them as you understand who they are.At the halfway point in \\"The Amateur Marriage\\", I realized that I just did not want to spend any more time with these boring and disagreeable people. I can understand Ms. Tyler's desire to do something different and I don't need a \\"happy\\" story, but these monotone characters have none of the richness and depth that I expect from her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeaming qualities","review":"What was Elizabeth Beverly thinking when she wrote this book? What kind of message does this send? Your main character's history is that she spends her childhood with a crush on a guy who treats her like crap and thinks she is the dumbest person on the face of the earth. Because of this she flunks out of college, has low self-esteem and does absolutely nothing with her life. Years later he comes back into her life and continues to treat her like crap... realizes maybe she's not so dumb and they live happily ever after? Still scratching my head. I agree with the previous reviewer. This feels more like the beginnings of a verbally abusive relationship. Word to the wise, if a guy is calling you stupid and telling you he's too good for you within minutes of being intimate (And this happened two, maybe three times in this book) he's probably not the guy for you.I read Harlequins every now and again but will NOT get anything else by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow a Dream!","review":"Ted Mason's dream is to be a naval officer and a pilot, a dream that goes sour when his mother dies and he's virtually kidnapped by an alcoholic, half lunatic, stunt-pilot father. Several years pass before Ted has his chance to get into the navy, not the academy, but as a recruit using an assumed name. The enlistment begins his long struggle to maintain an identity not his own, and to reach his goal of becoming a naval pilot.The author, Tom Smith, takes his protagonist through a series of escapades and identity changes as he pursues his goal, combining adventure, humor and romance with an element of suspense. Readers will find themselves trying to challenge the plausibility of the identity changes, and they'll ultimately say: \\"It could have happened.\\"The Lieutenant Who Never Was is a great book, not only for one who identifies with the military and with flying, but also for anyone with a penchant for a unique and unusual turn of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for the emotional ride of a lifetime!","review":"Some books make you laugh, some make you cry, others we can relate to in other ways,.... well this book takes you through the entire spectrum of emotions and makes you sorry the book is over when you are finished. This book should be made into a movie, it would be an academy award winner. This book is one of the few that would appeal to men and women alike and have the same impact on both sexes. Please, Tom, write more like this....I will be waiting with much anticipation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Important and well done","review":"A very helpful book in that it presents a very important argument very ably, being that King James Version onlyism is not some new cult as it is often portrayed, but the ongoing defence of the historically recieved sacred text. And Cloud's book is a terrific resource in providing pointers for further research.The author comes across as reasonable, straight-talking and eloquent, and has evidently engaged in a lot of first-hand research.As another reviewer has mentioned, this book compliments Cloud's 'Myths About The Modern Bible Versions' very well. But it stands on its own very well too.A very important and highly commendable book. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falls Short of the Original Crow","review":"If this movie had been the first in the Crow series, then its likely that more movie fans would have liked it. However, there was a first Crow movie starring the late Brandon Lee and its to that first movie that this Crow and the other Crow sequels are compared to. On those grounds, this Crow merits no more than a 4 out of 5 rating.Let's face it, Vincent Perez is not a good substitute for Brandon Lee. The first 15 minutes of this movie were incomprehensible and had little to do with the rest of the movie.However, there are some redeeming factors to this movie namely the music and the cinematography. Add in a script that has a strong second half, and you have a movie that is worth a rental at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of The Crow Sequels","review":"Of course the original Crow is the best,but when it comes to the sequels this is the worst. The only reason I gave it 2 stars not 1 is because it is a Crow Movie. City of Angels should have gone straight to video and Salvation should have gone to theaters. Wicked Prayer is also way better. Watch it if you are a Crow fan though."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever made","review":"How bad is this movie? Let me put it this way: I demanded a refund when I rented this so-called movie.It is a cross between a random collection of unrelated things that clueless marketing \\"experts\\" think need to be included to \\"sell\\" a \\"franchise\\", and trite soft-core gay fantasies that hack directors mistakenly believe are \\"artistic\\".This movie is so horrible that even bad-movie aficionados will find nothing in it to enjoy.Don't even think of wasting money on this; instead run away as fast as you can.I'd award this one negative stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"the crow city of angels","review":"I wasnt to sure if this movie was going to be as good as the one Brandon lee made sure enough it was I almost felt as if Brandon lee made the movie Vincent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, despite the reviews.","review":"It's not a sequel, but a separate story, so it doesn't taint the original in any way. But actually, I thought it was a pretty good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISH SERVED COLD","review":"This second in the popular CROW series is mean-spirited, ugly, and ultimately a vile tale of revenge. Vincent Perez takes over the hero role, and he just doesn't have the presence or charisma to make us feel anything for him, in spite of the horrible way he and his young son were brutally murdered. Director Tim Pope has managed to make this foggy, oppressive LA the ugliest one has ever seen the city. The villains (including an over the top Iggy Pop and an underused Thomas Jane) are especially vile but even so, their deaths are staged so absurdly gruesome, one doesn't feel the empathy for Perez as much as we did with Brandon Lee in the first Crow. Mia Kirshner is beautiful, but her character is wasted, and Richard Brooks as head villain Judah is simply not that strong of a screen presence to further villainize his character. Too mean spirited and vile to be considered entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick.....","review":"First of all,The Original movie was great but City Of Angels just went too far.

It was a mistake to make a sequel. and now there is another sequel called the crow:salvation. I feel it just desecrates the original more and more. Tim Pope holds nothing to Alex Proyas."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too generous","review":"potential purchaser:the original THE CROW was an amazing piece of cinematography, and more importantly it was BRANDON LEE'S last film. out of respect for the now dead actor, the movie industry should never have made CITY OF ANGELS.aside from the ethics concerning this film, it was a horrible attempt at remaking its predecessor (it didn't even try to be a sequel). where THE CROW enticed the audience with its gothic charm, CITY OF ANGELS causes people to become nauseated (it replaced charm with repugnance). if it were possible to rate this video less than 1 star, i would do so.^'^ may fortune smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sequal to a good movie.","review":"I was so disappointed when I watched this movie in the theater and I just kept hoping it would end soon. The story line was horrible! For example, Vince Perez tries to be funny when he is not unlike Brandon Lee in the first crow movie who is a bit more comical than Vince. I just hope that if a third crow movie is made, it will be better than this one. Don't waste your money on this movie! The first one is better. NUFF SAID!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely pathetic compared to Crow 1","review":"If Brandon Lee had been alive to view this film, I am sure he would have been aghast to see the downward incline of this sequel. Without a doubt, Crow 1 had a storyline which contained more substance and was more meaningful than the sequel. Vincent Perez did put on a good act, but he did nothing to aid in the creation of a truly outstanding movie. Definitely a pathetic movie. Even a crow couldn't save this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM DUMBER FOR HAVING SEEN IT.","review":"Horrible film. It did not attempt to capture any of the good qualities from the first film, but simply played on the concept in a poor attempt to make money. The production value was poor, the plot was essentially the same as the first film, the acting, writing and direction were all sub-par. I do not reccommend wasting your time with this picture. If you enjoyed the original, chances are you will regret watching this film. The soundtrack is pretty good, which is about the only thing that this film has going for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"I highly recommend buying from this seller! My DVD arrived promptly and in perfect condition! A+++! Thank you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace to Brandon Lee","review":"This movie is a complete insult to Brandon Lee who starred and died in the making of The Crow. The main character is a wimp. He is scrawny and not very intimidating. This movie is a complete insult to the original and should not even be associated with The Crow. Do not buy it! Do not even bother watching it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, Yeah..","review":"The only thing this pathetic film has in common with the first 'Crow' film is the name - And it insults that name. Stupid plot and stupid acting make it a complete disaster. Avoid this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"a joke","review":"This movie is a disgrace to the movie name The Crow. They should of stopped after making the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"Maybe if they had slapped another name on this very obviously B flick I could have watched it. But, having the name The Crow on it, I expected the same quality as the original. It was not there! It was a dark drama, but the story just never clicked. It just seemed to be a quick rip off hoping to bank on the cult following established by The Crow with Brandon Lee. I would recommend renting this to see if you can sit through it before wasting the money to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hollwood sequel factory turns out another terrible movie","review":"This is easily one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. This movie tries hard to recycle all of the successful elements of the original Crow movie. . .unfortunately it doesn't have much luck. What it lacks in story and acting and basic logic, it tries to make up for with stylish sodium lighting and a hodge-podge of shadowy religious imagery and quick-cut edited kinky S&M orgies. The director fills out the rest of the hour and a half with shots of tattoos, motercycles, and crows flying around the desolate cityscape."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PILE OF CROW CRAP.","review":"Making a sequel to The Crow is like making a sequel to Grease or Terms of Endearment. We all know what the outcome of that was. The Crow: City of Angels is a disgrace to it's classic prequel. How dare they tarnish the sacred Crow this way? This film lacked everything the first one possessed, even down to the music! Where was all the cool music?!? Let me say that again, WHERE WAS ALL THE COOL MUSIC?!? I was so looking forward to seeing this film and it has to be up there with \\"biggest dissapointments in film history\\". It's like, \\"let's make a sequel to Fargo...yeah, yeah, good idea, yeah.\\"There's just some things you don't do Hollywood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I blame the script.","review":"Director Tim Pope's direction of the film could have been perhaps a bit better, but from a purely visual sense the movie is not without its strong points.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the strength of the story itself. It would have been better not to have tied Mia Kirshner's \\"Sarah\\" character to the that of the first Crow film and the overall strength of the narrative (and especially the dialogue) left much to be desired.And similar to what i said of Tim Pope's direction, i credit the actors for getting as much mileage and investing as much of themselves in the somewhat weak source material that was the script/screenplay for The Crow: City of Angels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"This movie is low rate with poor plot lines and no character. They ruined Sarah and made this crow lacking in character. The ending was horrible. A lot of the nudity was unnecessary. The few things going for it is the gangsters were at least not cartonishly stupid and the movie's darker setting of depravity and hopelessness was believable. Not worth watching it. It is a shame because the original was so well written, had character was believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad attempt to carry on the Crow legacy","review":"Just like the first movie it had a drug/crime lord, a witch and his minions who kill two people. One who is resurrected and linked to the crow. Oh, also there is a girl named Sarah who is connected to them, again. The story line is a copy and past from the original, along with terrible acting and script. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Almost as bad as Battlefield Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crow is cool!","review":"I loved this movie. The most talented actress of all time is in it. Meet Ms. Beverley Mitchell. She is a beautiful and talented actress who plays Grace. She has also been in Sinatra and Killing Obsession. I think that this showed her at her best work! Keep up the good work, Beverley!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked And Apalled","review":"While some parts were good, the movie had a lot of flaws. First of all,the cinematography made everything look yellow. Not only that, there were some scenes you would find in an Anne Rice novel. All in all,disapointting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, derivative sequel","review":"This half hearted sequel attempt to the brilliantly moody The Crow is so devoid of any emotion or soul that it still makes me cringe to this day when I watch it just like I did back when it first came out. Vincent Perez plays Ashe; a man resurrected and guided by a crow to avenge his death and the death of his young son. Perez broods his way throughout the film, his wooden acting skills don't let us mourn for him much, same with Mia Kirshner's character Sara (the little girl from the first film now all grown up) and the villians seem like typical card board comic cut outs of typical drug addicted low lifes. In the end, The Crow: City of Angels is a terrible, derivative sequel to the modern day classic original, and would be followed by a direct to video sequel which was a bit better; The Crow: Salvation. The rest of the cast includes Richard Brooks, punk icon Iggy Pop, ex-Power Ranger Thuy Trang, and Thomas Jane who is due to play The Punisher in the upcoming film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Purchase","review":"This is one Blu-ray disc I should not have purchased. There is no improvement in picture/sound quality and the story line is not as good as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movies","review":"Got this as a gift for my brother. i know he is going to love both movies.

An ok BD if you don't have the old special edition DVD","review":"Got the Crow 2 BD and was comparing it with my DVD and it really is not that much of an upgrade in PQ. It's slightly sharper then the DVD, but not by much. Sound is DTA-HD MA 2.0 and sounds good, but could have been much better. For $10 bucks it's not to bad if you don't have the special edition DVD, if you have the DVD then just stick with that.One thing I did notice was the BD is not the slightly longer Directors Cut like the old special edition DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"City of Angels lacks salvation","review":"While the gothic and gritty image remain intact, the story line is too watered down and fails to connect on an emotional level. Unlike the original Crow, City of Angels just feels flat all around. The culprit here is the stale script and monotonous acting. Though my opinion differs from the vast majority of reviewers, I thought the bright spot of the film was Perez. I thought his manic portrayal of a father returned to avenge his childs death was right on the money. The movie is a bust, but not entirely unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iggy Pop. Now there's a intimidating villian. HAHAHAHA","review":"Maybe the movie was good, but I couldn't understand what the Crow guy was saying. It should have been sub-titled. Now, I can't dog this completely. I too, would be running for the hills if I were attacked by Iggy Pop, and the Yellow Ranger. With his freakish girations, and silly squirming. I'm not too sure why the guy was out for revenge. I thought his son died, but you'd never know it by the way the character acted. \\"Um, my son is dead, now I want to kill Iggy Pop.\\" \\"I think somebody died, now I want to kill Iggy Pop.\\". \\"Now I want to kill Iggy Pop.\\". I think he was really seeking revenge for the soundtrack. Now apparently there was a \\"MAIN\\" villian in this movie too, but I don't remember him. No wait, that's right. He was the guy that wasn't very evil, and died pretty easily. Ooooooh yeah. Now if you'll excuse me I must go seek vengance for being made to suffer through this movie. MUST KILL IGGY POP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally wrong","review":"Okay, you're asking me, \\"why did you give a Crow movie a 1?\\"well, all I can say about it is that it [stunk]. There was one fighting scene, and that really didn't live up to all the \\"fighting for justice\\" thing that The Crow set for the rest of them. and the follow up, trying to stay in the spotlight of the first was tacky. It was alright, but it really didn't follow the realness of The Crow. I didn't really take to Ash anyway. I could more relate to Eric.There was also the fact of there was a bit too much information when it came to the clubs. And they really didn't have to add some of the things at the end. I didn't like it. [sorry for the spoilers there...]It's not just because I am a major Brandon Lee fan, and I know no one can beat an original, but I know that Vincent Perez was almost there in the whole thing about walking in his shadow and succeeding, but he wasn't quite there.*Shrugs~ so maybe you have a different opinion, but this is mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose death over this movie!!!!!!","review":"This has got to be one of the biggest peices of (...) to ever come out.

If you liked the crow, DO NOT see this","review":"I loved the crow, it has to be one of my all time favourite films, but city of angels...oh dear. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this film but it can be summed up in one word \\"Garbage\\". It is nothing compared to the first film, it's bland, uninvolving, the actors cannot act, the script is appauling, the bad guys are un convincing, iggy pop plays some ridiculous character called curve. Everything is lit in green light (whats that about). It runs like an overly long music video. The only thing i felt after watching this film was anger after having paid money for it. Save your money, do not see this film, it's awful and shouldn't have been made. It is a vain attempt to cash in on the success of the first film, only it doesn't becasue it's crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the Crow, don't see this.","review":"This sequel, like most, was a complete disappointment. Vincent Perez cannot act to save his life. The only slightly good thing about this movie was the cinematography. It was dark, but more in a colorful way compared to the first. However that isn't enough to save this waste of a movie. I loved the first one. So to anyone who thinks of seeing this after enjoying the first so much, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I loved The Crow but the sequel was so not worth my time. I saw it in the theatres when it was released and expected something entertaining. What I received instead was a movie that was exceptionally LOUD and utterly dull. But that still wasn't enough to keep me awake. I fell asleep for about 2/3rds of the movie and was glad it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sequel, better movie.","review":"Good screenplay, great cinematography. Yes, The Crow was a good movie, yes, a sequel won't be as good, but City of Angels does a great job. Those who complain about the similarity (face paint, crow symbols) have missed something-THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE SAME THEME AS THE CROW. Tying the first movie into the second one via Sarah was an interesting idea. Although it loses some momentum at the very end, it is still enjoyable. If you want to complain about a travesty of The Crow, see The Crow:Stairway to Heaven. After watching that, you won't complain about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this movie really needed?","review":"The first is my favorite film of all time. And this must be the worst film of all time. First off I watched it twice. Compared to the original in story feel and emotion it is pathetic. Trying to see it as an individual film it was pathetic. In the first I was compelled and horrified by the emotion and situation. DURING THIS ONE I WAS ACTUALLY NODDING OFF!! There is hardly any character development, if you notice the the main character Alex managed to strike all famous poses of Eric's right down to mirroring the firey crow with a crow shape aparently made of glass?(WHEN DID HE GATHER ALL THAT GLASS never mind) This film was put together for high box office.(RIGHTFULLY BOMBED). Vincent is an excellent actor but should have acted instinctively on his character rather than listen to the director sayng see the first film, then mirror it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sequal","review":"This movie would have been a good movie taken on its own, but as a sequal to The Crow it was terrible. It was essentially a streight re-creation of the orriginal, with only a slightly altered story line. It also lacked the impressive visuals and cinematic creativity of the orriginal. Though the sub-plot involving Sarah was interesting it did little to aleviate the shere repetativeness of this movie.See the orriginal, if your a true crow fan watch this one to."},{"rating":"2","title":"stardustmaiden","review":"I think that people are a little over critical about this one. I've seen few sequels that are remotely as good as the first. If you take this one as a stand alone project, you might have a different interpretation. It is a little darker and heavier than the first. So you really have to be in to this sort of thing to watch it. Vincent Perez, who is a wonderful actor, pulls off the role rather nicely. However, I will have to agree with some of the other reviews about his character not being real sure of where he's going or what his role is. I loved the way it was shot and the color pallette that was used. It really stuck to the original in that respect. However, the big bad was pretty lame. But overall, I have to say that I enjoyed the different view and the story that was being told. So if that means that there is something wrong with me, then so be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish i could give it zero stars","review":"The first Crow was an excellent film....and it's so tragic how the entire plot of the movie circles around death and in the process of making it Brandon Lee's life came to an end....he in the process though made one of the best movies i've ever seen.

Rest In Peace Brandon.As far as Crow 2: City Of AngelsGRRRRR!!!!!! BAD BAD BAD BAD SHAMEFUL BADThis movie is terrible. Brandon has been replaced with a fat balding english man hopping around yelling stupid stuff to the extent of \\"I'm going to get you\\"...the witty repartee has been replaced with terrible drivel.

But the second the star opened his mouth I knew that I was in for a bomb.It is impossible to understand the guy, it sounds like he is talking with food in his mouth, and man was that movie corny.

You may not have a problem with the fixed drop distance for your situation. I did and I solved the problem by replacing the shipped drop arm with a 1 and 1/2\\" x 12\\" pipe from the local hardware (you could take the drop arm to the hardware have it cut to the correct length and have them re-thread the pipe). Thus the top of my 47\\" Sony LCD mounted 8\\" from the ceiling and not the approximate 24\\" that the shipped arm would have given me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from LaCie drives if you like your data...","review":"Of the three LaCie drives I've bought, two failed within twelve months (of relatively light use).

The fact that the drive remains unlocked after a reboot--or for that matter, after a shutdown--is a security issue, and I could live with that, but the reboot would be a big hassle if I was using this drive every day. Oh, and if you're thinking of using the drive on a shared machine, be sure to lock it when you're done, because it will show up unlocked no matter what account you use. I know!!!!

A piece of the Greenie was obstructing the area where the contents of his stomach should feed into the intestines and nothing could pass! He was put on IV for dehydration and observed for 24 hours. Then I was presented with a very large hospital bill when he recovered. This was several years ago when the product was new.

I enjoyed reading it for the style in which it is written (the play progresses backward) and some of the staging techniques are rather interesting. The theme of the play boils down to that the most precious moments in our lives are the one we don't even realize. That theme is an important one, but is overused so much it has lost much of it's impact. Still, when used correctly, it's a profound and ephipanical message.

Tarkington has the mannerisms down pat for a twelve year-old boy living around the WW1 area.This book is listed as a juvenile book, however, I wouldn't recommend it for children unless they weren't afraid of dictionaries and some politically incorrect references to African-Americans. There is also a chilling tale about Penrod and Sam finding an old gun in Sam's father's drawer and what occurred with it.

Tarkington's very interested in the psychology of Penrod's family as well as in the ways that kids relate to each other -- but it's all played for laughs.

This book is a terrific starting point for anyone who really wants to dig into the subject, and also a very well rounded study for those who want a (detailed) glance at the history and the myths.

I had assumed that the book would give a little bit of Vlad the Impaler's background and then focus on vampire history. It was like reading a history text on Romania and its battles with the Turks.

Chirstafari rivals the likes of Black Uhuru and Mad Professor, experimenting with textured soundscapes in the tradition of Sub Dub and Revolutionary Dub Warriors.I picked up this CD when I saw Christafari live last night in a dank, seedy little bar in downtown Salt Lake City--they were better live than on disc! Lead singer Mark Mohr and his wife Vanessa were enthusiastic despite the dilapidated venue. We were caught up in mesmerizing rhythms and thunderous beats, I only wished that the club had advertised their performance more so that others could have shared the experience. Their unique blend of reggae with Christocentric lyrics jubilantly conveys their brand of Christianity--and this, coming from a humanist infidel who scarcely shares their ideology.If you savor reggae or dub, check out Christafari."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for something?....","review":"If you're interested in this cd, it may mean several things.1-You're into J pop...can't help you there.2- You enjoy anime soundtracks- I'd reccomend Yoko Kano's work instead.

Well, the above still apply, but why not check out some John Willaims or Hans Zimmer?4-You(like I was)are interested or are looking for something in the vein of classical music- Well, if you're new to classical,get a guide, like \\"The Complete Idiots Guide to Classical Music\\"(not that I'm calling you an idiot -_-), then try some Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven. One of them will suit you're fancy,believe me, or perhaps all three.5- You just want your Record of Lodoss War Soundtrack, so stop babbling about Hans Zimmer and classical music, yah freak!.....okay, suit yourself, but you could do much better then this.

The firewire interfaces allow a lot of data backup in short periods of time, so that's cool. There's also a cool \\"On-Auto-Off\\" power switch which senses what your computer is doing, so you don't have to think about the proper sequence of turning on and off the drive in conjunction with the computer.So far so good.

I would like to compliment LaCie and their customer service department for the timely, polite and fast service. I highly recommend LaCie to anyone shopping for external hard drives. The only thing I am disappointed in is the \\"auto\\" on/off setting on the power switch does not automatically turn the drive on and off when I have it hooked up to FW800 and also have FW400 items connected to my Mac.

KonincaMinolta does not have local service center and according to their customer service repair volume is so high on this camera that turn around time is 3-4 weeks.You have to pay for shipping the camera, and they will send similarly by ground (add to the cost of purchasing this camera).Besides this I have found that auto focus fails in low light - auto focus does not really works. Manual focusing procedure is so cumbersome that it may as well not be there.I regret buying Minolta, better stick with Cannon A80 - better product better value.

When I turn it on the shutter makes a noise and the memory light comes on and stays on. The lens does not extend. I went to the KM website only to find the company no longer makes cameras and Sony has taken the responsibility for repairs. Sony charges a flat rate of $181 to work on the camera, plus parts, and we pay the shipping to get it there. There is an internal battery in the camera but only the mfg can replace it.

Although the pictures are good if everything is correctly set, this is a fairly rare coincidence. It took us quite a while to figure out that you must manually lift up the flash. We lost and still lose many pictures because we forget to do this. Also, this is not a camera that can be easily slipped into a pocket or purse. The 10x lens makes it bulky, and does not fully retract even when off. Because of these two things we have essentially abandoned this new Z2 in favor of our old Kodak. If you are looking for a point and shoot, to capture family moments and events, then this is not the camera for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the color?","review":"I purchased my Z2 and couldn't wait to see the great images it could produce with 4 megs and 10x zoom. What a disappointment! I want my old Olympus 510 back. The color is horrible on the Z2. I could get the color ok by adjusting the white balance in the program modes (not using a flash), however it's not adjustable in the \\"Auto\\" mode, which also meant switching back to \\"Auto\\" for a flash shot. Also, this camera's size and shape make it totally impossible to just carry around in your pocket.

It takes gorgeous pictures. I like to do a lot of scenery and outdoor photography (amateur), and this camera has captured beautiful colors. It's also not big and bulky. As far as pictures in dim lighting, I took a shot of my son with his father after turkey hunting one day. It was getting dusk, and the background was dark, but the picture turned out beautiful with this camera, one of my favorites. I wish I could put it on here so you could see it. Anyway, GREAT camera and has lasted many years with much use (I can't even remember when I bought it it's been so long). We're taking it with us on our wedding anniversary trip to Hawaii in April.

However, this is all great if you could take a good picture with it. This camera DOES NOT have image stablization & you will take 10 blurry pictures to each clear one. The white balance doesn't seem to work as well as it should either. I cannot stress enough how this camera struggles to take clear pictures. It's a real shame, but if your going to spend this kind of money on a digital camera you should expect more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working in less than 3 months -","review":"In less than 3 months of owning this camera, it stopped working. We tried to return it to the store we bought it from, and they refused it and said to contact Minolta. Minolta would only refurbish my camera for free the first year. I told them I wanted to return it because something was obviously wrong with it. I have a 10 year old Minolta that has never given me any trouble. Why would I pay over $300 for a 3 month old camera that had to be refurbished.

There is a front piece that you install after you put the TV on the stand. This piece wraps around the very bottom of the TV make the stand and TV look like one. Setting it up was very easy. Someone definitely did their research when developing the manufacturing specs for packing because each part is clearly labeled and easy to install. My only gripe is the same as the other reviewer. I can't place my center speaker or my receiver on the top shelf because the opening isn't big enough. The receiver placement doesn't bother me as much as the speaker placement because now instead of sitting directly below the TV and centered, my center speaker is not offset and on the lower shelf about a foot away from the TV. It would of been nice if it were reversed: that is for the upper shelf to have more headroom than the lower shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand for your Sony TV","review":"This stand was the perfect addition since it was made for my tv.

Besides being some 6 years out of date, the book doesn't track direct-to-video movies and seems to neglect a few imported cartoons that had hit airwaves before 1997. Also, many '80s cartoons (particularly those from the great toy-license revolution) have incorrect series synopses, voice credits, and even entries (such as the listings for G.I. Joe).

Her driving narrative and ability to sweep you along are tremendous. I think the Tony Hill books are some of the finest of genre and McDermid can proudly stake her claim to be one of the top thriller writers in the world today.That said, it is rather nice to go out to the garden and breath some fresh air when you have finished. McDermid creates a very nasty and black world. It occured to me that she owes a little to the gothic writers with their castles and torture chambers.
