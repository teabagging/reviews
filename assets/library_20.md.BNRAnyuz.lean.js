DeNiro is as good as he's going to get in a movie of this sort.

I still think the primary one in Ronin, stands head and shoulders above the rest. De Niro stands out as he always does, but some of the supporting roles, are very well done.This is one of those rare action/suspense films, that you will want to watch again and again over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"If this is the Japanese release, tread carefully.","review":"Judging from the specs (Japanese/English subs and language) and the cover art (English text but no BBFC rating stamp the way a UK release would have), it looks like this might be the Japanese BD release of 'Ronin,' which has been out for a little while now. I bought it myself for about the same price as this, and I've got to tell you that you may not find it worth it. It's one of Fox's earlier MPEG-2 transfers and looks like most Fox movies of that vintage--slightly gray, slightly fuzzy. It's still a leap above both DVD editions and it certainly doesn't look outright bad by any means...but unless the $45 pricetag means nothing to you, you might want to just wait to see if the eventual U.S. release gets a better treatment.Edit: Oh, and--again, if this is indeed the Japanese release--no features except for the theatrical trailer (and a few trailers for other Fox releases)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Action Flick","review":"I take exception to the reviewer who said this film is part of De Niro's downward slide. This is a great action film, with the best car chase sequences since The French Connection, and solid performances by De Niro and Reno. I especially enjoyed the repore between the two.To those who think De Niro is in a downward spin, I loved his performances in Analyze This and Meet the Parents. It shows a side of him not seen since Midnight Run, my favorite De Niro flick. To those who thinks he has sold out for the box office, comedy performances are never recognized as being as difficult and challenging(ie, Kevin Kline in In and Out), but I think shows his diversification as an actor(drama, action, comedy), he is superior at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ronin - Japanese edition","review":"I love this movie - especially watching the S8 used in the chase scenes but there are subtitles in Japanese that I can not turn off (might be able too if the set up was not all in Japanese.

I can't find any other words to describe this film but boring.Its basicly Mission Impossible trying to be Mad Max.

To me it had a very non-Hollywood feel, and a terrific realism applied to everything; especially the gun fights and the *incredible* car chase scenes. You'll appreciate the detail even more if you listen to the director's comments on the DVD version. One of those movies that, after you watch it, you feel like you've read a book instead of watched a flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great action flick","review":"Ronin is the best government intelligence film of the year. The reading the back of the film cover is just not enough. It'll leave you in the dark. After watching it everything will come together. The car chase scene is unbelievable as it takes place in the narrow streets of Europe. De Niro is perfect for his role. A CIA agent who joins the group of thugs since there is no work for him in the agency. This movie is almost similar to Mission Impossible, only De Niro would kick Ethan Hunt's ass any day, twice on weekends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action","review":"The sceneries and the actions are excellent.

Well photgraphed, crafted, and cast; everything about this film works well, especially the interaction between Robert DeNiro and Jean Reno. The car chases are unmatched, as are many of the gun fights. Callous disregard for innocent bystanders not withstanding, the \\"shoot-em\\" up sequences hold a degree of realism, from the ordnance selected by the operators, to the much of the weapons handling by the cast. The scenes under the Alexandre III Bridge and ambush in Nice are outstanding. The director also make great uses of the French locations, as the photography is superior. If you enjoy an action film where the hereos don't fire 20 mm Gatling Guns with one hand, I recommend Ronin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little farfetched","review":"One of the hard things to believe about this movie is that an undercover CIA agent, played by Deniro, will actually go through surgery, having a bullet removed, by an amatuer in order not to blow his cover. This would never happen in real life. Also, the alternate ending on the DVD did not make much sense to me. This has all of the cliche's of all action movies, long car chase scenes, guns shooting, and the mysterious betrayals left and right, not knowing who is on who's side. Further, this is not Deniro's best performance. I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did DeNiro sign to do this film?","review":"I saw that Ronin was the top DVD selling movie so I bought it on pay-per-view. This movie is horrible. The script is terrible and the action sequences consist of 75 blown up cars. If you like DeNiro I suggest Jackie Brown if you want a new film. Wag the Dog is another good new film. Ronin is a disappointment. Rent it before you buy the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not to good","review":"It started out strong but quickly fizzled into a superfluous action movie.

I was quite dissapointed. It was confusing, boring, slow moving and had some car chases. Big deal. So did Bullitt and that was a lot better.

The chase was too long, the acting was bad, the plot was stupid (chasing a box which you never find out what is inside), and I cannot believe that people would pay $80 to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD JOB ON SOUND EDITING","review":"I notice there are already quite a few opinions on this movie as a whole, however, no one mentioned how poor the sound quality was throughout the movie. Maybe it's just me, but I found it so hard to hear what the actors were saying, (especially during the car chase scenes), that I had to turn on the subtitles. The actors' voices were muffled and washed out. Maybe someone messed up in translating this movie to the DVD format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"An AWESOME movie! Fast-paced action non stop through the entire length of the movie. Hats off to the stunt drivers in this movie! Deniro shines as only he can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Agree with the other reviewers comments on the acting, the car chase realism, etc.The scenery around Nice and Villefranche sur mer is wonderful to look at. The director's commentary on the DVD is actually educational as, among many other things, he discusses the difficulties of showing small passages of time in a movie, issues of framing scenes, and test audience reaction to the various endings.There is also just a lot that happens in this movie, you might think that it was three or four hours long.There is a realism about this movie that most spy thrillers lack. There is a nice sub-text going on critiquing the gung ho, invade first plan later approach to violence with a more experienced, careful approach.And, on top of all else, there are a handful of marvelous one-liners in here as well. Punk trying to show off: \\"You ever kill anyone?\\" DeNiro: (dismissively) \\"I hurt somebody's feelings once.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Guy Film","review":"Tense male bonding picture with chick sub-plot. DVD is okay, but could have had some more extras. Film itself is a sharp transfer and the commentary by John Frankenheimer is pretty good. The ease at which DeNiro slips between speaking French and English makes the film believeable. A top notch film with a solid cast. May be too intense for some, but still a take no prisoners movie. Chase scene through Paris is a bit reminiscent of the one in To Live and Die in LA but still well done...unless the Princess Diana parallels bother you. Put this on, pop open a cool one sit back for a wild ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"I was quite disappointed that this movie was not marketed well when it was initially released in the US. I took a gamble on it because I remembered seeing the poster in the subway, and boy was I glad that I saw it.The transfer to DVD was excellent, and the audio track with Frankenheimer adds to the detail of the film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreicates a good thriller with action (i.e. The Usual Suspects)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a much better mission impossible","review":"This movie has everything a great suspense/action movie should have: suspense, great acting, great filming, great scipt, and great plot.

It has the best car chasing scenes, best shoot-outs, and a very good story line. Starring Robert De Niro and Jean Reno, who starr in the best movies, they i'd say are the main characters who do not want to be set up, and they give a good revenge. I have seen this movie in a cinema and bought it on dvd, and will (hopefully) never stop watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrills on wheels","review":"This crime caper involving mercenary robbery has become one of my favourite movies of all time. First and foremost because it was set in Paris, a city I love dearly. And secondly because it has some of the most exciting car chases I've seen on film.Though he is the headline star, Robert DeNiro proves what a great acting talent he is and gives a completely selfless performance, stepping back, and giving his co-stars Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Skipp Sudduth, Sean Bean and Jonathan Pryce room to shine. Written, interestingly, actress Rachel Weisz and J.D. Zeik, director John Frankenheimer brings intelligence and tense, high-octane action on to the streets of Paris.Among other things, the DVD extras include an alternative ending and a featurette called \\"Filming In The Fast Lane\\" which tells us how the awe inducing car chases were filmed.If you like gritty urban crime thrillers you'll like this. If you like car chases, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the director's commentary?","review":"This movie is great. The lack of director's commentary is frustrating. The commentary made the DVD worth watching multiple times. Anyway, at least it isn't dubbed and at least you can take the subtitles off, unlike the In Bruges import I just bought that seems to not have working special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you're driving in your car,you'll think of these chases","review":"A blast! Jean Reno and Robert De Niro star in this amazing action/thriller movie with the best car chases ever!Even if you don't want to watch the movie itself (which is great), at least rent it to check out the wicked chases. They are trully umbelievable. The movie is about a group of hired people who have to retrieve a briefcase. The chase for the briefcase is AWESOME!!!!!! But, betrayal comes into play and the survivors are trying to finally retrieve this briefcase. 3/4 of the movie is action while the end has a thrilleresque approach. De Niro as always is fantastic and Jean Reno also does a good job. There's really nothing else to say besides that this movie is a must see alone for the chases and the movie itself, besides the chases, is even excellent. Beleive, you'll rewatch the chases after you watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic and Driven","review":"Having not seen Ronin in theatres, I rented it one night on videotape. Wow. I was literally blown away by the authenticity of the gun battles and car chases. I was so impressed it was one of the first DVDs I purchased. The sound techs who worked on the nuances of the different weapons used should be commended. Awesome in its authenticity. I knew to expect terrific car sequences from Frankenheimer, seeing as he directed one of the great racing movies of all time, Grand Prix. The chase scene through the crowded streets and tunnels of Paris is worth the price of admission alone. The movie is driven and authentic to a fault. Ronin rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"why is it not known more?","review":"this is a fab film. the music is just one excellent bit. the bizarre bingo scene stuff is, to be fair, best left in the polar regions- but despite the setting, this is a warming and positive film which tackles some complex and interesting issues on its way through. it is much more than a showcase for k.d.- although she does, obviously, shine in a film that was written for her. the lighting and the setting, the story and the twists, the music and getting to watch k.d. maked in a library (don't ask- watch it? ) are elements of a splendid whole. okay, so it is a bit dated now, and not everyone wants to engage with lead characters howling in radar dish. but i think that it's worth the watching: saw it for the first time many years ago and can still remember clearly crucial and powerful parts. buy it- even if it's the only way to get your hands on what i think is the best song that kd has ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this hauntingly compassionate movie.","review":"I felt this movie was about an understanding between two people who were misfits in totally different ways in a hostile environment.

With all that the movie DOESN'T have, it has her and she shines through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love k.d. but hate this movie","review":"It's a real stinker of a movie. It's touted as a love story but it starts as a stalking story to me. No motive why k.d. fell in love with the librarian who was harsh and cold to her for half the movie or more. And at the beginning, k.d. came across close to a feral animal and at best in the movie, a lovesick overgrown tomboy. I don't know which was worse, the writing or the editing. The woman playing the librarian (Rosel Zech) was the only redeeming factor in the movie. I picked it because I love hearing k.d. sing but she sure didn't impress me with her acting.Stay away from the Salmonberries, it will make you ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD","review":"This has to be one of the worst Lesbian movies ever made!!

Salmonberries is a less happy production, though it deals with a similar theme and an Alaskan equivalent setting. The script and acting are awkward. Oscar Kawagley, in his few minutes on screen, is the only sympathetic character. The persistent German fascination with First Nations culture --- as usual over the top --- called for a pretty unflattering self portrayal by the Innu cast --- who in this movie are called \\"Eskimos\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this dvd based on the reviews listed here.

You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lurid and badly written","review":"Two overworked ideas combine in this exploitation effort: the serial killer (yawn) and the out-of-control disease. In the hands of a talented writer, peopled with believable characters, sprinkled with good, intelligent writing, it might have worked. But it doesn't at all. It comes over as a deeply tired idea trotted out by people who should know better. I've read a number of medical/biotech thrillers in recent years and this would have to be among the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon won't let me give this book NO stars...","review":"PLEASE don't dignify this terrible book with your purchase. A heartless formula book written by two men with no aspiration to craft or skill -- only an abiding lust for cash. (Look up the NYTimes Sunday Magazine piece, its an eye-opener). They read \\"COMA\\" and deliberately set out to make piles of dough by using it as a bestseller prototype -- and it shows. The writing is simplistic and stupid, and the story is transparent.

Please, go buy a book someone put a little effort into, and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time when there are so many other good books","review":"On the plus side, the science in the book was interesting and bioterrorism is certainly a hot topic. However, as a novel, the book failed completely. The writing was abysmally bad, the characters' motivations were missing or unbelievable, the characters were one-dimensional, and the plot made no sense. I didn't care one way or another what happened to the protagonist or his friends. I only finished it so that I could discuss it with a friend but I really had to force myself to read. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is interesting from a medical standpoint only.","review":"\\"The Eleventh Plague\\" is interesting only in its details of the dangers of bioterrorism. It has a poor writing style and the dialogue is extremely stilted. None of the characters is well-developed or even remotely human. The villain is a lunatic out of central casting. Naturally, his crazy mother made him the madman that he became. What an original plot line! The author knows his medicine, but if he wants to attempt fiction once again, he should learn how to write believable dialogue and how to create well-developed characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise ruined by horrible writing","review":"As an infectious disease specialist and Pro-MED subscriber, I was most eager to read The Eleventh Plague. Despite a plausible and interesting premise--a recreation of the biblical plagues using biological toxins and infectious organisms--the book utterly failed to please. The writing is stilted and leaden; the characters, flat and uninteresting; and plot development, non-existent. Don't waste your time on this book; read The Coming Plague if you want an accessible and well-written text about infectious disease disasters, past and present."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only these authors knew how to write","review":"This book is essentially the combination of the movies \\"Outbreak\\" and \\"Seven\\" except you never sense the hysteria in \\"Outbreak\\" and never identify with villain as you do with Kevin Spacey in \\"Seven\\". These authors have the writing ability of 5th graders. The charcacters are completely underdeveloped. At times it seems if the writers have a thesaurus at their side judging by the use of overly complex and trite vocabulary. The authors also have a serious problem in the overuse of the excamation point. Unlike Sphere, which was a far better book than movie, The Eleventh Plague would make a far better movie than book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mulligan Stew Plague Story","review":"I truly wanted to enjoy this book, especially after reading the Cobra Event. Sorry to say that while the book was a quick read, it was also a terrible read. Recipies for bioterrorism notwithstanding, the characters were extremely one-dimensional, the killing off of major characters was a ploy to get you to read another few pages.In my humble opinion, if you want the tar scared out of you...Read Preston's \\"The Cobra Event\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible-plague-mold-oh, my!","review":"I had just finished reading an article in the paper about how mold can be DEADLY!

I'm sure that the authors were totally on target as to the killer viruses, molds, bacteria, and everything else that can kill us. It wasn't even a Biblical read. It became an up-to-the-minute testament of how nature can affect us. I was totally engrossed. I think we need to examine these killers more closely.

For us, the Biblical plagues are historical fact, and we delight in the expressions of our children as we count out the plagues one-by-one: blood, frogs... This time, I found myself looking at these words with renewed excitement, having just finished reading The Eleventh Plague by Marr and Baldwin. This fast-moving novel takes place in the modern world of science and internet, and the plagues are products of human, rather than devine devine retribution. Anyone who follows the recent advent of new and re-emerging diseases such as AIDS, Ebola, and the 'super bugs' must read this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLAGUING BY THE RULES","review":"If you can avoid all the techno-[material] and long histories of some of the characters, you're in for a frightening look at how easy bioterrorism is. THE ELEVENTH PLAGUE revolves around a madman's plot to mirror the ten plagues of Moses and kill off vast amounts of people all in the name of God. Character-wise, there's no one here we haven't met before, and even the villain is rehashed from Dr. Phibes through Hannibal Lechter. However, the book has some terrifying scenes and some surprises, too. It's a little long in the tooth and is nowhere as realistically frightening as THE HOT ZONE, but it's still a scary read.RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"LMPG","review":"This was an exceptional book it was put together in a manner to keep you wanting more. From my standpoint this book was very good and it is comparable to The Hot Zone (another great read). The ideas were well thought out and it was not incredibly hard to read. For example the last paragraph of the book reads,\\"Dr. John Bryne didnt need 'LMPG'(Le My People Go)on the screen to understand that the Eleventh Plague was still to come. He realized he was now about to battle with a dead man.\\" I would definetly reccomend this book to any one who likes to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a BANG Ends with a FIZZLE","review":"The first half of the book keeps you wanting to know what happens next.

What he describes is nothing short of a fascistic world system in which huge, private, unaccountable corporations trump nation-states that are at least in part accountable to their citizens.There is no doubt that the political process has its flaws and that even democratically elected governments can end up being illiberal (see Fareed Zakaria, \\"The Future of Freedom\\"), but once the world treaty system and national constitutions and laws are aligned to give the corporate form clear advantages over human rights, it's all over for us.

If you are a believer it just strengthens what you all ready know about the ends times. If you are an unbeliever it will be scary but gives you information about what you need to do before the Rapture. Trust me you do not want to be left behind. For those you are skeptics just use your bible. Yes this is fiction only because we don't know exactly what will happen but like I said read Revelations.. The author is great!

This spark quickly expired and I am confident in saying I will not be reading any materials from LaHaye and Jenkins again.I read this book shortly after completing Left Behind. I found Left Behind to be somewhat entertaining and thought, well, let's give the rest of the series a go. About half way through Tribulation Force I regretted this decision and cursed my inability to put abandon a book once I've started it.The storyline between the characters in this series is painfully dull and reeks of those \\"after-school-dramas\\". Honestly, if the authors stuck to their take on the actual Rapture, they'd have a winning story. But they haven't and I can't take anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Another End Times Book For Christians.","review":"Wheither you believe is Christ, Mohammad, or UFOs, this is a well thought out, researched, and imaginative book. Not every Christian will agree with every premise in this book, but that's not unusual. The characters, plot development, and mystery unfolds as you turn the pages faster and faster. By comparison, Brad Steiger's exceptional new book Alien Rapture is the alter-alternative to the Christian Rapture with a great sinister government woven in. Being a student of theology, I have read both books numerious times. I loan them out as a pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Height of Absurdity","review":"If you ever need an example for the logical fallacy of common belief, look no further. The myth of the rapture continues to earn millions of written pages every year and gains the imagination of millions of believers despite the fact that it belongs in the catagory of fairy tales along with the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. Then of course, we shouldn't be surprised since many people actually believe one goes to heaven for being a suicide bomber.What misguided historians actually believe humanity has gotten out of the dark ages? Judging by the persistence of silly myths like the rapture, we're only beginning the renaissance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly better than the first, but still awfull","review":"Yes, I read this one too, hoping that somehow it would be better. It was but it is still unbearable. I sincerely do not care about the teaching - it's all in the technique. The same thoughts of the characters are related over and over and over, it hits you over the head with LaHaye's views, it's really just horrible. There is plenty of other good and even great eschatological fiction out there, much even from the same theological perspective. Invesitgate that instead.I tried reading the third book as well but could only make it half way through before I decided to stop punishing myself, so I did not write a review for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing; doesn't deserve one star!","review":"I read the first two books in this series simply because a friend asked me to. If I didn't have such high regard for him I would never have completed the first one, LEFT BEHIND. I am amazed that anyone could praise this as good writing! If the Bible had been this poorly-written, and the people and events it tells about had been recorded in this shallow and unbelievable a manner, the scriptures would never have survived the first century. I also find it disturbing that so many readers seem to be forgetting that this is FICTION, not some addendum to... or divine explanation for... biblical prophecy. The blatant use of wide margins and large print in the books to make them appear more substantial appears, to me, greedy and cynical. Count me as one Christian who finds this series offensive and insulting to the reader's intelligence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait To Read The Next One","review":"This book, the second in the Left Behind Series, was a suspenseful page-turner.

After the first one, I thought maybe things would start to happen in this one, but they don't. There are a few plot elements that are connected with endless filler. And all of the things that do happen in are completely devoid of suspense. There's one major event that we're told after the fact via a TV newscast. You might think that a book about the end of days would be interesting, but these authors obviously don't know how to write a thriller. It's just endless soap opera. This book and \\"Left Behind\\" should have been one volume. If all the books are the same pace, the whole series should have been a trilogy, but of course, then they would make less money.Don't waste your time on it and don't encourage these talentless hacks by buying their books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dating - Circa 1920","review":"First of all, I will read the next one because I have read that it is a lot better then this book.

A 30 year old 'famous' journalist who cannot even hold a girls hand! Silly. During the \\"most historic moment of our time\\" he is eating a cookie because his girlfriend is too. Come on! He kisses her about 8 months after they start dating and is so happy after she effortlessly HOLD HIS HAND in public - even though they are married. And, all of a sudden, Rayford is married. Please!

For me this is just an adventure tale so I grew a little weary of the tone of the book after a while, but it does hold your interest. I was raised a Catholic but have not beeen a practising Catholic for many years. I take a wait and see attitude. The other book I read was \\"Transfer\\" by a guy named Furland. I liked it better because it was not nearly as preachy and melodramatic and because it didn't seem to rely on biblical doom and gloom to make it's point.

As a book, this is not good. The writing is sophomoric at best. Especially when the authors are describing budding romances, the dialogue, pacing, everything suffers. About the only parts that were interesting at all were a) the appearance of the two witnesses, although, as someone commented, it feels weird when one of them just places a phone call later, & b) the exposition of the Scriptures on the Messiah by a noted Jewish rabbi.What's with the passage of 18 months?About the only good thing that can be said, from my perspective, is that somehow, the authors cause you to keep flipping pages. You just want to see what's going to happen. Sadly, in this book, the answer is not much ... and those things that do happen are described in plodding prose and strained dialogue.1.5 stars.

I'm glad my wife likes these books, because they're the first books she's read in years, but it breaks my heart to think that she believes this stuff is good fiction. A decent end-time series would attempt to explain how/why the things prophesied in the Bible actually come about - this series merely says \\"It came about!\\". Absolutely no suspense, drama, or intrigue. Will they or won't they HOLD HANDS???? Will he or won't he TAKE A NEW JOB??? That's about the extent of the tension in this book.I am also one of those who believes that the author is milking his followers for all they're worth, with the giant margins, large print and blank pages, not to mention the way the story is excruciatingly stretched out to make up a novel.

There's nothing wrong per-se with the books, the problem is more that there just isn't very much right about them. Essentially, it all seems to boil down to a glorafied \\"We told you so!\\" And honestly, I'm looking for more from a religiously themed book. When there's writers like C.S.

It spends an extrordinary amount of time on stupid misunderstandings between two characters. Almost like a bad episode of a situation comedy. Also, they don't really examine the faith of these new characters. The new faith the characters have is too perfect. These people are still human, but do not seem capable of making mistakes. And the non-believers do not seem capable of doing much right. All in all, neither is it illuminating about Christianity and the end-times, but it is also quite boring as a supernatural thriller.

Yeah, right, two lifelong non-Christians would have such an innocent and chaste relationship. If this was written realistically, everybody would be hopping into bed immediately because of the impending doom. And don't get me started on the contrived nature of the rest of the plot.

Although, it is fiction, it is based on facts and a very realistic view of the life of those who may be left on this earth after Christ's return. I am sure reading this entire series will have an impact on people's lives. I beleive that the chilling reality of the stories will bring people to salvation.

It didn't disappoint, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you bought the book, donate it to charity!","review":"I thought the first book, Left Behind, had potential but I was wrong. Tribulation Force just gets truly ridiculous. All of the characters are really annoying expecially the female characters! They're so passive with little or no personalities to them. In other words, they have no use in the book. I also find the relationship between Buck and Chloe just laughable! They act like stupid teenagers rather than serious adults. I'm beginning to like Nicolae. At least, he has a purpose. It was so bad that I wished that all of these so-called good christians died from these deadly events. I wanted to cry not because of the plot but that I actually spent money on this low-quality writing. Don't these authors know the difference between adult and children fiction? At times, I thought I was reading my little sister's book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of fill...little thrill","review":"As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat. There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book. I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point. Overall, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Force to be Unreckoned...","review":"After reading Left Behind, I couldn't wait to read Tribulation Force. I was hoping things would get better. They didn't. If anything, the general quality of the series hit a new low. Originality and Depth are two features that seem to have been left out of this model. I understand the rave reviews from Christians who have nothing better to read; but maybe we can consider these a wake-up call to get some decent Christian fiction on the market. When the non-Christian world writes compelling fiction, and the church settles for English 201-level \\"novels,\\" it's time to work on bringing at least a smidgin of class into the Church. Tribulation Force was, in a word, depressing. The only reason I give it two stars is for the fact that it is communicating to Americans, and therefore is not a complete failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get 3 and a half stars?","review":"The only reason I can think of is because most of the readers are christians. This book is full of illogical occurances, thinly veiled racism, sexism, anti-science, anti-semitism, anti-atheism (the list goes on but you get the picture).It's the kind of thing I'd expect from someone wno was raised in an environment that degrades peoples intelligence, reason, and free thought. After generations of this pile up the real interesting deformities appear and this book series really shows those deformities."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reminder that prejudice is still rampant today.","review":"Let me begin by saying that I read this book because it was selected by the members of my book group. I was displeased with the first in the series and am likely to dislike the rest of the series. However, I did not dislike the book because of a lack of writing skills or creativity. I disliked it because of its strong use of prejudice and anti-Semitism.The book basically attacks the Jewish people saying that they are denied entrance into heaven because of a small portion of their beliefs. I grew up being told of an all loving God. This god would care much more about the way a person lives their life rather than their denomination. For me the book served as a reminder that some people still disrespect others simply because of a name or title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plotless Rip-Off","review":"While the first book was hardly great literature it did benefit from the intriguing premise of the rapture occurring and leaving millions behind. Once that scenario played out the writers followed it up with one-dimensional characters and boneheaded plotting (only the three characters figure out who Nicolae is! ). \\"Tribulation Force\\" makes its predecessor look like Tolstoy. There is no real plot to speak of and the writers obviously are stretching this saga out as long as possible. Don't waste your time. Nothing happens until the last chapter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"End time prophecy. Christ is Coming back.","review":"It is important to believe in Jesus Christ. Because only He will pick us up (for the rapture). Get this book and watch the movies, and pick up a good Bible, and Pray to Christ. Eternal salvation is worth it. To live daily with the One and Only Jesus Christ. Think about the higher message these stories are trying to tell us all----Christ is coming back(to the clouds) for the rapture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Transaction once again!","review":"Very good transaction again and I will continue to purchase from this vendor.Fast shipping. Received in less than 5 business days. Would recomend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blahh!","review":"After reading the first book Left Behind, I was so geared up for the second book of the 12 book series. Man, I was so disappointed. I actually found myself hoping one of the main characters would be eliminated to stop the madness of boring \\"does he like me?\\" \\"does she like me?\\" This theme was throughout the whole book. The end of the book was good and it let you know that it wasn't all for nothing because the next book which is Nicolae has to be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"like the premise, but how slow can it be...","review":"Well, I am reading the series, because I like the premise, but why is it written so poorly? So many negatives that make me leaf through the pages, reading \\"diagonally\\" - to avoid all the flashbacks, uninsightful insights of the characters, cheesy dialog - just to get to actual events and action. Chloe really got on my nerves. The writers mention several times how smart and sophisticated she is, but never actually \\"proving\\" it - neither through character description, nor through her actions/dialog. What I really disliked about this book is how every minimalistic movement any character made had to be described - who called whom, who went to pick up/drop off whom, everyone's goings and comings and incessant (sp?) worrying about each other and leaving messages and checking messages... arhhhhhhh... u get the point - too little actual content. With such a grand premise, why subject reader to pages and pages of boring and mandane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"So here's the logical problem at the heart of this book and the others:IF all of these events are prophesied, IF they are all bound to happen ....why do anything? Why bother with a \\"Tribulation Force?\\" What are they doing? What's their purpose? There's no free will at work in the world that's described here, anyway, so why bother to take action?And if you are going to take action, if you know that this guy is the anti-Christ, why not just kill him? Half the main characters in this book have ample opportunities to off the guy, even if it involves risk to their own lives (a small price to pay for killing the Anti Christ, you'd think). So why don't they at this point...oh. Because it's not in the prophecies? Well then..Do you see how illogical this is? Do you see the difference between quality fiction, which gives us a world like the one we live in - filled with free creatures making decisions, facing unknowns - and propoganda disguised as fiction?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction-lite","review":"If you're in need of Sunday-school remedial lessons you may find something of value in these incredibly light-weight novelettes. Stretched out to garner as many sales as is feasably possible, each of these commercial exploitations is a very superficial and unsophisticated read. In contrast, read Glen Kleier's complex and spiritually satisfying supsense thriller THE LAST DAY and you will see how much gold can be mined from this rich topic of the End of Time. For my money, there has to be more to a novel than simply a validation of fundamentalist Bible interpretations. I'm also looking for a story, characterization, and theological insight. These books are very disappointing in that regard.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no intelligent life on this planet!","review":"Wow! I'm terrified! Either end up in heaven with billions of brain-dead sheep or burn in hell for all time... I think I'll get used to the heat...I would like to refute the childish arguments made in this book with some reasonable analysis but I understand that reason has nothing to do this... thing. Scary that 50 million books were sold. This is scary stuff... what does that say about the 5 million people who bought ten books each? ;-)As a Christian, I was brought up to accept Jesus into my heart... however, I don't like the company I find myself in. What's with these fundamentalists anyway? Can't they understand a metaphor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up to \\"Left Behind #1\\"","review":"This was a pretty okay read. The early struggle between Chloe and Buck was ridiculous, tiresome and sloooooooow. Some of the other subplots going on didn't flow overly well, and the political aspects didn't seem very plausable. I did enjoy reading about the 2 witnesses, and for a while, that aspect of the story kept my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the editor of these books?","review":"I read these books in an average time of 4 hours. Each book I readkeeps my attention for a less amount of time. I find myself skipping over passages that are just repeats of a passage 4 pages back. Obviously these two gentlemen are not writers. I feel sorry that their editor did not catch onto this and do some cleaning when they received the manuscripts. The plot lines are ridiculous and do not flow with time. A good writer would not have to title a chapter \\"18 months later\\" that is a title for a television sitcom. Also if bombs were going off in the major cities of the US I really doubt a Range Rover salesman would be sitting behind his desk waiting for a customer. I think maybe I am analyzing a book that doesn't deserve analysis, it's just fluff. Fluff books are what you would see on the NY Times best seller list. These books require the intelligence of a 12th grader to comprehend...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story but character's dialogue is unbelievable","review":"To be fair, I have to say I can't put these books down because I want to know what's going to happen next. However, I really don't like the writing. It's written at about a sixth grade level and is so repetitive that I skipped pages and pages of repetitive content. I sincerely hope the authors will raise the bar on their writing because I, like many others, am eagerly awaiting the last book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the edge drama from cover to cover.","review":"This is part 2 of a compelling series which can actually be read without reading the first book, Left Behind. Yet it is a great series of end-time prophetic literacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be stupid or really really ignorant to like ..","review":"This book is one of the most badly written pieces of trash I have ever read. The characters are shallow and unbelievable. Instead of wasting your time and money, go to some fundamentalist church and listen for 10 minutes. Stupid, stupid book. Toilet paper is more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Soap.","review":"This books left a lot to be desired. There really was too much emphasis in the first part on Buck and Chloe's relationship with missteps galore. The entire time, I was thinking, just get on with it. I was about ready to set the book down when it finally moved beyond that and got interesting again. The middle was better, but you know they were in trouble when they had to skip 18 months to get a cliff hanger so you'll be hooked for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, except for one thing....","review":"After reading Left Behind, I was eager to read more. I started on this book immeadiately after I finished Left Behind. Anyway, from the start I have loved all the characters, they are realistic and not totally un-real. I thought this book was great, until they skipped 18 months ahead. I wished we could have gotten to Amanda a little better before Rayford just went ahead and proposed to her! But besides that, it was a GREAT book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tribulation Force Review","review":"Tribulation Force is one of the best books I ever read. it is one of my favorites because it has drama, romance, and real life situations that could happen in the future. I especially like the relationship between Cameron \\"Buck\\" Willams and Chloe Steele. The only reason I like it is because you don't know if they will get together or not. The other thing that got me thinking was the thought of world war III. World war III to me is so realistic especially compared to the events that are taking place today. The last thing that kept interest was to think who was going to survive the next judgement by already knowing who has died during the other judgements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing Saga","review":"Not as riveting as the first book in the series, but offers character development and moves story along. Much happens. More characters consider conversion. Romantic involvements blossom between characters. Death and destruction begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series","review":"This series is well written and grabs your interest right away. you have to start with the first book to get to know characters. You need to remember this is FICTION not Biblical truth. It can help to visualize what it may be like after the rapture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribulation Force (Left Behind #2).","review":"This book was terrible. I really wanted to like this book, but it was just so bad. The writing was poor, the plot was uninteresting and the characters were thin and unrealistic. Some of the dialogue made me sick - I felt like I was reading a teen romance book. In some parts I thought that I was reading a Track -- good stuff but too bland for an action novel.This book suffers from the same problem as most other Christian fiction: we settle for low quality works just because they include a Christian perspective.Bottom line: unless you like reading books at the third grade level, skip this one. Frank Peretti books are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sequel to a good book","review":"I liked the first left behind. The constant developpement of the plot when the characters realize that everything around them is written in the bible makes you wonder.The problem is that the poor aspects of the 1st left behind are overemphasized in Tribulation Force. I wanted to know what was happening to the temple, to New Babylone, to the new Global Community...i got pages and pages of cheesy platonic love dialogues between shallow characters.Also, while the first book was subtle about instilling the idea of conversion in your mind, this one gets you right into it without false pretense. It becomes repetitive and can fall on your nerves because it is so obvious.I believe that this subtlety made the charm of LB. It is lost in TF.I will give a chance to Nicolae (book 3) if it is much of the same, it will be my last one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Continuing to get even more rambling","review":"I read the first book gave it a 3 star since in the middle it was rambling and long. I bought the second book in the series hoping it would be better. I was wrong. The book has a good plot...if the writers wanted to write a fiction book they should at least try to stay in that path. They are trying to hard to put world events and biblical references together. They haven't read the Bible where it says that nobody knows the day or the time not even the son of God. The tribulation will come but it sure as heck is not going to give us any time to sit back and analyse it. If the authors where writing a fiction book they could have made it more adventurous and not so politically involved. Nice try but I don't think I want to by the 3rd book in the series. This book was way to sanctimonious for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad","review":"A clone of its predecessor, Left Behind, this book features the same 2-dimensional characters, plodding action, clunky dialogue, lame plot twists, and true bigotry towards anyone who isn't a born-again-middle-class-middle-American fundamentalist. Oh, yes, and the margins are so wide the publishers (and authors) must be raking in the money in a most un-Christian way. If you're interested in the story of Revelations, read Revelations. This series has absolutely nothing to add to the Bible besides cartoonish characters and messages containing the kind of subtle hatred of others that masquerades as Christian love and pity for the unenlightened. LaHaye and Jenkins should be ashamed, but they are probably too busy counting their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"T.F. - too long and too romantic.","review":"Well....I guess that I'll read Nicolae because my mom liked it and hey, moms know best! Well the whole marraige thing upset me and I didn't care for the 18 months later thing so I give this a 2 Star award!!! A little worse from my 5 star Left Behind rating. I didn't learn much about the rapture from this book. All I learned was that eating a cookie on TV makes you look like a love sick puppy. BOW WOW. PLEASE MAKE NICOLAE A GOOD BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing, but good plot line delivers","review":"The plot of the book could have been condensed into fewer pages. The book was so long that the reading became tedious and repetitive. All together, the plot line was intriguing and kept me interested despite the poor grammar and writing style. I would like to know what happens in the next book. This story would make a great action movie if all of the books were condensed into one story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amanda's presence raises some troublesome issues.","review":"The authors made a big mistake in having Rayford hook up with Amanda, a minor character whose only role is to provide a romantic plot. What's going to happen at the end of the series, at the Glorious Appearing, when Rayford is reunited with his first wife, Irene? What will she think or say about her husband remarrying when he knows that the tribulation means that the marriage won't last anyway? Amanda is little more than a marriage of convenience, or if you like, of desperation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful to have this book.","review":"These books from the Left Behind series are holding my attention even when I have to put the book down carrying out my daily duties. They explain the book of revelations while following a story. I'm thankful for these authors and this book. Glory to God that we currently have the freedom and access to the bible and the Left Behind series. Really makes you think about things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first one!","review":"I think everyone is getting the wrong idea, this book is mainly to inspire you to BECOME more spiritual. If I wasn't already a believer, I am sure I would be after these 2 series. I am a catholic (devoted) and everyone seems to once again FORGET this is just a book to help the non-believers understand YOU NEED GOD in your LIVES. The story is there just to give some spice..It doesn't have to be a catholic or christian or buddism or whatever religion way, It is just a FICTION book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!!!!!!!!!

It keeps you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great witnessing tool","review":"I have found these books to be a great witnessing tool and have spurred my interest in the rebuilding of Babylon by Saddam Hussein. The beautiful, amoral flight attendant Hattie was a cliche that I found to be a big turn off, however, and referring to her as \\"Rayford's senior flight attendant\\" is ridiculous. As a flight attendant (blonde, even) for a major U.S. airline, I can assure the authors that while airline captains are the final authority in an crew, the cabin crew in no way belongs to a captain. Captains, first officers, and flight attendants are also not typically addressed by their work titles outside of work. Clean it up, boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining story","review":"I am a non-christian who has found the first 2 books entertaining. You do have to be a little thick-skinned about being preached to. But if you can get past that and see it for the epic story that it is, you will be very entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Behind and now coming together","review":"In the Tribulation Force, the individuals we have been exposed to in Left Behind start to gather and regroup. While I thought this book was a little slower paced than Left Behind, I still enjoyed it very much. I could hardly put it down, and it is a quick read - so I recommend this book for Christians and fiction-lovers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring I about cried.","review":"This book was without a doubt the worst of the 7 thus far. Nothing good really happened in it. The last page or two was OK but othing exciting. The only reason I read it in 3 days was so that I could get to Nicolae (which is 20 times better than Tribulation Force)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Interesting, but a little unrealistic","review":"Tribulation Force is an action packed, well thought-out sequel to Left Behind. The book does a good job balancing plot, characters, and action to keep the reader glued to the pages. Unfortunately, a few melodramatic relationships develop between the main characters. Otherwise, I feel like the book gets its main intentions across with an underlying Christian message and Tom Clancy-like action. What more could a reader ask for? The book, in my opinion, is every bit as good as one of those Crichton or Grisham mass-produced bestselling novels. I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another thriller!","review":"I will also admit that this book is not nearly as good as the rest, but I think it was necessary! We have to get to know the characters better, and there's no other way to do it than through reading about them. That's pretty much all that happens in the book, but there are a few other things. We find out that the antichrist in Nicolae Carpathia, that the times are going to get much worse, and more. A must read if you intened to finish the rest of the series(which I would also highly recommend!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of the end...","review":"I have read each book in the \\"Left Behind\\" series. I am an avid believer in the Bible and that it is the inspired word of God. I have come to believe that the \\"Left Behind\\" series, (though it's characters are fictional, it's foundation is Biblical,) is an \\"INSPIRED\\" writting. I would highly recommend this series to anyone, believer or not, who is in search of the truth about how things are to be in the end times. If, like myself you have ever read the book of Revelations but did not understand it, this series will bring what you have read to light. If you read this series with an open mind and a searching heart, it will inspire you too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a great series of books!","review":"I too have read the series of books \\"Those Left Behind\\" and I find it to be compelling!

I thought the authors did a good job relating their message without being too preachy. However, I thought it was downright silly for the authors to make Buck, a 30 year old man and world traveler, a virgin. He was too busy to ever get around to it?!! Other than this bit of corny play, the book was great. It also made me seriously think about my own life. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE FICTION","review":"Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing.

I remain at a loss as to why this ill-conceived and hackish series continues to make the best seller list. I am particularly disturbed at the xenophobic impulse which gives the Antichrist(whatever that may be) a foreign name, multilingual abilities and influence in the United Nations.

Keep up the good work, Jenkins. I enjoy your anti-Catholic stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The are better books on this subject","review":"Having read Peretti's THE VISITATION, and now three of the LEFT BEHIND series, I have to say, I'm rather disappointed. If you're reading these novels strictly to underscore your faith, then disregard this review--I'm more concerned with the quality of the story, the plot, the writing--which I found less than enthralling. If you're reading these novels for entertainment, then let me direct you to any number of better Last Day novels, including the best of the lot, which goes by the definitive title, THE LAST DAY. Written by Glen Kleier, LAST DAY is probably the best novel ever written in this genre. Stephen King's THE STAND, while not as spiritual and compelling as LAST DAY, is still an exciting, suspenseful read. Both are far more interesting and thrilling than VISITATION, NICHOLAE, TRIBULATION or APOLLYON. If you liked any of these, try reading STAND or LAST DAY for a more heart-pounding experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives Christians a Bad Name, and a Terrible Extrapolation of Prophecy.","review":"It really does give Christians a bad name.

(just curious where in John's Book of Revelation they got that from....)I tried reading it, I really did. But I like plots that are actually sensible, characters that have at least TWO dimensions if not three, and written as if the author actually knew how to write a book. I guess some people, apparently millions, don't really care how terribly written a book is.however, I will tip my hat to the authors, they've figured out how to make millions of dollars. Write crappy books geared towards right-wing Christians who hate the UN and you'll make millions....I'll start working on mine now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing the light","review":"My friend recommended this book to me, so I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Once I bought the book and started reading, I couldn't stop. This book really helps you understand the Bible better. It helped me understand the Rapture and the effects it could have on the world.

The characters are like friends that you desire to keep in touch with. I found that once I was introduced to the Left Behind family, that I was unable to break the connection.

Can someone PLEASE explain to me what that's all about? This is a blatant and unfair attack on Catholics by two men who are trying to write Christian books? GIVE ME A BREAK!

Paul Coufos, plays the boxer and father who also has to decide on a boxing career or his family. The movie really never goes anywhere the direction is slow and the movie itself is low budget which makes it really seem dated.

At the time I was enamored by Pete Dexter, whose books Train and Paris Trout I had recently read. Both of those books are spare and menacing, at times brutally violent, but done in a masterful way. Brotherly Love is like those books, but to call the book spare is an understatement. Dexter takes his time - most of the book, really - fleshing out the main characters, cousins Peter and Michael Flood from a Philadelphia gangster family. As the plot slowly develops - or comes to a boil, one might say - it becomes clear that Peter wants out. But of course, Michael and his band of hoods keep dragging him back in. In Brotherly Love, Dexter doesn't quite plumb the emotional depths of his characters as he does so effectively in Paris Trout and Train, and the reader is left with a book that feels empty and characters that feel doomed from page one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Dexter books are not created alike.","review":"The story is violent, brutal, pointless, and dull.

A big letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible dvd","review":"What an awful DVD!! Language is Japanese, with NO subtitles. Thus, it doesn't make any sense, unless you'd understand Japanese.

Definetely not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite video yoga teacher!","review":"From the moment Mr Yee introduces himself to you, you are with him. He is gentle and such a friendly presence that even though he is so graceful and strong you are never intimidated by him. I work with this videotape every morning before breakfast. I go to yoga classes too, to supplement the instruction on the tape, and have read some books on yoga so that I understand more clearly the poses I am doing with Rodney Yee. I don't advise doing any tape in a vacuum, without supplementary knowledge, but Yee's is a wonderful introduction to the flow of vinyasa postures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet","review":"I love the \\"flow\\" of this workout--I even like the music, despite the fact that I'm not a fan of new-agey stuff. Yee is soothing and well-muscled; the latter is prominently (perhaps TOO prominently) displayed by his tiny black bikini briefs. I like a nice quick workout, and this is it. I do it every day and have not yet grown tired of it. However, I think it would be nice if the video included a few more specifics on certain postures, since it IS for beginners. I'm not sure if I'm doing the \\"upward dog\\" pose right..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although short, a great yoga immersion","review":"I had never tried actual yoga before using this video, proving that it is an excellent beginners tape, for I was able to follow the instruction easily. Although it is necesarry to do the yoga along with the video several times before being fully able to keep up and actually feel any relaxing benefits, but after a few viewings it becomes relaxing. This video was a great start and I plan on continuing with more advanced videos from the same series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"this has got to be one of my favourite videos! rodeny yee is a great instructor. he goes slow enough that you can keep up, but not boringly slow! you can really feel the difference after even using this once! i recomend it to everyone. i like how he relaxes you in the end. you feel totaly seteled! this is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"good workout but...","review":"I consider myself an average yoga-er, but this is definately not a tape for beginners. you have to know what the poses are beforehand, as he moves from pose to pose very quickly, not really explaining how to get into some of the poses, which someone with no experience (aka beginner) would get lost. I would recommend this tape to more advanced yoga fans, as you will know most of these poses and be able to keep up. My only gripe is with his billing of this as for beginners, otherwise great workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, but not too difficult","review":"This is a short efficient workout -- good for intermediates. You have to know a little bit about yoga and be able to do the postures correctly because the instructor moves quickly. If you are looking for a longer workout, this is not the tape for you. However, it is perfect when I am in a crunch for time and I really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Down","review":"He goes to fast.

I'd like to exchange this video for another beginners version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout for non-beginners","review":"One should read the editorial reviewer's last two sentences with care (and the comments of other customers). This video is not for persons who are ignorant of basic yoga positions, because Yee doesn't teach them.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately NOT for beginners","review":"I bought this series thinking \\"beginner\\", that's definately for me seeing I had never tried yoga before. However, after watching 10 minutes of it I started wondering if there was something before \\"beginner\\" as there was certainly NO way I could keep up with this! The moves were too fast, there was no instruction and by the time you registered exactly what the name of the pose was, he was already on to the next one! I'd skip this if you're just starting, this is definately more on the \\"been there done for a few years\\" route rather than just starting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"You should at least be familiar with sun salutes before beginning this tape.

Not only is it very short, there is hardly any instruction given on how to do the moves.

This tape is NOT for beginners! Beginners need instruction about the poses - how to do them, correct form and TIME to do them. Also most people beginning yoga lack flexibilty to move at the extremly fast pace the instructor moves in. There was no time for adjustments. I am in a power yoga class,in decent shape and I couldn't keep up using correct form. If you are not going to use correct form, why bother? If you are new to Yoga I would highly suggest Yoga Journals Yoga Step by Step 3 vol. video series. Each dvd has a 35 min instruction part followed by a 20 minute workout. Don't follow this tape like a drone. Try Yoga Journals and get educated about yoga and get a good workout as well. I hope when the tape is updated that they update the title as well. NOT FOR BEGINNERS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for someone w/ a little yoga experience","review":"When I first began yoga, this tape quickly become my favorite after familiarizing myself w/ basic poses (using Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss). I would recommend this to someone who has learned the basics and is looking for something a little more challenging.Rodney Yee is practicing on a beach, in Hawaii. The majority of this workout conisists of Sun Salutations w/ lunges and Warrior poses. There are a few seated or lying down moves and a nice 5 min. cooldown at the end. Total workout time: 20 min.All in all, this is a great tape to have if you are a beginner who is ready to move on OR as a standby for the more advanced practitioner as its a nice quick, feel good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"It wouldn't read some cards that were put into it.

Sound: there is distortion on all significant sounds- this had been used so much that the sound is uniformly damaged. This is simply one of the most worn-out set of reels I've ever seen, in cinema or on video. Even the picture on the box looks dreeadful and has a moire pattern.

But his life experiences a sudden twist of fate when he meets the innocence made woman, an alluring but shy woman Stella, who captures his full attention until he gets to convince her she makes exactly the same activity.But the poetic treatment given by Pasolini marks the difference between what a simple existential chronicle of the Neo Realism Italian and a powerful and vibrating scream of agony and redemption.

Possible, but so what? This is hardly the first drip coffee machine I've owned, and that has never happened before.If you decide that this little junker is the machine for you, at least be forewarned that it does not have an automatic shut-off and that it does have a propensity to leak all over your best business suit when you're pouring that last cup before rushing out of the house.Richard VidaurriGuadalajara, Mexico"},{"rating":"1","title":"carafe broke","review":"I've had this unit for a backup office coffee maker so even with infrequent use the carafe cracked.

It is very compact and cute!The bad news: When it arrived, I was suprised at how lightweight and flimsy it was. Yes, just like the ones in hotel rooms. I have had mine for five months now, and this morning the very flimsy plastic lid on the glass carafe broke off. Without it completely attached and correctly seated, the coffee doesn't flow down into the carafe and just sits in the brewer.

They heat up evenly and clean up nicely. The handles will warm up a bit after a while on the stove, but that is to be expected. They have a nice amount of heft, and I really like the glass lids.

There is a huge outline of a chunk of Tuna on one pan that stuck after I didn't use enough oil. And I don't care if my pans get scuffed up, but it's just kind of funny. You can tell it was a piece of fish. I also don't think that they heat too evenly. And the handles do get VERY hot. However, I bought these handle covers at Crate and Barrel for a couple dollars that are made out of that heat resistant silicon or something. They slide on and off.

Though her childhood was different than most, it was still one of exploration and education, of conquering difficulties and facing emotions. Fraser writes well, with a strong sense of people and place as she drifts from northern California to the Oregon coast to Hawaii. Her book will strike a cord in a lot of people: It's a cultural story from a child's point of view, but also spans a life from childhood to adulthood. A great read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book hit close to home.","review":"So close, in fact, that I had to take some parts of it slowly, circling back to read more after coming up for air. Joelle Fraser writes with great clarity and humor, she writes incandescently, lighting up old memories and emotions, but most importantly, she writes with chutzpah--she's unswervingly honest. It takes talent to write a good book, and guts to write a real one about yourself, warts and all, and she's got both qualities in abundance. This book shook loose things in my own life I'd tried to forget; this book crawled under my skin and stuck with me. It's very, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable Read","review":"Joelle Fraser writes a very honest, sweet memoir that is a pleasant change from the usual brag memoir. She takes us on a journey through growing up and understanding ourselves and the ones we love. She allows us to see the painful as well as the pleasurable moments in that growth and I find this very refreshing. Also, being a lover of Hawai'i, I enjoyed the brief journey to that state as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself some time","review":"Flower-child child comes of age. Your older sister's diary is a more interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Every once in a while you pick up a book and know in first few pages that you are in for a great ride. This book takes you on a journey through the life of Joelle Frazer from the beginning to the present. The honesty and complete willingness to share all of the events of her life is truly moving. What courage. I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine memoir...","review":"I found the book, \\"The Territory of Men\\", to be an enlightened account of one young women's view of the effect of men in her life. I also found many similar experiences to my own life and read the book in two sittings! I highly recommend this book - it takes a serious look at how all the people in our lives, not just the fellas, leave a lasting impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Winter in Northern Illinois. Use this in my garage which stays above freezing. I follow the directions. Easy as pie. Salt, gunk, & everything dirty & nasty comes right off. Nice smooth finish. I'm pretty picky when it comes to having a clean car. This is really great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Horror","review":"This really is old school horror. In case you are unaware, this short story was written in the latter 1800s and the writing style reflects the standard of the time. Stevenson (who brought us \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\") doles out a cautionary tale about supply and demand, and the meeting of old friends. A quick but satisfyingly grisly read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The songs have a wide range of meanings.","review":"The album had everything from love songs to comedies. I give it four stars for the meanings, and the fifth for the range of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I think this Cher at her finest...better than a lot that came after it. Especially liked the song, Jesse James!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD","review":"But I'm going to ask a question rather than sing its praises....does anyone have a copy of it on CD with the original artwork? It was a drawing of Cher leaning against a rock with bat like eyebrows.Any ideas people...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cher","review":"It is hard to know what to say about this CD.I used to think it was kinda cool but now I don't.The problem is that I dont like Cher.But if you do like Cher,well,Cher belts out rock hits with a gutso.I bought it because I loved the JesseJames song."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIE HARD CHER FAN","review":"I have been a DIE HARD Cher fan since this album came out. I wore out a few copies of the tape and plan to get it on CD as soon as I can. CHER RULES!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially recommended to new Cher listeners","review":"For those who were introduced to Cher through her latest albums, \\"Believe\\" and \\"Living Proof\\", \\"Heart of Stone\\" is probably the best of her \\"middle period\\" recordings. You hear her rock soul on this set, and yet you get diversity from a sort of country parody (\\"Just Like Jesse James\\"), a kind of gospel rock number (\\"Heart of Stone\\"), something tender (The duet with Peter Cetera: \\"After All\\"), to the adult contemporary \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\".Along the way, you'll incidentally hear song writer Diane Warren at her very best. She writes quite well for Cher in this album, with songs that lend themselves to Cher's dramatic and rather sardonic delivery.All in all, if you're a new Cher fan, I think you'll be pleased with this, and if you're an old Cher fan, you should already have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps my favorite civil war book","review":"This is by far the best book on one of the mose terrifying battles of the war. It's full of details, from indivdual regiments to General's personal thoughts. I read through it in no time, and quickly moved on to the following books in Rhea's series (this being my favorite). Rhea uses a wealth of primary sources and soldier's accounts to add flair to the excellent writing. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has an interest in the American Civil War"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating read.","review":"An exhaustively researched study by Mr. Rhea that puts you there with Generals Lee, Grant, Meade, ....etc. He also includes quotes from the letters and memiors of ordinary foot soldiers. The result is an incredible portrate of the American Civil War that makes it difficult to not feel like you are actually witnessing what took place during those bloody two days in May 1864."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed, Entertaining, Excellente!","review":"A refreshing and detailed book about some of the most intense and gruesome fighting of the war. I must ask when Mr.Rhea is going to turn out more of these outstanding summarys of Grant's overland campaign. It is to be applauded that this book ignores the pro-southern tilt than many works about the Civil War invariably manifest. Clearly this enlightened author is out to provide an account of what happened, not folklore. This book covers it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Battle Histories","review":"Since I agree with the other reviewers I will keep this short. I really enjoyed reading all of the books in this series. As a previous reviewer stated I was pulled into midst the battle as I read each chapter. Even though I knew the outcome the end of each chapter was a cliff hanger. I could not put this book down. Through the words and maps I was able to visualize the battle. This is an outstanding book. If you are interested in the CW you must read it (and all of the Overland Campaign books in this series)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Integration at it's BEST","review":"What a book to use with your classroom. I am a fifth grade teacher and use this book as part of a unit on Ecosystems. (Although you could use this with younger or older children) The book shows food webs in a way that any child could understand. The text is a poem with a predictable rhythm that my students LOVE. We use this story for 4 different activities, two are Language arts based, and two are Science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back On Track","review":"Relocating to New York, Mike Scott left behind his bog standard infatuation with Irish music and returned with this cracker that pushes a barrage of rock guitars and life affirming songs to the fore. Opener, 'The New Life', epitomised his new approach, whilst the wide-eyed rush of 'Glastonbury Song' and the mystical goofiness of 'Spiritual City', hinted at a new found spirituality. There's variety aplenty here, whether it be the country waltz of 'Corn Circles' or the feverish psychedelia of 'The Return of Jimi Hendrix'. Scott's an endearingly eccentric character with a vivid imagination. Keep on dreaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"long wait for a solid album","review":"It took the waterboys a long time to create something new but it was well worth the wait. The excitement when this album was released was intense at my home. I tried to explain it to my wife before the album came out-she'd only listened to the vinyl records a few times. They caught her imagination and now she too is hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterboys? Yeah!","review":"I first heard this album while driving across Canada on a school field trip. This isn't music you just listen to, it's music that you feel. Irish folk rockers who just play and sing what they feel. Hopefully, The new life, will start here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream harder, indeed!","review":"My only exposure to Mike Scott and the Waterboys was in the form of the two Celtic influenced romps, \\"Fisherman's Blues\\" and \\"Room to Roam.\\" So, when I tried to listen to the over-produced, cliché ridden, New Age pomp, feel-good, self-indulgent schlock that passes for music here, I was stunned.\\"Dream Harder\\" ranks up there as one of the all-time most annoying albums I've ever heard. No tired, overwrought, or slick contrivance was spared in recording this utterly unlistenable mess. And that doesn't even touch on lyrics here. You would be hard-pressed to pen stuff with more of a cringe factor than these words:Corn circlesMysterious symbols in the fieldsCorn circlesMysterious symbols in the fieldsNo one knows - are they phonyOr maybe are they real?Or these:Winter winter on the waybitter cold she bringWinter winter on the wayhard and deadly thing . . .Dream harder, indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst album ever. Listen to sample tracks.","review":"It's human nature to like upbeat reviews-- we're all in the mood to buy, and who wants to read a negative review? Yet, with apologies, I advise everyone to either pass on this CD, or to listen to the sample tracks first.When I purchased this CD and played it with my housemates, we were shocked at how formulaic and pop-sounding the songs were. This CD was a running joke for about a year... We would listen to the lyrics occasionally just to laugh at how stupid they were.I truly don't enjoy dissing others' creative works, but BUYER BEWARE. This CD is the pits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I bought Dream Harder after being quite impressed by Fisherman's Blues. Alas, this album had predictable lyrics (you can make a game out of guessing what the next line will be because the phrasing is so obvious), pretty but insipid and repetitive eurofolk music, and a total lack of soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Them's got cream cakes!","review":"A vivid and comic look at dour Britain in the early 50's, just as Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen) is about to get married. Local celebrations are hampered by food rationing - and a stolen pig becomes the centre of attention. Lizzie Smith as the old mum is brilliant, Richard Griffiths excellent (he is in \\"Withnail and I\\" too) and Dame Maggie Smith as Michael Palin's wife is just right.Denholm Eliot, as a local bigwig, is a revelation. Buy it! Pity it's not on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"For certain tastes only, but good Brit fun","review":"It's all about the Princess and the Pig in this bleak black comedy, which takes place in war-rationed England, circa 1947. The princess, only in a peripheral story, is Elizabeth; and the pig, who takes front and center, is Betty, a sow who's being illegally fatted for slaughter. She gets a second chance at life when someone (Michael Palin) steals her. Very dark comedy, not for the light-hearted!Staci Layne Wilson"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand why people find this funny","review":"I thought this film was boring. The mother in law is the only highlight amongst all the other uninteresting and undeveloped characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"The description given of the film on Amazon was enticing enough to buy it on sale. Despite a well of talent from which to draw in Michael Palin and Maggie Smith, as a comedy, it will generate a snicker or two, but the real laughs are utterly absent. If this film were an aircraft, it would never get off the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"British Humor","review":"Just not my cup of tea. Maybe when I watch it again I'll get into the mood and follow it more closely. An early work of Dame Maggie Smith. The theme is about how to raise yourself to a higher standing in a community and do it through the escapades of finding and cooking a pig. Whatever, I just expected more hilarity. How very American of me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All about a pig?","review":"Good performances and a fun story pity the transfer to Bluray doesn't match them. As always Maggie Smith gets the character spot on and Richard Griffith a delight to watch. Have watched this several times since it was released and still enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I also thought the story ended rather abruptly, almost noir-like. The ending, while cute, wasn't as satisfying as I was beginning to anticipate, thus a 4 star rating. Otherwise, the film does build interest as it goes, smouldering in the beginning but aquiring clarity and sense of direction as it continues - only to break off suddenly as you find your interest engaged. Either way, it is still a good, if short film at 92 minutes, with a subtle sense of humour and a recognizable cast who put in fine understated performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"This last Phil Rudd appearance in AC/DC (until \\"Ballbreaker\\") marked the beginning of the three weakest AC/DC albuns, along with FLy on the Walland \\"Blow Up Your VIdeo\\". It has bad production, a sense of Deja-Vu, Brian Johnson singing his worse. For Christ's sake, just listen to \\"For THose About..\\" and \\"Back in Black\\" to see the difference!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"This C.D is not what i'd call the best album AC/DC's made. There's Flick of the Switch, which is a decent sounding song, but after that it's really boring. I see many people puting this cd before Fly on the Wall, but I have to say that this is alot worse. Don't buy it unless u can get it cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Song and Dance","review":"While at this point, AC/DC had not hit their all time low in the \\"Dark Ages of Rock\\" ( the mid-80's ),it was drawing near and this shows it. With the release of \\"For Those About to Rock\\", the songs were still good, but sounded a little too similar. This album has only gotten worse,and more repetitive.AC/DC was clearly running out of ideas fast.While AC/DC did sve themselves in the early 90's with \\"The Razors Edge\\" this is just a little too low quality for AC/DC and way too repetitive, all the songs just seem to flow together..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is on fire!","review":"There seems to be an obsession with 'Back in Black' on the part of those listeners who are stuck in a time warp;'Flick of the Switch' is the post-Bon Scott album that comes closest to the glorious 70's era in terms of grooves,bitchy licks and attitude:if you ever tire of the black album, go for the white one instead,but handle with care:it's white hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"A great, under-rated album. I would put the tune \\"Flick of the Switch\\" up against ANY other metal song in the rock universe and dare you to find one that rocks harder.

Listen to it loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS IS AN AMAZING ALBUM!MOST SONGS ARE GREAT,THE BOYS ARE DOING GREAT .THIS IS MUCH DARKER THAN SOME OF THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS,ITS RAW AND TOUGH.THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AC/DC ALBUMS FOR SO MANY REASONS:BRIANS VOCALS ARE GREAT LIKE ALWAYS,GREAT CHORUS',ANGUS,CLIFF,AND MALS GUITAR WORK IS AWESOME,AND PHILS DRUMMING IS TOP NOTCH,HE IS ALSO THE BEST DRUMMER EVER I MIGHT ADD!! I MIGHT ADD ALSO HE ONLY DID HALF OF THE ALBUM,THAT BRINGS IT DOWN A BIT.THERE IS NO SONG UNDER 3 MINUTES,I DONT LIKE IT WHEN A SONG IS ONLY ABOUT 2 MINUTES.I RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like an album of rejects and half-dones...","review":"This isn't an awful album, but it sounds completely unfinished. The songs are just there... without making much of an impact. I think THIS is the album that influenced all those bad '80's heavy metal bands. I keep expecting to see the name Warrant rather than AC/DC in the credits. But no, it's AC/DC... It sounds like an album of filler. Not really necessary to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gods are still on Mount Olympus!!!!!!!!","review":"I've listened to this album for years. I believe this to be one of the best albums they ever made. They totally pushed all buttons themselves. This is for a true AC/DC fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Is Cool","review":"I think this is a good album. My personal favorites are \\"Flick of the Switch\\", \\"Bedlam in Belgium\\", and \\"Rising Power\\". Bedlam in Belgium is my favorite on the whole album. I still like this entire album, though. Brian Johnson does not screech like he does in The Razor's Edge(1990). This is a must-buy for AC/DC fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit the Switch","review":"This CD is explosive and every song on it is really good. Bedlam in Belgium and the title tracks are my favorite. Had Mutt Lange produced it, 10 million copies would have been sold instead of the 2M. Brian lost his voice completely after this CD. I think trying to sing high like Bon was never his strong suit. I think every fan wishes they would play one song off of here in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Like Fly on the Wall, this is often overlooked. It's a little short but I think it is one of their best post-Bon efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, Hard and Rocking","review":"Like Powerage, this is a great AC/DC album that hasn't gotten all the priase it deserves. It's the last album in which Brian Johnson has the full power of his voice and it shows the band making a definite shift from the bombast of \\"For Those About To Rock...\\", to a stripped down, straight-up, no nonsense affair. One could say all the songs sound alike (even by AC/DC standards) but that's THE POINT. Look at the simple black & white sketch cover and the running time of the songs/album. It's supposed to just hit you hard and get out of dodge...very punk rock aesthetic actually....although even the best punk never had a nasty groove like these cuts. Imagine if the song \\"Back In Black\\" just kept hitting you and hitting you, until you stuck up your hands and screamed, \\"I give up! You guys are the gods of rock.\\" That's Flick of the Switch.The last GREAT AC/DC album and easily the second best (right after Back In Black) of the Brian Johnson era. Buy it, crank it up and rock out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloweyelashwish is Ear-Candy for Shoegazers!!!","review":"This albumn is a must have for any fans of My Bloody Valentine and the Cocteau Twins! An amazing joyride through some lush and swirling sonic experiments. The melodies will haunt you like the voices of Angels in your dreams!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shut up and get it","review":"Absolutely incredible record. For years, I've been looking shoegaze more along the lines of My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive and only found records by Curve, Catherine Wheel, ride, etc, which were decent but very different from the Loveless-type sound i was looking for. In 2004, i discovered this. And it's better than Loveless.I thought long and hard before writing that. The 30 second samples don't do this justice. It has the doning guitar wash sound pattern of Loveless, but a sexy, goth-inspired (TASTEFUL goth) dream pop sound that follows no verse-chorus-verse structure like MBV, with completely spaced out sugary bursts of noise. That said, it's also surprisingly accessible (if you listened to Loveless, that is.) It's like Souvlaki, Loveless and In the Presence of Nothing all combined.Get the Lily's in the presence of Nothing also if you're looking for this sort of sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than My Bloody valentine","review":"Similar to MBV in its noise approach, LOvelies... focus more on daydreaming than MBV that have more rock n'roll attitude, other coolness, even sexyness that is absent here. In Bloweyelashwish is more virginal, pure, like the most ethereal moments from MBV and also Cocteau Twins or Flying Saucer Attack put together. The result is magnificent - this is one of the best ethereal-noise shoegazer whatever record i had ever put my ears on. Fantastic noise landscapes, here and then with an angelic female voice, down there, back there, where the horizon ends. Perfect listen to trip our minds. Put it next to Victorialand, Loveless and all your Flying Saucer Attack records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This is a good vampire book, plus the fact you get two stories in one book. I liked it and will keep in my stash. Not many books rate a 5 with me, so a 4 is a definite good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good vampire romance series","review":"I loved Kiss Me Forever. Yes, there are a couple of discrepancies, but the book as a whole is so wonderful, that they don't matter much. Christopher (or Kit) and Dixie are terrific characters, their romance is believable, Laurey's vampire world is intriguing, and the suspense is just right. Expertly done. 5 stars.Love Me Forever is not quite as good, leading to the lower overall rating. While Laurey spent a great deal of effort making the setting realistic (I currently reside in the area), the characters and especially the suspense were not quite as well-developed. More to the point, there are many editing errors -- some small like typos and some huge, like saying one thing but doing another or saying something had happened that that not. These things really mar an otherwise fine story and keep it from being as good as the first. Pity, Justin deserved better. Still, it's a good read, and Kiss Me Forever is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes but they were dashed....","review":"I have been looking for a new Vampire series and came across this two in one book and thought I would give it a try. I can honestly say this is not going to be a new series for me. It is soooo boring. I can barely get through it. The action...well what action?? The love story is nonexistent. There is absolutely no chemistry between the Vampires and their lady loves. and really what is the chance that both women end up dying so soon after they meet the Vampires causing them to be turned?? Belch! Horrible horrible books. Do not reccommend at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Wonderful Romances In One Book!!!","review":"This is the first time I've ever read Ms Laurey and needless to say it won't be the last! This read combined two full length stories that tie to each other and introduce us to some really yummy hero's that the reader is sure not to forget once the final page is read!Ms. Laurey has taken the vampire legend and made it her own. Add to this fun characters, some nasty villans, and truly great romantic tension and the reader is set for an all encompassing read. Ms. Laurey truly has a wonderfully unique voice and her vampire romances are some of the best I've read in awhile. Justin, Christopher, Dixie, and Stella are characters the reader will enjoy. Secondary characters only add to the wonderful cast of characters. This book is truly worth picking up and I suggest adding it to your summer reading list.Official Reviewer for Romance Designs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book!","review":"Inconsistent story line, awkward dialog between characters, luke-warm love story... not much good I can say about this book.

She's now given us yet another gift--this one a journey through the Advent Season. Her songs are prayerful, hopeful and offer us an opportunity to turn inward and meditate. In these frenetic times, filled with too many obligations and commitments, this album should be in every car, and in every home...simply put it on and allow the melodies, rhythms and messages pervade us and persuade us to focus upon the true meaning of this season--this season of hope--this season of the coming Savior!

Wright. The book takes some of the major topics of debate head on, allowing Borg and Wright to articulate their own conflicting positions on such important questions as the resurrection of Jesus, Jesus' self-perception, Jesus' relationship with God, and the virgin birth. The conflicting essays, while brief, offer helpful glimpses into the process by which Jesus scholars reconstruct quite different pictures of the historical Jesus.

The \\"secret\\" of the book was obvious from the start, the plot was disjointed, the characters were unbelievable and bland. Many loose ends were not tied up. The meaning of Judaism in the characters' lives was not shown except for the mention of letters in Yiddish and various Jewish foods and holidays.

Let's all hope that Ms. Goldman gives us more wonderful writing to read in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who know the \\"territory,\\" a heartwarming read","review":"Judy Goldman speaks in a voice that resonates with me. I loved this book, and I have recommended it to several of my close friends. It is the story of a woman's emerging identity in her fifties within the context of her family relationships and her growing understanding of them as she matures. Perhaps because I am about the same age as the protagonist, and I am also a psychologist, the territory the novel explores is very familiar to me. I thought that the characters were exceptionally well-drawn, and I was surprised to find that other readers were not uniformly positive about this book. Perhaps my world view, like the protagonist's, has been shaped as much by the places I have lived as it has been by my family of origin and its traditions. In the same way that I love Rebecca Wells' writing, in part for her evocation of a time and place with which I am intimately acquainted, I loved this book.

This includes a love story that takes place in two different lifetimes as Miro and his soulmate, Heather, fight to first find each other and then to not repeat their mistakes. Although Miro is trying to avoid the specter of his dead father and the destiny he fortold, the heart of this story is a love story. Everything in the first two sections is a setup to part three which is impossible to put down.A great story and it has many spiritual messages, some hidden and some quite obvious. Can Miro change his destiny and live happily ever after? You'll have to read it to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I THOUGH IT WOULD BE","review":"Unfortunately the book did not hold my interest the way I had hoped.It was not bad for an unknown writer, but not above what you would find in any entry level college writing class.The storyline was an ok idea, but the idea was lost in the translation to the page.

New Age or not, this album conveys what music is all about. Much like Yes' frontman Jon Anderson did with Vangelis back in the eighties, he now sings with Kitaro in this beautiful production which borrows a little bit from the musical spirits of these moderm day geniuses. There is not one song that stands out: the entire album is worth listening to once and again. Get it, and listen to it with the lights off. You'll be transported!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful.","review":"I bought this CD on a whim because I liked Jon Anderson, although I had never listened to anything by Kitaro before. I was blown away. This is simply some of the most beautiful, transporting music I have ever heard: mysterious and vast (Symphony of the Forest, A Passage of Life), delicate and ethereal (A Drop of Silence), exotic and stimulating (Agreement, Magical Wave).

I recommend this book only to the unenlightened and moronic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change your life! The masquerade is over!","review":"This book exposes how satan uses the New Age to entrap God's people with the ultimate goal of destroying them. All these psychic hotlines and crystal healings, and candle burning are tools of satan. Many of us believe that there's no danger in these things, and some people are so decieved, they believe these things to be of God. But it's not just for fun, it's part of a deadly war. Rev. Hardy reveals with eloquence and honesty how satan wants to destroy each and ever one of us and how he's using the New Age to do it. This is a must read for evryone. Believe it or not, there are some very common things that people do, i.e. reading the horoscope, that are deceptive tools of satan. Don't get caught in his trap. Rev.

I would give this album two stars, but the six bonus tracks are so good, they make this disc worth the $18 I paid for it. These six tracks have the authentic Afro-Latin sound that put New Yorican bands on the map.

I maintained this open mind when I popped Mindwarp into the VCR and was pleased with how entertaining and good this movie turned out to be. Set in post-apocalyptic times when most of humanity lives in a virtual-reality dream-state, it features a woman who desires a \\"real\\" life and, as a result, is outcast to a hostile wasteland. Bruce Campbell is excellent as the \\"hero\\" who rescues her from the elements and the wasteland inhabitants -- cannibals. Angus Scrimm (from the Phantasm films) is delightful as the demented underworld cannibal leader. It may sound strange (text on the back of the box gives little insight about the film), but the movie has a very good plot, good special effects and some surprises that easily place this movie in the \\"own\\" category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"Mind Warp is a very fun movie to watch, it stars Bruce Campbell(Evil Dead), and Angus Scrim(Phantasm). Mind Warp is a very unusual movie. It takes place in the future and all or most of mankind is living in a dream. Until one courageous women breaks free and discovers Bruce Campbell in the \\"Dead Lands\\" and then the two are caputured mutant cannibals, and brought to become slaves for Angus Scrim(the leader and father of the girl). Some parts in the movie are rather gross, but this movie is very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most intelligent book ever written about religion","review":"Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion is by far the most fascinating and critical look at religion I have ever read. The work is extremely well thought-out and, in my opinion, unbiased as well. As the editor, J.C.A. Gaskin, points out, Hume, in expressing points of view opposing to his own, portrays these views accurately and succeeds in anticipating his oponents' counter-arguments.Second to the magnificence of Hume's ideas, the greatest thing about this book (and Hume's work in general) is the complete clarity of his writing and the ease with which the reader can follow the logical progression of his ideas.I consider Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion to be Hume's greatest work. Regardless of your personal beliefs, Hume will make you re-think your views about religion and the universe.Very highly recommended to all, skeptics and non-skeptics alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic of theological skepticism","review":"Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion are the classic, and most damaging criticism of the tenets of natural theology. His refutation of the argument by design contained in the first nine chapters of the Dialogues and the 11th chapter in the Enquiry anticipated William Paley's watch analogy 20 years before it was published, and refutes it masterfully. The language, however, is somewhat difficult at times, and Hume's personal convictions about the subject matter are questionable, as he often contradicts hiself. These contradictions, however, can be taken as either sarcasm, or a response to the immense pressure placed on him by the church, and do not detract from the overall power of the works"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"CR's first release is a classic, and well worth your time.

Barthes perforates the being of the text, he pinpoints the ineffability of the greatness of the truly great writers. He writes about Nietzsche, about Sade, about Flaubert, and many others. Unlike the general dynamic of French post-modernity and post-structuralism, Barthe's style and tone are unusually playful and entertaining. This treatise flows with the lucid readability of a good William Carlos Williams poem.Barthes relates reading to orgasm (petite mal=small death in Lacanian terms), reading is related to the act of striping, to seduction.\\"The pleasure of the text is not the pleasure of the corporeal striptease or of narrative suspense\\" (pg. 10).\\"I am interested in language because it wounds or seduces me\\" (pg.38)And this text will seduce you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to understand, philosophy and technique of Aikido!","review":"Quite simply one of the finest Aikido texts available.

There are techniques that one would not usually found taught in many North American dojo, and a heavy emphasis on the Japanese terminology that accompany them. These facts make the book a valuable addition to any martial artist's library. Some minor editing mistakes and the lack of a personal approach to aikido by the author make it also one of the least motivating books on aikido I have read. Hopefully the Doshu (Ueshiba) will have the book edited at least one again, and will accompany the current text with some more personalized reflections of what aikido has meant to him personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game Holders","review":"How much can you say about plastic xbox 360 game holders, they work great and fit nicely in my area I have made for my Xbox 360.

So this is a way for them to be independent and for me not to be paranoid about their hurting the disks. Having said that, there does seem to be one drawback. The skins work better on new or unblemished disks. If the disk is already a little scratched, the device seems less able to read the disk with a skin on. However, I have never had a problem with a new disk. So it may be that the skin does add a little interference which only serves to magnify any problem the disk has. I still give it 5 stars because it's such an awesome product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work in Xbox, Laptop and some data cd's!!!!!","review":"I bought these in hope that they would be the great thing that they are advertised to be.

It wouldn't even read the disk and it sounded like my laptop was an airplane taking off due to my cd drive frantically trying to read the disk to no avail. On a desktop computer, it will read some data disks with the d-skin on it, but it's slow. You won't be watching an mpg or vcd movie with the d-skin on for instance. I don't know how well they work on a cd player with musical cd's, but anything else is definately out. Since I am an mp3 man, I have no need to play music cd's, so I haven't tried them.

I don't understand why so many people are down on this movie. It has a lot of action, and is pretty suspenseful, granted there are better movies out there, but this is a very good one in its own right.A boat full of people are making a documentary about a lost South American tribe. The group happens upon a skitsofrenic who is oppsesed with capturing this gigantic snake. He eventually takes over the boat. This leads up until the very end: a showdown between Jenifer Lopez, a giant snake, and Jon Voight.Don't let anyone fool you, this is a very good movie, not the best, but still very good.

After I watched i I was well pleased. The giant maneating snake well carried the show. Jon Voight in the role of the villain was outstanding. The filming crew were very good also. The special effects in this movie were also outstanding. The snake victims being swallowed whole was pretty good photography. The scene with Jon Voight was exceptional. The scenery in this movie also added to the quality of the movie.Ifyou are squeamish about snakes don't watch this movie.All in all this was a very entertaining movie. Watch it.

I gave this movie 2 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jungle Thriller","review":"Anaconda is an excellent jungle thriller set in the Amazon River. The huge and scary man-eating snake is making life hell on earth for a team of people in search of a rare Indian tribe along the Amazon River.This is an action packed film, full of suspense and has some excellent special effects.

If you like action movies, you might like it, I thought it was alright. It's not as bad as a lot of people say it is, but it's not great either. Jon Voight does the best job of all of them playing the villain that just wants to catch a huge snake for money. The reasons I didn't like it as much as some of the other good action movies was because you could definitely tell the snakes were fake and the crew fought each other more than they did the snake. But other than that, it's not too bad of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst horror movie since Orca","review":"This is the worst horror movie I have seen since Orca. The snake looks cheesy and you can tell it is fake especially at the end when It comes down from the celling. It has some corney gag in it and very little gore.There is one nasty party when the anadaconda regregates the hunter and he winks at the girl. The snake catching on fire and moving is interesting but cheezy.If you like snake horror movies I recommend you King Cobra which is a little better than Anaconda. The best choice are Python, Phyton II and boa."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie bites.","review":"Ok, it's not all that bad. In truth, it's probably exactly what you would expect. Jon Voight takes a stab at playing the snake hunting scum-bag, while pretending to help out. Eric Stoltz is fine, but not around much. Jennifer Lopez does the same job as any non-actor could. Ice Cube more or less plays himself. Owen Wilson who normally is hilarious, never really even cracks a joke in this one. Kari Wuhrer I like, but she never shows any skin, which she normally does in movies. Another let down. As for the snake, it's part rubber, and part computer graphics, but never that realistic. The whole group is in the jungle to shoot a documentary before they get into snake trouble. In short, if you enjoy movies with giant spiders, rats, crocodiles, or bats, you should like this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!","review":"This movie is pretty stupid and unbeilvable, the snakes don't look real, John Voight played a great bad guy as always, that's the only thing going for it, J.Lo gave a C performance as always, Ice Cube was annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I have seen real anacondas, I have pet real anacondas.

If you're an ice cube or j.lo fan then don't watch this movie watch:All About the Benjamins or Barbershop for an Ice Cube movieorEnough and Angel Eyes for a Jennifer Lopez movie.Those are highlight movies for the both of them.DON'T, i repeat DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANACONDA","review":"THIS MOVIE WAS COOL THE SNAKE LOOKS SO COOL.

It was pretty funnythe way he describes how \\"The damn thing went beserk and started tearing up the set\\". I'm sure anyone not involved with the animatronics dept. was highly amused by this incident.I'll stop the review right here,I recommend this movieyou'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of slimy fun!","review":"People who didn't like this movie should realize it's SUPPOSED to be campy.

Just turn your brain off, and everything bad about this movie will go right past you."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST PLAIN STUPID","review":"Okay if you want to see Jennifer Lopez earlier in her career wearing next to nothing this is your movie. If you like the idea of Ice Cube as a documentary filmmaker, well, this is your thing too. If you like seeing Jon Voight (weird actor and father of Angelina Jolie) playing evil, well, this is your thing. If you relish the idea of Eric Stoltz clinging to life in the hull of a ship while his exploration and anthropological filmmaking crew floats along the Amazon looking for an indigenous tribe of people only to encounter evil Jon Voight and a vicious, ridiculous Anaconda snake that looks bigger than a few football fields, well, here you go. There are things for everyone here. But not for me. This film is sooooooooo utterly stupid.

I saw the film about 6 months ago, and I wanted to take time to make sure i disliked it before I trashed it. I can't lie - it's terrible. I really like Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy), but his acting in this film is pathetic. Obviously, he needed the work. The plot is cheap imitation, the acting is just sad (yes, even jennifer lopez), and the special effects are unforgiveable. This film was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't make films like this! Jon Voight you're awful!","review":"There should be strict guidelines to ensure films like this never get made!

It's so damn corny. Ice Cube can't act worth a damn. I couldn't even sit through the whole thing. I had to see the ending on HBO. Damn I wish I never saw the ending. It's so damn fake.

Eric Stolz and Jon Voight, not to mention Ice Cube and Owen Wilson, must've REALLY needed the money to make this. Still, there's something perversely endearing about John Voight's character, and he's the only one who's really acting in this thing, and looking like he's having a hell of a good time doing it. Jennifer Lopez, on the other hand, considering her talent level, was as good in this as she's been in any of her films ... in other words, squarely mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY DID!!!

I can't say there was much acting at all (no, that's not exactly true, the snake did give a half-way decent performance).

The best thing about the film is the not- all-that convincing computer graphics...in short: utter garbage!If you have escaped seeing ANACONDA thus far, consider yourself blessed.

In fact, you need a NEGATIVE rating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun classic horror flick, better than average acting with exception of the snake","review":"One of my favorite classic \\"B\\" rated horror films. The storyline is a bit more creative than most of the films in this genre, and the action and danger levels remain high from beginning to end. A group head out on a boat into the Amazon to film a documentary about a lost South American tribe and end up doing battle with giant anaconda.Jon Voight seems ideally suited to the role of the creepy bad guy. Other familiar cast members who manage to elevate the quality of the dialogue include Owen Wilson, Ice Cube and Jennifer Lopez. Also, if you're a CGI junkie and just really get into the spectacular special effects in so many of today's action/horror flicks, then the giant anaconda in this film may seem comical in comparison to current standards. But again, take it for what it is and you'll have a good time watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty pleasure","review":"This is just one of the guilty pleasures I enjoy from time to time.BUT, I just ordered this from Amazon and while it said it was thewidescreen edition, the full screen edition was shipped.Now, there isn't a separate listing for a full screen on this siteso I'm at a loss as to what to do next, can't very well order it againas I'd probably get another full screen edition to return all over again.G2"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice attacks but lame movie","review":"i kind of liked the movie but it wasint that good attacks were nice but the movie was boring i dont think the movie is not worth it to buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"I love any movie with Jon Voight with the exception of Anaconda. John Voight has acted in classics such as Deliverence and Midnight Cowboy. Why on earth would he agree to act in this movie. I read the case in the video store and it sounded like a very exciting and suspenseful movie. Boy was I wrong!! I think that this movie would have been much better without the extremely fake looking special effects. Also I think that if the script and direction would have been better thought out then this movie would have been watchable. The premise was there but it was ruined by poor production. This could have been a really cool movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaws of the 90s","review":"It's an outstanding original production of its kind. I wish the movie shows more floral & fauna around the great amazon basin and not too much focus on the snake. Fireflies were nice, a wild boar, tiger & wasp. And what about piranhas and wild flowers? They're part of the wild life, too. Anyway, the movie has its purpose to terrify viewers that anacondas kill and eat their prey including MAN?!? Jennifer Lopez shines in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"FantasticDan and Bugster say \\"J Lo is hot, movie is not\\"","review":"At long last Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube team up to make one of the greatest thrillers of all time. Ok, that is an overstatement, a tremendous overstatement. In fact the only reason it got two stars is because we found it to be so bad its good. Plus J Lo's not bad looking. Jon Voights overacts and speaks with a very strong fake-sounding acent in the irritating role of the villian/snake hunter. As far as giant snake movies go Anacondas at the top but its a really short list. All it beats is made for video [junk] like Python. If you need to see a movie in which Jon Voights is regurgitated out of a giant snake rent it, otherwise stay clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOTTA C THIS MOVIE,","review":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE U JUST HAVE TO SEE IT.

John Vioght (spelled his last name wrong dang!) and his fake...accent will have you laughing if not gaging. He talks like he's a carny at a cheap mall lot carnival and the snakes ah' the anacondas!

Voight's campy accent is a distraction from the shallow characters and plotting. The snake is unconvincing besides. It's a known fact (trust me on this one) that no snake on Earth is fast enough to catch a running human being. Ignoring this, the snake is computerized in too obvious a way (and is too big and moves too rapidly)for it to raise any chills. Like I said before, ANACONDA has no merit save John Voight, and is likely to be forgotten in the next 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather be squeezed to death than watch this again!","review":"This \\"movie\\" deserves 0 stars. It is extremely cheesy. The actors are about as horrible as any B,C,D,or Z movie. while watching I was hoping a snake would slither out of the TV screen and bite my genitals, while injecting them full of painfull venom. I rented this movie back in the day, and all I can remember about this movie is it sucked really bad, and they spent way too much time on that lousy raft/boat.I bought a lot of laserdiscs, and to my dismay, this movie was in the pile....I will never tarnish my laserdisc's heritage by subjecting such a block-buster flop to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know the kids will yell at me","review":"Sorry. I can't go higher than 1 star. This film was bad! The snake was scary IF you're five years old! And I was surprised to see veteran stars in this such as Jon Voight.

Good detail of the terrain, but would have liked more consistent information on trail distances in km. Distances are recorded in hours it takes to hike each segment, which is a standard that the other maps of the park use. However, the times given were a good estimate of the time it takes to hike each part of the trail. What isn't clear from any of the maps is the difficulty or rough conditions of many of the trails. In general, trekking in the park is moderately challenging, but the condition of many of the trails (rocky, steep, and/or highly eroded in places) makes it more so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great map","review":"Used this on our trek to Torres del Paine.It was our favorite map- we had to others- but this one is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good map, but...","review":"Generally this would be a very good map. Has a nice contour every 100 meters. That gives you instant idea about the terrain you going to travel thru. It is a trekking map, so I expect that the trekking features are well exposed. Trails are very well exposing in bright yellow color. The distance is mark in hours. Lakes, glaciers, peaks and valleys are clear to read and easy to find. All names are in nice big font, except Camping's. I do have a problem to find them and some of them are totally invisible. The font is too weak and too small. Careful, it is printed on a semi gloss paper, rips easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"research only","review":"This map is enormous. Don't expect to take it with you.

His life was dedicated to his students. He was kindness personified. as a retired teacher I read it with great interest. His humility was his crowning virtue. It is a well written biography although being older (about 1928) it is somewhat dated. Dean Briggs introduced journaling way back then and I always thought it was quite new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive information source on Helen Keller","review":"This hefty book is probably the definitive source of information about Annie Sullivan and Helen Keller, all of their foibles included. It includes everything you could possibly want to know, with four sections of photos and reproductions of their original letters. The author must have done exhaustive research, to compile so much into one place.I found it interesting that when the Gibson play was written, so much was factually correct and taken directly from Annie's letters and Helen's memories. Even the dining room knock down/drag out over table manners (with a little dramatic license taken, I'm sure).Interested in the full story of Helen Keller? You'll find everything you ever wanted to know in this huge volume - and more! Give yourself a week or two to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helen & Teacher: The Story Of Helen Keller And Anne Sullivan","review":"It's an interesting book and well written. It is rather lengthy which is fine in most books. But in this book I find after reading for awhile it becomes tedious because of all the personal letters which is what most of the book consists about.

The argument that \\"X says Y, but he's pretentious so don't listen to him.\\" I bought this to read for a book group and our response was pretty similiar. While it persuade me to sit down and read the Bible more regularly it didn't teach me much about \\"the art of spiritual reading\\". It just told it was important to be grounded in the scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Introduction to Lectio Divina","review":"In many ways the entire book is a discourse on the need for lectio divina.

However, this book rates right up there at the top of them all. In fact, I intend to immediately read it again. It can be used as a devotional. It is very illuminating concerning the art of Scripture translation. I learned so much I didn't know. I also love Peterson's Bible translation, \\"The Message.\\" In \\"Eat This Book,\\" he explains how his contemporary translation came about.

It is also good for beginners who need to start slowly. To increase the workout, she uses hand weights. She shows you ways to increase the \\"burn\\" for those who wish to get more out of the exercising. Its a good exercise video for anyone, but I think for those advanced you may be disapointed in how short and simple it is. The one thing I loved about the video is the fact that I don't need a lot of room! I was able to excercise to the video in about a 4 ft x 4 ft area! You truely can even utilize the video if you only have the floor space for your own marching feet! The video can be adapted well for beginners or advanced, and if you have a lot of room or none at all. I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie's at it again!","review":"As someone who has not exercised in a bit and needs a nice way to get started, this video works well. I alternate it with another by Leslie for balance. She starts off by going through the basic steps, gets into the workout, gradually adds weights and then gives a cool-down. If you go to the gym regularly, this may be a little light for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, fast workout","review":"I enjoyed this workout very much. It's only 20 minutes long and seems to fly by, which is nice when you have a limited amount of free time. Leslie is pleasant to listen to and is a great motivator.I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the video tape itself, though. It was staticky and a bit hard on the eyes near the end of the workout (this was the tape itself, though, not the workout) and this was only on the first viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic work out for hips and thighs!!!","review":"Leslie does it all with this one!

Like so many others, I paid an arm and a leg for my tickets for Opening Day at on an online auction site. And like so many others, I thought it was totally worth the cost. Although the Reds had a terrible season because of injuries and an embarrassing ownership group, the team did \\"go all out\\" for the Opening Day festivities.For those of you expecting a detailed history of the tax increase, the ballpark construction and the companies involved -- this isn't exactly that type of book. Although it has a chapter on the buildingof the ballpark, most of it's devoted just to Opening Day.I really wish this book had some sample pages on amazon so that other people could see the type of photography in this book. There are some great shots of Barry Larkin, former President Bush, Marty and Joe, panoramic shots of the ballpark, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable book","review":"This was a great book about the first day at the Reds new ballpark, Great American Ball Park. Unfortunately, I thought it would be a book about the financing, architecture, details of the construction, etc. Although an opening chapter does hit on these topics - I was hoping for a little more.I do have some other complaints. Some of the photos in the book look a little dark and fuzzy. Also, I was hoping more of the book would have been devoted to the players and their reactions to the ballpark.So why give it 4 stars?Though the book wasn't necassarily what I expected, it was still really interesting. There were great photos from inside the clubhouse, the restaurants, fans, the parade and even the implosion of Cinergy Field - as well as neat tidbits about the whole day. I have it sitting in my living room, and its the first thing our guests pick up. Though a little pricey, its surely worth it to any Reds fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Scream Museum","review":"I thought the Scream Museum was a slow, boring book.

This would be ok if it where up to date stuff, but it is soooo old. Completely worthless if you want to know about the area, or plan a trip.

His father was sent to kill him and instead saved him from another daemon who had him in chains and was torturing him for a year.Somehow or another this is a detective novel as well. As usual in that genre your client is lying to you. The extent of the lie is breathtaking.What I find interesting in this book is that the morality of daemons is explored rather well. If you were 10+ billion years old, how would you view humans?The level of emoting in the book is higher than I would want. The switches between the daemon as friend to daemon to deadly enemy and back are awe inspiring. One minute the female daemon is threatening to utterly destroy Evan and the next she is having rapacious sex with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"This was a good book. The biggest thing wrong with it is that I kept thinking there was a book before it I should have read. It keeps refering to events in the past, like I should already know of it. I eventually figured it out, but I think that this one should have been a sequel, not a first book. I would recommend it to most people though, it is a good book. They run a detective agency, and all of them seem to be trying to figure out why they like Evan. Kevin is struggling to understand his paternal feelings. Lily occasionally gets confused by her emotions for Evan. Even Evan is trying to figure out why he wants to stay alive. Meanwhile, you are trying to figure out why they don't know.

That seems to be the author's big problem too: the book reads like some of the worst sequel novels I've seen, where the first hundred pages are spent explaining, in unlovely prose, what happened in the first book. In this case, there was no first book, but the author presents his characters in that manner anyway. The narrative moves with the speed of frozen molasses -- when it isn't moving backwards. Then there are the characters themselves. Billion-year-old daemons who are as tempramental and un-self-controlled as two- year-old kids. This is just really, really stupid stuff.

The fact it is black and white enhances the chilling horror. \\"Titanic\\" suffers from a bad script and awful acting, most notably from DiCapprio, who is simply one of the worst actors of this time.

There is only one historical flaw, however. There are some scenes where you see smoke coming out of all 4 funnels of the ship. In reality, the fourth funnel was artificial.

I am not knocking it, but I do not think sex,like in this movie, should be shown to young viewers. PG-13? Should be R for sure. Unless you feel you must cheapen your dignity, don't buy this video. Why doesn't the film industry make technical AND dramatic classics? All the old visual and spectacular plotline movies, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, are just considered old junk heaps now.

For a person like me, however, obsessed with treats such as the deleted scenes, this is a great addition to your DVD collection. There is over 45 minutes of deleted scenes on the 3rd disc. On the 2nd disc is an alternate ending, which is about 7 minutes in length, if I remember correctly. So, combined, deleted scenes run about 54 minutes . . .While I own Titanic on VHS, the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD, and now the Collectors Edition, if a new set were to be released with the movie in it's full original epic glory of 5+ hours, I would probably run out and be one of the first to own it.

The characters were just cutouts, two dimentional and without depth. I felt no sympathy for any of them when the boat went down, just a sense of relief that this long winded tear jerker was almost over.Lowest common denominator story-telling at its finest.I'm really saddened that Cameron would unleash this \\"disaster\\" on us.

Though I do agree this should be rated 'R' for the profanity and sexualality. Definitly a movie that you should watch because this is something that really happened. In my point of view, James Cameron was trying to let the world recognize TITANIC as a tragic, painful, and memorable night, not only to the survivors but so that everyone could see how a few hours can change your entire lives. If you are one who are rating this movie a one or two star, you probably did not like the script, but you have to admit, it is a sad thing right?

This was supposed to be a love story. What? Two teenagers doing so many immoral things - on a ship? Once again, the Titanic sinking was a real tragedy, but why just make the movie worse by making it appeal to teens that will fall in love with the movie and see it 20 times.

I thought the movie should have stayed on the tragedy aspect & not the love aspect. If we want to see a love story there is Sleepless in Seattle & Hope Floats. James Cameron however did depict very well the cruelness of the rich to leave the poor & servants on the ship. He also depicted with terrible reality the horror of being in the middle of a freezing ocean, no way of escape & knowing your fate of doom. The poor children dying. It was so very sad. The characters could have been written better. The first movie is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I thought this was the most stupid movie ever made. Seriously. It made me cry a lot. But, maybe this was because my mom wouldn't let me out of the theater so I could get away from that monstrosity. I hated this movie.

I hate fiction and facts mixed together. But here it is used in a tragic historical fact. The very idea is sickening. Well, the wrong ones made the money and we fell for it. Thanx to Hollywood who also fell for it. And to me the best they ever did was putting Ben-hur up there. But now they killed it all. I never believe in awards anywheres, cause the best is always forgotten. But I had given credit to Hollywood, not now. How does this sound - saw the movie \\"Life is beautiful\\" when it was released here. We were only 8 of us in the theater! The moment Hollywood / press pumped it up - we all think it's the best.

Maybe it's because the boat sinks, a story device which, I for one, didn't see coming. James Cameron (writer-director) decided to sink the boat!I also liked the love story. I thought it was totally convincing that a girl would meet a guy on a two day cruise and love him forever.The end was also very satisfying dramatic tension.

I would have given it maybe 3 stars based on it being a sappy story with impressive effects and excellent costumes and set design.HOWEVER - this movie has the most atrocious, mindless, badly written dialogue of all time. It was NOT in any way true to the period which was not only incredibly distracting but it would have been SO easy to fix. It was badly paced, badly acted and grated on my nerves to the point where at the end, when Leonardo does the cannonball to the bottom of the Atlantic, I had to laugh out loud!

Of course the academy would choose this film best picture for '97, all the 3-hour long \\"epics\\" win best picture, even if they're terrible, like this one. The film is really slow moving and actually quite depressing during the last hour. And how on earth did this movie pass with a PG-13 rating???? There's lots of explicit nudity, violence and language. Forget this film - it's just hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was way to overrated!","review":"This is the most overrated movie of all time! The romance between Jack and Rose was way too unrealistic. They just met and only knew eachother for four days! They can't be in love. Parts of this movie were way out of the time line. No one who wasn't married made out in 1910's. That was only added so it could get a PG-13 rating. I can't believe all the awards it won or being the best movie ever! There are much better movies, even movies about the titanic. I'll admit, the boat sinking was pretty cool, but there are more interesting stories about boats sinking than one that wasn't supposed to sink. Most of the movie is so boring I almost fell asleep. Thank God it isn't popular anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Titanic waste of time and money","review":"To put it simply, the cinematography was great, but the acting, plot, and casting was pathetic. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I will admit that the sinking ship special effects were nice, but other than that, this movie wasn't even worth watching. The movie was long and drawn out with a shallow plot. This was more of a special effects showcase than an epic love story. How in the world did this get nominated for an Academy Award, much less win. And my final discrepancy about the movie was its acting. Poor, bad, boring, inadequate, terrible, unintellectual, anile, and just plain stupid acting made this movie even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Source of All Evil In the Universe?","review":"Trite, boring, formulaic, eye candy with neither soul nor wit. I GET ANGRY when I think about this piece of trash. Angry that so much money was wasted on this infantile pabulum. Angry that it was so well received at the box office. Angry that it garnered all those undeserved Oscars which should have gone to better films. And above all, angry at its bad example; that the greatness of a movie should not be measured by its budget. Did James Cameron sell his soul for his success? It would explain both the film's artlessness and its good fortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanic: The Movie That Sunk","review":"This movie is the worst rendition of the sinking of the Titanic. The story was taken from all of the other Titanic movies and was hazerdly thrown together. It was over acted, and had several imposable sceens including the rescue of the hero by the girl(she closed her eyes and used the force)and the sceen where he puts her over the other side of the safty rail...(self explanitory) In short the worst Camren movie yet!

I can't imagine what all the fuss and hype were about after seeing the video. The two leads had no chemistry whatsoever and the dialogue was laughable. (Really, we were howling at times.) Kate Winslet is a wonderful actress but she couldn't overcome this mess. However, to be fair, the costuming was lovely. Really the best part of the film. Why do people rave about this film???"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing \\"Titanic\\" about this movie","review":"When the \\"Titanic\\" craze first began, I was eager to see the widely-declared film. However, when I did finally view the film, the film sunk just like the Titanic, in my mind. What was the big deal about this film? I thought it was unrealistic, childish, and very soap-opera style. Maybe the director should air the film on NBC's daily soap operas. I've seen better movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!","review":"The most over-hyped movie of the century.

Not only did it drag for 3+ hours and that song....I mean come on its okay to hear the thing maybe once or twice a day but every five minutes? I was FORCED to see it by a friend and I have to say that the only good thing about the whole experience was that I got to take a 2 hour nap....then i woke up by the noise of the boat sinking and the idiot behind my seat sobbing because Jack was dying or whatever...I mean I was sitting there for 3+ hours waiting for the ... boat to sink so I can go home and sleep.....And for the record I was 16 at the time and I still thought it [was bad]!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT STINKS","review":"Horrible.

The only problem was during a scene with Jack and Rose taking a walk on the deck, there was a little speck or a sort of flicker in the corner of the picture. Considering this, Titanic is definately the worst movie ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I rate it below one?","review":"From the very begining I cannot to see Leo drowing down into the deep frozen and blue sea.

If I were the car's owner where the disgusting love scene happens I will be happy that the Titanic remained under the water.About Leo's paintings.

I will never watch it again and will certainly never own it!!! Just a shame i cant give negative stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic is the best movie!","review":"What's wrong with you people? Titanic is a great movie I thought. The special effects were awesome and I thought Leonardo DiCaprio gave his best performance at the end of the movie.

I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic movie review","review":"[...]I watched this movie and really enjoyed it. It was quite a long movie, but you don't realize it while you're watching it because the storyline is so compelling. The acting was superb, I like Leonardo DiCaprio and wasn't familiar with Kate Winslet until the debut of this movie. The wonderful special effects make it seem so realistic. Computer animation was well done. The movie was meant to tell a love story despite the tragedy itself. I was, as most women who watched the movie, emotionally touched and moved when the story came to a close. It was a heart-warming and heart-wrenching all at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic Review","review":"Titanic is a great movie that takes you on a journey through time. It is a fantastic movie and well recognized since it won 11 academy awards and has the box office record. The movie makes you feel like you were on that ship, with all the costume design, the drama and the faithfulness to the actual tragedy where nearly 1500 people died either from drowning or freezing in the water. This movie goes beyond anyone's expectation and put Leonardo Dicaprio's career up on a pedestol and hes been on cloud 9 since then. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Romantic Film Revolving Around Class","review":"Just like my title said, it is a great romantic film about class. I love it because it shows race is not always the issue that Americans make it out to be. And I also love it because it shows that some 'white' names are hard to pronounce. Yes, as a Nigerian my name is often butchered in America (I have an English name, but when I became enlightened it took a backseat to my African name) and this is proof that 'white' names are not all easy to pronounce. This movie shows that love is a universal subject no matter what race and some 'white' people are poor. In Nigeria, because of misinformation by the media, the general consensus is that every 'white' person is rich but thanks to Jack I now know that you have your own poor people and sometimes you need our help."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"i have to say that anyone giving this movie 5 stars is BLIND to the fact that this movie is just like every hollywood movie. a lot of time and effort was put in this, but what about feeling? NONE. it's just eye candy for the guys, and a cheesy, unrealistic love story for the Leo girls to shove down their pathetic chick flick filled throats. how can anyone expect to get a film with feeling and real emotion from the guy that directed the Terminator? come on! the acting was good, but cheesy and over done, and in some cases not done enough. sure i felt tears in my eyes, but that's just because i'm still vulnerable to Hollywood's false emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long, Bad Story","review":"This movie was way too long. The only really good thing about this movie was the costuming and the special effects.

I'll never \\"revisit\\" Titanic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible in every sense of the word","review":"I hate this movie, not because of some deep seeded hate for Leo whats his name. No i hate this movie for what it is. A POORLY written and acted movie. The characters are flat, the storyline is laughable. The plot makes me want to vomit. I've seen this movie twice, the only time i enjoyed it was the second when me and my friend made funny comments about each scene a la MST2K. This movie so overhyped and over rated it makes me sad to live in a time when a glorified piece of garbage can make so much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"History according to the movies","review":"What disturbs me the most about \\"Titanic\\", that in the minds of millions of people, the tragedy of the eponymous ocean liner will be forever replaced with a fictional romantic story of a British girl and a American boy. Did the film make you actually care about 1500 passengers who died in the crash? Very unlikely. We're supposed to mourn the girl's lost lover instead. 1958's \\"A Night to Remember\\" offered both the more historically accurate account of the event and a human drama behind it. Along with \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Titanic\\" is a sad example of how the actual history is being replaced by Hollywood's fictionalized versions of it. Dream factory, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine example of Hollywood pap.","review":"The appeal of this movie - and its success - lies with the pre-pubescent teens, and unfortunately, adults with the emotional and intellectual faculties of an immature teen, who saw this movie over and over again.

Well, let's just say that Titanic has almost doubled that limit. Oh, you want to buy it. Fine, watch profanity & nudity for 3 hours straight. If your son or daghter asked for it for their birthday or soemthing & that's why you're buying it, STOP!! Don't you want to get The Sound of Music or The King & I?

Then I saw it again on Pay-per-view (we have the video, but it remains unopened), and I was not impressed at all. This movie certainly does not rank as the best of all time and it did not deserve all of those Oscars. I have agreed with previous choices for Oscar winners, but this was ridiculous. I guess you could call it a travesty that such good pictures are made and ignored and drivel (yes, I said it) like this takes home all of the prestigious honors. James Cameron had already proven himself to be an excellent director, but I'm upset that he was recognized by the Academy because of this movie. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine visual effects, spectacularly terrible in other ways","review":"This film has a paradox while also being the highest grossing movie of all time (sad isn't it, that it beat out Star Wars, I mean episode 4). Jim Cameron's direction isn't that bad actually as he sort of sets a good story up and the always known climax looks really good. Unfortunately, he has a screenplay that makes the Jacqueline Suzan books seem like exceptional writings by comparison. His screenplay, and the actors that act out the scenes are so inept, and bring this epic down so far, that you have to stand in awe of how bad it is near the end. So while there is that, at least some of the visuals are far out and EXTREME fans of Cameron might find some interest.

Yeah, I liked it. What I can't believe is that the resolution is so poor. They certainly weren't thinking HDTV or 50-inch monitors when they made the transfer.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are a perfect match in this romantic drama. Their chemistry is like no other, their characters Jack and Rose are so dynamic together, it's hard to ignore their lingering passion. Directed by James Cameron, this film was delayed and critics thought this film would sink but it became a monster hit and won many Academy Awards including best picture.

She's only diving into icy waters on the ship going after her beloved honey and she doesn't even flinch! If James Cameron is such a decent caring human that feels bad for those that died on the Titanic, then why didn't he spare us and donate the $200 million he spent on this movie and donate it to charity?

In this, it seems to follow the 1950s black and white movie, 'A Night To Remember'.But I thought the romance aspect of the movie was the biggest lot of trash I have ever seen. The truth is that a woman of that social class would not have looked sideways as a boy (and I emphasize 'boy') from the lower ranks.

The acting is flat, the plot is downright silly, and the soundtrack is painful to hear (\\"My Heart Will Go On\\", ranks right up there with \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" as the worst movie song of the century).Teenage girls went for this movie in droves, which unfortunately caused the MPAAS to get all caught up in the hype and award this turkey a most undeserved Oscar for best motion picture, passing up several more worthy competitors.This movie is truly a triumph of form over substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Titanic of all Movies","review":"This movie is definately the Titanic off all movies.

Contempoary reactions to the sinking were mainly shock, as Harland & Wolff had an international shipbuilding reputation. This lamentable piece of 3hour-plus tosh is just that- not only because of its imposition of 1990 social mores [Jack would never have met Rose, let alone made holiday-package nude love with her in 1912], but because of its quite intolerable, fake lightheartedness and its lacking in human warmth.

The real sinking of the Titanic was indeed a tragedy, as was the script, the acting, and everything else about this movie. I don't know if I've ever witnessed such horror on film before. If someone was really as self-centered as the fiancee is supposed to be, would he continue chasing them around the boat when it's obviously sinking--wouldn't he be more interested in saving his own hide? And I shudder at the spitting scene--there's no better way to cause a common steerage passenger to fall in love with you than to learn to spit with him. What a trooper she was to descend to his lowly level. Ah, it must be true love. I'm just embarrassed for Hollywood, and for all involved in making this movie.

This film drags on with no purpose whatsoever aside from CGI, diCaprio, and Winslet plus it plays fast and loose with history as well as reality.

The 1990s are the era of production professionalism --- the sets, costimes, and cinematography are predictably expert --- and null creativity. No disaster is richer in meaning than the sinking of Titanic, the ship built and underequipped on naked human hubris, but direcot James Cameron failed to even notice the philosophical subtext --- or make any other point. Since the original story wasn't exciting enough, director James Cameron added a cliched romance, stereotypical bad guys, and pre-adult social commentary... we should require more of our art."},{"rating":"1","title":"I rather look at \\"Golden Girls\\" reruns than watch this!","review":"I don't understand what the hype was about this movie.

Titanic may not have the most original script in all of history, but at least its plot is kept simple and easy to follow while visuals and performance are given all of the focus and treatment. The romance is still presented in a marvelous way, and it's what I walk away from the film remembering, even though I went into it for the fancy 1900's era visuals.The only thing that bothers me about the success of Titanic is it gives Roger Corman more credit than he already has in the film industry for giving Cameron his big break.

First of all DiCraprio can't act at all. Secondly why should we care about the miserable lives of two people on the Titanic when thousands, upon thousands died. The title Titanic, to me, sounds like a film about a great ship, that fell to a terrible demise. Not some love story between two little insignificant people that no one cared about in the first place. The only good part was when DiCraprio froze like a popsicle. Unless your a girl who is obsessed with DiCraprio don't watch this travesty of Cameron's talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"This movie wasn't anything but a long, boring, love story aimed toward teenage girls who lack common sense. The only reason this movie made money was because teenage girls wanted to see Leo. And why did Cameron make it look so sad when Jack died? Hundereds of people died on the Titanic, but this movie does nothing to mourn them. Why do they show Leo and Kate doing each other in a car inside the cargo area of the ship? How the hell did they get into the cargo area? My rating is zero stars, not one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total utter recycled tripe","review":"It's sad how standards for excellence have sunk so low as to elevate \\"Titanic\\" as the best movie ever. I hope and pray that most of the people saying this are immature teenage girls who have yet to know what a good movie really is (i.e. It *can* have all \\"ugly\\" people in it). This movie is boring, drawn-out, re-cycled from 1000 other movies, crap. The only thing of interest was the Linux-driven special effects which were pretty amazing.Other than that, Leonardo and Kate need to go to acting school, or better yet, get a job at McDonald's or something...poor unbelievable acting from them. YES, they're great looking, but that does not make a good movie.

It was toooooo long and the only thing that I liked about it was that it ended. The boat and Cameron's special effects were really good and all, but the storyline did not affect me in any way. Cameron should have casted better actors. First of all, Winslet looked ten years older than Di Caprio. And second, their emotions were not convincing enough. Cameron should just stick to plain action movies. He directed Terminator 2 and True Lies and these movies are a lot better than Titanic. Sorry Cameron, but you are no \\"King of the World\\" in my book.

The story itself, however, was shopworn and predictable and the acting was one-dimensional. In particular, I found it impossible to be sympathetic for Kate Winslet's character. Overall, I was disappointed considering the hype and Academy Awards this film received, and felt that it wasn't worth three hours out of my life to watch it.By the way, couldn't they have gotten a better artist to do the drawings that Di Caprio's character had done (that were supposed to be so talented and promising)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh... Did I miss something?","review":"Anyone else think this movie was horrible? I was falling asleep during the middle of it. Jack and Rose's romance was very unrealistic even for a holly wood movie! They just met! They can't be in love! To the fact that many parts were out of time sequence. No one who WASN'T married made out in the 1910's.

What a disgusting insult to history, and to the great ship Titanic.Is this supposed to be a \\"tribute\\" to the 1,500 people who died at sea on April 15, 1912?Cameron's film makes a mockery of the Titanic story. He turns history on its ear for the sake of a mediocre soap opera story. Maybe some screen time could have been spent paying attention to the real people who sailed aboard that ship, and not to Rose's dopey \\"Freudian\\" comments - which in 1912 Edwardian society would have gotten her pitched overboard.See \\"A Night To Remember\\" (1958), based on Walter Lord's classic bestseller, for the true account of the Titanic disaster.

It was a HUGE success and there are so many documentaries, deleted scenes, music videos, storyboards, interviews, etc that SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED! If they want to release a 10th Anniversary edition in 2007 thats fine, but they should have dropped the price on this crapper YEARS ago! 25 bucks? 19 bucks? Are you kidding me? It should have dropped to 14.99 at least 2 years ago! UUGGHH!!

One has to sit through seemingly endless hours of lifeless dialogue to arrive at the actual ship sinking. Now to the scene of the ship sinking which is remarkably well filmed. This is all one would expect of the man who directed T2.Aside from the ship sinking there is really no point to this film. One has no feelings for such wooden characters and so when the ship sinks one admires the special effects etc but the people who perished?.....so what!This is a shame because the people who did perish on that tragic night so long ago surely deserve better than this juvenile rubbish to mark their passing.The one star above is for the ship sinking scene of course"},{"rating":"1","title":"stunk","review":"Every one told me oh! go see this movie its so good.

ZERO STARS FOR POOR ACTING.","review":"First of all, the poor casting selections did the film in fromthe get-go.Leo DiCaprio looks all of about 16 years old and has aface oily enough to grease a cookie sheet. Kate Winslet is a portly petunia whose acting is so contrived that you wish Jack wouldn't have given up his spot on the floating wreckage. The worst thing about \\"Titanic\\"? All the laudits from people who don't know what a good film is will only serve to feed James Cameron's massive ego. Look for another disservice to the movie industry at a theater near you. Oh, and James, pick someone else besides Celine Dion to screech your next theme song, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated film of all time","review":"Titanic is completely overrated and is stupid. One of the main things that ruins this movie is it is pretty obvious what is going to happen. The ship is going to sink and one of them is going to die. Like we didn't know. The plot is nothing new. <Didn't NBC air a movie called \\"Titanic\\" a few years ago in which the plot was similar?> The acting is horrible. With the exception of whn the ship sinks Kate and Leo provide no drama or suspense. This scene is the only \\"exciting\\" scene in entire the film. Titanic is nothing more then a boring 3-4 hour soap-opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read this if you liked Titanic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"There is nothing in this film but a shallow, maudlin attemptto make you cry. The ending produced no emotion in me whatsoeverexcept bewilderment at how such banality could be made. Those who call this the most touching movie ever have obviously never seen a film with such emotional power as The Rules of the Game (1939). Let me recommend one of my favorite films in lieu of Titanic. If you want to experience a film with a compelling drama that climaxes by giving you a surge that not only brings sudden tears but also a heart flutter, watch Zinnemann's The Search (1948). There is nothing like it on al of cinema- it's on my top ten list."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY - FINALLY - FINALLY! What took them so long?","review":"First of all, it was dumb to not release the extra scenes and footage with the first DVD set. But, at least, releasing it now is better than never releasing it. So, I'm glad they finally decided to stand up and get it done. It's only 2005 so I suppose eight years isn't so bad to wait. :-( Anyway, this is an excellent film. I recommend it highly for each and every family. It's just an excellent film.

Come on: who among us wouldn't want to see Leo turning blue like that, even if it's just in a movie.Really, I have never seen a film this manipulative before. Okay, not just manipulative, but exploitive. This thing starts out about as good as a can-o-corn docu-drama, and that's the set-up: the viewer is lulled into a false sense of cheese, and before you know it, you're having nightmares about drowning.So, you have to see it, because we all wonder what it's like to actually die, but like a box of Fugeeos, you hate yourself at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah...","review":"I did not like this movie - nothing about it appealed to me. The script was rotten, the acting wooden (especially Kate Winslet), and the storyline so overly dramatic that i spent more than half of the movie rolling my eyes. Billy Zane's character was so extremely one dimensional that he might have stepped directly from the pages of a fairy tale (enter the wicked witch of the west, stage right).The special effects were impressive, but like many other movies, it was simply not enough to keep the weak plot afloat (so to speak). I won't say it is the worst movie ever made, but i can think of much better things to do with 3 hours than watch Leo in a wet shirt. The worst thing about this movie is that it is so unstimulating.

You can tell right from the start that it will end in tragedy, but James Cameron drags the already thin plot out over two hours before the real action even begins. The only thing that saved this movie from total disaster were the effects, and even they were a tad fake at times. I also think that it's somewhat depressing to see James Cameron spend so much money to make a blockbuster out of one of the most horrible disasters in history.

First: it got far too much hype. It's been my experience that recent movies of such immense popularity usually fall into the \\"Incredibly Overrated\\" category (Forest Gump, Braveheart, etc.). I attribute this phenomenon to the ridiculously low standards of the average schmuck. The second reason I won't watch this film: Mr. Leonardo Di Caprio. It wouldn't bother me that chicks really dig this guy if he was really worth the fuss. A young Paul Newman or even Tom Cruise are a lot more handsome than this lightweight pretty boy. I can only hope that most of us will someday wake up and realize what an atrocious actor this punk is. I liked him a lot better when he was on Growing Pains; At least then I could take pleasure in the fact that Di Caprio was constantly upstaged by another atrocious actor, Kirk Cameron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie, Similar To a Porno","review":"This movie really strays away from the actually story of Titanic. IT is basically a porno with a small story line. Basically the two main characters sneak around various parts of the ship enjoying various moments of sexual pleasure. Eventually the man dies when the ship sinks and she won't let go of him in the water because all she wants is more sex. This movie really falls away from the true story of Titanic. It was disgusting and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still terrific!","review":"A massive cruise liner thought to be unsinkable (spoiler alert!) hits an iceberg and does just that. The film focuses on a fictional couple who fall in love and pursue a relationship despite their differences, and the unfortunate circumstance of being on a sinking ship. This 1997 film became a box-office smash and a cultural phenomenon. It is enhanced by the 3D experience, and is well-worth investing your time and movie dollars. What made the film so good was the combination of the riveting sequence of the ship going under, the love story that captured hearts everywhere, and an easy to hate villain. A return trip to Titanic is an experience we should all undertake."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better.","review":"I watched the whole thing, and I just don't see what all of the fuss is about.

I will definately be getting a copy of the widescreen version, and I hope all of you will as well.

Leonardo DiCaprio gives a moving performance as Jack Dawson, a dreaming and scheming lower class young man who falls in love with a confused upper class young girl (Kate Winslet).

What is even further beyond my comprehension is why people kept going back to see it again and again. Four words to sum up this movie: Stupid plot; horrible acting. For the record, I have seen Leonardo DiCaprio give some brilliant performances in movies such as \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\" but in this, he's completely dull. And Kate Winslet: WOODEN!!!! She seemed completely unable to comprehend the emotion in the dialogue: \\"I-will-jump-I-swear-I-will\\" or whatever the heck she said. Completely without feeling. Okay, the set was out of this world and the boat sinking was a pretty good piece of cinamatography but beyond that, this movie should have sank.

That's not right. Even in Pearl Harbor, there's a love story most of the time. Titanic and Pearl Harbor should've just forget about the love story, and should've focused more on the historical accuracy of the film. Instead of the love story in titanic,it should've been filled up of what the crew did ,what the passengers did then get straight into the sinking of the Titanic. In Pearl Harbor, they should've focused more on Yamamoto and Roosevelt, or the people in this place, then go straight to the attack. I know this off topic but don't you think that the planes in the movie going through tight spaces should be left only to Star Wars? I think that would be too weird for a plane in 1941 to be that maneuravable with that speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"PuuuuuLEASE!","review":"The plot line of Titanic was absolutely insipid.

The only thing I don't like about this movie is that it is TOO good. I mean it was good enough to dominate the Oscars and Golden Globes. This film tells the tale of the tragedy of the events of the sinking of Titanic. Very good directing and very good effects, this film should be considered watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic 3-Disc","review":"This 3-Disc Titanic DVD is awesome!!!

Here are my problems with the DVD. The movie itself is split into 2. I thought the creation of the DVD was to have the whole movie on one disc. The VHS of Titanic was two tapes. It's the 21's century. Now people are going to argue this point with the \\"The alternate ending is on the second disc!!\\". Then what is the 3rd disc for? All of the special features should have been on one disc. The other featuretts really didn't astound me. They were short and rather boring. If the special edition wasn't so cheap I would have just gotten the regular DVD and probably would have been much better. On the other side of the spectrum, the movie itself is fantastic! Minus the having to get up mid way to change the disc. Titanic is my favorite movie and features my favorite actor and actress. I reccomend the movie, but not this edition of the movie. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitting the Ice","review":"This movie only gets good when the ship hits the iceberg. And then only for a few tense minutes. It is a boring love story upon which the couple involved happen to be on a ill fated ship. Why do people take such a historic event and make sauch a boring movie out of it. This movie is as bad as \\"Pearl Harbor\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I feel kind of bad writing this because I haven't asked for a refund or exchange, but for $15 I didn't think it was worth my time. Two major issues:1) The disk skipped multiple times in my player (not sure how since DVD is new?)2) The screen was small on my TV. I tried to adjust to make it bigger, but I believe that's how the picture was put on the DVD.Overall, the movie was ok, I got past the skipping parts, but it was not what I expected for my $15 + S&H;."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Titanic is best movie that I have seen. It is exciting, sad and romanic. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful in their role as Jack and Rose. Titanic is my favorite movie. In my appreciation Titanic should get 10 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"flawed but good","review":"It's interesting to note that almost all of the customer reviews here from England (and most from around the world, for that matter) are positive. We North Americans know the British are a lot smarter, more sophisticated than us, so let's take their word for it, it's a good film! Yes the plot and characterizations involving the main characters might come across as thin or unoriginal but for a historical flick this movie is a lot more entertaining than one of those equally long and much more slow-moving Swedish dramas! The reason most people like this film is because whatever its faults, it never ceases to be emotionally or dramatically engaging. Some of the reviews are quite mean, subjective and unfair. What most harsh critics of this movie seem to dislike about it isn't so much the film as much as the fact that it was so over-hyped."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Effort!","review":"This is a movie that millions around the world have enjoyed time and time again. This movie is a worthy addition to the very long list of movies that have been done regarding the story of the fated ship \\"Titanic\\" is brought to the silver screen.The love story between the two ill fated lovers is both touching at sweet. I think that Mr. Cameron has done a very good job taking a real situation and adding a touch of Hollywood. This movie won several Academy Awards and was worthy of each one. I highly recommend \\"Titanic\\" if you want a good story that audiences can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only guys review of this movie.","review":"From a guys point of view this is still a very good movie, although yes it definetly is one of the biggest chick flicks. I with held the 5th star because it focuses a little too much on the love crapola and very little on the ship going down and why. But this is also a movie about survival and in that guys will find it to be a very good movie. The visuals of the ship and it going down are incredible, INCREDIBLE, some of the best visuals ever are in this movie, it is only surpassed by LOTR in that area. Its quite long and could have been about a half an hour shorter, they could have taken out some of the scenes when people first get on the boat and some of the love scenes. Leo and Kate give good performances. I give it a 8 out of a 10. Its definetly a good movie, but chicks would probably be the only ones who would watch it over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not anamorphic???","review":"One of the most spectacular movies ever released on DVD and not anamorphic. What gives? I give the movie 4 stars overall, but probably 1 star for technical delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overrated and Silly, so-called \\"touching\\" Movie","review":"I just can't believe how overrated this thing is! This movie was WAY TOO hyped up and given praise for what I don't know. It was very much undeserving of the numerous awards it won, and all the money that it made. If anyone is stupid enought to sweat a movie like it is the best thing that ever touched this earth when it is simply okay then that means there is something wrong with this world. (I was so happy when reading some editor's view in Parade Magazine that he thought it was embarrassing that it won 11 academy awards and that there are so many other movies out there that were good and better than this piece of garbage, but failed to get the attention that this nonsense got.)That DiCaprio guy is so overrated! That idiot is nothing.I don't know why I am the only one that thinks this. The movie was not all that touching, heart-breaking, and awesome like the media make it out to be. Please! Are people for real?!!!!!!! Go watch soap operas instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised it made any money at all","review":"Easily one of the worst movies of all time. Sappy, poorly acted, next to no plot. The saving graces for the film were the sweeping views and special effects, though they were hardly enough to waste your time on.The movie brings nothing to the table and leaves you with exactly that, nothing. DiCaprio looks young and out of place in what was supposed to be a steamy love affair. Winslet looks the part but can't seem to get a line out without some odd facial expressions. Certainly one of Camerons worst works yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie celebrates the most overrated event in history","review":"The Titanic movie should never have been made. Because no one should remember the Titanic. 1912 (the year the overrated ship sank) was a bored year for America. Nothing much was happening so the papers spent time covering this shipwreck. Six years later the world plummetted into the worst pandemic ever seen---Spanish Influenza.40 Million people died of influenza in that outbreak. Hollywood listen up and make a film about the SI Pandemic. Unlike the Titanic it was important."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never let go...","review":"I will never let go...of this film! I remember when I first saw this as a kid. I was perhaps too young the first time, but it is an amazing film that will live in your heart forever. I had been waiting for this film to come out on Blu-Ray and I was very excited when it did. It looks amazing on Blu-Ray! I highly recommend upgrading to Blu-Ray for anyone that has been on board Titanic and to all of those who never have, you are missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"Good quality and received in good and timely fashion.

Not so great. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY IS TITANIC A BOX-OFFICE HIT?","review":"I have never seen Titanic, and I don't believe I ever will. I've read (and heard from other people who've seen the movie) that there's sexuality and nudity in this PG-13 film. Sure, it's an educational movie, to a certain degree, but why learn about history when there's back-alley ribaldry mixed in?I watched \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" starring Kate Winslet, and thought she was an excellent actress. I still think she has great talent--- but why did she waste it in a movie that exposes children younger than 10 to sexuality? I'm asking you to consider the effects of buying Titanic. Sure, it may be 'only a movie,' but its influences are greater than you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with this 3-disc set????!!!!!!!!","review":"I have exchanged 3 copies of this and have found a pixelation error in the same place in all three copies of disc one during the film. So much for quality control. I called Paramount home video and they have informed me they have been flooded with calls concerning this title. It appears there are problems. I plan to get a new set from paramount themselves. If anyone else is having problems, do report it here and call paramount home video."},{"rating":"2","title":"THAT WAS SO SAD!","review":"Titanic was a very sad movie. I already knew how many people died and stuff, but it really hit hard when i actually saw them die! Exspecially when the preacher is holding all the people's hands and reading from the bible. Then they all start falling. I admit, I cried, but not because of Jack. He was much better in Gilbert Grape. But I still loved the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOY MEETS GIRL ON A BOAT: HOW LAME!!","review":"Yup, that's basiclly what this movie was: boy meets girl on a boat. Way too long, very corny, and overall something to aviod. Unless you had more money than you knew what to do with, I don't see why anyone would pay 20 bucks for this overblown, truthfully lousy flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsinkable Ship","review":"This movie is extraordinary, exquisite, grand movie that I ever seen. I mean the whole movie is great and excellent. This movie showed that the TITANIC was called ship of dream for everyone else. The love story that director created was superb and sorrowful. I think the true story of TITANIC and the love story that created were matched really well and it's nearly perfect I can say. This movie always reminds in my heart and I will not might be able to forget the memories of Love of TITANIC ever after. It's most spectacular film that was ever made before. TITANIC Forever! TITANIC, the ship never forget in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!!!BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!","review":"Not only is Titanic the highest grossing movie of all time, but the movie a lone is as classic and royal as the R.M.S Titanic herself.

Mexican Region 4 Edition doesn't have a DTS ES English 6.1 Audio Track!!!","review":"This rating is exclusively for the Mexican Region 4 Edition... Not the movie, nor the extras... Hang on with me and you'll know the reason why I give it such a low rating.I was excited to know that the 4 disc edition was only going to be available for certain markets (Including Mexico) but my dissappointment lies in the fact that the Mexican Edition does not have a DTS Audio Track. So, I guess I'll just have to buy it again through Amazon or in my next vacation trip to the U.S. I'm a rabid fan of DTS Sound, so it was sort of a let down to know of the lack of it when it is even announced on the box. Don't get fooled as I was. I'm sort of a completist, so I'll surely be getting the U.S. 3 disc edition just for the sake of having the chance of experiencing this movie with the best audio format ever available: DTS!Enrique Aguilar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home Theatre Fanatics and Fans of the Film - BEWARE","review":"Excited about your new widescreen or DVD player and want to experience it with your favorite film, Titanic? WAIT! This is perhaps the worst DVD I have ever purchased (and in 3 years I've purchased many). It is not anamorphic, or enhanced for your current or future 16x9 (widescreen) tv. It has no extras such as commentaries, documentaries, interviews, or deleted scenes (from a film famous for originally having an over 4 hour cut).I love the film. But this is worse than just a bad dvd, it's a .... I would venture to guess that this dvd was cut to capitalize on the original rush of fans who are mostly new to dvd and would buy anything \\"Titanic\\", knowing that many of these same fans will buy it again when the \\"Special Edition\\" or \\"Anniversary Edition\\" or \\"Awards Edition\\" which will inevitably come out a few years later, just to increase revenues.Save your money or buy a used version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanic sinks","review":"If I ever have to sit through this movie again, or even worse listen to that damn theme song again, I'm gonna fill the bathtub with cold water and drown myself. Teenage piffle is all this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed opportunity","review":"Well, the DVD of Titanic could have been spectacular.What does the DVD have that the VHS tape doesn't have besides the obvious better sound/picture? Not much. It's not enhanced for widescreen TV's, but at least the studio can rerelease it in a couple of years. There's no commentary tracks, which could have been very interesting, and there's no special features of note in what is considered a special movie.As for the movie, it was fun to watch the first time, but was there ever any doubt that Jack would die? Not for me. I would've only bought the movie if it had lots of features - 'cause it loses ALOT going to small screen from theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Leonardo was very different in this movie. He was ruthless and selfish in \\"The Man in the Iron Mask\\", but in Titanic, he was caring, loving and thoughtful. His acting was really something. He contributed to the impressive atmosphere of the movie. Kate was the star of the movie with her extraordinary beauty and her awareness of what life is all about.They deserve all the attention they get: They succeeded in turning a very well-known story into a new adventure. What more can I say?.. 5 stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DVD must!","review":"Yes, the story is a bit thin. Yes, there's some over-acting on the part of a few charaters. And yes, there are numerous assumptions made relative to the sinking of the ship. BUT: The complete movie is magnificant, and visually a '10'. I'm adding this to my collection -- right next to other Oscar-award winning movies. At $15.00, it's a steal."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate chick flick","review":"This is a great movie. If you can get past the poor acting, the women sobbing all around you, and if you can go 3 hours and 20 minutes without having to go to the bathroom. This movie might be worth watching solely for the effects, sound track (no, not Celine Dion's song), and the other 9 things that it won Academy awards for. Leonardo (Pretty Boy)DiCaprio turns in yet another lackluster performance as the romantic lead. It's not his fault that he can't act I suppose...I just wish he'd try harder. Still...this movie has grossed more revenue than any other in history. Why? Because they're are a lot of women in this country. This record will be short lived however, as the release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace looms on the horizon. James Cameron...your days are numbered!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this move make millions? Ten year old girls...","review":"I would bet my soul that this movie made its millions from all of the ten year old girls with a crush on Leo.

Well, maybe if you move your mouth differently so it is pronounced: \\"worst picture\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Hype","review":"I fail to see the hype generated by this film. If you want to see a story of the Titanic, see the one with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck. The visual effects may not be there, but the story is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheesy","review":"I have to say that this movie is not very good. The \\"romance\\" between Leo and Kate is laughable. Throughout the movie I felt that the this relationship was rather odd. How old is Leo? 14? and Kate is how old? 40? The only redeeming point of this movie is when the boat sank. That was an amazing scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long, Too Cheesy, Too AWFUL","review":"This film is all bark and no bite. I have no idea what everyone sees in this movie. I don't think that it really deserved all those Academy Awards. It was too long and drawn out, all icing and no cake. It was unrealistic and had bad acting on Leonardo DiCaprio's and Kate Winslet's part. I also found the dialog cheesy and laughable.It was exceedingly hard to sit through, let alone take seriously and as a result I'm forced to give it a 1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three cheers for the iceberg!","review":"Titanic was just a maudlin, over-acted, cliche. The love story in this movie was so predictable. The moments of highest emotion between Jack and Rose were a little nauseating. The acting was stilted. In the end I was cheering for the iceberg.The special effect were pretty cool, however. That couldn't make up for a lame story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanic sinks to a new low","review":"This film boasts the worst screenplay ever written for a movie. Even some admirers of the film admit to the banal script as being deficient. The last bits of footage with the distressed captain and the sinking of the ship are very good, even excellent. However, most of the three hours is taken up with a very substandard love story. This is not Romeo and Juliet nor is it Rhett and Scarlett. Instead, it is Jack and Rose -- two kids running around the ship, giving others the finger, and otherwise acting silly (and very naive). The most overrated film of the 1990's, Titanic is a titanic waste of time and money. Don't even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cammeron's worst film","review":"I thought that film was entirely over-rated. It was by far one of or the worst film Cammeron's ever made.

I don't think I ever cried in a movie before. I saw it with my husband, and let me tell you..in the 8 years I was with him, I never saw him so affected my a movie. I didn't care for the romance..the sinking of the ship..the frozen bodies..the panic..it all tore at me. I actually had nighmares. That frozen baby and mother will haunt me. Any movies that does that..makes you think like that..well, I truly believe this movie deserved the oscar and yes, even the hype. Although tragic romance appeals to so many, what really got me was, THIS happened...those people died like that. Sure Jack and Rose were made up, fictional characters..but all the events that surrounded them..it really blew me away."},{"rating":"2","title":"great over all","review":"I thought this movie was great and one of the best that I have seen. I'm a guy and dont care too much for Leo but I thought he did a great job as part of this movie. It was a piece of history, the TITANIC. It showed the love that these two human beings had, and the ending is so breath taken that you will be on the edge of your seat. Now I never cried when he died but I was very touched. I just had to see the movie once I found out the Reba McEntire turned down a part in the script when she couldnt post pon her tour dates. I think she would have made this movie a 5 star plus, when it already is a five star."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelent decision","review":"For the fans of Titanic this is a good DVD with everything you always wanted to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie, that lost alot of it's magic over the years.","review":"When I first saw this movie in 1998 when it came out on video, I loved it. I watched this movie more than 100 times in the first three months alone. I cried at the very end when she had that dream, and since I am a guy, it is almost impossible for me to cry at a movie, and only a few have done so. The whole story was great, and all the special effects, and background are excellent. The performances are good, but definitely not the best out of all the actor's careers. I blame the screenplay for this, because James Cameron always had someone write his movies with him, and this was the first in which he wrote the entire movie by himself. The nude scene with Kate Winslet was nice, but I still can't figure out how this movie got a PG-13 rating. This movie has lost alot of it's magic over the years, which is the main reason why I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5, but it's still a good movie to be seen by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED.....","review":"ALL IT TAKES IS TWO...

I think that Leo and Kate did a pretty good job as main actor and main actress. I did not want to watch it a second time though and wished I wouldn't have wasted my money the first time. The rats running to get away from the sinking ship was a great add in and the musicians, I still remember them, that was my favorite part of the movie, they sang till the ship went down.

Had two dimensional characterization. Predictable to its core. CGI a little too obvious. Crowning Leonardo the next James Dean is insane. Goes to prove how much disposable income teenage girls have nowadays, as is shown also in popular music (i.e., backstreet boys, and hanson).

Sure, the special effects were well done, but the plot was lame, the acting mediocre, and the theme song makes me want to slit my wrists.Titanic was popular because everybody wants to see the big, realistic disaster. We are fascinated by death and this movie is a very realistic portrayal of death on a catastrophic scale.And if you still think Titanic really beat Star Wars in ticket sales, think again; A movie ticket was under $5 in when Star Wars came out. Titanic may have grossed more money, but it still didn't sell as many tickets.Spend your three hours watching a different movie or reading a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"This movie is horrible. That's right, horrible. ... The movie hardly describes the event correctly, and it does not honor the hundreds who died that night. All it focuses on is sexual relationships between a criminal and a woman who would be a criminal if it weren't for the fact she came from an upper-class family. And let's not forget the adultery it potrays. There's only tradgedy, and it's not the one it should be: crimal dies, adulterer cries. Horrible movie.

For one, the dialogue is about as shallow as the Atlantic is deep. When Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) is first told the ship has struck an iceberg, all he can say is, 'Hey, that's not good....' Jack and Rose speak like two mall rats of the 1990s, and their oil and water chemistry was not convincing. Jack, for one, is so chipper that he needs to be doused with cold water -- and is. Most of the other characters are stereotypes, with the only heartfelt performance turned in by Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose. In short, Jack and Rose's romance just didn't seem authentic. My expectations sank before the ship did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it was at the cinema","review":"OK, first of all I don't understand why this movie got so much attention, I mean, at the cinema it was like... Oh.. wow... great... stunning, but when I watched it at home, it was not as fantastic as I remembered it being, in fact, I am now ashamed that I actually have it! Kate Winslet is a really fabulous actress and she does a fantastic job, but... no this movie is NOT something I would have recommended. If you want a STUNNING film, a romantic film, I highly recommend \\"A room with a view\\", it is simply stunning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"I was going to give this film three stars, but after I watched it again a few times I decided it deserves a little higher rating. I don't give it five stars because of the fact that no film needs violence or profanity. Rated PG is my limit, but with films like this one I will make an acception. I was affected by this film in both good ways and bad ways. The first half of the film is both exciting and heart warming. But the second half is darker and sometimes even terrible, except for the ending.Danny Nucci and Leonardo Dicaprio make a great team. A pair like them should work together again someday. Not just as Jack and Fabrizio I mean. I wrote a fan fiction story about how they became friends. It's called \\"First Meeting\\" and it's posted at After the Iceberg.

Without those words, the black bars on a widescreen movie will take up 1/3 of a picture's available resolution. Once you get a widescreen TV, the only way to fill your screen with these movies is to \\"zoom in\\" - a great loss in resolution.

It was a little better than I expected, but thats not saying much. I did however, enjoy the last hour of the movie. The special effects were phenomenal. But, idiotic dialogue and an uninspired performance from Dicaprio sunk this movie for me. And I have to say that the last time Dicaprio was really good was in \\"Gilbert Grape.\\" I thought about purchasng the DVD but WHY? There are almost no extras on this disk! A Theatrical trailer?

Mind you, I think they were robbed. Especially Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio who kept the story (pardon the pun) afloat during this 3 hour epic. I usually become bored with long romance movies, but this had me rivetted throughout. 3 hours? Seemed like 45 minutes. It passed so quickly! James Cameron you are a genius! You deserve every penny that falls into your pocket for having the balls to defy the Hollywood moguls' penny pinching and make \\"Titanic\\" how YOU wanted it to be made. My only criticism with the DVD is that there is no behind-the-scenes footage, doco or deleted scenes....and we know there are many that hit the cutting room floor.

What I liked is the special effects.I think it's incredibly amazing what they can do with computers. They can take a small piece of mechanical movie set that was filmed in a tank on a Mexico beach and make it look like a sinking ship in the mid-Atlantic. All the computer animated people they used in long shots of the ship and also the puffs of breath they added in with computers are cool, too. I can't wait till I can get through college and start working with things like that too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austin","review":"Titanic is the worst movie ever made in the history of the world. I wonder what the dirctor was on when he created this movie. When I saw this movie, It was so boring that I fell asleep through the entire movie. The only good part is when the ending credits came on. This movie is so terrible, that the orignal actors must be spinning in their grave. The only other good part I liked about this movie was able to turn it off. I encourage anyone who saw this stinker to send an message to HollyWood and tell everyone there to cease and desist making any movies like this and/or have Leonardo DiCaprio in them.

I could be wrong but at the beginning of the movie they incorporated some footage from the movie Ghost of the Abyss and seeing the real Titanic at the bottom of the ocean in 3-D was jaw dropping.The movie is broken into 2 parts, Disc 1 . One a love story, two Disc 2 , a disaster thriller. Both parts are about as good as it gets. This for me is a real keeper. One note , the first time I went to watch it, it began freezing on parts of disc 1. I tried to contact the movie company with no luck, so I contacted Amazon customer service for help.

Any sadness i felt was based upon the reality of what happened, not any genius on the part of Cameron. The romantic \\"subplot\\" was completely without merit, and the acting of the two leads was painful to watch. Had the movie focused on the more interesting (and I believe real person) Molly Brown well-played by Kathy Bates, the movie would have been excellent. Instead, I was forced to endure the contrived romance between two completely fake characters. Whether it was the script or the acting, I did not feel that Jack and Rose were the least bit believable.

The second time it's three hours of waiting for a ship to sink. Sure, the special effects were magnificant, but the plot was more than a little lacking. Any movie is decent or good the first time.

Even though the film did contain a few mistakes that only the trained eye could catch, this movie was great. And call me a sap, but I cried when Jack died. Yeah, Yeah, I know...you don't have to say it. Anyway...I recommend this movie to everyone no matter what your favorite movie genre is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Poor DVD","review":"As one of the greatest blockbuster hits ever to come out of Hollywood, one would expect more from the DVD. The DVD, especially from Fox DVD, is sub par. It contains no special features, and the quality is so-so. I would wait until a special edition (which almost assuredly will come) arrives on the scene. The DVD just does not do the movie the justice that it deserves; it is one more example of a DVD made without any real care or thought.

To my dismay, I realized that the DVD is NOT, I repeat: is NOT, anamorphic. The picture is not enhanced to fit WIDESCREEN displays. It appears all squashed up and elongated. I had to immediately switch it off!Folks, if you plan to watch this on a 4:3 TV screen or projector, by all means go for it. BUT, if you plan to watch on 16:9 display, simply FORGET about this DVD.

Her mother will wind up starving and broke if Rose doesn't do this. What happens? Before you can say \\"Debbie does Dallas\\", this girl is shacking up with a boy who is poor, and barely over twelve years old! The outrage! She couldn't keep her pants on around this guy for more than three days? Poor Cal. At least he had the good sense to kidnap a child, and pretend he was the father.

The dialogue for Titanic is horrid, it was overly long by about an hour. What you're left with is the special EFX, which in all honesty aren't that great.I honestly can't see the film's appeal. Maybe it's because I'm not a romantic, but this film did absolutely nothing for me. Not even Kate Winslet's bare bossoms could save it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three hours of my life I'll never get back.","review":"What a waste of time. There is really nothing good to say about this. I had to see it TWICE in theaters when I was in 7th grade, so it's technically 6 hours of my life I'll never get back. Leonardo Dicaprio CANNOT act.

Kate Winslet lit up every scene with a fire rarely seen on film. James Cameron deserves all the recognition he has received for such a masterpiece. Although the film was much better viewed in the theatre, the story is what makes the movie, not the special effects, (which were really good too!). Anyone with half a brain should not have reason to put this movie down. It is one of the most well crafted films in history and the story, although boring to some, was intensly captivating. This film could have gone on for 6 hours and I still would have watched it without blinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deserve the hype that it has received","review":"When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was pretty good. It had an aura that made it very appealing to watch. It was one of those movies that had a numbing effect on you when you left the theater However, I saw this movie for a second time and I started to think more critically about the movie itself. I think that the special effects used in this movie are probably the best that can ever be developed to portray the Titanic in any kind of production. The acting was highly overrated and too sappy. The dialogue was horrible, just about anybody could have played Leonardo Dicaprio's part with ease. If the casting directors would have picked a much more established actor with average looks, the audience could have concentrated more on the acting and the story line itself. If this was the case, people might take this movie more seriously instead of making a machary out of it. In my opinion, rent it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This movie proves that the majority of our teenage society has deteriorated into ditsy bimbos that fall for cheesy plots with bad acting.

For instance; \\"We need to stay on the ship as long as possible\\"...WHY? \\"Just hold your breath and kick towards the surface\\"...that just wouldn't happen.

It is still difficult for me to believe that this mishmash of pure nonsense won Best Picture over the far superior movies L.A. Confidential and As Good As It Gets. 11 Academy Awards? It equals Ben-Hur (1959) in the number of awards, but will never equal it in artistic achievement or dramatic tension.Except for the cinematography, costume and set designs, and some of the special effects, this is a perfect example of what Hollywood calls \\"high art and entertainment\\" today.

There wasn't even a good battle scene with the iceberg. The boat just crashed into it! And that was it. The boat just gave up and sank. Just like that. What is film making coming to? How did Cameron come up with this story? I think something like this happened for real a while ago (but I could be mistaken). It's not a very original idea. Sort of like UPS.

Including me, for the most part- at least I'm not one of the people that goes around criticizing it a whole lot for something that isn't it's fault: People making such a big deal about it. That's why everyone is so sick of it now. But one thing that I'm not sick of, not after hearing it a hundred-plus times, is the music. James Horner is just fantastic. Without the music, this movie would not be worth seeing. With the music, it is just amazing. Of course, you could just save some money and time and get the soundtrack.

That this movie won an Oscar indicates just how big of a joke the Academy Awards have become. Buy \\"A Night to Remember\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Titanic","review":"I wonder what the people that loves the REAL Titanic ( that is the ship and its story, not the movie ) thinks about this.....Is there really new interesting historical material other than the usual 'extras' ?Is it really worth the time or have we already seen all Cameron has to give on the ship ?What do you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love it!","review":"Oh, I love this movie! The costumes are really great, especially Roses. 5 stars, and it's really worth it too. The music is fantastic. I listen to it everytime i watch the movie (wich could be many times a week).But the greatest thing I love in this movie, is Roses and Jacks love for each other. It's so great, that they don't care what other people thinks. Kate is a really talented actress (Leo too!), and watch her (and him!) in a movie like Titanic is just too good to be true! But it is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"I'm sorry but this film didn't keep my interest. I'm even a forteen year old girl and I still didn't like it. Maybe I'm just not into romance movies. Many parts of the movie I wasn't even paying attention. The movie got tedious at times I found myself shifting in the theater seat. The only part that kept my interest was the actual ship sinking. That was done pretty good. It's amazing how many Titanic lovers critisize the people who don't like it to be in denial. What's wrong with them not liking the same movie you do? Isn't everyone entitled to their own oppinion? Why does it make you mad that their favorite movie isn't the same as yours? Sorry I've seen much better movies than Titanic. But then again maybe I'm not interest in Romance stories. What's next? Rose and Jack meet on a WWI battle feild? Rose and Jack in the Chicago fire? Rose and Jack in the Normandy Invasion? Rose and Jack meet in the Depression?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This is one of the most overrated movies of all time. The plot goes at a snail's pace, filled with little romantic quips and cliches. The first two hours of the movie are completely unnecessary. By the time anything exciting happens, you don't care. Titanic was a good idea, but failed in it's execution. Just another Hollywood hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"A FAKE.","review":"New specially developed special effects were used in great ammunt to make the public forget that fact that this is not but one of the silliest love histories ever told on screen ! THe director was smart enough to take a plot (the sinking of Titanic) that ever aroses interest in people (like sharks, for example, or the murder of JFK) to bring the audience into theaters. Then he filled it with special effects and no histories at all. By the way: at the end of the movie, Billy Zane's character, that at best could be defined as a rich person full of prejudice, transforms himself almos into the Devil himself! Absurd !"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a cartoon, right?","review":"Everything sucks. The iceberg looked fake. The acting would be laughable if it weren't so earnest. The story isn't even a story. Any episode of \\"Scooby Doo\\" has a better (and more unpredictable) storyline. It's a tragic shame that so many people have wasted so many hours watching it. Glad to see there's a lot of negative reviews here; gives me hope in human intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood rewrites history again","review":"I only picked one star because I couldn't have 0. This was the most irritating, offensive piece of crap I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. Yet another example of directors screwing about with history for \\"dramatic\\" purposes although the so-called drama in this doesn't get more trite. 600 people who died from the Titanic came from my home-town alone - no they weren't first class passengers, they were engineers and firemen and other working classes. James Cameron has insulted their memory by portraying every English person who was on that boat as incompetent, snobby and ignorant. Evidently the English were too busy oppressing the Irish on the boat to notice the bloody iceberg. I was shaking by the end of this film. But not with tears, it was more like anger. James Cameron apparently made dives down to the wreck for authenticity (that's a laugh). He should've stayed there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't understand.","review":"I just don't understand how could all those people watch this movie again and again. Just one time of having to sit through three hours of bad acting and a predictable plot line made me want to be on the ship as it went down, not watching it, realizing I just wasted 7 bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A technically polished mediocrity","review":"I guess all that can be said is that Cameron botched the dialogue in every way that the dialogue can be botched. Add to that cardboard cut-outs for characters and all the cinematographic cliches that could be fit into three hours, and you get an spectacular, and spectacularly shallow, film. It's not all bad, of course. The cinematography _is_ beautiful, the acting is generally acceptable and I agree that the framing device was very well conceived. But this is a very far cry from from the work of art some have pretended it is. In all fairness there were only two of its eleven Oscars that the movie did not deserve: best picture and best director.I am much heartened to see that there are in fact quite a few people out there who were not taken in by this, judging from the comments here. Still, it did become the most popular movie of all time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"This movie had romance (Leo & Kate), and adventure (Titanic sinking).

Titanic III: Kate's New Life in AmericaWell there you have my two pennies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone...","review":"Is this comedy or drama? With the exception of a few NONROMANTIC scenes near the end (which were truly touching--the mother putting her children to sleep while the ship is sinking, the frozen corpses of the mother and her baby), I found this to be one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. Call me an unemotional person, but it seems one has to be a romantic type to appreciate this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good special effects, but the dialogue...come on!","review":"Story: good.

No special features! We had to see this movie saturate every aspect of pop culture and they couldn't even add a music video or making of special, special effects anything or SOMETHING to the DVD? If you like the movie, rent it.

There are black lines on the left and right of the screen as well as the top and bottom. There should be black lines at the top and bottom but not the right and left.

I went to the theaters to see it just because it looked like it would have pretty good special effects. But I wasn't expecting it to have a lot in terms of plot and drama. The special effects were some of the best at the time. After seeing it, I definitely agreed with what I had been hearing. It is a great movie and not many movies can stand up to it in any way. Everything about it is great, it deserved all the Academy Awards that it got and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"630 reviews?????","review":"You know, even the people who claim to hate this movie are writing about it. That alone says something about the movie. If they really hated it, why are they writing? I have seen better movies in my time, and I'm only 12 years old. And yes, in case you're wondering, I'm a girl. But I'm most certainly not one of those Leo-infatuated blockheads.He's not as bad as some people say, though he could use a haircut, and a few more muscles. I admit that the reason that this movie is PG-13 rated seems a little inappropriate for a 1912 setting, but it's a love story, and how many people who are still alive were old enough in 1912 to remember what it was like then?Please don't let the bad reviews phase you. It's good, not great, but it's still a movie everyone should see. I've seen Star Wars: Episode I, and it's a lot better than Titanic. But Titanic is still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film but some extras would be nice.","review":"when you consider the price of the Titanic DVD,I would have thought some extras(documentaries,interviews)could have been added.For me,the most chilling scene in the movie was seeing that epic wide screen shot of all those people drowning in the water.It has outstanding special effects and seeing the real Titanic at the bottom of the sea was a bonus.I hope that when the special edition comes out,those extras will be provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"The history is better","review":"Titanic is a good movie and has good historic parts. But the love story is way too cheesey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal Disappointment","review":"My wife and I saw TITANIC on opening night. At some point, perhaps halfway through the movie, I wanted to depart because the stupid and phony tale of the male and female leads left me dumbstruck and spoiled the otherwise appealing visuals. Unfortunately, my wife refuses to ever leave a movie that we paid to see, so, I did stay and see the entire film.A couple of years later, while I was with friends and family, I forced myself to view the entire video to see whether my initial impression was too harsh. It was not.If an edition could be sold that omitted any broadcast of or reference to the male and female leads, including the portions where the woman has aged, that version would be worth watching. When that video appears it may rate five stars. This version of TITANIC is one star; it is a colossal disappointment as story, film, and entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable lightness of being","review":"My apologies to Kundera, but this is, in a way, what he was talking. 'Titanic' is so light on substance and emotion that it is simply unbearable. Until I saw Mel Gibson's 'The Patriot', this was the worst film I had ever seen. The nauseating romance scenes, the blindingly cliche dialogue, the boring chase scenes, it's interminable length - these all add up to one of the worst movies of the century. Like a few of the other reviewers, I, too, had to summon up great strength not to burst out laughing and cheering when Leo slipped into the dark Atlantic. (I couldn't summon up enough and may have ruined it for a few people.) I imagine people like the film's love story and drama, but you get more drama from a table and chairs. 'Titanic' would have been just a laughably bad movie, except for it's promotion and production. Now it's just an unbearable waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanic Load!!!!","review":"The first half is standard chick-flick tripe. The second half is alright with the boat sinking, but would have been better if you didnt already know it was going to happen!!!(a fictional story, and not the story of the Titanic would have made it much better) The 2nd star is for the sinking and DiCrapio dying at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHICK FLICK, NOT AS HISTORICALY CORRECT AS THOUGHT","review":"A lot of people like this film because of the romance in it. This romance has been done to to death. Other's enjoy it because of the music and some because of the historical value of the sinking of the Titanic. This movie is not as a historically correct as people think. It may be visually correct but historically there are things missing and things added. Here is one example. The wireless operators where never given the command to send the distress signal CQD in the movie, they went straight to SOS. This was a big thing historically. As it went really they recived the CQD command and the wireless operators started sending it off casually thinking it was a drill, then they recieved the command of SOS and thats when they realised that it was no drill. So buy this movie if you want to see DiCaprio or Kate Winslet, but go for one of the earlier Titanic movies for historical value."},{"rating":"2","title":"still an excellent movie after many viewings","review":"for those of you who thought the movie was predictable...HELLO! Of course it was predictable... Gee Mr. Cameron, I don't think the ending will work where the ship sinks. Why dont you rewrite it so everybody lives happily ever after. Duh! Sure the love story was sappy, but if it made you remotely aware of the horrible tragedy than the movie worked. I've never heard of a bad movie winning 11 Academy Awards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever made.","review":"There's not much to say about this movie except that it was absolutely brilliant!! This is one of the best movies ever made. The story of the Titanic always differs from what source you look at. It was great to finally have all the pieces brought together in a movie. All of the characters were well portrayed and the design of the ship was stunning. This is one movie to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":".....what a let-down.....","review":"am i the only person who absolutely wants to scream at James Cameron for not putting out a proper DVD of this movie? i mean, he puts out a double disc DVD of \\"The Abyss\\" but not \\"Titanic?\\" i would have rather he held it back from being released on DVD than release this featureless, pointless waste of money. if i wanted JUST the movie, i'd buy the VHS...DVD isn't about the movie as much as its about the FEATURES....wake up, Jim.....get on the ball here.....i wanna hear just two words from ya: \\"Special Edition\\"....snap to it Mr. King-Of-The-World!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As overrated as it was expensive","review":"Granted, the special effects / sets / costumes were amazing. I first saw it at Silver City Metropolis, and the movie really played up to the super-theater's oversized screen.The second time was a real disappointment -- There was absolutely no substance to back up the visuals. All I could see was poor acting and a laughable script.The movie is impressive, but ultimately forgettable. It's worth viewing once (preferably on a big screen)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overblown movie ever ! I want to give it 0 stars!","review":"I don't recomend this movie to anyone at all.

It was a big ball of nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beware- there is a HUGE special edition coming out soon!","review":"There is an awesome set coming out soon, I think 4 DVDs of material. Deleted scenes, making-ofs, documentaries, etc. Avoid this vanilla version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't mind it, but not a classic.","review":"I wrote a review a few days ago, but forgot to add this: For all those people who continue to 'trash' Leonardo DiCapprio just remember this, he gave one of the best acting performances EVER for his role in 'What's eating Gilbert Grape'. It's just too bad he couldn't show his acting talent in Titanic. For that kind of money, he should done a far better job. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I had anticipated SO much more when I went to see this movie in the theater last year. It deserved maybe two of it's eleven Acedemy Awards...certainly not Best Picture. Lousy acting, lousy story, lousy script (did it even have a script??). If all it takes to win Academy Awards these days is a hit song, some special effects and a teen heart-throb...it's truly a sad time for the entertainment industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easiliy the most over-rated movie of all time...","review":"Cameron had the material of his life in his hands.. Look at the classic by Negulesco. Instead, he chose to make a movie about two sinking teenagers... Let them sink... Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a bad movie, it is only SOOOOO pedestrian.... It has no screenplay to talk about, an absolutely average direction, the acting is dull (but they didn't have anything to act)... It has 35 seconds of sheer brilliance (sounds little to a 180 minutes plus movie, and indeed is): the seconds that follow the decision of the musicians to keep playing... But it did not belong to the storyline, that's why it was so short.. And yes, that music kills me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPECTACULAR","review":"Great costumes, great acting and great special effects. I liked the fact that they cast lesser known actors and actresses. I think this added a sort of \\"freshness\\" to it.

Kate Winslet and Billy Zane rule!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total DVD Disappointment","review":"After having enjoyed this film in the theater, I couldn't wait for the home video to hit the market. After continuing to enjoy the film on VHS, I finally bought a DVD player and began to update my movie collection by purchasing DVD's of my favorites.Titanic was one I couldn't wait to have on DVD. I must say I was never so disappointed in a single DVD purchase as I was with Titanic.The single DVD contains one trailer and the movie...that's it!! No bonus material at all! But my biggest complaint was the video transfer. For a DVD, it is no better than the VHS tapes, in both video and sound quality. And if you put any zoom on it at all, it goes grainy even with a minimum amount. One would think that for the exorbant price of this DVD it would have been of top-shelf quality. Nothing could be further from the truth! This has to be the worst buy of any DVD in my collection, and I am really disgusted with it because it was one of my all-time favorite films."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a wonderful movie","review":"Titanic unaccurate?

Kind of sad and is fun to watch. It is the best! You will never get sick of watching this flick. It was a huge dissaster and is remembered after all these years. With Rose and Jack lighting up the screen you cant go wrong. Those two love bugs are a perfect match. A lot of romance and action this movie is for YOU! Spose to be a VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, Titanic fans!!","review":"If you're a Titanic fan and you're reading this, I'll tell you that we should all join together to write more and more 5 star reviews for it.

I'm glad I didn't spend my hard earned money on this turkey. I will say from the outset that this is a beautiful looking film, but that is as far as it goes. Perhaps if I were a 12 year old girl I might think it was great, but I am a grown woman who can't for the life of me imagine what is so wonderful about Leo! No story here. Of all the wonderful real-life stories that must have taken place on this ship, why try and fabricate one? And a bad one at that! The earlier Hollywood version of \\"Titanic\\" with Barbara Stanwyck & Clifton Webb, as well as the British version \\"A Night To Remember\\" are both far superior to this attractive trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The best Movie Ever Made","review":"\\"Titanic\\" was all I expected, which was a somewhat interesting love story and a special effects bonanza. Leo's totally mediocre acting job is what ruined this movie. The score by James Horner and all of the other actors save this movie from totally bottoming out. James Horner, as always, delivers a masterful score. And with James Cameron directing, I was really hoping for some action, which I got. Buy this movie, if only for the second tape. The sinking is one of the greatest hours of movie I've ever seen.

It is a great way to show of your new dolby home theatre system if not your taste in movies. Home theatre sales people should all be issued a copy of this one. Hollywood doesnt seem to be able to make an intelligent epic anymore, not that they were ever very good at it. Greatest movie of all time, I dont think so.

Though the visual effects were spectacular, the only entertaining point in the entire ordeal is the sinking of the ship. The plot is sappy, stupid, and poorly-written. I found the film incredibly shallow and boring. There was no chemistry between Rose and Jack to make the love story seem at all real to me. DiCaprio's performance definitely did not live up to the talent he showed in previous films such as \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\" and \\"The Basketball Diaries\\". I was unimpressed with most of the other acting as well. This movie was not an innovation in filmmaking nor did it portray any message to the viewer.

As a film studies student, I find it incredible that such a film should ever recieve 8 Oscars! Can this film really be placed in the same category as semiological and representational masterpieces such as 'On the Waterfront'? A truly great director is one that uses his films as a medium through which he communicates his ideas about people to the public.

I saw it as nothing more than a dime store novel dressed up with special effects;Twister mounted on the scale of grand romance. some argue that the introduction of fictional, modern characters on the ship was a strong asset, allowing us to experience the tragedy by being able to identify with the characters, while others see it as a travesty.

Then when she dies, after a real marrage, children, and grandchildren, she returns to her one night stand. Yup. This is a movie for all the 12-14 year old girls utterly infatuated with Leo D.

The plot is, well, let's just say down-right watered-down. The movie tries to be an emotion filled drama but to me, came out only as a corny attempt to make me cry. The director is awesome, but the storyline is the only problem. The storyline is the reason why I deducted three stars. I saw this movie in theaters. While 20% of the people were crying, mostly insecure teenage girls that were just dumped. I on the other hand, feel asleep after two hours and woke up when the ship was sinking and laughed.

Was he supposed to be a nice guy, a hero, or a jerk? The script was poorly written. The writer had no clue what to do after each scene. What's the deal with the gun chase??

Personally, I belong to the second category. The film's special effects are generally impressive, but the plot is so utterly stupid that it makes the average soap opera look like fine art. Rarely have so many cliches been used in the same story, the characters are stereotypes and the plot turns are generally very predictable. James Cameron made some fine films in the 1980s, but in the 1990s he lost his touch, which is evident here.

I did not find anything in the storyline that made me think, made me question, made me feel especially touched, which I think the movie had a potential to do if the dialogue and acting were done at a higher level.

Aside from the wonderful screenplay, the actors performed well also. This was one of the films starring Di Caprio that did not aggrivate me. Personally, I think that he is a terrible actor and cannot make any of his portrayed characters look believable. Kate Winslet had an outstanding performance. This is the movie that will make Winslet a star. The only reason that she did not win the Oscar is because she is English and because the Oscar winners are rigged. All of the actors performed greatly in this romantic-story that will be held in the hearts of moviegoers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jack Dawson, a poor artist who wins a ticket on Titanic's first voyage to New York.

In only four days, Jack and Rose fall in love, and then disaster strikes.DeCaprio nicely captures the youth, romance, and energy of Jack. Winslett's performance just didn't ring true to me. Zane was wonderful as the villian you love to hate. But the real star of the show is director James Cameron, who created jaw-dropping special effects on such a grand scale.

The reading was very dry, but had a lot of information. So if you wanted straight up information, this book is good for that.

Overall the book does not turn much new ground.McClellan is, as usual, condemned as barely competent. For my two cents, McClellan is the victim of hindsight, and was a serious, effective man, though I have yet to read that in any popular Civil War history. Perhaps McClellan did overestimate the size of Lee's army, but he acted on the data that was provided him. Much like Admiral Jellicoe at the WWI naval battle of Jutland, he did not lose his force, and he held the field, and that was the essential strategic requirement.The book has a general point of view bias to the Union side.

This is all too bad since I'm a McPherson fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry--I'm underwhelmed","review":"With respect to all to the 5-star raters out there, I found this book mediocre at best. 96 pages and we still haven't even gotten to South Mountain. Only 35 pages out of 156 were actually devoted to the battles, and this includes all four: Turners Gap, Cramptons Gap, Harpers Ferry, and FINALLY Antietam. And in the handful of pages on the battle itself, nothing new or thought-provoking. I know McPherson is trying to write a different kind of military history with a broader perspective than just how many Minie Balls were shot per cubic yard, but this book was a singular disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"... dissertation","review":"What a disappointment for serious Civil War students. McPherson uses his well-deserved reputation from \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" to hawk a relatively... short work focusing on this one battle. The book is only 200 pages in length. You have 50 pages of footnotes, index, etc., 100 pages of historical context preamble and then 50 pages of well trod accounts of this battle. Antietam a crossroad? One could argue that Vicksburg and maybe Gettysburg deserve this depiction. Borrow this book from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANTIETAM WITH NO ANTIETAM","review":"Because I have immense respect for McPherson, I am thoroughly perplexed by this brief account with its ill-chosen title. If you have already read his magnificent BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, there is no point in reading CROSSROADS. It is the same coverage of the political dynamics with little discussion of Antietam itself. In fact, it gets exasperating, waiting for him to get to the battle, which he finally does, in cursory form, as almost an afterthought. There is no real insight here, new or otherwise. This might be a nice introduction for someone totally unfamiliar with the build-up to the carnage of Antietam. For anyone with even a nominal command of Civil War content, I suggest avoiding it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn....","review":"This book was very disappointing. I bought \\"Crossroads of Freedom - Antietam\\" expecting a volume detailing the battle at Antietam. What I got was a short book rehashing the general history of the Civil War. As a matter of fact, I don't believe there are more then 20 pages in this entire book devoted to the battle at Antietam. I would not recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for historians","review":"James McPherson has again dug deep into the past to pull out sources and material for his latest work. Even though there is quite a bit of info about McClellan and others the main focus does stay with Antietam. He just gives an over view to better set the tone for the reader so one is not confused as to what occured on 17 September 1862.Very well done, easy to read and it's not filled with trivial detail that would bog down the average reader.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Indepth Discription","review":"McPherson never disappoints. Even though we know the implications of Lee going into Maryland, this book covers ALL aspects of the battle. More than that, it explains the political aspects of this battle, both at home and abroad. Antietam was indeed a battle that changed the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely interesting, to say the least.","review":"To put it in a nutshell, quoting from Alexander J. Field, Haim Ofek \\"argues that humans were selected for exchange, and that both the harnessing of fire, and the development of a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, were dependent on a previous selection for exchange\\".In any event, I would like to add that this work reminds me of Morris Berman's \\"Wandering God: A Study in Nomadic Spirituality\\", in the sense, that, both books treat plenty of issues which, although instrumental to defend their respective thesis, are so interesting that, even if you do not agree with their authors, they make well worth it reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible idea","review":"I sincerely hope this article was written tongue in cheek! Better to limit the amount of public funds donated to the care one receives if one abuses his or her body in such a manner, perhaps then they will learn to respect and take care of their bodies.

Personally, I'd choose freedom any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely inappropriate","review":"My daughter was assigned to read this book in her 7th grade literature class. She showed the book first to my husband who thought it was borderline inappropriate after reading one page.

After doing some research, I have found that this book has been banned in many schools in America and some have even called this soft porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not poetry.","review":"This book is entertaining enough, but to call it poetry is very misleading.

I read this book in about 3 hours, and that's because I wanted to keep reading it, and it is a GREAT book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book does a very good job of expressing all of the emotions of teenage love. \\"What My Mother Doesn't Know\\" is a novel of short verses, all written by the point of view of a 14-year-old named Sophie. In the book she tells about her first 3 loves. In this coming-of-age novel, Sophie learns the difference betweeen lust and love, and also learns that you can't always trust people, even if you think you love them. The poems are really well written. This book flows; I finished it in 2 hours. Make sure when you start reading this one you have plenty of time, because you won't want to stop. I think anybody who has ever either been in love or thought they have been in love can relate to most of this book, no matter what age you are or what experiences you have had. I really suggest that anyone reads this book, whether you normally like to read or not; you'll like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I'm sorry, but I really don't see why so many people like this book. Personally, I hated it. It took me about half an hour to read it, and with the short poem-style writting, you can't get a feel of the characters or setting. My advice; go to the library and get any book by this author before buying any of her books. If you don't like her style, then I guess I've saved you a few dollars, which you can spend on much better litterature. If you like it, more power to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What My Mother Doesn't Know","review":"Even though the set-up of the book is a bit funky (set-up like a poem even though it isn't) it is a great read! This book takes you through the eyes of Sophie with her 3 loves Lou, Dylan, and Murphy (a.k.a. Robin). This book shows a lot of issues that most teens face some are being accepted, popularity, and girls who are boy crazy. Even though this book is strange sometimes its a great read! I recommened this for girls ages 13-15 because there is some issues which people under 12 shouldn't read about until they are older."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty good book","review":"This book is a good book for girls who like romance. It is about a girl named sophie that has a hard life at home so she looks to her friends and guys for support. Through the enetire book she has three relationships, one with a guy named Dylan that the more she gets to know him the more she dislikes him. Another with a boy she met on cyber space named Chaz. And the last one with a sweety, nerdy kid named Murphy. This book is fast paced because you always want to see what is going to happen next and who she is going date. I read this book in three days along with another book. It is not my favorite but I liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"what my mother doesnt know","review":"What My Mother Doesn't KnowWhat this book is about is a teenage girl who's name is Sophie the other characters in the book are Sophie's mom her two best friends Rachel and Grace and then there's Murphy and his parents and of course Sophie. The story takes place at mainly Sophie's house but there is also other places to like Murphy's house the Art Museum. The plot of the story is that Sophie has been really interested in boys so first she went out with Dylan and then it was Chaz and now its Murphy and all this time her mom doesn't know that she has been going out with any of them. The point of view is first person because she is referring to her self as I. Then the theme of the story is that keeping things from your parents isn't always the right thing to do even though it might seem like it. The conflict is what Sophie's mom doesn't know about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"What My Mother Doesn't Know","review":"This book was about Sophie's first love, then her second... then her third. Her life turns up-side down when she starts to like the biggest freak in school.

Should she ruin her perfect life or would it not be that bad in the first place? Should she take the risk or stay on the safe side?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What My Mother Thinks She Knows","review":"I believe that this was that this was a very good book . It will help me when I am in relationships with other people and it will help other people in their relationships as well if they read this book.I know lots of girls my age would enjoy reading this book because it is a chick flick . I would defiantly read another book by this author because she knows how to keep the reader interested . This book was not a hard book and easy to understand. I can relate to it because things that happen in this book happen in an everyday girls life. What My Mother Doesn't Know was a great book and I would recommend it to all girls of my age."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time Favorite","review":"I never have favorite books, but I adore this one. I first saw some of Sonya Sones' writing in \\"Love and Sex\\" by Michael Cart, and I liked it a lot. I read 'Stop Pretending' and then 'One of those Hideous books where the mother dies' and i was hooked. Within the first few poems in 'what my mother doesn't know' i loved the book. I could relate to some of the stories SO well. It's real emotions and real issues. Not just come cliche thing that some writers associate with all teenagers. It's a great book, and i would definatley reccomend it. And all of Sonya Sones' other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"The book is very cute and exactly as I thought it would be.

I wanted more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's THAT Good!","review":"I love books that make me feel like I am really listening to the real thoughts of a real person who I can really relate to. I totally feel that way reading 'What My Mother Doesn't Know.' This is the best book I've read since 'My Fractured Life' which is about the best book ever about how things really feel today. Just like 'My Fractured Life', 'What My Mother Doesn't Know' is like sitting up in to that time of the night where it's almost easier to call it morning and talking with someone you totally know even though you don't know them, but you can relate to everything they say as they tell you about their whole life. What other books can make you feel that way? If you totally love 'My Fractured Life' then I promise and swear that you will totally love 'What My Mother Doesn't Know'. It really is that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! Who would have known it was a book of \\"poems\\"?!?","review":"This book made me so mad!... This was a VERY quick read, with no tangible plot or deep charactarization. It was a book based on \\"poems\\" about her life. The poems themselves described what was going on, which is the main reason this book was so bad. The poems are boring and dry and offer little insight to the situations going on. I reccomend you do not read this book, unless you are keen on wasting your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this in the shortest time ever","review":"I had my light on all night because I was reading this book!!

Her mother was upset, as the book is to adult, and maybe used for a sixteen year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"This book is one of the worst I have ever read. The plot is so incredibly dull. The only thing I like was the poetry format. Unfortunatly, that is the only thing appealing about this book. The plot consists of the main character Sophie whining about her mother and her boyfriends. Also the book was so short. It took me less than an hour to read. But thank goodness, I didn't have to endure the book anymore. But, even against my advice, if you decide to read this book, just remember that when you're finished you will probably say, \\"What a fabulous waste of my life.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Stars","review":"What complete and utter garbage. People actually gave this book a 5 star rating? *Wow* Implying this book contains poetry is laughable. The story line/plot is passé at best. Recommended reading for pre-pubescent girls/boys? Only if you advocate teen sex. I can't believe some actually recommended this for young girls. Save yourself some time and money... I've seen better writing on bathroom walls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Girls Life Story--","review":"Ninth grader, Sophie, thinks that everything is going wrong in her life. That is, until she meets the super sexy, \\"guy of her dreams\\", Dylan.

However, as she sees her friends and the way they act around their boyfriends, she realizes that maybe the relationship isn't as perfect as she thought it was. She finds herself starting to like guys that she never thought she would, for example, a guy off the internet, who she has never even met!! She also likes Murphy, YUCK!! Who would like Murphy??!?? The things that she deals with in this book are things that girls of that age deal with everyday, like what to wear to the dance, what to say to that cute guy from art class, and how to not have your parents find out about your boyfriend!! It's a great book, funny, clever, romantic, and extremely true to life! I would definately recomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What My Mother Doesnt Know Review","review":"Ages 11 and up. Sophie has many loves. In this book, \\"What My Mother Doesnt Know,\\" she talks about her life. The book tells about all her loves and how she feels about them. She's an average almost fifteen year old girl, crushing on all these boys she knows. She likes to love and to be loved. Her mind, heart and body do not seem to agree much though, when it comes to who she likes and does not like. She is not very close to her mom, but her friends help her out by writing letters to her when they leave for the summer. This book deals with friendships, teenage love, and mother-daughter relationships. This book is a good book for teenage girls to read and relate to because it deals with some of the same things teenage girls would deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book was horrendous. The style was creative, yes, with all the little poems, but it was such a waste of 200 pages seeing as there was only about 10 words on each page. The characters were all one dimensional, you only saw one side of their personality, and you never developed any feelings for them at all. Sophie, the main character is annoying as heck and I'll be damned if she's an \\"average teenage girl\\".This book is predictable, boring and sicky sweet. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Horrendous."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARGHHHHHHHH","review":"Why do people like this book so much? The plot is very very cliche...and the shortness of the book only makes this worse because there is no room for it to develop a slightly unique plot...The characters didn't develop well and before I knew it, the book was already over. I spent 10 bucks on a book that lasted 30 minutes and was written in a poetry format."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't See Why Everybody Loves This Book","review":"I read this book over a year ago, when I took it out from the public library. I had heard good reviews about it, and a lot of people said it was very good. \\"It has a great plot, and it's very true to real life\\", --a close friend.Well honestly, the quote you have just read from my friend is way off. This book does not have a great plot, and it is not true to real life. The 'poems' in the book are poorly written, in my opinion, I think they could have better. And really, this book is reccomended for 12 years olds? What a joke. That pisses me off.The speaker in the book writes about her sexual encounters, which I don't find appropriate for 12 years old, no matter how 'mature' they may seem. Really, what mother is going to want their preteen daughter reading this kind of book?Overall, the book was boring and the plot was bad. Don't waste your money or your time reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Mothers and Daughters","review":"I read this book for two reasons. First, the author bragged at a conference it had been banned from several schools/libraries. She was so proud of it. Second, as a mother I wanted to know what the teen's mother didn't know. I must admit I couldn't put the book down. It is easy to read. I felt like the book reflected what many teens go through and the importance of parental involvement. When bad things happen, like the perve boys she encounters, she deals with it well. I think it is a great book for teens and parents to use to discuss issues many young girls encounter and feelings they have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way I look at it","review":"The way I look at it is, my own life I mean I'm 14 and my life is almost exactly like that book. I have 2 best friends that are like sisters to me and they would do anything for me, I've dated a total geek, and my mom is in love with T.V. This book is the best book ever, I mean I couldn't even put it down when I started to read it. It's about this girl named sophi (fifi) who is going through some real hard times with boys, friends, her mom, and the internet. It was written in poem form, which I love. I think anybody over the age of 11 should read this book because it talks about more teenage things than childish things.Signed,Lacie"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book =]","review":"I really do recommend this book. I thought it was a great book. It really teaches girls that it really isn't looks in a guy that you should always go for. I would recommend it because it really is a good girl book and has a lot of lessons to learn in it. It also makes you want to keep reading on because it always keeps you wondering what is going to happen next.

It's just her falling inlove with a bunch of guys, but no real plot. This book put me to sleep and is one of the worst i have ever read.

This happens only in the fantasies of the self-absorbed and boring writers of the script. Another offensive aspect of this movie is its lame satire of Christianity. Again there is no characterization of the Adventists, only caricature.

Chapter One drew me in, even with the annoying narrator, because it started the book out with a dead body. However, rather than continuing to follow the murder, the next SIX chapters were backstory. I frankly had no interest in what apartment the narrator had lived in before she moved to Battle Creek, nor did I care about the cockroach that started it all. I wanted to know what happened to the dead guy (who is much more likeable than the main character).

Though broken by first person views, from time to time, the primary view makes it rather hard to follow. Next comes Lola Was Here, dealing more with career issues than romance. Lola wants to make it in New York as a photographer, but has doubts until in Sundae's she meets a man who calms her fears and inspires her to see possibilities. In the final entry, the heroine does not just pass through Sundae's, she works there as a waitress, which is the title of the story. Yet, she wants more and dreams of being a writer. However if she makes it, let us hope that her writing is more engaging than the stories in this anthology. If more fleshed out, they might be more appealing, but as it is, there seemed to be something missing.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Fit Sidekick 2","review":"I just received those and I am returning them back to amazon.

Kelis her vocals are wonderful, the samples are just right and the whole atmosphere is bewitching.

One or a half minute longer and it would have been perfect.The Deep Dish Attacks Mars remix is fabulous. The song starts out with some samples that are similar to those used in another dance song ( forgot the name ) and immediatly set for a creepy tone. This remix is quite lengthy, but not boring.Then there is also the remix by Kamanchi, a project from DJ's Krust and Die. It takes the song to another sound, namely drum and bass. And it works ! Also quite lengthy and good for one of those sweaty drum 'n' bass parties where everyone is dancing. Good choice here.And finally there is the beautiful animated video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death of a Political Plant","review":"This was my first experience with a Ripley book and I was very disappointed.

She acknowledges that all of us value the truth, although each finds ways to justify our lies. The book is thought provoking, while often a bit thick as Bok explores every nook and cranny of each ethical issue. The book creates in each reader the desire to know how far one is willing to go to be honest, and when it is justified to deceive. If you have the patience and time to deeply explore our daily decision making processes, I would recommend this book as an eye-opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets: On the Ethics of Concealment and Revelation","review":"This book was purchased as a gift for my son who teaches Ethics and other subjects at a local university.

The due time has come for the two Witnesses and the agreement with Israel.Reading the books of this series is like having M&Ms; it is hard to stop with one. You will find yourself looking for the next book since you'll finish this one in a day or two.Jenkins does not always resolve issues with his story. We know the GC will break the agreement with Israel, but you never really notice it. The tension is built up, but then just mentioned and forgotten. I would think it would get more attention than it did.I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a lot better","review":"After reading Assassins, I determined that I will not read any more of these books. This one rehashed too much old material and did not do enough to advance the plot. It was predictable and poorly written. The first book in the series was by far the best. The rest have gone downhill steadily. It seems to me that these have become potboilers...a money machine. It really is too bad, because I would like to be able recommend this series to my non-Christian friends, but I just can't do it. They would never again listen to a recommendation from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Assassins","review":"My overall opinion on Assassins was that it was a great book. It had realistic characters and a ralistic setting. Also it had a captivating plot.The best part of the book was when Rayford makes an attempt to assassinate Nicolae Carpathia, the Antichrist. In order to do it, he contacts Albie to purchase a high-powered weapon, and then goes to New Babylon. At the end of the book, he shoots at, and supposedly kills, Nicolae.The best two aspects of the book are the characters and the setting. The characters are realistic for several reasons. One of them is that they think like real people. Also the characters act and feel like real people. What I mean by this is they feel pain, sorrow, and anything a human feels, plus they react like anyone would to situations. The setting is realistic too, because it has real cities, real climates, and the author describes the places in as much detail as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"book 6 left behind series","review":"This book just wants you to keep on reading to find out how this ends. empressive way the authors leave you wondering.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Series","review":"Scary to read, but cannot put them down once I start reading.Love the authors.

I have read a number of other books in this genre which have been recommended in these reader reviews, including Nichols THE FIST OF GOD, Peretti's THE VISITATION, and Kleier's THE LAST DAY. Of all these, THE LAST DAY is by far the very best read. It has complex plotting, tight-scripted prose and dialogue, fast pace, and one of the most surprising, exciting stories I've read in years. If you're looking for a good book recommendation, that is my two cents worth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has success spoiled Mr. Jenkins and Mr. LaHaye?","review":"I've read and recommended this series to a number of friends since the first book came out. However, Apollyon and Assassins do not begin to equate in quality with the initial books. I have read other reviews saying the \\"cash cow\\" has come into play here and I regret that I must agree. With the upcoming movie of \\"Left Behind\\", I felt that the authors were writing Assassins more as a screenplay than a novel. Please Mr. Jenkins and Mr. LaHaye, return to your prior quality writing. The movie rights will take care of themselves as will the screenplay! Leave the \\"who-dun-it\\" theatrics out because it just cheapens an otherwise invaluable series of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAHHHHH!!!!!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I've read all the others, of course, absolutely loved the way they put Revelations in understandable, modern terms, and was anxious to get the next saga. However, I was extremely disappointed with everything about this book, including its ending. It was just more of the same ugliness that was stretched to fit the book.

I won't buy the next books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long awaited and worth it!","review":"Another great saga of the post-Rapture experiences of Cloe,Buck, Rafe and all the other Trib Force members.

Any perceptive reader would realize that the scenarios plotted are absolutely implausible, that the world would not nearly sustain the kind of technological infrastructure remaining in the wake of such catastrophic disaster, and the errors in characterization (Rayford, anyone?) are annoying to the point of distraction. Never let it be said that these authors shine with brilliance, for such obtuseness will be met with right vindictive emotive capacity."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've assassinated the series!","review":"Please, Jerry, Tim, it's time to move on. You've wrung as much from this bleak concept as you possibly can, and the sponge is dry. If you need inspiration, go read Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY. There is no better crafted a Judgment Day story than that. And while you're biting your nails over it, check out the depth of plot, characters and prose. THAT'S a novel with substance. No more pablum, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book alone would not be enough to capture my interest","review":"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed the previous books of the Left Behind series, but found Assassins to be sluggish. As I read this story, I couldn't help but feel that it had been written by a different author. Its style is not consistent with the other books in area of character development. I felt as though I was turning pages to give me a mere \\"update\\" into their perilous situations. Rayford's moodiness, Leah's brash personality, Buck's indifference to his family, Chloe's disappearance into the woodwork all left me bored. The authors, however, did a good job of stringing me along to the next book with the last few chapters. The ending provided some hope that the next book will have some answers, action and get back on track with character development. The subject matter here is incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I thought that the book was very good. Everyone I know is on a waiting list to borrow my copy!

The demonic horseman, visable only to believers, destroy one third of the remaining unbelievers leading to the predicted death of The Wailing Wall Witnesses.

The characters are paper thin, the writing lackluster, and the plot, decidedly simplistic.

This guy thinks he is writing a bible sequel","review":"Let me say this first, I believe in GOD! This book is pure hogwash. This whole notion of God Vs. the devil is nothing more than a step backwards for our struggling culture. This book gives the reader the idea that their is a devil here on earth making people do bad things, and we need a savior to \\"save\\" us all. I don't buy it one bit. There is no evil force turning our souls rotten, what happened to free will. I hate it when people start talking about hell and heaven as tangible places where our souls actually go. These places and peoples (Satan, angels, etc.) are dreams of a confused animal that has lost its way. True immortality comes from within the heart and mind, as well as through our offspring which shares half of our genetic infomation. Face it, there is no such thing as heaven, hell, or the devil - they are metaphors for our own insecurities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the series since the first installment.","review":"This book contained more of the things I had been looking for: descriptions of life during the tribulation period; action; more illustration of the GC leadership, Nicolae and Leon in particular. Having been disappointed with Apollyon, this book was very satisfying. More pages could have been devoted to the Gala Celebration, as too much flew by too quickly. Also, I like cliffhangers, but this one is a little too much! I don't see why the resurrection of the \\"shooting victim\\" could not have been included here, i.e. go about 50 pages further. Not knowing who the \\"assassin\\" was at this point is not a problem. Bottom line: very well done, considering the challenge they have before them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book So Far!","review":"I really enjoyed this novel! Nicolea keeps seeming darker and darker with each passing novel, and the part were Carpathia prays to Satan In this novel gave me the shivers.

Think about though wasn't Rozenweig acting strange towards the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose the padding!","review":"Like a few other posts, I agree that Jenkins and LaHaye sacrificed content for cash cow in this sixth installment of an otherwise exciting series. It takes four hundred pages to tell this segment of the tale whereas the actual plot events can be summarized in about two hundred words! Please, Jerry, Tim and Tyndale - either slow down the production line or just shorten it - if your story is only 100,000 more words long, don't use 500,000 words to tell it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We deserve more for our money","review":"This sixth rehash of the same basic stuff has worn out my welcome. And now they intend to stretch it out for ANOTHER six books? Heaven help us! What people think is a witnessing tool is, in reality, nothing more than a profit mechanism for the authors and publisher. The public is being duped. Again. If you really want to wake up to the ploy that's being perpetrated on you, pick up a copy of a REAL eschatological thriller, the end-time book to end all end-time books, Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY. That novel has a heck of a lot more on it's mind than simply making a buck off of impressionistic people. If you have an open mind and you are willing to use it, read this novel.

It's a story about God and Satan going head to head for souls during a presidential campaign. Great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't keep me interested...","review":"Book six of a story that should have been told in three books!The concept of the series is captivating, but considering the lack of creativity in the writing, story, and character development, I lost interest by book four. Continued on to book five because of morbid curiosity, then started book six, but three quarters through, put it down without the slightest interest in finding out what the big cliffhanger was going to be this time.I was most disappointed with the lack of religious depth. End times theory was totally glossed over and addressed only superficially.The biggest objection though, was the shameless way the authors have tried to stretch this \\"Left Behind\\" cash cow over as many books as humanly possible. Each book (from book 3 on) was filled with page after page of what can only be described as filler! Summaries of experiences from past books, and endless retelling of the character's personal \\"left behind\\" experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Said What???","review":"Give me a break! The dialogue in Assassins was ridiculous. At times, I didn't know who said what. It would have been nice if the authors could have written decent tag lines with the dialogue.

A much better Christian fiction novel was LUMINOUS by Peter Quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's get to the end","review":"Is it just me or are they trying as hard as possible to stretch this series out as far as they can? I do love the books, but Apollyon dragged a little and Assassins drags a lot. It is good to be able to see so much of each character, but do we really need this series to be open ended? Let's start to tie up some of the loose ends and finish this thing up. It is a great book though, and I did enjoy every minute of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with this series already!","review":"I agree with a number of other reviewers that this series has stretched on way past where it should have stopped. The original Left Behind novel started off well, but it seems the length of the series was stretched by publishers who wanted to make as much money as possible off of the series. I see no reason why \\"The Indwelling\\" and \\"Assassins\\" couldn't have been merged into a single book. A lot of what the authors put forward was rehashed in previous books, like a television soap opera with Monday and Friday shows that mirror each other. Those still interested in reading well written, realistic scenarios of the apocalypse should read The Christ Clone Trilogy and Conquest of Paradise instead. Both those books were a lot more believable, and they didn't need twelve books to tell a good story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit","review":"I would have never guesed how the book ended....it leaves you wanting book #7 right now!book 6 was probably my favorite so far...it's a toss up between books 1,2,3,4,5 & 6 for favorite...ok ok so I like them all. but book #6 is so far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series presents the pretrib rapture viewpoint very well.","review":"This series of books seems to be biblically accurate to me from my own reading of the series and the Bible text that matches. However, I personally subscribe to the mid tribulation rapture viewpoint. This is a well written set of novels; maintaining consistency of style and content in a series of novels is difficult from some of the others I have read, and these authors seem to be doing a very good job so far... We'll see in the next/last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tribulation \\"force\\"? ...","review":"Please. I admire Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins, but surely, this is the poorest written series, ever. I've gotten this far only because I was curious to find out what happened to one character. The writing is silly and implausible at times. None of the \\"force members\\" even remotely resemble some of the saints we read about in the Bible. The truth be told, these are the sorriest set of \\"believers\\" I've ever encounted. They are portrayed as lacking power and faith. You will find yourself wondering what they have actually accomplished since the Rapture. The series itself gives no actual insight into end times and is no doubt in favor of the pre-tribulation rapture. It makes no room or argument for a mid or post tribulation rapture. If you aren't a student of the Word you must not rely on any of these books to give you a clear or unbiased teaching on what believers can expect as we wait for Christ to return.I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it","review":"I have managed to trudge through all 6 of these books out of sheer will to understand why it's so successful. I can't believe that books that lack depth, story, sense of characters, and are so badly written can be on the best sellers list.The characters in these books are unbelieveable, shallow, too perfect (after being saved), and totally uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete, choppy, rushed","review":"The Assassins is not up to the standards set in the first two books. As the series progresses it appears that the focus is on getting the book to market instead of developing the plot and expanding on the prophecies of Revelation. If the schedule of two books per year is met, I doubt if I will buy any of the following books. The Assassins is chopped up to try and keep three story lines moving, there is repetition, and inconsistencies, not a good effort. It was a struggle to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be self-contained novels, not episodes in a soap.","review":"I agree with the reviewers that say that the authors are just dragging out the series because it's a cash cow. Really good series have self-contained novels that can stand on their own; think of C.S. Lewis's Narnia books or Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, or the Star Wars movies, for that matter. Even though it's best to see them all as part of a bigger series, the individual works stand on their own. That's not true with Left Behind. The overly intentional cliffhangers are nothing more than cheap marketing ploys to get us gullible readers to keep on shelling out the bucks. Maybe some enterprising insiders should start leaking plot elements to the public so the authors can't get away with this kind of tactics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promotes an adversarial approach to non-Christians.","review":"One of the biggest problems with this book is that more than the others, it makes the reader want to hate the enemies instead of love them with the love of Jesus. If people are cheering when bad guys get killed, then something is wrong. We should grieve that they died without knowing Jesus. This book and this series goes too far in demonizing non-Christians and doesn't show their humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sluggish and slow","review":"I am a believer, and I have been challenged by the Left Behind series to be more diligent in my Bible study and prayer life. However, with each new book in the series I feel that more words are used to cover less ground plot-wise. It's as though someone - the author, the publisher, I don't know who - is stretching this story out as far as it can possibly be stretched. Even the font size is bigger, and there are fewer lines per page! TWELVE BOOKS? Please, it's a great story, but someone, for some reason, is going overboard. I guess as long as people (like myself) are hooked and buy the latest installment, the series will go on. Maybe the next book will negate all of my complaints by resolving Hattie's dilemma(PLEASE!) and including more than one major plague and one major event."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great series! But this is the weak link","review":"Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins have created an excellent tale. Yet, the repeating story elements are a let down. I couldn't wait to get the book but like most of my friends we had trouble getting through it. I read all of the other books in one or two days.You have to read it to be positioned for the next book. But my hope is for less reflection and repetition in the upcoming story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, and I can't wait for the next book!","review":"This book is an attention getter. It's easy to empathize with the characters; I don't want to be Left Behind. I'm anxiously waiting to see what happens in the next book. I love the scriptural explanations and how they are woven into the fabric of the story. The characters are are believable, and they pull you into the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"How about six stars!? Revelation simplified.","review":"If you have found the book of Revelation confusing, read these books, then reread Revelation. This scripturally-based, (fiction, of course), saga of the truth as it could be now, leaves no room for doubt where you'll want to be in the Rapture. Don't waste too much time analizing the perfection of the work....understand the message that the authors have clarified for us and that the gift of eternal life IS PERFECT! Thanks for six very enlightening books. Looking forward to the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell-bound and gasping for more!","review":"The dynamic duo have done it again. As the tribulation moves rapidly to conclusion, the authors have brought out the urgency, feelings and emotions of all characters. For those who still read with imagination, this book is spellbinding. Tragedy, laughter, sorrow that will soften the heart of the hardest of readers and true conviction. For those who believe the events will come to fruition, the challenge is evident. To those who do not believe, certainly thoughts to ponder for those who reject the proposition.The ending is accurate and yet far from predictible, even if you have read the Bible account.Jenkins and LeHaye have and are doing a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb! Can't wait for the next one","review":"Oh wow, I'm so bummed out because I read the Assassins the same day I received it.

I've read all the \\"kids\\" Left Behind series also."},{"rating":"2","title":"time freezing","review":"This is the best book in the series so far.

Unfortunately, the LEFT BEHIND series disappoints on all levels. This is very lightweight stuff, people, in my opinion. The very finest of all endtimes novels, without question, is the quintessential Judgment Day suspense thriller, THE LAST DAY (Glenn Kleier, 1998, Warner books). If you want to read a gripping, intelligent and thought stimulating drama that will alternately fascinate you, amuse you, scare the living bejeebies out of you, and keep your mind boggled till the wee hours, there is none better. LAST DAY is the ultimate Last Day experience, and if you haven't read it yet, you're in for a soul-quaking treat. Not a one of these LEFT BEHIND novels comes anywhere close."},{"rating":"2","title":"ugly loser","review":"I think that assassins was one of the best books I've ever read.

The charactersin the books are so real and Jenkins and LeHay draw you towards understanding the frailties of humans through these people.

CAN I GET A TIDBIT OF WHAT COMES NEXT?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent read, which holds your attention","review":"While I either bought or borrowed the other books in the series, I started as number 43 on a \\"wait list\\" at the local library for Assassins. The book was worth the wait, though. While the reviews of previous events can be irksome, they do help to pull together the full story. The depictions of the Horsemen were well done, but most intriguing with Assassins is the \\"who shot JR\\" finish. If I count right it could have been any of eight people, including the three less loyal potentates. Will be anxious to learn the \\"rest of the story,\\" and then to move on into the Great Tribulation, come next February."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOSING STEAM BUT STILL COMPELING","review":"The first 300+ pages are basically filler and catch-up for the real action that occurs at the end. As the title implies, there are several assassins here. Carpathia guns down the Jerusalem Twosome witnesses on their prophesied last day. Lying dead for three days while celebrants dance around their bodies, the two begin to stir and rise to Heaven.Surprisingly, two diametrically opposed characters, Rayford Steele and Hattie Durham, decide independently and separately to kill Carpathia. In the closing pages, during the culmination of the celebration in Jerusalem Carpathia is shot in the head and is clearly dead.Unclear, is who is responsible; Rayford, Hattie, or one of the ten under-potentates on the stage with Carpathia. Though the authors go out of their way to makes us think it's Rayford, I'm not so sure. And it probably doesn't matter--Carpathia, though dead here is destined to return in INDWELLING."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AWESOME READING SERIES","review":"As a new believer, I have struggled with books and series of books never seeming to be able to finish what ever it was I was reading. In this series of books (Left Behind) I have found a series of books that has filled me with a need to complete everyone of them but then feeling bad because there are only # number of books left in the series. Never before have I felt the need to keep reading a book and not be able to put it down. If you have found yourself with the same problem in the past, you will be very pleasently surprised. This series is very compelling and I find myself giddy every time a new title comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking a breath","review":"Of the 6 books that are out in this series, this book is the slowest, however, it allows you to take a breath. Understanding all that has happened in the pervious books, and in this one is an important element in grasping the themes in the coming ones. It wraps up several story lines, yet unfolds new ones in the process. While not as much a rollercoaster ride as the previous 5, it is, never the less well written, and insightful. A truly interesting plot, that leave you wanting answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk About A Cliffhanger!","review":"With eager anticipation we move toward the mid-week of the saga with speed and trepidation. I was pulling out my hair at the conclusion because now I have to wait for the next book to come out. Great ending, guys. Bravo, bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You","review":"Thank you Tim and Jerry for writing this series. It's made me understand and visualize Revelations. For those who critize the books don't surely understand their true meaning. Even through the story and the characters are fictional the truth of the matter is that events of these kind are in the future of this world. One day god will come take all his believers and leave behind those who are not saved. This series has made think about how we don't know when he is coming so all people need to take a good look at ourselves and ask Will I be one of those who are left behind?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Loved it. Can't get enough of this series!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I can't wait until the next one comes out. I feel like the characters are my friends, and I long to see what will happen in their fictional lives next."},{"rating":"1","title":"2,5 stars. Better than the rest so far.","review":"With the exception of the first book, I've given the Left Behind sequels 1 star, mostly because of the extremely slow pace, where it feels like they took a few chapters and stretched them out to make a whole novel. The other problem is that they are preachy.Well, \\"Assassnis\\" was certainly a step in the right direction. The was some action in the book, not (as in \\"Apollyon\\") only 200 pages into the book. \\"Assassins\\" was also not as preachy as for example \\"Soul Harvest\\".So it's definitely an improvement. There are still problems though. There's still too much filler material and the book could have been about 50 pages shorter (but that's an imporvement from the other books, which should have been about 250 pages shorter). And the story is moving to slowly. I can't understand why they need to stretch it out into so many volumes.2.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective","review":"This book is really great at teaching you what will happen in the end time while still keeping you entertained. The charactors are very real and you feel like you know them at a personal level.The authors are able to use suspence to keep you wanting to read the next book. It just kinda gets confusing with all the different stories going on though.I would definatly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to read this series!","review":"The left behind series is dramatic, suspenseful and most of all, based on the word of God. It was what turned me back to Him when I had forgotten Him. Thank God for LaHaye and Jenkins for putting this wonderful series together, it is very eye opening and makes Revelation very easy to understand and comprehend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Climax Esculates as the Great Tribulation Unfolds","review":"'Assassins: Assignment: Jersalem, Target: AntiChrist,' book #6 of the 'Left Behind series' reaches it's climatic confrontation of the forces of good and evil battle for supermacy in a world without leadership. A Horde of 200 million demonic horsemen slays a third of the world population. The Tribulation Force face the future as fugitives risking their lives to warn others of the Great Deception of the AntiChrist. It's here that history and prophecy come together in Jerusalem for the most breathless and explosive episode in a plot to destroy the AntiChrist as foretold in Revelation 13:1-2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were the collateral damage not so severe, they'd be revised.","review":"Even a cursory analysis of the characterization and plot devices of this volume indicates a general decline in the overall qualitative effect of the series. Most readers are no longer gripped by the minutiae of the Israeli conflagration, nor are the impending catastrophes presented with plausibility or satisfactory allocation of pagination. Major events are dealt with in a summarily dismissive manner, and minor characters consume far too much dialogue space. A more credible reading of the eschatological importment would provide far more casualties and more attention to such details as food and water and other such life sustaining materiel. In short, the heavily perfunctory and homiletic approach of the authors prevents literary and theological appreciation from taking place to any major extent."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea - awful writing","review":"I'm a Chrisian and give \\"Left Behind\\" away all the time. But the series is getting so drawn out, I wish someone would write \\"The Unauthorized Conclusion to Left Behind,\\" and we could be done with it. People die for no reason that I can discern, (ohter than the author doesn't have a place for them), the boy/girl stuff is juvenile \\"does he really like me? then why did he say that?\\", and the irrevelant detail is nauseating: \\"R. took a walk. His phone rang. It was B. B. said, how are you? R. said, fine why did you call. B. said, no reason, I was just thinking about you....\\" PLEASE STOP RIPPING OFF A LOYAL READERSHIP AND GET ON WITH IT.... Thanks and God Bless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to look forward to.","review":"With every book in the series I have learned more about prophecy. Another fan of these books also turned me on to the Zion novels by Brock and Bodie Thoene. I read their most recent book, Jerusalem Vigil which is a must read for anyone who wants to know first hand how God began the fulfillment of end times prophecy in l948. Taken together, this series and all the Left Behind novels bring it all to light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome........Again......","review":"I must say this series of books has gotten me to read once again. My reading time is very limited, yet each time a new book in this series, is released, I can't put it down until I am finished. I would suggest to anyone recieving or buying this book, to begin at the beginning of the series with \\"Left Behind\\". The plot and mystery is woven thru each book. This is meat and potato fiction! If you trust in the Bible to be the Truth, it will help you better understand the what ifs of the last days. My hat is off to these authors, giving a wonderful way of showing Bible prophecy, in situations that we all might be in, if not for the mercy of God. Way to go Jerry and Tim!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a let down.","review":"I was on a left behind high for so long. I read all of the previous books within days. Here I am now on Assasins and I am going on week two of reading it. It isn't nearly the page turner the one written before were. It may be because Lahaye Jenkins and I have such a difference to how we take revelations. Everything is soooo literal with them. I mean so literal it can almost be a bit corny and ridiculous. I will continue on with the series and hopefully soon be done with this assasins so I can move on. Also another thing I don't like is that it seems every character feels no fear. Its quite unbelivable and unrelateable if they never once are afraid especially in a time like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Series to Leave Behind ...","review":"Hey folks, this is SF and commercialism. Not exactly \\"the Word\\". Read the Left Behind, it is imaginative and actually very good. Then stop. The \\"backtracking\\" through earlier books is offensive to the reader who bothered to read the earlier books. These guys have nothing new to say here, just a desire to make a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizzle and No Steak","review":"This was a disappointing continuation of the series. There were a lot of cliffhanger chapters that were underwhelmingly resolved.

I have *never* not finished a book before. I would give this one a pass"},{"rating":"1","title":"They made Rayford into a doofus.","review":"I don't know what the authors were thinking, but this book's characterization of Rayford is pathetic. There's no real sense of continuity with the previous books; this Rayford comes across as demented, unbalanced, vengeful and sometimes just plain old nuts. Sure, the characters are all under stress, but this seems way out of line."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can get beyond the hideous anti-Catholicism. . .","review":". . .based not on what the Church teaches, but what LaHaye and Jenkins have bought into. . .you might find the premise of this book to be a little more thought-provoking than most in this series.At least a legitimate moral question is posed: Is it moral to kill a tyrant? I'll give the authors credit -- a little -- for asking a serious question. But overall, this book -- like the series -- is a poorly written collection of comic book caricatures based on an extreme minority view of \\"Last Things\\" -- a view rejected, not only by Catholic and Orthodox Christians, but by most Protestants as well.If you're into supernatural thrillers, read Charles Williams. If you're into novels about the \\"End Times\\" try \\"That Hideous Strength\\" by C.S. Lewis or \\"Father Elijah\\" by Michael O'Brien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you on to it, yet?","review":"If you haven't seen my rave reviews for The Christ Clown Trilogy all over the place here, you must be blind. I've been writing literally hundreds of them for years, planting them in the readers reviews of every best seller I can find, trying my best to [trick] you into buying them. Just look above at the review I wrote for myself. You'll note, I even spent hours keystroking in \\"yes\\" responses at the bottom to ensure my reviews dominate the tops of the pages forever. Yes, The Christ Clown Trilogy is superior to the Bible itself, filled with the most sentient wisdom imaginable. But most important, if I can fool enough people into buying my books, I can make enough money to quit my day job writing boring speeches for 3rd-rate politicians (not to mention writing boring reviews to flatter myself). Maybe it is deceitful and manipulative and incredibly egocentric, but hey, I've gotten away with it for years, now haven't I?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome, repetitive, uninspired, sloppy","review":"On the whole, it might be less irksome to endure the Tribulation than to sit through the remaining volumes in this series. Characterization, never a strong point in this series, has all but been abandoned here. Dialogue is even more wooden than in the previous books. And plotting has been abandoned in favor of happenstance. Only the least critical reader could find anything of substance and style in this volume. With six projected volumes to go, this series will prove the accuracy of Eliot's remark about the world ending in a whimper, not a bang."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been Left Behind","review":"Left Behind was good enough to get me hooked on reading the next four but Assassins is the last one for me. This has become like the day time soaps where there is little content between the cliff hanging end of one book and the next. There really isn't even a coherent story anymore.Assassins was full of disgusting violence inappropriate for a Christian book series. This is the kind of mind-garbage I try to avoid. The Left Behind series has gone down the sewer of glamorized violence. The original premise of Left Behind, to explore the post-Rapture days based on scripture in Revelation, has worn so thin that there is nothing recognizable anymore. From now on, just leave me behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave behind","review":"The only thing that will be left behind is the money you leaveat the counter for this book. I know this book is fiction, but youmust admit that people take the idea of the Christ's return veryserious and they use Tim and Jerry's books as a tool to understand the rapture. If the authors really believed the rapture was coming, why do they write so many books about it and make so much money. What good will their big pile of wealth do them when they are up in heaven. Wouldn't one book explaining how judgement day is upon us suffice? People...if you really believed this was the end of times you would quit your jobs, be with your families, and pray for forgiveness every waking moment. Instead you go about your days, running the rat race, trying to make more money so you can buy the next installment in this tired series. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"The dog's bollocks?

Maybe you people should stop trying to usurp the Father's power (only He knows the hour), pick up your Cross, and start living a true Christian life. This book reveals the worldly underbelly of Evangelical theology that includes heresies such as prosperity gospel, speaking in tongues, obsession of the Parousia, and lack of a sacramental and prayerful life. Too bad the system requires a minimum of 1 star, or else I would have assigned a negative number."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"Even though I've done grad work towards a PhD I couldn't understand what this book was about.

Avoid if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"Maybe the \\"Left Behind\\" series isn't for me. Maybe I shouldn't have started reading it in the middle, instead of from Book No. 1. Either way, this book was a snore until the last 40 pages or so. Even then, the ending was a huge disappointment.

It looks like a children's book, so I read it to my two 7 year old's. But I don't think it is written for children. It's much too heavy for them to comprehend. And yet, it's a story book, and not likely something adults are going to want to pick up. (I even thought about donating it to the public library, but they would most likely stick it in the children's section, and I don't think it belongs there.) And the book goes on far too long.

It helped her and it helped me quite a bit as well. I think more than anything, if quiet types are grieving, this would help them deal with those of us who express ourselves easily during a loss. Sometimes a huge wedge comes between couples, siblings, parents & children, etc. when we lose someone so close.

It is absoutely just as much (if not more) a book for adults. Everyone else has done a good job of describing what the book is and what it covers. I'll just add that I treasure this and will absoutely give it as gifts to others in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear Soup Book review","review":"This is very good book for those who have suffered a loss in their life. Not just death.. but a child moving away, loss of a job, etc. It looks like a children's book, but I found that it is more meaningful for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear Soup","review":"My child Kindergarton teacher uncle die on new year day this year. Kids where around when he pass away. Got this book for her to share with them. And she just love it. I even got a copy for myself.

It is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Appel's Nineteenth Century Stories","review":"The side-by-side translation are great, is usual with this series. The content of the stories is hit and miss. The final author makes up for any losses. Appel doesn't bother with footnotes here, though he does occasionally in other dual-language volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"Very good movie, will purchase more movies from this person . Movie play all the way through sound was good as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice and Comedy No!!!! He really should stick to more family orientated stuff.","review":"I loved iced cube back when he was with NWA but he really can't do comedy like he use to. He's more of a diverse father figure type now a day's....Now Mike Epps is funny cause he get's hype over little things."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok movie","review":"i like ice cube but, this movie was not the greatest as i thought could of been better , ?No wonder i did not hear about this movie lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"led zeppelin - the song remains the same (2 disc set)","review":"The dvd reminded me of the zeppelin concert that i attended. If you like zeppelin you will enjoy this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Led Zepplin, the song isn't the same","review":"OK, so the songs are the same but I was disappointed in the HD DVD. I got to see Zepplin in concert at about the same time this concert was recorded and have listened to cds ever since. Sound quality wasn't that good neither was picture quality. I think the stuff in the beginning of the dvd just really confused me and I couldn't get into it that much from then on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not flawless, but if you are a fan...","review":"Very good sound, nice picture, The Song Remains the Same has been well remastered.Yes, the cardboard box of the collector's set is rubbish, but the T-shirt and the little cards enclosed are worth the extra price. If you are a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"good picture bad sound","review":"the picture is great of course is blue ray but the sound at least the one i got sounds horrible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"When I bought this Led-Zeppelin DVD, I was hoping for alot more of them live, then those stupid fantasy settings. The quality...on DVD is awsome, so is the sound. When they show concert fotage, its just unreal. I with there was more special features and less fantasy stuff. Other than that, its a great DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-Ray 1080i Transfer","review":"Their are plenty of reviews discussing the content of the film / concert. My review is specifically intended to address the transfer of this film to Blu-Ray. The source signal (at least on my copy) indicates a 1080i transfer (not 1080p). Still, this is the best available version of this package to date. Film is grainy in outdoor sequences, however concert footage is more than acceptable when considering the source material is over 30 years old. Purchased this copy over the Best Buy website in December '07. As other reviewers point out, it has since been discontinued in this particualar format and re-release timing TBD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"This is one of the most incredible DVD's I have ever seen. It really captures the heart and feeling that Led Zeppelin puts into their songs. The performances of \\"No Quarter,\\" \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" \\"Kashmir,\\" \\"Moby Dick,\\" and of course \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" are all unbelievable. No one should have a music collection without this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor filming but strong performance","review":"Much of what has been said of this film is true-- the poor footage, the fatigue of the band and the dated material. However, this video portrays what raw energy Led Zeppelin were capable of on even an average night. Page in particular displays a mind-blowing combination of speed, articulation and taste. Jones and Bonham give jackhammer bass and drum work, while Plant is in the peak of his vocal range. If you forgive the indulgences of a vanity rock film and use this video simply as a time capsule of one of rock's most gifted bands, then The Song Remains the Same will excite even the harshest Zeppelin critics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sound quailty","review":"very poor sound quailtyI have it aslo VHS and its a much better recording.I think they just slaped this on a DVD disk without thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you crazy? Its ZEP and ROCKS!!!","review":"Folks...this movie has never looked better...(oh yeah this is a review from someone who has seen it!)...and its still as crazy/fun/lame/awesome as when I saw it on the big screen a few decades back. It doesn't pretend to be the ultimate Zep show..it was a rough hewn gem (when they explode on the stage to the strains of Rock N Roll it still gives me goose bumps) and this presentation is terrific and the bonus stuff on the second disc is classic and to be appreciated by any true Zep fanatic starving for extra concert and interview footage. There is a reason millions of people tried to get tickets to their upcoming show...THEY ARE LED ZEPPELIN for crying out loud and this is a great timecapsule at a ridiculously low price..stop complaining and enjoy!!its been a long time ...as the song goes"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good but I think the re-editors had their hands tied","review":"I guess the owner of the film told them they could clean up the sound and image but couldn't recut. So the song outtake have to \\"remains the same.\\" And it's shot in 73 so don't expect it to look like the Matrix even if the HD does look better. It's still a very cool show and worth the $15 I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreal...........","review":"This hd dvd is just incredable.I remember seeing this as a midnight showing at the local mall theater and thought it was great.Then I got it on hi-fi vhs and thought it wasnt gonna get any better than that.I was wrong.This hd dvd will blow you away.I know the format is going away but if you already have the player just go ahead and buy it.You cant beat the price! The audio sounds just f-ing great and the video looks like it was shot yeasterday.Unreal......and with all the extra concert footage it is a must have for any Led Zeppelin fan or any music fan in general.Buy this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The song rocks your socks off in 5.1 digital!","review":"Listen to this with a good surround sound system! Night and day compared to the old version. Worth the $20 bucks and then some!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emabarassing remains the same unfortunately","review":"Here's the format i would have shelled out money for: The whole concert footage, sans fantasy sequences, disc one; the fantasy sequences alone on side two just for period piece/comedy value. I can't believe the band even wants people to have to sit through this stuff any more. Even The Clash's terrible \\"Rude Boy\\" movie had an option on the DVD menu whereby you could just watch the great live scenes. Maybe they'll trot the fantasy-less version out next Christmas...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"I'm embarrassed that I enjoyed this when it was first released. This is painful to watch. The sight of Robert Plant twirling his finger up by his head is indelibly etched in my brain and has turned me from a Zep fanatic to Zep detractor. Only redeeming quality of the video is Bonham's playing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Led Zeppelin - Some of the best blues-rock. Video - Boring.","review":"For some, just the shot at seeing the band play must be a thrill. I loved L.Z. album I, most of II and IV, some from V, and a few cuts from the other albums. (I have the Complete Studio Recordings set. I want to get the BBC set!) I still consider some of their song renditions the best in blues-rock.A fan of the songs, I never followed the band. I never followed any band. Didn't point my finger to the sky to say #1. (I considered them the best rock band that I knew of at the time, ages 12-18, but it was the MUSIC.)I didn't like the live sound on their album (heard at about age 17) or on the video (seen at 37). Frankly, I found the video boring. So, my * vote is for the video, not for the music, and not for the band.Now if only someone had spotted some of the music on the albums to the video....(C) 1999. Rights shared with Amazon.com (for 1999 anyway)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Zeppelin what are your thoughts on the matter?","review":"Are you people insane? This is horrible, the music is good yes but the footage is bad and it's hard to watch unless you're high. The fantasy scenes are just boring and you're thinking okay that's nice now get back to the concert footage. Zeppelin fans shouldn't waste time with this, instead you should check out their other concert dvd because it's way better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midnight at the Movies","review":"I must have seen this movie 20 times at the local theatre. Friday and Saturday nights at midnight they'd play Rock n Roll movies. I have never been able to stay awake through the whole movie. I thought at the time it was because we were staying up past midnight to watch it and we were just to tired to make it to the end. So when I picked up the DVD and brought it home after not seeing it for so many years I thought \\"I'm finally gonna be able to see this movie from start to finish\\". I still fell asleep. This movie has not aged well. I LOVE ZEP. But this movie reminds me too much of Spinal Tap. The dream sequences.........Why are the there? The band looks very bored. They also seem to take this whole 'rock star' persona way to seriously. Spinal Tap was a spoof. This was not and looks like one. Long live Zep...........but you don't need this DVD in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Led Zeppelin: The Song Remains the Same","review":"This movie really does a good job of showing yopu what a Led Zeppelin concert is like without being there, and is an excellent example of how talented they were as a live band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective needed - it's Zeppelin 1973...","review":"It's Zeppelin in concert - good or bad. A sign of the times - 1973. You can have fun with this show if you relax a bit and throw some perspective at it. Many Zeppelin bootlegs reveal mediocre performances - so i don't think we're talking about 'the one awful show' out of thousands.The 2 disc DVD 'Led Zeppelin' set is better if you are looking for stomping-era Zep in full blitz from all angles, but this 1976 film is a time capsule and should be enjoyed as one of the few remaining documents of Zeppelin in concert. The fantasy sequences only add to the surreal 70's allure. Fire up a fatty and enjoy colorful bullet decapitations and John Bonham burnouts.However, I am frowning on the preponderance of compilations and re-releases that Page insists on chucking out. Buy the original albums, this DVD, and the 2 disc DVD set and you won't need redundant compilations aimed at Wal-mart distribution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential purchase for any Zeppelin fan","review":"For the longest time if you were a Zeppelin fan this was your only chance to catch a glimpse of them live, and even then you had to wait to see it at a midnight movie.OK, I'm showing my age and I know I'm being a little nostalgic. Sure, the fantasy sequences are a little cheesy and even then, we noticed that sometimes Jimmy's hand's weren't syncing up quite right with the music but it didn't matter, this was Zeppelin live! Anyway, they've remastered the soundtrack, the picture looks a lot better and the second disc of extra footage makes it essential. If you're a fan, you either have it already or you need this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Song Remains the Same, Led Zeppelin","review":"There was no band that ruled the rock world as Zep did in my opinion. One has to remember this was made in 1976 not 1999. I was lucky enough to see them live on july 23rd 1977 at the Oakland Colisieum. I was 18 years old. I had been to hundreds of Rock concerts Befor Zep and hundreds arter but none came close to the awesome atmosphere and presense of Zep live! Yes this video was raw but maybe thats how they wanted it? I have it on VHS and am buying it on DVD. So Buy it and enjoy it for what its worth, not for what some MENTALY DEFICIENT PERSON named Dave from Columbus Ohio Thinks! Thanks Jimmy, this captures Rock history and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Zep performance-True to Form","review":"The band that paved the way.....Produced during one of the many peaks of the Zeppelin era. Filmed at Madison Square Garden, this concert covers the many facets of the Zep movement including selected songs from Zep I to Zep IV (Zoso). This footage is also visual artistry of the music found on \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" CD/Tape. The movie is filmed around \\"visions\\" of the band members labled as \\"fantasy sequences\\" set to a selected song(s) from each band member. In contrast to the time this was filmed, this footage is somewhat raw, yet it helps convey the concert experience of those fortunate enough to be a part of the Live Zeppelin experience. Early in the concert, the sound is rough and un-mastered, but when they hit the 2nd and 3rd song, the sound is fantastic. You will see the most incredible guitar and drum solo's ever filmed. This is a essential must for any Classic Rock Fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray Version Does Indeed Improve A/V Quality","review":"I've owned \\"TSRTS\\" in virtually every possible format: VHS, DVD, cassette, vinyl and CD. As each newer technology has become available, I've always enjoyed the improvements to the audio and video quality.The Blu-ray version continues that trend, especially in regards to the video quality. It's huge jump from the very murky VHS version that I first had in the 1980s, and it polishes the improvements of the DVD I had in the '90s/'00s.If you are familiar with the earlier releases of \\"TSRTS,\\" the bonus footage of the tracks that were not previously included is a very enjoyable bonus, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"really a downer. depressing. bad blues.

It's like saying how the weather for the next month just sucks...or your next car doesn't ride as good as your current one does. Again, if you've got questions or concerns, post to the forum; that's what it's there for. Leave reviews to real reviews of the product and not crying about how you hope the quality is better than the other versions.Just a thought..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zeppelin at their worst","review":"I've been a fan since I saw them in concert in 1970. Their first four albums are classics. When this film first came out, I couldn't wait to see it in the theaters. I've only seen it once, and I thought the concert performances were HORRIBLE! So bad, in fact, I couldn't listen to LZ for a decade! Every time I heard their music, images of these god-awful performances filled my mind. I finally re-kindled my love for their music, and I never want to see this film again. If you really want the definitive dvd of this band, buy the 2 disc compilation \\"Led Zeppelin.\\" It is STUNNING from beginning to end, and shows the band in all their glory. Why they ever released these poor performances, when they had the great performances shown in \\"Led Zeppelin,\\" mystifies me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to ruin the vision for all time.","review":"Have they separated the \\"dream sequences\\" from the middle of the songs?If they did, this will become one of the greatest concert films ever.If not, toss it in the trash can as some of the most embarrassing, boring statements ever.#1 kick A$$ band of all times.Having seen Zeppelin in the 70's more then a few times.Also going to see this when it first came out and watching people walk out in groups.Let you all know the original generation of fans were not pleased.Don't let the retrospective pushers make you believe this was the real deal.Even during the \\"midnight\\" showings in the theaters. Most went outside to have a beer, or smoke a joint.Or stay inside and sleep.After all it is Led Zeppelin, and it's true their worst was still better then most everybody else's best.Get the Zeppelin DVD if you want something close to the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie [stinks]","review":"Do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this movie.

I guess after all,THE SONG DOESN'T REMAIN THE SAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the curious only.","review":"The sound is poor as it prologic and very centre channel,the video is hacked up and out of synch with the energy on stage, the off stage sequences are rediculous and unnecessary But it is Led Zep and therefore good to watch Page at work. Bonham is an animal, I think Keith Moon would have gotten out of breath trying to keep up on the skins. I think the camera work spent too much time on Plant below the belt and we would have all been served better above the waist."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON from Michigan","review":"If you're still looking for this soundtrack contact Tower Records in anaheim on BEACH BOULEVARD. They have EVERYTHING in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but Flawed movie with poor packaging","review":"Let me start off by saying the 2 Stars I've given to this are not for the movie content, but rather the very poor packaging for what is supposed to be deluxe LTD Edition. Similar packages by the Dylan, The Doors, U2 and others all have top quality content in both music & packaging with hard case boxes, this set on the other hand is made of the most flimsy box they could find & is basically not what you'd expect from Zep who supposedly pride themselves on quality. So the Verdict is save money & buy the standard edition which I award 4 stars, the Ltd Edition packaging on the other hand gets 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing film;something never tried before!!!!","review":"I'm really a lucky man.Luckier enough to have this kind of work in my collection of cds, and now DVDs.This is an astonishing performance of one of the best rock'n roll bands ever.The performance of Jimmy Page is here,something i've never saw beforeand reveals all of the charismatic portrait this band ever had,specially among the brazilian youngers of my generation.The presence of Led Zeppelin music was a constant in my entire life.And what music!!!!!This is a fantastic gift to all of the new fans of good intense sensuous,amazing music.The performance of the band at \\"Dazed and Confused\\"is stelar!\\"Stairway to Heaven\\"perhaps the most beautiful music ever recorded.Finally,all of this musicis a journey since the light begining,until the catharsis at that triumphant final!!A gem of the modern music.Something to get always at a special place of any great musical cds/DVDs collection!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Inferior Audio of the 70's","review":"I did not care for this DVD although I am a great fan of the group. The audio [is so bad] that I took it off and traded back in. It is not possible for me to be so nostalgic that I can listen to simply anything.If you love Led Zep -- no holds barred -- go ahead. If you want decent audio from your HTS, don't! It'll remind you of buying those egregious ATCO vinyl pressings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song remains the same 2 disc special edition","review":"Save your money! It is cleaner looking and sounding.That is about as much good as I can say about it! Why didn't Jimmy Page just put some more footage together and include a show from MSG and call it Led Zeppelin DVD II? All this rubbish about copyrights and such. Just don't call it \\"song remains the same\\" and get rid of those tired fantasy sequences and let us see the band performing.I am a little disappointed in Jimmy this time and I am not alone.I am one of their biggest fans for over 32yrs. We waited a long time for new footage.I think we deserved more! Perhaps,one day,we wil get the shows uncut and void of \\"fantasy\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Led Zeppelin rocks, this DVD does not","review":"During the 70's Led Zeppelin were the kings of rock, not only that, but they put on a good show. Now I'm a huge Zeppelin fan, so when I give it 2 stars, you know it sucks. When I purchased this DVD I frankly expected more. I (being a guitarist) expected to see Jimmy Page in all his glory thrashing out riffs for everybody. Instead, i get Jimmy playing at his sloppiest. Robert Plant keeps saying \\"push, push\\" during every song which is, quite frankly, disturbing. John Paul Jones and John Bonham sound great, but stand behind Robert and Jimmy like statues (which I guess is okay). Robert, Jimmy, John, and JPJ all look tired and worn out. To put it, they look lazy. Add to this the annoying \\"dream sequences\\" and there you have it. I expected a Zeppelin concert, not a freaky LSD trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page mistakes + bad editing = Mess","review":"OK,OK I admit it..I am a typical American male in my 30's and went to see this 942 times at midnight showings in the 70's.But nostalgia aside,the band just weren't on this(these)nights.

Robert Plant seemed to be singing to and for himself. Stairway To Heaven was OK but even that lacked any semblence of energy. I give the one star for the amusement my teenaged son got from seeing Jimmy Page play guitar with a bow. Even that got boring as it droned on and on.This DVD starts off with a 20's-style mob hit that I never figured out what it had to do with the rest of it. Maybe you gotta be stoned to enjoy this one; I wasn't, and I didn't.I truly do enjoy their music. But this one was truly a stinker all the way around. The sound was terrible. No matter how we tried, we couldn't get it adjusted right. If you can find this one for a buck at a garage sale, that'd be okay...maybe. I'm afraid this one'll sit on our video shelf for a long, long time before it ever sees the inside of the DVD player again."},{"rating":"1","title":"thought there would be more","review":"i thought i was getting the DVD I've seen on VH1 Classis as \\"The Song Remains The Same Reissiue''with new footageof Zeppelin doing different gigs than Madison Square Garden but it's just the same movie thatthey put out in 1975 and bashed it saying they didn't even see it before it was released but I learned later they lied (a Led Zeppelin tradition like ripping off other musicians and calling it their own) at least song writers have zep to thank for more strict copywrite laws"},{"rating":"2","title":"Led Zeppelin Rocks!!!","review":"I had seen this a long time ago on TV, but as others was not impressed.....This version is much better.

In fact, the 73 tour may well have been their worst. If you're a fan, of course you have to own this, but if you're a REAL DIE-HARD FANATIC, then send some blank tapes to someone in a newsgroup and get yourself a copy of a performance from the early days or the L.A. shows of '77.

I wish the Beatles' company Apple would offer more dvd releases like this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks, Jimmy","review":"This is it! The one true video representation of Zeppelin, save for the VH1 \\"Legends\\" special, which is painfully brief.

Thanks, Jimmy for your selfishness."},{"rating":"2","title":"The correct review","review":"I purchased this at a different location than from Amazon and found it to be in better condition than the first review provided. His claim that the case is cheap is not entirely true. The T-shirt did need to be placed with it, but the rest of it has containers for both the DVD/CD and for all the bonus material. You can seperate them and keep them together if done properly. Just Bill must have torn the whole thing apart if he had to put the DVD/CD in a sleeve to protect them. It has cases for everything which is inside a box (container) Worth the purchase if you want to see the extra footage/music that is inside of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film","review":"An unintentionally funny film this. John Paul Jones' scenes are particularly hilarious. If you notice Bonham's scenes are very macho and not at all \\"fantasy\\" sequences like Plant and Page. The tracks are for some reason very quiet (compared to the Madison Square Garden songs on How The West Was Won DVD) and on some Plant sounds quite croaky. If you've watched it a lot you'll find the entire movie is strangely put together (the editing for instance).Since I've Been Loving You and an emotional Rain Song are the highlights for me at least. It just lacks the power that Led Zep had on stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song Remains The Same","review":"I was pretty impressed when I saw this when it first came out [in a theatre]. While its flaws are more obvious now, it is worth having for any Zep fan. The fantasy sequences are a bit silly at times, Planty's ego is too and some of the performances are a bit dodgy against Zeppelin's best work. But it is worth it just for the 25 minute 'Dazed And Confused', a magic moment in rock history, rambling but not a note out of place. Here and in some other parts, it is a joy to watch the band,Page especially, at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent remaster","review":"although i had hoped to see the complete show as it happened, due to some legal mumbo jumbo they couldn't mess with the film release. that said, the remaster job is excellent! i don't know why people are complaining? this is still an awesome set, and lets face it, how much visual material of Zeppelin is out there...(more in the vaults i hope, for a possible release down the road)...i love this package, and the remastered cd set as well!!! 5 star all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Zep- Most miised the Point","review":"I can't believe people are complaining of poor editing, choppy this whatever....This is classic Zep here and in order to enjoy this DVD you must SPARK UP YOUR BONG before the show starts then all is well...."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a Box, a unique special edition gift to your life","review":"You buy, a lot of old pics, tickets, memorabilia, a offer for a poster, mini--posters, a wonderful t-shirt, and the box..

Being a true beleiver Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham put on an exciting and riveting show with the pure drum power of \\"Moby Dick\\" and the \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Whole lotta love\\" mix. This video is for the Zeppelin purist"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Song Will Never Change...","review":"Despite the poor directing and editing, this film truly documents Led Zeppelin in their prime. A wide range of vocals from Robert Plant, extensive organ playing from John Paul Jones, the heart pounding beat of John Bonham's drums, and dazzling guitar work from Jimmy Page is what one will find in this film. A must for any Led Zeppelin fan or someone wanting to relive past concert memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I use to be a big fan back in the day, and I recall enjoying this video a lot. Many years later, I am not quite so enthralled as I once was. Most of Page's solos are pretty sloppy IMHO, and Plant is off quite a bit as well. Some decent performances (Moby Dick is probably the best), but most are mediocore. As for the dream sequences, a bit goofy, but not that bad. Some interesting footage worked in as well. Worth a look if your a fan, but I would prefer to see a better performance from these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for zeppelin enthusiasts","review":"While this may not be my favorite of their available dvd performances (that goes to their 2007 reunion show), this is a must have for any serious zeppelin fan. I felt the movie was a little bit way over the top, but that was part of the whole bands concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the fantasy sequences??? FYI","review":"Alot of people complain about the cheesy fantasy sequences in the \\"Song Remains the Same.\\" There is a reason for that. I just finished reading the book \\"Night and Shade\\" a book of interviews with Jimmy Page and others. In the book, Mr. Page goes into detail about the making of the film. Apparently they fired the first director of the movie. There was much footage lost during the making of the film. The finished product had a lot of gaps in it. So, the band decided to fill in the gaps with those fantasy sequences which were done years later. Another interesting tidbit: They had to redo some of the songs on a sound stage. Jimmy Page said he had a little difficulty synching up to his own stuff. I think only a guitarist would notice that some of the songs aren't quite sync'd up. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in the theaters. After that, I would dream about being a rock star like Jimmy Page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concert video","review":"If you don't know Led Zeppelin, this is a wonderful introduction. If you're already a fan, this video has an amazing soundtrack featuring all of their best songs. Provides insight with behind-the-scenes and interviews about the rise of one of Rock history's greatest bands. I would watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"much more than a live performance","review":"when I bought this, I thought I was only getting a live performance of one of my favorites band, which was a good enough reason for getting it. To my surprise, this is more than just a live performance of a very good band; it's a documentary/movie type treatment which makes this a very good catch in my opinion. Sound and video quality are much better than expected, considering it was originally recorded on 1976 (if I'm not mistaken).I am glad I got this disk, as I like the band and this is something I will cherish for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extras make it","review":"My husband actually owned this on VHS already, but loved the extras not included on the tape he had from years ago. Great for someone who loves Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"2","title":"great concert","review":"Watching this was easy like going down memory lane. I wish that it would have just been the concert without all the other stuff going on but still a great dvd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu ray","review":"I just received this on blu ray and thought I'd write a brief description about it.There were no audio problems, either in Dolby 5.1 or dts hd, throughout the movie. However, I noticed that the extra songs (misty mountain hop, over the hills and far away, etc) sounded flat and tinny. On the led zeppelin DVD (2003), these performances had not only better sound but better visual effects and editing.The picture, however, looks great; hard to believe this was filmed almost 40 years ago.There are a few extras, 3 or 4 songs that were previously left out, as well as an interview. Standard blu ray case.The movie itself is pretty enjoyable, if you like led zeppelin; the movie is half concert footage and half... well... movie. I won't go into this since I'm sure others have written about the movie itself in great detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not work!","review":"The dvd did not play in any of our devices (dvd players [non blue ray] and laptops). It kept coming up with the error message that read \\"cannot read disc\\". Had to return it and hope to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great MOvie","review":"So why the two stares? Because this version of the movie supposedly came with previously unreleased material. Which is just not true! Perhaps the two disc version has this supposed material. But this DVD certainly did not. As a Zeppelin maniac, I have seen this movie hundreds of times. And this movie, while in blu ray, doesn't have a single moment which the regular DVD doesn't have. Now that Celebration Day has been released... I would have Zeppelin Fans consider that option instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"the song remain the same","review":"i love, love, love, it.the first time i seen it i was in NYC. It was awsome then, it is awsome now. Color, clarity and sound are great. I highly recommend it for any Led Zepplin fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this all-of-a-sudden not available from Amazon?","review":"I'm a big Zep fan and I really enjoyed the re-mixed 2 CD set of The Song Remains the Same, which just came out. This DVD is a new release too....but why isn't it available directly from Amazon? They ran out?? It just came out, and it is a major release (I thought...). They must want everybody to go for the Blu-Ray or Hi-Def versions. But what if you don't have the type of player? What happened to the regular DVD??? Someone straighten me out here...."},{"rating":"1","title":"a MIXED review","review":"I agree that both the audio and visual aspects of this film must be reviewed. I regret getting the album first. Page and Plant, who are geniuses in the studio, are showboats onstage. If you ask me, they may look cool during masterpieces like \\"No Quarter\\" and \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", but they sound either half-dead, or stoned to me. There stage presence, however, as well as many more songs and visuals, make the movie superior to the album, by far. All and all, however, the fantasy scenes, and occasional camera tricks are way, way, way too outdated to do any justice to the feeling Led Zepplin's music gives me. Time limits simply don't apply to them. this is my review of the film, and being a fan of the band, i can still stomach the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Indeed!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I agree with the poster that said that \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" was terrible. I saw them live in the 70's as well @ the LA Forum more times than I can count. This video is god awful and I hated it and still hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unleded Zeppelin","review":"Led Zeppelin is my favorite band, however, this movie was horrible. Plot needs major work and the sound quality was not the best (my vinyl LP's are almost better). I would say just buy the soundtrack on CD and you will enjoy it better. Don't buy this DVD just because it is Led Zeppelin, like I did. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get \\"Spinal Tap\\" instead, much funnier","review":"This is a bloated, self-indulgent, boring mess. When this film came out, I remember thinking that if thisis the great Led Zeppelin, then they are quite overrated. Some of the songs are way too long, the videosequences are almost laughable and Plant is either having a bad night or is already struggling to be thePlant of a few years earlier. Get the excellent double DVD \\"Led Zeppelin\\" instead - way, way better.It not only shows the band at various points in their fairly brief history but does indeed demonstatewhat a terrific group they actually were. In its wake, \\"Song\\" is now useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hutch's Led Zep movie review","review":"The Song Remains The Same is Led Zep at their early (1973) in concert best. For those of us that were lucky enough to see the band in concert, this is as close as we can get to revisiting that magicial time! For everyone this lets us see why Led Zep was one of the few greatest bands of all time!! The music and the performance here proves that!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Song Is Only the Same if You Can Get It!","review":"I have been waiting at this writing for almost THREE MONTHS to receive this set, ordered on December 1! How can it be in such short supply? Amazon should be embarassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same exact movie","review":"The movie is exactly the same as the old version with no extras! The sound is 100% better especially the drums. The extra songs are on the 2nd disc. The songs are just as poorly edited as before in fact Whole lotta love is worse. The CD is not the same CD as before either. It matches the versions on the DVD but No Quarter is missing part of the guitar solo. On the movie and CD Black Dog is still edited yet on on the DVD that was released 4 years ago the verion of Black Dog was Complete. During the menu parts of the DVD there are cool parts of Whole lotta love middle scetions that should be on the CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Picture Quality, Bad Sound","review":"If you already own the DVD of this concert do not bother to buy this BLU RAY disc, the sound do not improve a bit. The sound on the regular DVD is the same, the picture quality arguably is a bit better. This is far from true HD Sound...NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT the 2 disc special","review":"The concert is here along with the movie, which is good news. However, this is NOT the 2 disc special released on standard dvd version. Example: \\" Since I've Been Loving You\\" is a performance from the second sold out Madison Square Garden concert. I'm not complaining, as I still own 2 disc version. The color, sound and dvd quality is great on blue ray. I would definitely recommend it but wanted all Led Zeppelin fans to know, this disc is somewhat different from the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great workout!","review":"I am so glad to have Gilad's workouts in my collection! This workout combines a variety of excercises (mostly cardio) from several of his videos. Gilad's fun and motivating nature really made me feel excited to keep going. By the end of the workout, I feel exhilerated! For a great overall cardio and toning workout, Gilad is a must-have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cardio to sculpting.","review":"This is a great DVD. I use this dvd 3 times a week and Gilad's 45/45 dvd two times a week. I have never enjoyed a dvd so much. Gilad really knows how to work you out and it be enjoyable at the same time. Makes you fell like you can't wait to work out.Give it an A+++++++++++++++++++"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Best of Bodies In Motion","review":"The workout parts of the video are good, but the breaks in between when Gilad is flying from one island to another are annoying and break the continuous movements of the workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not great","review":"I love Gilad, but this DVD had to much of everything but excersise. Did not want to keep stopping and watch him fly his plane to locations and talk. I was really upset that the excersise was not continuous and I had to stop and wait throughout the CD. I ordered another one that I recieved today from Gilad from the Earlier years, these are the Best."},{"rating":"2","title":"tried and true","review":"Just like i remember, Gilad never disappoints with his tough but fun workouts. Its great for someone who wants to start working or again after taking time off. He's fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want an effective workout?","review":"Think the video segments from shows are well edited in terms of workout progression interspersed with humorously worded/placed segments of narration throughout.Definitely feel like I got an outstanding workout and who would know about working out better than a decathlon winner?Been doing similar exercises for years, that Gilad explained in a manner that made them more effective than ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly 80's","review":"I ordered two copies of this video, one for myself and one for a gift. After viewing my copy, I promptly asked Amazon if I could return both of them. Unlike the great 30-minute workouts Gilad has on television, this video was made back in the 80's and is a string of workouts lasting 70 minutes long. There is no use of free weights, and the exercises are all dated -- lots of old aerobic steps. I am going to replace these with up-to-date Gilad workout videos. Don't bother with this one, even for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Gilad","review":"Thank you for your great service, in sending out the DVD, \\"Gilad Best of Bodies In Motion.\\" It is exactly what I expected. It got here promptly and safely. The DVD works fine. I wasn't sure what content was on it, nevertheless I appreciated the workouts. I love your selection of all that you offer. Thanks Amazon! You are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tape","review":"I started working out to Gilad in the late '80s and I was happy to find his tape at Amazon. It's definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor continuity, cheesy music, and overall poor workout","review":"This is one of the worst workout videos I have every owned. The warmup, stretching section of the tape is insufficient to begin with. Secondly, the workout is not one continuous workout as Gilad cuts between different workouts at different locations. These interludes, with Gilad in a private airplane talking about the next segment, interrupts the flow of your workout (you don't keep your heart-rate up). The music is inconsistent -- ranging from live Hawaiian drumplayers to cheesy synth music. Overall, the focus of this workout is more toning and than aerobics."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this video!","review":"I love love love Gilad's workout videos - indeed, I've been doing them for the last 20 years. This video is my FAVORITE!! Buy it and buy it right away - you won't be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"Gilad is without a doubt a good instructore. Unfortunatley, he and his producers do not know how to put together a good best of tape. In and of themselves, the different workouts are wonderfull. However, Gilad flying back and forth to the different islands and the cut and breaks inbetween each segmant is quite anoying not to mention distracting. It wouldn't be so bad if he had cut down on the number of cuts by keeping each segmant grouped into one continues cut instead of breaking each section by flying around (i.e. keep all the ab workouts together)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's cool and effective !","review":"I am a russian woman , I came to visit my daughter here, in US. And I loved it !! It's so easy, effective and it's so much fun ! Personnaly I enjoy looking at Gilad - he looks terrific ! I have a huge request to you, Gilad - please go to the Russian market - a lot of russian women and men are waiting for you ! And one more thing : you are one of the most great impressions I have got during my visit ! Thank you for it !!! p.s. and one more thing - you are really a Real Man, and I wouldn't be wondered if you have some russian blood..:-) ! Sincerely, Valentina"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This dvd is awful. Gilad is in an airplane and every few minutes, the workout stops and goes to a different island. It is jumpy, you can never get a good workout because they are constantly returning to the cockpit of the airplane and he tells you what island you are going to. I don't care what island I am going to, I am looking for a good workout. This is just a ridiculous way of splicing a workout together. All the cardio is walking and jogging in place. Chances are, I will not order another one of his workouts if it is like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I was hoping this product would be the latest work from Gilad. When I put it into the DVD player I realised it was not. This is some of his older stuff (late 80's 90's) and not the workouts you find on FitTv at the moment. It does have some comical value though. The scene on the moving ship is very funny.Shame is wasn't the latest stuff as that is much better than what's on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio version is horribly cut","review":"The small print: Abridged. The CD is not worth it!

It is easily a \\"10\\" in either category. But the book, (which was rejected by publishers for years before it became a runaway sensation) is in actuality a kind of hodge-podge of inventive mind games; all of which revolve either around actual trout fishing, or people named things like \\"Trout Fishing in America Shorty.\\" Not a real novel in the traditional sense, it is more a collection of short stories based on a theme. Some of these are hilarious, thought provoking, or steeped in emotional remembrance, (The \\"Kool Aid Addict\\" probably being my personal favorite). But far too much of the book is simply inventive rambling, which ceases to be interesting after awhile.

The book is good in size so fits well into a day-pack. Very good and relevant information with detailed maps of many treks that you can take, solid advice on medical aid, hotels, things that you allowed to do and things that should not be done.

It's about people who feel \\"real,\\" with the typical problems and joys that goes with that.It's very possible the author was imitating, to some small extent, the Nancy Drew stories, which started nearly 20 years earlier. If so, she not only matched Nancy Drew's attractions, but exceeded them.I first read these books when I was around 10 to 12, and I found them a welcome escape from my troubles at the time.

If your like me and you enjoy variety in an exercise than this is not for you. Gilad repeats the same things over and over again changing the routine about a few times during the entire workout. It had me wondering when is it gonna finish? And the ab workout wasn't all that great either. You know I should actually have given this 1 star. Because I bought and did it once and don't plan to do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy for beginners","review":"I really enjoy this video and plan on buying another one for a new change. After working out with Gilad I really feel good about myself and feel I have acomplished something for the day. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilad is the BEST","review":"I alternate between this tape and the Step and Tone Workout. Gilads instructions prevent injury and give results.I have purchased several step workout tapes but none compare. For Christmas I gave my husband the Abs Workout and Interval Training for Men by Gilad and he is still thanking me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok","review":"Gilad is very good with teaching the warm up and the cool down.However I think this tape is best for beginners. I am used to doing Step 2 ( intermediate level ) at the gym and I get bored b/c of the repititious movements. Just a FYI for folks at Level 2 or higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun on the Beach","review":"I really like this video. Gilead really keeps you cued up. I also like the format of this video. It is broken down into four segments. Each segment leads up to the final segment which entails all of the moves he showed you previously into one big step aerobic routine. It is fun to do. Plus you get a great workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"I wouldn't bother with this one - I think it was just an excuse to stand in front of a beach and look good. Although the initial choreography was fine, it wasn't well taught and by the end it was just a joke. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This is by far my favorite workout video! Good warm up - great 40 minute cardio and good abs and cool down. The cardio is broken up into three sections. Gilad teaches each section throroughly and then combines them all. You can really get a GREAT workout with this tape. Gilad is easy to understand. He tells you what the next move is going to be before the actual move. The scenery is gorgeous. The music is so/so - doesn't really movitate you - just background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow,Great Workout","review":"This video is very easy to follow and slowly builds to a high energy workout. Gilad makes it easy to go at your own pace and gradually work up to the highest level. The tropical music and beach location makes it fun to do. I do this tape 3 times a week and each time is just as much fun as the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"Gilad has a decent enough step work out, but his inane comments and the relentless polka music on Waikiki Beach is aggravating. If you want a serious step workout, try something by Gin Miller or Keli Roberts instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Step Workout!!","review":"I'm hooked on step aerobics but some of the latest tapes on the market are way to complicated for me. I'm not into the dancie twirl run around your step backwards kind of person-the least amount of memorizing I need to do the better of a workout I get. I wanted a steady intense workout with safe traditional moves - Gilad's step tape does just that.What a great workout! Very intense straight forward and challenging workout. His instructions were right on cue.Although you only get 6 mins of ab workout at the end of the video the isolated moves he teaches are effective.I like his style of teaching so much that I just ordered the Step & Tone and the Sculpt & Tone tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too intense!","review":"I am not that coordinated, so I tend to shy away from step routines, but after reading other reviews that good instruction is given, I gave it a try. It's true, Gilad gives you plenty of advance notice as to what move he is going to do next, and there are not a lot of tricky moves. Another reviewer did mention repetitiveness, which I appreciated. It is repetitive in that the same standard step moves are used in a cycle. I didn't feel like I was working that hard, yet I did work up a good sweat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burn up those extra pounds!","review":"I have purchased many workout videos but this one is my favorite. If you want to lose weight this tape is definitely going to help you. I started exercising with it like a month ago and even though I have not been on any diets, I have lost 10 pounds and my body looks incredibly different. You'll have a lot of fun by following this step workout video."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the never before and the step regulars","review":"I love this video! When I first started it took me about 2 workouts to get comfortable, and now I just go to work. What I love about it the most is that you start working out from the begining. Try it, I guarantee you will enjoy this work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese New Year For Kids","review":"I am always looking for books and activities about Chinese New Year for my daughters' teachers. This book has made that task much easier. The historical explanation of Chinese New Year is simple and straight forward. The ideas for parties both at school and at home are great! The directions for craft projects, snacks, and games are clearly described. The illustrations are playful and colorful. This is a wonderful book for parents and teachers who need help with ideas to celebrate Chinese New Year."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap xerox on newsprint","review":"Do not buy this book.

I think this is unfortunate, because the book gets lost in a sea of diet books. As a diet book, this isn't the best, but this is much more than just a diet book. There is some overlap in information, but Dr. Ullis puts much more emphasis on exercise with even a section of illustrated strength training exercises. Atkins and other low carb diets are about keeping insulin levels down to burn fat. Ullis talks about that, but also about balancing all your hormones for improved health, longer life, and to reverse the affects of aging. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into the technical details as much as I would like (which accounts for the deduction of one star), but there are definitely some good things to learn about this book. Ullis emphasizes not only what to eat and how to exercise, but also timing. So, I think this is a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miles of Smiles","review":"This CD makes me smile...I can close my eyes and ride its waves as if I were in the very rooms where these songs took flight.This is a collection of songs sprinkled throughout with some of the best voices (not just vocals) of our recent folk past.

But this DVD-release is unbelieveably badly made: bad sound-quality, bad picture-quality and above all so many cut scenes (!) like the one where Eve meets Alain for the first time or Bruno's grandmother died.

Pages 316 and 315 are not in good order and page 221 is not well printed, a part of the text is not readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to understand","review":"I do not find the book suitable for an introductory course in linear algebra. It takes too much time to get through a page in this book due to the use of heavy mathematical language. The examples are not enough to help a student solve the exercices at the end of the book, so often times one has to always rely on the TA office hours to get a homework done. I do not recommend buying this text for a beginner in linear algebra, unless if it's required text for a course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solution Manual incomplete.","review":"The book itself is difficult to read. When new symbols are first used, the explination are burried in the text and time consuming to find. The use of dark blue ink to \\"color\\" the items they are refering to is very difficult to distiguish from the normal black text. I waste more time trying to figure out what the symbols mean than I spend understanding the concepts.The solutions manual covers every 3rd problem, not the compleete set of odd problems like it should (eg. 1,4,7,10...). Detail on the problems is average at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated and hard to understand","review":"While it may be good for advanced math people, this book is definitely no good for the students who haven't learned linear algebra before. The texts are really hard to follow and most examples are written 50% in math symbols. Understanding concepts is quite impossible, at least for those who haven't studied linear before. I really dont understand why most schools still use this book as a text. This is my honest review as a student who took this class and as a representative of many other students who had the similar opinions about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This book is very hard to understand, especially for students who are introduced to real conceptual mathematics for the first time, which is in this course. Not enough examples at all, written in a difficult manner to grasp for students. Professors may find it OK, but thats only because they have taken the material before, and probably taught it many times. Very bad choice for an Intro to Linear Algebra Course!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Linear Algebra","review":"Having passed all previous math courses (up to multivariable calculus) with compete understanding and great grades, I have earned the right to determine how unskilled this book truly is. Every other math book I have experienced is understandable and has examples for all types of problems. This book has few examples, and they are horribly explained. Then, to make it all worse, these examples are not the same types of questions as the chapter questions! This is quite honestly the worst textbook experience I have ever had. I would rate this book with no stars, but amazon will not take that as a rating, so one will have to suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linear Algebra","review":"Having completed much of my Engineering curriculum (spending much time with my face in a math based text over the last few years) I have to say that this is the most useless textbook I have had to date. From a students perspective It is very difficult to read and the examples are limmited. Althought this book may be technically correct in every aspect it is not a good learning aid! Most of my fellow students have found other resources to copensate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperback has VERY POOR quality binding...","review":"I am normally able to keep my books in near perfect condition so that I can resell them as \\"Very Good\\" condition or better after the semester ends, but the quality of the paperback binding is HORRIBLE and this book isn't holding up well at all.I've talked to 6 other students who have the paperback edition in my class and they are all having problems with their textbooks. Covers are falling off, chunks of pages are falling out, and the binding is separating at page 68 and at page 263 on my book. I purchased this *NEW* from Amazon in 01/2011 (20 weeks ago). What an insult! I would recommend the hardcover edition, but the instructor has that edition and chunks of pages are falling out of his hardcover edition too.Basing the 1 of 5 stars solely on how horrible the physical quality of the book is! The Linear Algebra content seemed fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Brutal","review":"I've recently had the misfortune of having this book as my text for an introductory linear algebra book. The subject can be hard enough to understand on its own, but this book makes it even worse. The examples are sparse at best, and most of the time are wasted by displaying the proof of a cryptic concept instead of actually assisting to answer the questions in the book. Even worse, when the book does provide a practical example, it often only shows the steps used to complete the problem, not even bothering to explain it! If you are stuck with this book as a course text, I would highly recommend finding a second, more useful book if you wish to get more than a passing grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American debut of Air Supply","review":"British-born Graham Russell and Australian-born Russell Hitchcock first met in 1975 while acting in the play JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR. These songs were first released in 1979 in the United Kingdom and Australia,respectively. The title track was the duo's(they had session musicians joining them) debut single in America in February 1980. Subsequent hits were EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD,CHANCES and ALL OUT OF LOVE. There's also the country-flavored OLD HABITS DIE HARD and the disco-flavored JUST ANOTHER WOMAN. GR and RH are the so-called Kings of Love Songs so they won't need to put out an album entitled \\"Love Songs\\". The duo put out a handful of albums on the Arista label following this one throughout the 1980's. The duo's labelmates include Barry Manilow,Melissa Manchester,Ray Parker Jr. & Raydio,Dionne Warwick,Jermaine Jackson,Whitney Houston,The Kinks and later,Hall & Oates."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lost it to the Supply","review":"The year was 1988, I was just a freshman.

It's terrible! I thought abstract algebra was hard to follow but this book makes abstract algebra seem like a cakewalk. The material is interesting but often confusing. Proofs are not in depth and the examples BARELY help. Definitions seem to contradict each other because of the way things are worded so similarly. This book is TOO formal which makes conceptualizing theorems impossible. Often times, notations are used without explanation. If you are a beginner, avoid this book at all cost. If you're an expert, then you might like it.The reason I am giving this a one star is because it is no \\"introduction\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The quality of this version of the book was awful.","review":"My problem is with the quality, not the contents. Through the first chapter, I actually quite liked the author's delivery of the material.I've looked at a version at a library, and at my local textbook store, and those versions were definitely quality made. However, when I found the same book on Amazon for about $40 to $50 less, I thought it would be a great buy. On the contrary, this version was made much more cheaply (hence the lower cost, I'm sure). The material for the pages isn't as nice, and the binding was so bad, that within the first week it had completely ripped of in front, merely from opening it.The book is great, if you get the quality version.

If you are one of the chosen few, you are better off buying a different logic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Book","review":"Enderton's writing is the best I've seen in any introductory math textbook; he is lucid, well organised, comfortably paced but free of expository flab. The exercises (judging from chapters 2 and 3) are not terribly difficult, but quite useful in building one's intuition and connecting logic to other mathematics. I had the book for my Logic class as a first-semester sophomore with very little experience with proofs and no abstract algebra, and found it quite accessible. I guess the book starts off with an advantage, being about a subject as interesting as logic, but that does not seriously detract from its merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly commonsense, cliff note version of a real Mgmt. book","review":"This book covers the right topics but does not give you much if any information. Might be good as a high school business starter book. I think more effort went into the layout of clip art and photos than the content of the book. Each topic is covered in a page or two, consisting mostly of a paragraph or two of text woven around much artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"A concise introduction to supervisory skills and techniques","review":"This book is exactly what the back cover claims it is -- \\"an introduction . . . for readers with no time to waste.\\" I agree with other reviewers that it provides more visual sophistication than in-depth content. My major complaint with the artwork and format is that large blocks of black text appear on dark blue, dark green, and purple backgrounds -- a real challenge to the eyes. Yet the book is well-organized, and the range of topics touched upon is more comprehensive than any product I have seen in this price range. I buy it in quantity and give it to participants in my \\"Leadership for New Supervisors and Managers\\" seminar.

This bottle makes a sound while he is sucking that sounds like air being suck in. It sounds like he is swallowing air as he sucks. The positive thing is that it is a inexpensive bottle. It also did not leak at all. It was easy to clean. The only problem is the air I hear. I placed the bottle down after a feeding and I hear the air being sucked in.

I think I agree with Christopher Hitchens that a lot of it is cynical and tacky, but you get both sides in this book and there's no doubt that Diana did make a difference on one or two occasions and she had a talent for meeting and greeting the needy. The Angola story is very touching. In terms of her marriage, I found all the insider quotes from the royal officials very revealing. You begin to understand just what had gone on and why the whole thing was doomed from the start - competely different expectations of what a royal wife was for. So, all in all, not only far, far better than anticipated, but actually thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diana book that's really worth reading","review":"What I particularly like about this book is that it destroys the whole 'Diana was mad' thesis (which you'll find, for instance, in Sally Bedell Smith's book - which I found silly and over the top.) This one explains, in detail that I found amazing, just how the whole mental health smear started. There's plenty of evidence here that Diana was perfectly sane and happy before she married into 'that family.' And - unlike many Diana books I've looked at - this does try not to take sides. Diana herself comes in for a lot of criticism, especially in the last few years of her life. But overall you do get a real sense of the pressures she was under and the quite magical things she did sometimes, right up to the end of her life. The landmine section is very touching. I'd recommend this book, in fact, to anyone interested in finding out about the real Diana rather than the 'spun' Diana."},{"rating":"2","title":"All parties treated fairly","review":"\\"Diana: Story of a Princess\\" is an excellent book about Princess Diana etc. that seems fair to all parties. This book chronicles the lives of Charles and Diana, their meeting, courtship, marriage, separation, divorce, lives after divorce and Diana's tragic death.This book is very interesting. It offers viewpoints from many different individuals on various aspects of Diane and Charles' story. I have read several books about Princess Di - all of them fascinating - though this book (\\"Diana: Story of a Princess\\") really gets into the aspect of the press and their role in Diana's life.Through this book I was able to envision a very vulnerable Diana. I also saw a person who loved much and needed much love. Princess Di was a very sensitive woman and I believe this quality made her the 'Queen of Hearts' and 'The People's Princess.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and fun!","review":"I have wanted to read this book ever since I saw the movie, \\"House of the Long Shadows\\" (which is based on the book). Surprisingly the book is nothing like the movie (or should that be the other way 'round?) It is a charming tale that keeps you guessing, and is an intriguing, historical look at how people spoke and acted in the early 1900s.If you haven't seen the movie, it is worth a look. It stars four actors from the early horror genre: Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Vincent Price, and John Carradine. It also stars Desi Arnaz, Jr. It's a funny, creepy-old-house movie with some knuckle-biting scenes. It is set in Wales, so the name of the manor house is changed from \\"Baldpate\\" to \\"Bllyddrpaetwr\\" or some such spelling!I really enjoyed reading this book - just be prepared to overlook all the typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with PD release","review":"The only good thing about this is the biographical audio.

This book was a major disappointment to me. The first story didn't even mention Christmas until literally the last few pages. A majority of the story took place in the summer/early fall! The second story was much better, but by that point I was kind tired of waiting for the anthology to get good. So I moved on to something else. I don't think I will give it another try. There was just nothing in the story or plot to \\"grab\\" me or make me interested in what would happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little instruction","review":"This book was a required textbook for my begining Maya class, but be warned, it's more a book about concepts and 3D animation history than it is about instruction.

For people wanting to just unearth the mere basics and lingo, the glossary at the end of each chapter might be useful. Besides that, the book lacks any real depth to the topics discussed, and is rather disappointing when these terms are freely available online. The \\"Getting Ready\\" tips for each section was laughable, written with the assumption that readers lack common sense. Furthermore, the unorganized structure of the book meant the referenced picture in the text is in MOST cases a few pages away.

There's no need to. Nothing here really turns me on beyond the appeal most of these singles had in the first place. Depeche Mode's music could potentially inspire the best remix music ever. Instead, this album feels like going through the motions. And DM must really be hurting for inspiration for them to turn to Linkin Park for help. Yuck!Additional note: it would be nice if some of these reviewers would read other opinions instead of just spewing their own. My review is right on par with a lot of the other ones, but I suspect they didn't bother to review mine. Ya get what ya give, baby! On the other hand, maybe they resent my opinion about Linkin Log, in which case they have awful taste in music anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depeche Mode Remixes 1","review":"This is a one disc set of a slimmed down version of the three-disc remix set which is available for a lot more money.It is difficult to remix Depeche Mode when they have such great songs to begin with. So I find it hard to add anything new to the originals to make them seem better.Some of the beats are okay and some remixes work better than others. The list price is way too much for what you get.Overall though, you'd be much better starting with the individual albums themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the originals instead","review":"The members of Depeche Mode know what they're doing. Most, if not all, of their songs are perfectly produced and it's difficult to improve on them (that means you, Marilyn Manson.) There are some really good remixes on the 3 CDs. These are the mixes that don't put in stuff just because they can - they're clean and simple but add another level to the song (the Air remix to \\"Home\\" and \\"World in My Eyes (Mode To Joy)\\" are the two best.) Most of the mixes, however, are just the same remixes that I wouldn't even listen to in a club - they're overworked and tired. Skip the remixes and get the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remix album","review":"This album takes many great DP hits to the techno club.

This is a book of artwork presenting different points of view of an illustration. The book starts with drawings of how to make a paper airplane.

Turn the page to see the air outside of the apartment building filled with paper airplanes which a little boy has thrown out of the window. I really enjoyed looking at that idea of \\"the other side\\". It got strange from there as disconnected scenarios trying to be connected are presented. I couldn't quite figure it all out from front to back; back to front; and middle to outside even with the help of friends. I concluded that it was just different illustrations.

We get to meet some new characters in this coming-of-age story, and delve deeper into the mystery of the mechanical people. Crystal Clare is missing from this trip, replaced by a snobbish mech named Metal Mina. There is the usual mix of beautiful scenery, science fiction action, and philosophical musing of the meaning of existance. This is not as good as its predessor, but is still highly reccomended.

All aboard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Step Away From this Movie","review":"I was greatly disappointed by this movie. It waste the talent of it's brightest stars such as Gabrielle Union and Morris Chestnut. The plot of this movie started great when the character Quincy played by Jamie Foxx is dumped by his girlfriend on the night he plans to announce their engagement. But from there The plot turns into a convulted mess. Gabrielle Union was the save of this movie. Which is sad really! She is such a amazing actress but Hollywood has yet to utilized her potential. Morris Chestnut plays Quincy cousin a player Who uses women for own selfish reasons. But here again an actor who was funny and wonderful in such movies as the Brothers and Two Can Play at This Game.

This light bit of fluff is easily ignored as a movie with one great exception: here is a veritable feast of African American talent such as Foxx, the very beautiful Gabrielle Union and Bianca Lawson, Morris Chestnut whose talents are minimally utilized. The cast is rounded out by Jennifer Esposito and Peter MacNicol (remember him as Stingo in 'Sophie's Choice'?). The story is slight but at least it doesn't dumb down the audience. Viewing this film makes us pleased that Jamie Foxx has left the comedy mike and is committing to films that deserve his superb talents.

Well written, but to no effect. No redeeming quality about 90% of the characters, and 100% of the major characters.

The feud between the families is really one-sided as the main family keeps getting duped and manipulated by the other - over and over and over again for generations. There are a few laughs and some tiny victories but they are too few and far between. There is a bit of pay-off/resolution finally at the end, but I'm not sure it was worth all the tedium. I feel that the author communicates the characters' emotion well. However, the writing style can be difficult to follow. Sometimes within the same paragraph the setting and focal character changes with no transition. It will jump like this often. The book's voice is in the present, but he speaks almost in 1st person while following the chronology of 4 generations. I enjoyed the bits of cinema history, but again, not really worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book at all","review":"I did not like the style of the writing.

It just doesn't hold much water as a racing title. The handling is very loosey-goosey, which is fine in a way because it's an arcade racer, but this goes too far. Mario Kart DS is a much better choice and there really isn't a good racer besides that out for the system right now. Like Guilty Gear in fighting for the DS (at the time of this review), Mario Kart is a much better choice though of course the whole feel and montage of the two games are a bit different. But Ridge Racer DS feels a bit watered-down and not quite worth the money, especially if someone payed full price for the title. Undoubtedly fun and tempting to buy because of the Ridge Racer brand, but other than that this is probably one to avoid in favor of Mario Kart or just another title or investment altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather be playing Ridge Racer R4","review":"I had high hopes for this game, and had fun for the first 6 races.

That sounds terrible, but in reality, although they left out a lot of details, the actual action moves too slowly in the novel. Still there are several important details left out or changed. Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is not quite edgy and evil enough - but then that character gave me the most visceral response I have ever had to a character in a novel.The direction is swift and the acting great. My real problem is with Nicholas Hooper's music. It does not go anywhere. There are only one or two decent themes, and the rest is accompaniment in the most noodlie fashion. I recommend the movie highly, but I hope John Williams returns for the last movie.

I know a movie can never capture all of the details and character development of a book, but it still needs to stay true to the essence of the book we all have come to love. This movie depicted Dumbledore as a very grumpy, almost mean, old man who displayed none of Dumbledores lovable qualities. The movie destroyed the relationship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. It depicted Ron and Hermione as stiff cardboard figures that stood behind Harry and looked concerned. I could go on and on with things that disturbed me about this movie.

I would recommend, for a younger child, obtaining a guide from one of the many websites out there, so that they can take full advantage of the game. I paid $7 for a guide from lunapages and it was well worth it. My only frustration has been that EA provides very little support for the Mac version on their website.

They took the ending of this book, which the entire book leads up to and which is hugely critical to the story, and they compressed it into a few minutes.

This DVD seems really thrown together in a hurry.The one good special feature is a review of all the Potter stories so far, to bring you up to date ifyou have forgotten some bits.The additional scenes are all laughable; it was a wise editor who cut them out.If you can play them, opt instead for the HDDVD or BLuRay HD version, if you just want prisitine video to watch.

There are a couple of things they could have added to the movie to make it flow a little better, but I know time is a consideration. I have read the books, so it is hard sometimes to not wish some details were added to the movie to keep it in line with the books. The actors played the characters brilliantly and you can't come away from it without having strong feelings about the characters. I like the two-disc special edition for the extras and details that you just don't get with the regular DVD.

Only criticism with the movie would be it could have been longer without a negative effect to develop areas of the story that were rushed over in relation with the book. The DVD quality is the WORST I've seen in modern transfers, in fact, it's worse than any classic film transfers I can think of. Completely distracting and soured the experience. Warner Bros. should be embarrased and offer a recall, seriously it is terrible. This was viewed on a 55\\" Sony WEGA which all HD and other standard defintion DVD look great on. Stay away from the standard dvd until they've fixed it, or go with Blu-Ray or HD DVD if you've got that option.Edit: Contacted Warner Brothers and they are sending a replacement DVD, they did not indicate any knowledge of a defective batch of copies however. Will update this review if the quality is different/better than the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie:good/Extras not","review":"The quality of the movie is fine, etc., but the extras are a waste of time and money. There are a few deleted/extended scenes: we loved Emma Thompson's bit at the table, but the rest were as usual. \\"The Magic of Editing\\" held possibilities, but little real information. The activity didn't work too well and became tiresome after a bit. \\"A Day with Tonks\\" was, again, lacking in any real insight or information and, although you saw Natalie Tena made up as Tonks, you never see her film anything and at the end she says,\\"Well, I've had a long day ...\\". The silliest segment was \\"Harry's True Destiny\\", having Harry Potter \\"experts\\" make predictions about the character's future, when the final book came out within a week of the fifth move, so that by the time this DVD was put together, everyone already knew the ending! Why include what is bacically an advertisement? So, save your money and just get the DVD of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Full -Screen Edition)","review":"I purchased this some time ago for my daughter because she likes the Harry Potter series.

It was past the time for the 30 day refund, so I emailed Amazon anyway and told them what happened. I did not expect anything to come of it, but Amazon contacted me and refunded my money!

Seen all the deleted scenes on youtube and there's a tour of the studio with tonks you get to see Neville and Dean play a game badly outside the studio I thought that was cute... But the tour was kinda boring. They also talk about what may happen in the 7th film and what's happend in the 5 films so far (i know all that already).

This is one of the shortest of all the Potter movies. It isn't because of a lack of materials but because the director was trying to keep it short and sweet. It works, but if you have read the books you will miss some of those scenes. But hey this is a movie and you can't do everything that is in a book. Blu-ray really makes the digital aspects of this film look amazing, especially if you have a 1080P capable TV. If you are into special features then you will enjoy those that are included with these dvds. A must have for all Harry Potterphiles."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am afraid to watch the last two brought to film after this one","review":"First off i adore the books. I've watched all the harry potter films because as bad as they are, i want to see what they did to it and i wasnt disappointed. This movie has so much fodder people were tripping over it in the theater aisles. Knowing that this was the longest book in the series some things were bound to be omitted. But the screenwriters keep making the same mistake. They cut out parts of the book that lead one to the other. This movie was extremely short but it doesnt feel like it. I kept looking at my watch and being surpriseed 2 hours hadnt passed. I'm a diehard of the books so i'm not going to be pleased completely but that doesnt mean i can't find it watchable. I enjoyed the 3rd movie immensely but it just gets worse when the books get darker and darker. Heres hoping they dont ruin the final 2 movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I was really dissapointed when I saw this movie. I felt that there was too much cut out from the book, and many of the scenes felt rushed or unfinished.I was very upset when I learned that Nevil and Kreacher were denied their fairly major rolls that they had in the book, which contribute to future books and plot points.If you have not read the book, and know nothing about the book, you may have a hard time following the movie. It really cannot stand on its own at all. Action wise, it's pretty good, and some scenes were very well done, but over all I found it to be lacking. I've never felt like walking out of a movie until I saw this one. I'm not even going to bother seeing the 6th movie when it comes out. It will be even worse because of things that were cut out of this one.If you've read the book, save your money and don't get the movie. You'll just want to cry because of what was lost and the pointless scenes that were added."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short review for a great movie!","review":"Ok, everyone before me has written all the details about the film so I'll get right to it. In summary, this is the best Harry Potter film to date...at least for adults. The pacing, plot, and special effects are all true to the book and make for a very enjoyable ride. I hope the next two films can keep up with this quality!Yes, the film follows the book very closely picking out the highlights. However, this means it is darker than the previous films and really is aimed at older Potter Fans. You may not want to let young children see this until they are older or nightmares may be in their future."},{"rating":"2","title":"best HP movie","review":"Of all the HP movies this one is the best.

It felt mediocre and really dumb and I hope people get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"some weird accents","review":"What I find most annoying about the Potter movies is the weird accents of some of the actors. I especially find Emma Watson's English bizarre. She doesn't really speak words; she makes chippy sounds and you are supposed to divine the word connected to the sound. I find as a result only about 15% of what she says intelligible. On the other hand Maggie Smith is completely clear as is Michael Gambon and many of the others. Radcliffe is quite okay, I'd say 85-90% of what he says is clear. Watson is the worst. For her one needs subtitles to know precisely what she is saying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one yet","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix far surpasses the other movies in the series. While it does not include as much action as some of the other movies, most of it being at the end, the story followed more with the book than any of the other movies, making it a longer movie, but worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing scenes on DVD","review":"I won't get into the debate of how well this compares to the book, as many others have done an excellent job of that already.My review is merely to point out that some small scenes that were shown in the theatrical version didn't make it to the DVD. For example, after Umbridge & co. blasts into the Room of Requirement, Draco hauls Cho in with him, which allows the audience to understand how they finally came upon the D.A., and the subsequent shunning of Cho by the other D.A. members. On the DVD, however, this is left out, and it's not until Snape mentions that he used veritaserum on Cho that the audience finally understands what happened.That's not the only scene that was cut, and I don't understand why they were cut, as they would only total a couple of extra minutes at most.Perhaps I have a defective DVD, but I doubt it. Did anyone else notice this??"},{"rating":"1","title":"What does Ultimate actually mean?","review":"I have received an official response from the WB store and have verified that this is not \\"the extended edition.\\" I knew that there were no extended cuts in existence for 3&4, so I bought those anticipating that to change for at least OotP. I do find it frustrating that the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" of a film who's director has repeatedly stated that WB made him cut nearly an hour of footage, does not receive the same treatment as the first and second installments of the \\"Ultimate\\" collection.I do love the packaging, and the extras are kind of cool, but the real reason I started investing in this set was for the extended versions.Thanks for a big tease, WB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry's growing up!","review":"I think a lot of reviews missed the point of this chapter of the Potter Saga. Harry and the rest of the students are growing up. Harry's glum bitter mood is appropriate for his age and the constant stress of his life. Readers of the books will be aware of this. The instalments grow up with the cast. If J.K. Rowling and/or the films producers would have kept the \\"Disneyesque\\" tone of the earlier books it would have become derivitive and boring. The cutting of many of the sub plots was needed otherwise we would have been watching a 3 hour plus film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!!","review":"I never jumped on the Harry Potter bandwagon when it first came out. I just recently watched all the movies. All I can say is....wow! They are phenomenal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have been two movies","review":"Good movie. I was glad to get it. But turning the longest Harry Potter book into the shortest Harry Potter movie was a mistake. The \\"plot telescoping\\" that took place in the earlier movies was carried to extremes in this one.

In the mean time, I'll be returning what appears to be an extremely poorly compressed DVD to the store for a replacement. I don't expect any difference in quality, but the stores need to know. Even my home video DVD's look better than this. Maybe I should see if I can find HP OOTP on VHS. It certainly would look better than the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"For the real HP fans, that was the whole purpose of getting the ultimate editions; to see the the movies in their ultimate and complete form. It simply indicates a lack of understand on the part of WB regarding their real audience. Collector cards and fancy boxes might be great for the kids, but most of us bought the ultimate edition for the full movie. One more thought from a fan. Up until HP and the Deathly Hallows P1, the earlier movies have remained pretty true (if not complete) to their books. Not so with HP and the Deathly Hallows P1. (Harry not disguised at the wedding; Harry and Herminoe not not under the clock when they entered Godrick's Hallow, the real reason the Lovegood's home was destroyed, etc.) Although a good movie, I hope they do a better job with part 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"USPS and Amazon - a deadly combination of incompetence","review":"The movie is fine. Service was poor. First the post office decided it could not deliver the package...the address was not correct (???). I then canceled the order. But Amazon sent a movie anyway. ***Sigh***"},{"rating":"1","title":"Combo Format Prone to Failures - Beware","review":"I will now be looking forward to receiving yet another replacement for this disc - I'll be on my third copy. Apparently the process of creating combo discs that work in HD-DVD drives and regular DVD drives is flawed, and involves basically gluing two discs together. The first disc played until 1:50 into the film, then tiled horribly then froze completely. The second made it only to 1:05 before doing the same. Both were reproducible errors. They have done a horrible job in terms of quality of manufacturing..the movie was great, if I could actually watch it all...avoid this until they can make these well.EDIT: This is apparently very widespread, and is now a thread on engadgetHD - this combo disc is poorly made, and many users are finding that it won't play without freezing. This is true not only on the Xbox 360 add-on, but also found to be true on my A3 model. It's not the hardware - it's this disc being poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incomplete story","review":"I am sorry, but the story line is'nt complete.

Much is left out of the book. Perhaps should have been broken in two. Some actions are never explained.Second disc great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Harry Potter Film Yet!","review":"Although the 3D IMAX version cannot be beat (I saw it twice), the DVD is excellent too. I consider the DVD an indispensable addition to my Harry Potter collection. Of course, some material from the book was thoughtfully deleted. If you want a movie to include every detail from the book, an 8-hour long movie such as the uncut version of Greed will probably be more to your liking. I was not over impressed with the extra material in the Two Disk Special Edition. In my opinion, the deleted clips demonstrated that the editor knew what he or she was doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and Order of Phoenix-2disc","review":"This was a disappointing movie and least enjoyable in series so far. If I had not read the books, would probably not have a clue as to what was going on. However, this book is the darkest and probably the hardest to translate to the screen as there is so much information past and present that needs to be sorted out and can't imagine how this 5th book in the series could be done well. Wish the last two were completed now, as this movie closes with such darkness and can't wait to see how the rest of the story is played out! Nevertheless, all the actors, actually the entire cast has done a wonderful job. People unfamiliar with the books may not see all the subtle twists and darkening atmosphere....a friend thought it was very violent and disturbing and failed to see beyond the action because so much had to be left out of the script that was in the original novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Amazon Service","review":"I'm a Harry fan so the product was as expected. But, the service was the treat. I placed an advance order and had the DVD in my mail on the release date. I didn't even have to wait an extra day to get it. Great Service. I love advance ordering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as previous","review":"We just watched the newest Harry Potter movie, \\"Order of the Phoenix\\". Quite frankly, I was disappointed.I had read at about the time the movie originally came out that it was directed by a different individual than the previous HP movies and that it tended to be \\"darker\\". I found it to be not only darker and bleaker but they had also taken the fun out of this one. I actually was anxious for the thing to end. Too bad. I've always liked the HP movies but if any further ones are directed by this guy, I think I'll take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible film","review":"I've watched all the Harry Potter movies and have read none of the books. The movies have all been most enjoyable and worthwhile. This one was not. It made no sense at all, was positively filled with miserable acting by the cast with a miserable script. It was illogical, and unable to get the viewer to suspend belief and buy into the world that Rowling has created. One minute the antagonist Umbridge and her henchmen have Harry and his compatriots are her mercy, the next she is alone following them into a forest and kidnapped by Centaurs. A totally bewildering, and unbelievable script, that is not helped by miserable acting.Oh, and this DVD has NO special features, only the movie. Buy this turd second hand in the penny bucket, or better yet, just rent it. Jeez, it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the WORST Harry Potter movie","review":"The movie was incredibly cut-up and lacked plot/character development. The graphics were superb, but at great cost to the film. I was incredibly disappointed at the aweful portrayal of the fifth book and will not likely watch it more than one more time. Had I not read the book, I would have not understood a single thing that was going on because the movie was just all over the place. The significance of most of the characters was not exemplified and the only thing anyone could have gotten out of it was Voldemort was evil and tricked Harry into getting a glowing sphere. There were many things missing in which the movie could benefitted more by following the book. The only part which I thought was extremely captivating was when all of Dumbledore's Army was punished with the special quill. The look on the Weasly twin's face (I think it was Fred) really captured the moment of agony and disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mo Potter","review":"I wasn't exactly feeling this movie. I only liked \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" out of all the Harry Potter films. At this point, it's like sensory overload, and overdone. It's just the same ol stuff, and the actors look like they're done, and they should be. I love the way it was filmed, but if your not a big fan of Harry potter in general, the movies are pretty dull and boring. It borders on pretentiousness, and the guy playing Harry potter needs to get over himself, you ain't all that honey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated solely on DVD quality ....","review":"This is a sinister ploy used by WB to push consumers to buy either Blu or HD DVD. The DVD encoding for this movie is terrible during the opening of the movie and ending of the movie.DVD's never looked this bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poison pen","review":"A lethal combination of bad screenwriting and hack direction. The nuances introduced in Potter movies 3 and 4 by Cuaron and Newell are jettisoned. Cuaron's sly take on book 3, his ability to suggest the pending sexual awakening of the three main characters, and the sexual ambivalence in some of the other characters, all wrapped in sinuous action, rescued the movies from the clueless Chris Columbus. Newell built on this, and brought the young actors to carefully shaded and detailed performances, performances that linger in the mind well after the FX have faded. Phoenix removes virtually every trace of character development, every trace of humor, and the spirit of fun that bubbled in the first four films is crushed in a wall of stony compositions and unfeeling visual effects. Emotionally cold and depressing, and even more depressing to find out that Yates is being brought back for the sixth film. Heaven forbid they give him the final two films. Bring back Cuaron and Newell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"In the opinion of this confirmed fan of the HP series, \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" is by far the worst of an otherwise excellent series of movie adaptations to the HP books. In my opinion this movie is a rip off of HP fans that cashes in on our faithful enjoyment of this series and gives us a pathetic shadow of the story in return. As a author of fantasy fiction, I would be outraged by this movie's treatment of my novel if I was J.K. Rowling. The review by Gregory Bravo is 'spot on.' Nuff said. J.P. Kelly"},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you expect from a movie?","review":"Whether or not you like this movie depends on what you want from a movie.If you want a movie to tell a clear story - as the books do, and as the first Harry Potter movie did so well - then you will be very disappointed. Indeed, if you watch this movie without having read the book, you will probably not follow exactly what is happening. If this matters to you, I suggest you skip this movie altogether.On the other hand, if you like a movie to be full of spectacular special effects and don't care much about what the story is - or whether there is one - then you will love this movie. Buy it right away, if you haven't already.This explains why some reviewers think it's the best HP movie and others think it's the worst. It all depends on what you want. Obviously I prefer a movie to tell a tale, so for me, this movie gets the lowest possible rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost makes me wish I'd downloaded it","review":"The movie looks awful in DVD format, and it's done on purpose. As the movie studios scuffle over which HD bandwagon to get on this year, Warner figures they'll help their HD hardware brethren by releasing newER DVD titles purposely watered down. The consumer is stupid and they'll never notice such subtleties, right? Hell, the compression is so bad I can actually count the pixels in Daniel Radcliffe's face (hmm...1, 2, 3...3?).And to think I'm watching this on a 1080p set with an upscaling player.

It's hard to review a movie that isn't aesthetically pleasing.If you bought this movie, be sure to call and complain to WB."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Easily the worst film in the series to date. The story is disjointed, likely the result of attempting to cram the longest Potter book into the shortest film so far. The effects aren't very good and are a considerable step down from Goblet.As for the DVD itself, generally you will see a smattering of special features on a primary disc with additional details added to a second disc. Not the case here. There is absolutely nothing on the primary disc but the film itself. This would be acceptable if the technical quality of the film was outstanding. It's not. Far from it. Watching on a 58 in. 1080i plasma with an upconvert player, there are significant pixelation issues, easily the worst I've seen on any film.Overall, a severe disappointment. Not looking forward at all to what Yates (Director) does with Half-Blood Prince."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great pick","review":"I,too,have mixed feelings about the film.It certainly has left out or completely changed certain aspects of the novel.Unlike earlier films, this one strays from the plot line of the novel in several key ways. Since I have read the series from cover to cover a number of times, I was able to fill in the gaps. However, the friends who saw it with me were not able to do that because they did not know the characters/sequence of events in great detail. I will buy the DVD simply because I own the rest of the series and want to add it to the collection.

However I did NOT LIKE THE DVD.The second disc is RIDICULOUS. It has four features, and editing process which is engaging for a few minutes, and then a documentary about Harry's fate that I did enjoy even though I'd seen it many times before the premiere of the 7th book. Then there was \\"Tailing Tonks\\"It was AWFUL! I can only say it was rushed and ridiculous overview where she was turned away in minutes by ever department. You could tell David Yates and the Harry Potter Production did NOT want to spend time on this DVD. There were no engaging behind the scene views, it was discouraging!

Whenever there's any question of what to watch, this one always wins out. The characters are really becoming 'themselves'. As mid-adolescents, they are on that cusp of being capable of fighting You-Know-Who, but are still just short of the skill and judgement of the adults. Being left out, plus teenage angst, propel the characters to new heights - stronger friendships and understanding - while learning new and more powerful magic for the conflict they know is coming. At the end, Daniel Radcliff does such an amazing and powerful performance - enough to rival any seasoned actor. I believe that this is the exact point where he moves from being a 'kid actor' to an actor capable of any role.

I have never, ever had a DVD with so many digital artifacts throughout the entire movie.I am not referring to bad CGI during an action sequence, I am referring to inexcusably bad DVD encoding. Even with mild background movement, the details and colors become blocky, muddied, and unnatural.I do have an HDTV and a progressive scan DVD player, so with a normal setup the differences may not be noticeable, but I firmly believe the quality of this DVD encoding was intentionally reduced to enhance the benefit of owning the HD version of this movie available on Blu-ray.I work for a company that provides Digital TV over DSL using MPEG 4 compression, and if we lower the encoding quality, the results look the same as how this whole movie looks, \\"just barely\\" good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Easy to order without having to wait in long, long lines at a brick and mortar store at Christmas time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the whole series","review":"I am a fan of all the Harry Potter books and movies.

Way too violent for young children, and way to juvenile for an adult. Just a pile of brittish crap dumped on us like most from across the pond. I do not understand the lore of a poorly written movie, with poor acting and directing, loaded with mistakes. All of the subsequent films have basically the same story line. Just an over-hyped boring film...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the book.","review":"I do not like this film. It omitted too much story from the novel. In my opinion, books 4-7 would have made better tv miniseries films, then a lot more of the story could be captured. Best part of the film is the acting. Ignore this film and stick with the first two films and the seven books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely different from book.","review":"Not only was the acting poor in most of the scenes, but half of the scenes were either completely inaccurate. They changed the sequence of events, they changed who was responsible for things, and they left about half of the book out of the movie. Things that should have taken a half hour to explain were done in 30 seconds, playing moving and giving a sideshow of what had happened. I would have walked out halfway through this movie if i had driven there. If you at all enjoyed the book, don't see this movie, it will ruin your perception of the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faithful to the Book, Unfortunately","review":"When I read the book I said \\"Well, it was fun while it lasted.\\" With \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" you can point exactly to where the fun stopped and the franchise died. 800 pages of Harry scowling and barking at everyone was no day at the beach and, unfortunately, the movie is true to its literary source. And no, I will not purchase this movie nor any others that follow; as far as I'm concerned the series ended with The Goblet of Fire. It's a shame J. K. Rowling couldn't have just continued to have as much fun with the last three books as she did with the first four; you can have drama without making the narrative so unrelentingly dark and dreary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure the movie will be delightful.....when I get it.","review":"But I will be waiting at least another 5 days. :(This review is for AMAZON'S Lame-oh shipping delay.Why bother pre-ordering from Amazon if it doesn't get shipped until 3 days or so after I could have bought it at W*lm*rt?Amazon gets a thumb down on this one. I guess I figure that, if people pre-order, then the inventory should match up and we shouldn't find ourselves gritting our teeth that we didn't just get a copy when we stopped at the W*lmart. Or the Kr*ger.

With this effect your sitting at the edge of your seat the entire time. Every unexpected move makes you jump. You look at the characters faces and you know they are unhappy and this is going to be more like a thriller than an action/adventure although it is that too.The only thing that I don't like is Rupert Grint. He's not that great of an actor. In this movie all he seems to do is stand in the background and look sulky. Ron isn't supposed to be that way. Oh well! I suppose I would be unhappy if they changed him!All in all, this is the best movie!! Watch it, love it, and watch it some more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Same Old","review":"The Harry Potter series doesn't get any better. It also doesn't get any worse. It's the same thing you've come to expect from the series, although I think the fourth installment was terrible for many reasons (poor pacing, melodrama, little character consistency, etc). At this point, if you've been enjoying the series, this must be added to your collection. If not, you won't start liking Harry at this point.The special features are fun for kids. Of course they have games, and CD-Rom extras, but if you're a behind-the-scenes-person, like me, then it's underwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is the good but the DVD transfer is terrible","review":"I thought this was a good movie.

The special effects are as good or better than the previous films, the story line is well worth it (even if you haven't read the book) and, in general, is entertainment at it's best. I mean, after all, isn't that what movies are supposed to be all about? Entertainment? The moral lessons added to the entertainment gives everyone a good reason to see the film.

My advise is to read the book first and if you still want to waste your time go ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Good","review":"This was a great movie! However, Goblet of Fire still holds first place for my favorite HP movie. This one had great action, thrills, and Bellatrix Lestrange is the best villian in the HP series! The final battle was great, and a little sad. Dumbledore and Voldemort were awesome, and there was a few good jokes here and there. In other words, a worthy addition to the Harry Potter movie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible movie","review":"i tried to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. there were too many scenes that where cut, as usual too many added on scenes that were never in the book, the elf kreacher didn't have the snout nose he was supposed to have, etc. lines that were supposed to be said at a certain time were either said to early or in front of a large group of people. cho wasn't the one who betrayed dumbledore's army, her friend was. veritaserum was only attempted to be used on harry, not everyone in the school. dumbledore never faltered before the ministry or dolores umbridge, yet he does in the movie. i read on J.K. Rowling's website that some of the things they had done in the movies had surprised her, and i think she was being nice. a lot of what was done in the movies was an insult to the books. i hope these movies are remade in the future the right way by directors and screenwriters who know what they are doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOO-RRRING","review":"I love the Harry Potter series, but this movie was just like the book -- BORING to the point of being ridiculous. Save your money and hope the next movie is better, it certainly can't get any worse than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books getting better, movies getting worse","review":"Ok, first of all, I have read all the books but do not consider them literary classics. Rowling leaves a lot to the imagination, and when you write a screenplay adapation it gives you much more freedom to cherry-pick the best ideas of the novel. Alfonso Cuaron did a MARVELOUS job of this in Prisoner of Azkaban, which I feel is the best-made HP movie by a WIDE margin in terms of direction, cinematography, and being as true to the novel as possible. This movie, as others have so graciously pointed out, is extremely flawed in so many ways I pray that books 6 and 7 will have more competent screenwriters and they should pay Cuaron whatever it takes to direct the last book. That being said, the performances are the best since all the returning actors have perfected their roles to a T and Imelda should get an Academy Award nomination for her bit as Umbridge. I hope the final two get better treatment than this one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineptitude in Insight","review":"This is in my opinion the worst of the Potter films so far. It was a huge mistake to have brought in a new director for this project. The whole feel and flow of the film is awkward; familiar and loved characters are reintroduced perfunctorally without any magic and warmth; and the editing feels disjointed and rushed. There is no cohesiveness to the whole story. When abridging and translating a book to a film, care must be shown to the surviving source material. Let's hope this director aquits himself well if indeed he will be helming Potter 6. Still, 4 great films out of 5 is a good track record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix","review":"I really like both the book & the movieI think the movie sticks very close to the actual words written in book 5I enjoy the movies very much but as with the books (I love them & have read them all) as the movies progress they do get more scary so I would advise kids under 13 watch this & all other Harry Potter movies with parental supervision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"As with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, they have chosen to leave out parts which I wonder how they will justify in book 7's movie.

I liked some more than others but it keeps up. It presents some death and that adds to the plot thickness, not all can be safe always or it gets boring, and it adds conflict with the school heads by replacing them with some individuals you wish would get squished in the film. Everyone likes the head of the school, the old wizard, but this one even gives him trouble and more questions for Harry Potter to answer plus some things he learns to know he did not in prior movies, it all adds up in the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter movies losing their magic","review":"Compared to the other Harry Potter movies, this one was a disappointment.

I was shocked the first two scenes were cut (Harry with Aunt and Harry's good by to cousin shaking hands). They totally changed what happened at the beginning, omitting some of the most human reflections in the whole movie. Can you imagine watching the famous movie \\"Gone with the Wind\\" today with the final cuts they would make? Yeah, the story is the movie and the action was only to reflect the times the characters were living through.

Like a 90 second sample of a scene that should have been ten minutes. Why was the longest book the shortest movies when the most common complaint of HP fans is missing or deleted scenes? If you didnt read the book you wont know whats going on. If you read the book you'll wonder what the hell were they thinking.The acting was flat and lacking emotion. Many key parts and and characters were missing those that were new and present had one or two lines.

This is the novel where Harry and his friends truly begin to grow up. For this reason, the cut the movie producers decided upon hurt, mostly because they made many poor decisions in what to cut. Cuts are necessary, but must be done intelligently. However, the cuts are not the fatal flaw of the film. No, that's the climatic battle with the Deatheaters. Here is where we are supposed to truly glimpse the mortal danger Harry and his friends are in. Instead, we get a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Watching it, I came away with an overwhelming sense the Deatheaters were going easy on the kids, because they were kids. You never feel they are actually in any real danger. Completely kills the movie. Overall, I've liked the film adaptations. This one was botched though.

Being able to do this permitted me to expierence the excitement and thrill of Harry's adventures as well as all the other charcters in the film.

There is no real action in the film, i.e. give and take conversation between the characters. It's all moody Ludwig. It's awful, and I can't wait to get rid of it.

Which one you get really depends on how much you already know or your personal preference. Funnily his video on this topic DOES update the book and cover Sector Rotation so Murphy obviously is aware of the oversight.This book is boring with no payoff.

It is not, however, a very good reference for anyone looking for a factual history of the neopagan witch movement. It is written in line with their beliefs and dosen't give an accurate origin of either medieval witchcraft or the neopagan witchcraft, but instead gives history through their beliefs. For those looking for historical facts on the origins, written in an unbiased and scholastic manner, \\"A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerriers, Pagans, and Heritcs\\" by Jeffery B. Russel is a much more honest look, seperating the fact from rhetoric and historic from neopagan, and giving a complete history, origins and developement, of neopagan witchcraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Don't leave home without it!

Last time I checked there was a balance; the Goddess and the God, but you would never know that by reading this book. It is akin to David Koresh writing a general explanitory book about Christianity. This is most definetly NOT a book for anyone who wants a book on the religion of Wicca and to say it falls under \\"Witchcraft\\" is quite a stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like a Sociology Book","review":"I really didn't care for this book for what it was supposed to be: a look at modern Paganism. Too much of the time, I felt like I was sitting in an especially dry sociology class, learning about strange and exotic people who aren't in very close contact with reality. I felt she made Pagans look a little stranger than we really are... but maybe the Pagans I know aren't quite as \\"exotic.\\"The scope of the book is broad, and persons interested in an overview of Paganism will surely get an education.

For the most part, though, she tries to gives us \\"the big picture\\" in this book. She does an above average job explaining the differences between the traditions.

A truly in-depth look of the psychology, philosophy, and sociology of witchcraft, this book is not for light readers, but it is a great source of information concerning idealism and conflict in and around the Craft. It's a bit difficult to read it all in one sitting, but I think that's part of the point: to NOT sit down and read it all at once, but to take your time to contemplate what you've read until you fully understand it.

It is hardly all-inclusive, but well-done considering the rapid growth of Pagan beliefs in the United States.Resource lists within the book are probably the most valuable, giving the reader direct resources for finding more detailed information.Ms. Adler mixes fact and opinion within the volume, but it is easy for the reader to determine what is fact and what is opinion.I do recommend this book with the warning to buy two if you are in the habit of loaning books out.

It's a little dry, but it's well worth it to read it. It can help you get aquainted with the Crafte and many of it's noteworthy names.

Of course there is no rapping or record scratching so you can all breathe a sigh of relief as far as that goes. Reminds me of the self titled if it was a bit more angry. The production is good, varied slightly and intentionally from song to song it seems, and there is plenty of[bad] moments as well as beautiful keyboard passages and fantastic clean sung vocal harmonies.

One unique feature is that the shaft is offset from the centerline of the tool, which makes it much more stable when used on the edge of a flat surface.

Paranoid Park is one of the director's more precise films, showing he is a master manipulator of narrative through images. Without giving too much away, let me just say the film is slow and deliberate, inviting the viewer into a dark world. Van Sant bravely allows the camera to linger on scenes, seducing the viewer into the minds of his characters. There are beautiful moments of single-take skates through the park, shot with a home movie, 16 mm quality contrasted with the sterile, but majestically shot slow, day-to-day events that unfold to reveal the answers to the dark mystery at the heart of the film. It reminds me of how meticulous Kubrick shot his movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't forget to clue in the viewer","review":"The strength of the film is its attempt to genuinely portray teenage apathy, relationships, and communication, all of which admittedly are often mis-portrayed in mainstream Hollywood films. But its strengths end there in my opinion. Some of the characters' actions feel forced or exaggerated, as if the viewer is incapable of discerning something in between black and white. Ironically though, the many (I would say way too many) musical interludes are wide open for interpretation, and come across as time fillers more than insight into the story or characters. There are two parallel stories in the film. The first is the accidental death of a security guard and the second is the main character(tm)s realization that long-term relationships are based on more than physical attraction. In the end though, I felt this film came up short on both fronts. Neither story was fully developed and instead the viewer feels left out like the parent of an apathetic teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda, woulda, shoulda but wasn't.","review":"This was a complete waste of time.

I know some of the shots and \\"effects\\" were trying to be artistic but by the end I was yelling at the screen, \\"get on with it\\". So, not for everyone but not terrible either.

Ms. Long does an excellent job of developing her main characters and I felt an invested interest in their lives. Additionally, the Native American culture is woven nicely into the story.The story revolves around Jess Clinton, a fiercely independent young woman who has recently lost her parents. She moves with her younger siblings to Oklahoma to live with her Uncle Fred. Upon their arrival they discover Uncle Fred was the victim of a recent attack. This is just one of many strange recent occurences in the small town of Chickasha. The most enjoyable moments of the story happen as Jess begins to unravel the mystery of who is disrupting life as normal in Chickasha. Furthermore, it is fun to watch the relationship between Jess and Daniel develop as she begins to realize she does need the support of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good picture","review":"I did not enjoy this movie in the least.

Poor screenwriting has abrupt scene cuts and no set-up dialogue. The camera often focuses on only one actor in a scene.

He was in love with another book called \\"Mama's Milk\\" so I thought this one would be a great since it was about a child his age. Neither of us liked the book. First, it really has very little in it about nursing at all. Second, the rhyming is poor and awkward. Third, there is no story, it sounds like she just picked things that rhymed having to do with her daughter and put a rhyme on each page. I didn't relate to it as a nursing mother, my son didn't relate to it as a nursing toddler. The only part I liked was the one picture of Michele nursing as a toddler - it is sweet and accurate in depicting a great big toddler laying in mama's lap.

For instance, hearing \\"U.N.I.T.Y.\\" with the word \\"b!tch\\" edited out kind of defeats the purpose of this song. Also, including the single version of \\"Ladies First,\\" rather than the album version would be - if you're not a marketing wiz at Motown anyway - the natural choice. But no, it's the record version which does not have the sung chorus. These might seem like small things, but they really interfered with my enjoyment off the album.Queen Latifah's music is a hallmark in the hip-hop genre, but you wouldn't get that impression at all from this collection.

The sweaters are pretty, and while the printed instructions may appear to limit sizing, an experienced knitter can readily enlarge a garment by increasing needle size and yarn gauge. Most of these styles can be knitted in easily obtainable, inexpensive yarns, or if preferred, in higher end designer yarns. Either way, the end product should be stylish and attractive. If you're the type of knitter who likes to follow a pattern to the letter, I suppose you might not like this collection. But if you're comfortable trying out your own little modifications, as I am, you'll find many of these patterns enticing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pattern shapes fall far short of fashionable","review":"I bought this book because I liked the texture of the sweater on the front. I was very disappointed to find that the book is full of straight-sided sweaters. There is not a fitted sweater to be found in the entire book! Regardless of how the type of sweater portrayed is meant to fit, every sweater knits straight up the side. Any clean-cut edginess that may be added to the sweaters by the texure is ultimately ruined by the shapelessness of the sweaters themselves. I vaguely considered altering some of the sweaters to have a more modern look, but I finally decided it's not worth it so I'm returning this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow size range!","review":"Any knitting book that can't be bothered to alter patterns for a reasonable range of sizes isn't worth the paper it is printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spray the Bear barely interesting","review":"Being a fan of the tv show \\"Mad Men\\" and having spent many years in the advertising industry, naturally I thought Walter Bregman's book \\"Spray the Bear\\" would be a lot of fun.

She inherits a rather large house. She is loved by her brother Keifer (Matt Farnsworth)is a most unhealthy way. She also has the the attention of a distant cousin Ethan Poe, who uses her to release his writer's block. Unfortunately Ethan is not all there and talks to the image of Edgar (Arie Verveen). Sex, murder, and bits and pieces of Poe's stories are used in the film.Outside of the brief nudity, the quality of the writing was made for TV.

This version has several of Clausewitz's 'books' missing.I would like to add that in general, I tend to stay away from books published by Penguin Classics and prefer other publishers. For example, Oxford World's Classics 'The Gallic War' is a better, more modern translation of the first installment of Caesar's Commentaries with more maps and a better introduction that Penguin Classics 'The Conquest of Gaul.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong translation","review":"On War is an essential work but this is an abridgement first published in the late 1960s and based on a poor translation dating from around 1908. The editor, Anatol Rapoport, is a scientist, not an historian, and the commentary is something of a hatchet job.Much better to get the 1976 translation with commentary edited by Michael Howard and Peter Paret."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION OF ON WAR!!!","review":"On War is an incredible work, but the Penguin Classics edition is terrible - the translation was done by an editor who was openly hostile to Clausewitz, something to do with Kissinger (whom our editor detested) being a Clausewitz fan. There are entire sections that are specifically translated in ways that make Clausewitz look bad, and edits to the same effect.I highly suggest that you read this book - but read the Everyman's or Princeton version - those editions have the Peter Paret translation and are far superior in every way. The Everyman's edition in particular is fantastic - hardcover, elegant, and only a few dollars more than Penguin's steaming pile of excrement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard work, but worth the effort.","review":"Not really a relaxing bedtime read. On War is challenging, and not to be undertaken lightly. Still, its concepts are eminently more utile than Sun Tzu's, when all is said and done.I would have given it five stars, but for the 72 pages of nonsensical introductory ranting by Anatol Rapoport, included with this volume. If you can find a volume without Rapoport's introduction, buy that one instead and save a tree.(Honestly, I will never understand why modern publishers insist on pre-forming the reader's reactions to classic works by adding an introduction from some third-rate aging socialist. If I wanted to read Anatol Rapoport, I would have looked him up in \\"Great Irrelevant Figures of the 20th Century\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"On War (Penguin)","review":"The book itself is unquestionably a classic. Anyone interested in strategy should read it. However, this translation is amongst the worst. The original German text is translated almost literally into English, preserving the difficult grammar constructions.

The first chance you get, get the much clearer, much more straightforward Paret/Howard translation, which is the one that's actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different version!","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer who said this is a terrible edition. Perhaps the average reader may prefer this abridged edition, but if you really want to know Clausewitz (like or dislike him), you're doing yourself a disservice to read this instead of a better work (like the Everyman edition mentioned before). I can hardly believe this was published as a Penguin classic because I have some great Penguin editions in my collection. This just isn't the Clausewitz book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic, but....read Sun Tzu also!","review":"This book, above all, justifies itself for its dictum about war baing the continuation of politics by other means. However, many of its readers have failed to understand, dialetically, that politics is the continuation of war by other means, and that therefore there is a dialectical unity between war and politics which precludes the idea of war as annihilation of the enemy. That was an error never commited by Sun Tzu, who regarded supreme skill as subduing the enemy without having to fight, a lesson not learned by many that chose to cling to Clausewitz's book, with his Machiavellian idea of war as a purely zero-sun-game. The tranlation is good, although a little Edwardian - and therefore, heavy. Highly recommended, if read conjointly with Sun Tzu's _Art of War_"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is much better","review":"I have the On War published by IAP, in November 2008 and it costs just US$9.99.

Nothing Stephenson has to say is new or interesting - anybody who'd consider buying the book has most likely read articles about the \\"OS Wars\\" for years now.

I am a software engineer: beyond working, the software should have beauty in each line. Similarly, when I read, I don't just want information: I want to feel the flow and beauty of the language. My second problem with this book is that, while it is short, it only has enough material for a book one-quarter the size. Borrow it from a friend and read the first chapter - that's all you'll need."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love anti-Microsoft ranting and raving!","review":"While I disagree with the premise that GUIs are inherently evil and moronic, and that command lines are better are smarter, I found this quite an interesting book. Much of what the author says is true though the writing is sophomoric at times, especially when he tries to sound hip and cool. There were some blatant inaccuracies and some other things that I looked askance at, especially since I have extensive experience with Windows 95/98 as well as Linux, as well as Unix on \\"grown-up platforms.\\" But the book makes for an interesting conversation piece, gets you thinking. At least it made me think more about the role that vision plays in intellectual processes, as opposed to verbal channels (i.e. language and text.) Ultimately Stephenson confuses his theory \\"selling OS's is ridiculous\\" with the theory that \\"visual based systems are inferior.\\" If you read his book critically and take its rants and raves with many grains of salt, it can be fun and rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick...","review":"While I did buy and read this book cover to cover in about 3 days, I regard that time spent as wasted. Stephenson, while a flashy fiction writer, left me wanting in this essay based on the evolution of the user interface. I will admit he managed to eek out a few brilliant remarks and commentary, (find the metaphor dealing with the OS car dealerships), but overall the essay was a poorly disguised rant. Stephenson manages to whine and carry on like a 8 year old with a stubbed toe for around 150 pages. I salute his fiction writing abilities, but the man is no sociologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before the command line","review":"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Neal Stephenson's books. The historical content he winds into his plots is engaging. However, I have been working with the micro computer since before the command line. Neal, you have the title wrong. In the beginning was the Monitor. No doubts in my mind. My right hand is still trained to enter octal codes on a keypad at lightening speed! The Command line came much later, more like the coalescence of matter in the Universe when clumps of useful things needed some impactful gravity. The Monitor was there before the clumps and after the octal toggle switches, address load and register load momentary switches. The Monitor got the human fingers attached to the computer once and for all. So, 2 stars because the title is just wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNIX, maybe; LitCrit, yes","review":"In the Beginning... is a compelling argument for using UNIX (though I am not entirely comvinced), and an interesting perspective on operating systems; but perhaps more importantly, this short and easily readable book serves as evidence for those who are seeking some background on Stephenson himself to understand better what goes into his novels. Having read all of the five currently available books, I am intrigued by recurring themes, especially as they grow out of the writer's own experiences with computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, and Sure to Please [some] Unix Lovers","review":"A short book, really an extended series of articles, portraying Stephenson's various experiences with operating systems -- DOS, Windows, Mac OS, and the various shades of Unix/Linux.It is not at all a necessary read for fans of Stephenson's fiction.Neither is it a necessary read for anyone well informed about OSes -- you'll have your own opinions and undoubtedly argue vociferously with Stephenson. Those interested in learning about how PC operating systems got this way could use this book as an overview, but it is incomplete, not attempting to present all sides or histories, but just anecdotes of what Stephenson has encountered, and his thoughts as to why it is that way.Perhaps the only readers of this book to be rewarded are those seeking a minor insight into Stephenson, himself, as his first-person approach is revelatory."},{"rating":"1","title":"A passable opinion piece, but with tedious writing.","review":"The opinions in this are most superficial but generally interesting, and make for an undemanding afternoon's read.But good God, do we have to picket Stephenson's publisher to get an editor assigned to him? Stephenson says in four paragraphs what he could just as well say in two sentences. Much of this essay reads like someone just strung together the posts in a ranty Usenet thread. This, folks, is the kind of thing an editor is supposed to stop from happening. And unlike most bad writing, it's a /pity/, because this could have actually been a very good essay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious lack of knowledge","review":"Neal is out of his element here.

I wish I hadn't because it would have been a lot easier to mount my saw before it was fully assembled. I could not be happier with this unit. It is well-built, it makes moving the saw a snap, it sits low to the floor, and it fits the saw well.

The characters are fascinating, ones you want to revisit again and again. And what a terrific caper! Isabelle Corey, one of the great but unrecognized beauties of the '50s, is marvelous.It's great to now own this film on DVD.

Anderson's commentary for HARD EIGHT, he talks about how this film was a big influence and that he probably owes Melville some money. I'd have to agree. Regardless, this film(and Melville's other films) are just so damn cool I can't blame P.T. This is a very interesting take on a gangster film. Apparently, Melville changed it from more of a heist-focused movie once he saw ASPHLT JUNGLE(Melville had been working on it when John Huston's film came out).

For those who haven't seen it...do.It's said filmmaker Melville is sort of a grandfather of the French New Wave. But BOB LE FLAMBEUR is more entertaining today than anything Godard or Truffaut ever made. This flick isn't just an exercise in style; sure, it has plenty of that, but it also has a great cast of characters, a good plot, and is just plain fun. In other words, this film isn't a mood movie. It's the real deal.Have fun dropping the title into conversation. Do it slyly and, when someone says they've never seen it or heard of it, act offended. And make sure you say the title with a thick French accent. It's fun! I'm kidding, of course (or am I?).

In both this film and Le Samourai, the central character is acting throughout the movie in a way that goes against their ideas of honor, but they are restored at the end.It's true this is not a caper flick. It's a great movie. It's a love letter to Montmartre, an examination of what honor is for a gambler, and it has a fantastic final twist that's been copied in many other movies.Melville used the idea of America (that the gambler is named Bob is important here) as a means to reflect on the possibilities of honor among men (he's not particularly interested in women, although he doesn't dislike them per se) after World War Two. It would be interesting to compare his work with Ridley Scott, another director whose Theme is Honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GOOD THIEF","review":"I would say that BOB LE FLAMBEUR is a very good film, but somehow not as satisfying as Neil Jordan's remake THE GOOD THIEF, with Nick Nolte."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I ever bought this","review":"Although this unit mostly works, it spins at very erratic speeds and likes to occasionally overspin and lose its grip on a spinning DVD, at which point the DVD goes banging around loose inside and you have to power the unit off to stop it.

Hardy (Heathcliff) captured my attention immediately and I've been following him since. An all star British cast makes it intriguing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chillingly, Hauntingly Beautiful (Spoiler!)","review":"An adaptation of a novel need not be correct in a linear fashion in order to succeed. It must show a vision, a splinter, that makes you believe you are there, as the novel also must do to succeed. This adaptation took my breath away, from the moment Heathcliff crawled in Cathy's grave, to the soul-shattering scream he utters when he knows she is dead. It doesn't matter to me that Cathy never curses him and Linton for killing her, it doesn't need these particles from the novel to make a drama that works.

If any one knows if the soundtrack is available for purchasing, please contact me. I would appreciate it immensely! Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nudity","review":"I confess I hate Heathcliff. I don't even really like \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" There are only a couple of admirable characters in there. However, I do enjoy the book as a character study. I like to contrast Heathcliff's selfish obsession with Sydney Carton's sincere love (from Tale of Two Cities). But this incarnation of Heathcliff is \\"over the top.\\" And I was shocked by the sex and nude scenes. There's no explicit sex or nudity in the book. I just hate to watch a \\"classic\\" and find that foolish moviemakers felt compelled to add 21st century sex and nudity. They just can't do without it. Don't watch it with your kids. Threw mine in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"I did not and would not buy this dvd, but I just finished watching it as a two-part series on Masterpiece Classic, and I found it beyond bad. The scriptwriter did include all three generations described in the book but took so many wild liberties that I was actually shocked. Heathcliff is depicted as nothing short of a madman. Cathy seems afraid of him in several scenes, so their \\"eternal love story\\" never works. Also, there were 3 (count em, 3) sex scenes in the movie, which meant it's not suitable for kids or for showing to students (I teach high school). These scenes were gratuitous and unnecessary and didn't serve to advance the plot at all. I mean, if Isabella and Cathy are pregnant, then viewers should have sense enough to know they had sex with their husbands without the camera having to follow them right into bed. I assume somebody thought Wuthering Heights needed to be tweaked to appeal to a modern audience. I believe that somebody was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful rendition of a personal favorite.","review":"I often struggle with movie adaptations of my favorite novels, but this rendition of Wuthering Heights is a beautiful, tragic film. The actors give striking performances, and the scenery is breathtaking. I would be hard-pressed to find anything I dislike about it. Be forewarned, though: I was taken with the book itself, before seeing the film; my appreciation for it stems from the earlier love of the novel. Not to say that it can't stand alone, simply that I love it for slightly different reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is by far my favorite adaptation of the story and Tom Hardy was an outstanding Heathcliffe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion gone wild","review":"If you're missing passion in your life, watch this movie! I've read the book several times as young as 16 and watched two other movies of this story. I must say that this is my favorite. I feel Heathcliff's pain and understand his anger better. Tom Hardy does an incredible portrayal of Heathcliff. All of the actors are perfect for their parts. I also like the interjection of a little history about Emily Bronte at the beginning and between the two parts. I think it's a wonderful rendition of Wuthering Heights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Worthwhile Adaptation","review":"This version is extremely satisfying as I found the acting very realistic and believeable, with every scene powerfully executed with full emotion by all the actors. Cathy is quite naive but that is to be expected as she is so very young and can't fully comprehend the long term consequences of her actions/choices. Heathcliff is permanently scarred with abandonment from his youth and together these two form an unbreakable bond early in life that one can undoubtedly see in the few scenes of tenderness exchanged by the two. I enjoyed the \\"liberties\\" taken with this adaptation as this created an aura of realism unlike any of the others up to this point. One might say the love scenes were unnecessary but the viewer witnesses intimacy of both tenderness and desperation...one feels so very right, the other so pointless, yet they occur.Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley were perfect together and the supporting cast acting was strong and memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of purchase","review":"this was a great experience. i placed my order and received the dvd within the timeframe that was specified on my confirmation."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Wuthering heights","review":"I bought the DVD, Wuthering Heights\\" as a gift for a friend.

I didn't like the characters, I think Tom Hardy is one of the worst actors I have seen. As for the sex scenes that everyone is so outraged over, they were practically nonexistent.

The acting isn't that great and the actual story has been horribly changed. In fact it's so reduced it's not even an hour long! And the ending! SPOLIER ALERT! I can't believe they had Heathcliff kill himself, that is completely out of character for him. It's just awful! Don't waste your money on this version. I think the Ralph Fiennes/Juliette Binoche version is much better. Fiennes makes an outstanding Heathcliff. The only thing this movie can boast of is the scenery/settings but that certainly can't save it from the ruin that was made of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"The acting was so off!

The female lead is new to me, but I did not care for her, either. I felt the residence used for Wuthering Heights was too grand, not at all appropriate.

Welles has a great voice to begin with, so when he's voicing Shakespeare (in deliciously over-the-top fashion?!) his delivery is even more captivating.

Just seven years after wowing the movie world with \\"Citizen Kane\\" he cranked out this practically unwatchable Shakespeare howler that looks as though it were edited with a Veg-o-matic. It's part of the \\"modernist\\" conceit that an artist should completely disregard his audience, and Welles sure followed the letter of that law here. Between the indistinguishable sets, garbled dialogue, bad lighting, troglodyte costumes, mismatched shots and jumbled continuity, even someone who knows \\"Macbeth\\" by heart will have a hard time following what's going on. If you're a Welles fan it's worth a once-over; if you're a Shakespears fan there are plenty of better versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this version if in US.","review":"Wish I read the reviews closer.. will not play on any US dvd player.

In some ways, Cary Grant's character was a bit of a cad, but of course he was charming as usual! The chemistry between Bergman and Grant was very obvious. The part where she tries to get even with her love for lying to her is very amusing and will have you in stitches! She bites off a little more than she can chew, but then gets her heart's desire in the end.

Apparently the lower bearing isn't so well sealed and dust will wick the lubrication out of it causing burnout and failure. Its a common enough problem that its in their FAQ. Their solution is to blow it out periodically, but I already did this as a matter of course (and it assumes you happen to have a compressor just to do maintainence) and mine still died a highly premature death. Also, not very well documented is the fact that using it on drywall voids the warranty. I did, albeit very minimally so aparently I'm on my own for the reapir, which runs at least half the cost of the tool, unless you can find someone to sell you the bearing without doing the repair. Thus far I've had no luck.I have to say, I'm disappointed. I consider this to be a design flaw and now I'm in a position of having to by another PC with the same risk of failure or toss the dust collection kit ... that won't fit on other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional-grade sander","review":"This is one of the best tools I own, but then Porter Cable seldom disappoints me. Before buying this one, I used a 1/2-sheet sander for 80 and 100 grit sanding, then switched to a 1/4 sheet pad sander for the 150 and 220 grits. Now I can sand faster with only the 333P. Just slap a hook and loop 100-grit sanding disc on and this baby will take off the wood in a hurry. Takes about 5 seconds to switch discs to go to the next grit. Vibration is low, balance is good, noise is tolerable. As with all sanders, you should always wear hearing protection and some type of dust filtration for your lungs and sinuses. Just common sense folks! Good job Porter Cable. You're right up there with my Bosch sliding compound mitre saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sander Has a Manufacuring Fault","review":"I purchased this in january of 2003. It worked well for 4 months of light home use. In April I returned it to the store where purchased, because the sander was \\"surging\\" in speed. It's now October, and the new replacement sander is doing the very same thing. This would definitely lead me to believe that there is a manufacturing problem with this model. When it works it works well, but who wants to continue using it, knowing that any minute it will stop working. I've used a lot of Porter Cable Tools, but this thing is junk. Furthermore, I've noticed a lot of these for sale as \\"Factory \\"reconditioned\\". Stay away. If they couldn't get it right the first time, why would you believe they can \\"recondition\\" it.

I recommend buying this a couple of months before you actually plan to go anywhere. Also we went a way for a weekend (Fri-Sun) and by Saturday night when we finished the last section, my eleven year old was starting to zone out. Seemed like A LOT of information in a short amount of time. Maybe spreading it out a little bit more than what the guide suggests would help.

I highly recommend this program for every parent and teen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so conservative...","review":"My daughter and I recently went on a Mother/Daughter weekend, and we used some of the material from this weekend kit. In my opinion, it focuses more on the 'typical teen dating scenario', and less on God's beautiful plan for marriage in the future. I would highly recommend listening to all the sessions and reading through the student's journal before using this material. There were some things that we did not discuss as we do not believe in 'teen dating', and therefore, have trained our children to not view this behavior as normal from a biblical perspective. So, use caution, if purchasing, but know that there are some nuggets that can be used for a wonderful weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable Parenting Tool","review":"I used this material on a weekend getaway with my 10 year old son. If your child likes projects and surprises this is the material to use to introduce them to peer pressure, choices and purity. Appropriate for boys and girls that are pre-teen. The CD's are fun and easy to listen to with your child. Five great object lesson projects that help make the lessons tangible. The material and topic opened up lines of communication that will benefit our father son relationship for the teenage years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly dull","review":"I cannot for the life of me understand how this thing ever found a publisher. The prose is flat and insipid; the characters unexciting and drab; the pace leaden. Reading this is slightly less exciting than watching paint dry. The author has done some historical research and can't just use it; where he pops in an historical detail he elbows you in the ribs to draw attention to his cleverness. I had a very hard time dragging myself to the end of this book (first one by Mallon I have read) and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad, sweet story","review":"This is a story that's going to stay with me for awhile. Mallon writes a wonderful story of four lives that come together mixing happiness and despair. Like \\"Henry and Clara\\" there is a sense of sadness (ill-fated-ness?) throughout the book that reminds one to enjoy every opportunity for happiness. As someone who works in Washington I also really enjoyed reading more about the city and what it was like in 1877. I think I'll have to take another walk down to Foggy Bottom very soon to look for the ghosts of Cynthia and Hugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"3x3 eyes","review":"This anime series is a great one for anybody that likes action and romance.

I wanted my sister to see it but she wasn't in the mood. It was mild at first, but then it started to get gruesome. I really loved the plot and the humor was great, but I found it to be way too focused on tearing the characters to shreads. There where also some parts of the show I found disturbing. Other than that, it was really good. Don't let my review get you down about this movie. After all, I'm kinda used to Sailor moon and all that Magical girl anime.

For example, the mathematics questions stress simple geometry (i.e. 3-4-5 triangles) while GRE mathematics questions are rather more dense. Some figures are even mislabeled. Reading comprehension paragraphs contain typographical errors. These problems result in an unpolished product.Kaplan boasts 12 section-length practice tests, but these tests share a question-pool, so students can run into the same question in Quantitative practice test 3 that they saw in test 1. In fact, one question on full length CAT is exactly the same as an ETS Powerprep Quantitative Comparison question (it involves the area of a parallelogram).The savvy student will purchase an ETS published book. By the way, the back cover of Kaplan's book includes the text: \\"Are you ready for the GRE Exam.\\" That asks \\"Are you ready for the Graduate Record Exam Exam.\\" Better rethink your editorial staff, Kaplan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but...","review":"I would prefer something a little (a lot, really) more sturdy.

If you are a developer who wants to understand the logical structure of the registry and the conventions for storing your own data in it then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a fan of Breaking Benjamin...","review":"or are a fan of any band, this book will give you a fathers' insight to how it all begins, and goes along the way.Gary Fincke doesn't hold anything back in his experience as the guitarists' dad in Breaking Benjamin. If you have never heard of this band, you seriously need to find a radio. They are breaking into the world of Rock and Roll.You hear a fathers' thoughts,comments, and emotions as the band goes through many changes. An EXCELLENT book for the rocker!!!I ordered it, and received it 2 days later! AWESOME reading when you have to \\"limit\\" yourself to a chapter a night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amp'd - Amazing","review":"I'll be honest-I bought Amp'd solely to learn more about the roots of the band Breaking Benjamin, and member Aaron Fink. What I received, however, was much more. Gary Fincke delivers a captivating, suspenseful, and beautifully written story in Amp'd. Spanning from Aaron's high school band to 2003 Breaking Benjamin, Professor Fincke recounts his son's transformation as a musician and human being. Amp'd is filled with anecdotes that are sure to make you chuckle, and in some cases, experience a strangely authentic fearful sensation. Even though I am an avid Breaking Benjamin fan, Aaron's success did not seem assured throughout the story; I had serious trouble putting the book down.To summarize, Amp'd is a powerful account of Aaron Fink's rise to stardom. Its captivating narrative is sure to engage any reader-fan of Breaking Benjamin or not. 5/5 for an amazing work of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory for all parents and teachers","review":"This book was recommended to me by my child's doctor and I only regret I didn't have this book years earlier. It's like having the owners book with all of the info that was not before known. Yeah we get tons of \\"advice\\" but none of it works because each kids is different. This book has helped me understand how to properly motivate my young kids so they are not only doing what they are supposed to, but working harder to reach THEIR goals. I have had the book for a few weeks and have implemented some of the concepts with fantastic results. This book is a great companion to the book \\"Positive Discipline\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advise","review":"Reading Part one I was beginning to wonder about all those wonderful book review on amazon. It seemed to tell us all things we have heard before. I was excited to reach part 2 entitled motivation booster. Where she tell us what will boost our children's motivation, and gives us quite a few examples of how to accomplish the task. In part 3, she goes even further by explaining the ways in which we can sabotage their motivation. I really enjoyed the last two part of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst formatted book I have ever read on my kindle","review":"Just like the title says. The formatting was horrid. Not sure if the writer was trying to be cute with all of the odd spacing and line spacing, but it does not work. Maybe the writer was trying to squeeze in some more pages to make the book look longer, it is a kindle here people, you aren't judging a book by its cover (or thickness).The subject was pretty basic as well. Long on fluff and short on substance. I rarely read a book that I look back on and wish I could have the time I wasted reading it back, but this is one of them. If you want some advice like, \\"Spend more time with your kids.\\", then buy this book, otherwise don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective tool for Law Officers","review":"Prior to my discovery of this book in 1994, I like most Law Officers were relegated to carrying cumbersome two volume hard back editions for reference. The Nevada Criminal and Traffic Law Manual has changed that. This book is extremely easy to carry in a brief case on duty. If you have access to a laptop, the CD rom version makes this a quick way to access all of the important statutes. The soft cover book has a somewhat less than handy index, but is workable once you become accustomed to it. The CD version has an excellent search engine with almost a \\"soundex\\" type function. If you are a Law Officer and this is available for your state, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivoting!","review":"This story is an absolutely rivoting tale of what it takes to tell the truth in modern society. The story gripped me from the moment I picked it up til the last page was turned. I found the characters to be real and the content of the plot super. This is a book not only for young adults, but for adults as well. Rat is that conscience inside all of us waiting to come out. Cheripko wastes no time in conveying the ideals and conflict that Rat will have to face, even in the midst of his own desires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"A poignant, sensitive portrayal of deformity, addiction, death, and birth. Cheripko writes to the young adult but manages to draw in readers of any age, including this grandmother. Everything DOESN'T turn out all right in the end, just like in real life.

Slavery was wrong, Mr. Davis, we get it, now get on with what we are to learn that we supposedly never did. My conscience got the best of me regarding tossing the book, though, since I have a certain reverence for books (even bad ones) so I fished it out of the trash and put it on the exchange table at work in case some masochist feels compelled to delve into it in its entirety.

I thought this was an excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"I found this book very biased, which is why I continued reading. The history is horrible, but I was curious the extent to which Mr. Davis wants to cement his moral crusade view of history in lay people's minds. At one point the comparison is made between the opporators of the underground railroad and the people who resisted the Nazis. By extention Mr. Davis makes the implicit and fallacious argument, slavery is like the holocaust.The title should be \\"Don't know much about slavery: How white men's stupidity continues in perpetuity.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know much about the Civil War","review":"I found the book to be an easy read, using a style of short, detailed accounts of events and people. There are also copies of documents that are refered to in history, such as the lost orders of Gen. Lee which were recovered by a Union soldier. This book is a valuable addition to anyy reenactor or anyone interested in the facts that often get obscued by historians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Know Much About the Civil War","review":"Don't know much about the Civil War reminds me of a Berkley professor brain washing it's students with extremist positions. Why does Mr. Davis take a subjective leftist view on this era? You only have to read any of his other books to know why. He is extremely liberal. If you are fresh out of a large University, you'll love this book. If you are tired of the rhetoric of the left you will find yourself somewhat repulsed. Not by the content, but by the strong negative tone inflections Davis places on America and its history. A history lesson, whether taught to you or your kids, must be objective facts, not a persuasive pitch of your own personal hatred. Davis sell book based on this premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to contain a bit of bias","review":"After finding ancestors who served on the Union side of the Civil War, I've been reading everything I can find on the subject. I have found old newspaper archives to be the greatest source of information. This is the first book I've come across that seems to paint the Civil War in a 21st century light. Yes, there is some good basic Civil War information but the author seems to include a bit of bias that flies in the face of the many articles I've read. One third of the way through the book and I'm done with it. I give it two stars for painting slavery as the evil as it truly was.

I do not remember ever seeing this book before I found it in the box. That was a lucky find for me. I do not read \\"porn\\", or \\"hard erotica\\", and when I saw the name, I was concerned it may be Too hot for me. I thought \\"oh, Dear\\", but when I looked through the book my heart melted for the heroine. This book has Hot intimacy, but it is not erotica. As a mother who dearly loves children I could understand Jenna's desire for a child. I can also understand wanting the best man to father her child. I enjoyed this book.(Possible Spoiler) I am a sucker for happy endings, and I found the conclusion of this story to be perfect. The physical attraction was there, and how the couple work out the logistics of conception time is funny, heart warming, and of course, sexy. This is a great beach read, or a fun way to pass time on a plane.

You wouldn't know from the book's cover that the author's experience and advice are narrowly limited to that field. As an outsider, I could not understand some of the terminology and concepts. That is in part because of the industry niche, and also because of the British vocabulary (Persil Automatic?).There's certainly value in motivational books like this, to get you all fired up when you need inspiration. It's just that this one will only be helpful to those in advertising, and specifically folks who work in small ad agencies and understand that language and culture. Outside of that narrow culture, many of the recommendations would prove disastrous indeed to one's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone home should have a copy","review":"When I taught an advertising class at university I put this book at the top of the required reading list. Most of the kids couldn't understand why a tiny little book like this was so important.

This book is what it is and to hold such high expectations to the point of letting it ruin your day is absolutely missing the point of the author's message. Paul Arden is simply providing his insight in small passages and if that approach works for the reader all is well but if it does not: \\"stop, drop and roll\\"!

And the format!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very inspiring at all","review":"This book was recommended to me, but I did not find it very useful. Extremely short (read it through in less than 1 hour) and quite old fashioned (yes, I know it's not new) I didn't read a single thing I didn't already know. I was a little disappointed as I had planned to relax and read during christmas and get inspired for the start of a new division of my company. Well, if you have no experience at all this book could be useful, the advice you get is all perfectly correct and true, and as I said, easy and short to read, if thats your worry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice piece","review":"Very cute pocket book.It's nice and interesting to read. Everybody that has seen it here at home want it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone, short of a book","review":"This isn't a book, but a collection of vague ideas, in huge font, aimed towards those in the advertising/marketing field. Of course, this isn't evident from the blurb or the title, misleading one into thinking that it is a motivational book for all.The ideas are few, haphazardly linked, and the message simple and obvious. You may find use in this if you are in the above line of work, but even then, I think there are much better books on the subject than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk like a West-Indian...","review":"Perhaps most useful if you're dumb, silly & blind and a fresh-faced internin the marketing/PR biz.The randomness of this collection made me wonder if he wrote it over thecourse of two weeks worth of company wash room visits in a particularlyconstipated period of his life...

If not for the extended nudity scenes (which I like very much), I would probably give it one star. Too bad, because the first ten minutes showed a lot of promise.

As for the 4 AA batteries it requires, I bought some Energizer NiMH rechargeables and will swap them when needed -- well worth the $12 investment. The sound in & out (I spoke with my HOH mother without any complaint from her) are both good with 3 volume adjustments & the ringer has high, low & off. The display on the caller-id improved when I cranked up the contrast in the settings. I like the black & silver color combo and it matches my RCA clock radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialout Died","review":"I bought this phone as a backup, kept in storage and occasionally used. No problems and very little use and I liked the look and feel of the phone a lot. Then, when I really needed it, the dial out numbers abruptly stopped working. I tried every which way to get them working again without success. This is not a case of batteries dying as I never had any in it and didn't need the power. Now I can only receive calls. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"As others have mentioned, you can not replace the cord.

Not worth the energy to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic and limited, but sturdy and economical","review":"OK, so a lot of people hate this phone. The main complaint seems to be that the cord that leads to the jack is not removable. This is a significant design flaw, but a simple cord connector fixes the problem and mine has worked for me that way for six years. Another thing is that, like many modern phones, in trying to make the lines \\"space-age\\" looking, the designers have overlooked the fact that there is a curve between the ear and the mouth, so you have to hold it at just the right angle to hear and be heard at the same time. But here's why I like this phone --(A) In the six years I've had it, I've dropped it on my brick floors innumerable times and it still works. (B) I've only had to change batteries twice in the last four years. (C) You can find it online and at big box stores for about $8. I think those things, caller ID, and a ten-number memory make it a decent deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lousy","review":"I've been a big Stan Ridgeway fan for a long time now so i jumped at this vid when i saw it in the store.Have to say i'm very disappointed.Some of the music videos are ok but the video quality overall in this dvd is poor as well as the audio quality.The quality of live stuff is *very poor.Worst of all after watching the home movies of their tour travel i'm disappointed in the group itself as they all come across as whiny jerks.Anyways buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commotion in the Ocean","review":"This is an excellent and delightful book!

The author possibly intersperses a few bits of original thought between near-plagiaristic repetitions of metaphors. This is all loosely shrouded in the context of dialog between an obvious ignoramous who is supposed to represent the reader on their path of self-discovery of all of this new wisdom, and the saintly gurus who so generously spew it forth. The book is at once amusing and insulting. However, as a collection of good folk wisdom, one could read it as a concise reminder of the way in which we would all like to conduct our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written book with no original content","review":"If you want to learn about what the author wanted to say, read the 7 Habits of Highly Effective people by Stehpen Covey. 90% of the contents of this book is contained in Covey's book, only in a much more detailed and convincing form.

The author states at the beginning he is a \\" beginner on self discovery...and presently reassessing his most fundamental values...how I view the world.\\" For me this means in a years time he will write another disregarding much/some of this as his present \\" personal transformation is taking place\\". What a pity he had not waited and written it when he was more stable and decided.The book is very superficial and contains about 100 things we \\" should \\" do. AS another critical reviewer noted its just a random collection of wisdom from past books jumbled together which he does not give credit for. Some of it is very good of course. He praises his own previous book in this book of course and promotes the need for a personal coach. In the end the author should have waited until his life was less confusing as he admits at the beginning. Thats the biggest block of all to buying this book.

The book compares the two languages and highlights the differences which made it easier for me to pick up. I'm not a person who reads many books, for work or pleasure, so I don't have much to compare it with. But out of the 10 or so books in my work library, this is the second best book I've used.

The polyrhythms that became a trademark of Talking Heads music starting with Remain In Light are clearly among his contributions. This album was Jerry's first solo foray and is every bit as strong as the music being created as part of the Talking Heads ensemble. His interpretations are more straightforward than those of David Byrne but no less authentic. It's also clear in this album that Jerry was a more original musical artist, especially in his willingness to explore the deeper elements of the music present in this collection. If you are a Talking Heads fan you may miss the vocal antics of David Byrne; Jerry's music - along with works by Tom Tom Club (Tina Weymouth and Chris Franz' efforts independent of Talking Heads) - suggest there was considerably more talent in that band."},{"rating":"2","title":"another good work from karaindrou","review":"may be this work is not one of the best Eleni Karaindrou but it is still good enough to take you to the other worlds..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A River Rages Through It","review":"Charting New Waters is a funny and gutsy collection of poetry, cartoons, autobiographical essay and political satire. Not always pretty, Chocolate Waters' work is hard-hitting and often side-splitting in it's raw emotion, humor and truthfulness. She is free with her hurt, her lust, her rage, her laughter. For all of you who lived through the birth of radical lesbianism, she guides a nostalgic ride that time only enhances. For younger readers, Waters offers a glimpse of the reality of life for political lesbians in the seventies.If you're looking for Moon, Spoon and June poetry, try another author.

I cried. I was speechless. I bought this CD on the basis of that breathtaking performance. But my first thought when it began to play was that I had been sent the wrong CD, that the used-CD seller had inserted in the sleeve an amateur home-made CD by mistake. I winced through much of it and I in no way mean to denigrate or make fun of Ms. Mullally or the musicians but I just did not enjoy the music made here. On slower, sweeter, sadder numbers, her voice evokes emotion from her listeners but on most numbers she sounds raspy and harsh. I blame the choice of music--too offbeat with all over the map arrangements. A gorgeous voice gone wrong. But when she puts out another collection of tunes, I will buy it nonetheless, hoping for the magic I know she has in her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES!","review":"Having loved Megan's last CD, \\"The Sweetheart Break-In\\", I couldn't wait to get my hands on her new \\"Big As A Berry\\".

Her last effort was a total original, yet it also recalled Bette Midler's early cabaret/bathhouse days.However, every single song on \\"Big As A Berry\\" is so down-tempo and depressing, I listened to it twice and had to put it in a box in the cellar. Why the cheery title and bright packaging (so at odds with a repertoire of what sound like bad country tunes) is anybody's guess.The CD is also flatly mixed and badly recorded, with Megan often sounding like she's singing into a tin can.\\"Big As A Berry\\" is very big a waste of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"A great, big, boistrous surprise!

Ms. Mullaly's choice of repertoire is questionable and her treatment of it torturous.

While Ms. Mullaly certainly has a voice (think \\"Bernadette Peters\\" and you'll get an idea of the tonal quality), it needs some serious coaching. She cannot handle the lowest notes of these pieces, leaving me to wonder if she really is limited to the one-octave range it sounds like, if the keys of her pieces weren't carefully chosen for her own voice, or if she just hasn't been trained to use her instrument properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this album....","review":"I saw Megan sing on Letterman and was totally blown away by the beauty of her voice.

I wish that those who would write as well as those who would read this type of literature would spend their time doing something far more productive, like searching for answers to real problems, like disease and space travel, instead of puttering about discussing the imagination's status as a place vs. a space.

Musically, it's a masterpiece of course, however, the problem is Shnittke's libretto and the production itself obioulsy. It's very dark and I can not see what are singers doing on the stage. The performance feels empty and there is a terrible direction and meaningless, disastrous stage design all over the place.

It did have some good pointers, but it did not cover anything about special issues such as being older, dating after children, etc. This dvd is for the young single who has not been married or had children before. I also thought that some of the messages that a guy isnt going to like you if you dont look like a supermodel were disheartening and wrong. Basically, this dvd is good if you don't have a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"More joke than informative","review":"I've watched Millionaire Matchmaker and enjoy it entertainment value, and I appreciated Patti's straight-shooting approach. I got this video out of sure curiosity and to see if she had any tips. But oh wow- This was a joke. I agree with the reviewer who noted poor production quality and terrible scripting. My friends and I are planning a watch party for the sole purpose to make fun of it.I say it's a joke, but it's also insulting to single women and also single men. She insults the women who attend her conference, she insults the men who she talks to at the round table discussion.... it's just awkward. The disappointing thing, though, is that this isn't the person she is on her TV show.Save your money or buy it cheaply.

It seems to me like the storyline is more of an excuse to hold together a multitude of informative and (mostly)enjoyable clippings from various sources. Perhaps it should have been a draconic encyclopedia, rather than a storybook. However, its real strength is in its glorious artwork. Sweeping landscapes and glittering details mesh delightfully on each oversized page, and dragons of all shapes, sizes and dispositions are sprinkled in liberally. All in all, a lovely source of information on various dragons, and an entertaining pastime on a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST summary of dragon lore I've ever seen","review":"This is a wonderful book. The artwork is breath-taking. You almost feel as though the dragons will step right off the page into your lap (not always a pleasant thought). Every drawing is so detailed, and you always see something new when you read it. The storyline is entertaining without being overly melodramatic or childish; it catches you from the first paragraph and doesn't let you go. The information about dragons from around the world is not very in-depth in most cases, but it covers so many different lands and legends that it more than makes up for the lack of depth by sheer width of subjects. All in all, it is fantastic and well worth the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Art","review":"This is strictly a story book, and wonderfully done.

My daughter (aged 11) read all but chapters 5 and 7 (which I read aloud to her so I could skip the \\"offensive\\" parts. I read the entire book beforehand...and that is how I know.) A few paragraphs in Chapters 5 and 7 are not appropriate if a parent/teacher were not comfortable with their student reading about couples living together before marriage (and sex) as well as some \\"adult ideas\\" about \\"the other sex\\". Even though Wanda Gag surely had these thoughts and did indeed live with Earle Humphreys and later married him, the descriptions about these issues do not belong in a book written for the 9-12 age group.

He attempts to bully the reader by totally unscholarly failure to consider alternative explanations and to present data contrary to his obsessional besmirching of Margaret Mead (NOT just attacking her first book).Since his first book attacking COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA, Freeman has become obsessed with sex. How stormy adolescence in Samoa was was in 1925-26 the \\"problem\\" Mead was studying, but Freeman now only sees the existence of \\"free love\\" as Mead's focus (any reading of what Mead wrote shows how false this). Moreover, Freeman's always palpable misogyny has extended to fagbashing in this book.Too bada that Vladimir Nabokov is not around to write about Freeman's obsession with the (ghost of) the young Margaret Mead -- and what he portrays as her evil father. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Let us see here: Freeman goes on to correct the picture of Samoa, and then uses incomplete and second-hand, and at times downright silly evidence to prove that Mead uses incomplete, second hand, and downright silly evidence.Now, I am not the biggest fan of Mead, but she is the most misinterpreted anthropologist (probably as she is most popular), and Freeman's sociobiological approach simply goes nowhere.I also resent the fact that Freeman was an intellectual covard, who chose to wait until Mead's death to publish any critique, in order for her to not be able to respond to it. For shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Shoot the Messenger","review":"One doesn't have to like Freeman to acknowledge that he's made his case and it holds up. It's wickedly ironic that Meade's shoddy reasearch (I don't think she was dishonest) was embraced as truth for fifty years. Anthropologists are supposed to explain myths, not create them. In a way it doesn't matter. The subject is old and Meade's reputation as a popularizer isn't changed one whit (but then the same could be said for Kinsey and Dr. Joyce Brothers). If Freeman had started his career with this book he would be justly regarded as a giant killer. As he's ending with this one he deserves his day. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book rings true because it accords with prior evidence.","review":"Derek Freeman's book caught my eye because I had been told similar things about Margaret Mead's research by a trusted Samoan friend several years ago. He told me that he once had a radio talk show in American Samoa and he was able to interview several of the women who, as young girls, had served as the source for Mead's information. As I recall it, they told him that they had noticed that Mead seemed to want to hear stories of their loose sexual behavior, and they simply gave her lots of what she wanted. Putting this story over on Mead, he said, seemed to be a great source of merriment to the girls.I don't think the Samoan friend is putting one over on me.

Also, it's nice that their lesser known offerings (\\"Perfect Water\\", and \\"Dance on Stilts\\") are included. It is of course a live recording, and most of their concerts since 1985 have been little more than a workman-like trip down memory lane.

I've got a keen ear for things, and with today's technology of digital, I would only expect to hear clean, crisp recordings. Even for live events. But this live piece of tripe is a major chore to try to sit through. This does not sound good turned way up, let alone at normal level. There should be no excuse for this.Technically the boys can play. But they cannot sing and they obviously cannot hear. Regarding the dreadful singing talents of Eric Bloom, he should stop...Now.But this recording really blows. The mix is completely off.

They will also not fit in systems with DVD slots like a car system where the DVD gets pulled into a slot and not put on a tray. Also, after being on the DVD in humidity, the humidity builds up and creates a small layer of moisture not allowing it to play unless you take it off, air it out and put it back on.

Possibly because the author doesn't have the time or space to expand on each character - every chapter is based on a different character in the story - there is no real exploration of their motives and they come across as quite cliched. The setting was a good choice - a pilgrimage through the desert with Muslims making the Hajj, traders and a bridal procession, but not enough was done with it or maybe the cast of characters was just too large. Perhaps if the author had concentrated on two or three characters instead then the story might have been more meaningful and engrossing.

We are all fortunate that Universal gave him his wish by putting these two stars together in one of the funniest war movies ever made. Surprisingly, Grant and Curtis work together superbly with neither dominating or trying to outshine the other.

Penny Serenade? I Was a Male Warbride? It's probably the latter, but don't rule out Operation Petticoat. Grant does his usual fine job; he's not the problem. He always plays Cary Grant. But the story is ridiculous, sexist in the extreme, and largely unfunny. A pink sub saved by a bra. Tony Curtis as Sargeant Bilko. A girdle in the machine area keeping a submarine going for hundreds of miles. A slapstick ending. Well, maybe this really is the all-time worst Grant film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much social stuff, not enough action!

Its funny with unique situations. It is not slapstick but full of sight gags, slick lines, and body reactions. Tony Curtis and Cary Grant are perfectly cast. The 5 nurses all have their own personalities which just pumps up the plot variations. There are so many subplots that you never get bored.Parts of the movie were based on fact: 1) the sinking of the submarine USS Sealion at the pier at Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines, 2) Lieutenant Commander James Wiggin Coe's letter to the supply department on Mare Island Naval Shipyard on the lack of toilet paper, and 3) the need to paint a submarine pink due to the lack of enough red or white lead undercoat paint.I saw the conning tower set on the Universal Studios lot and surprisingly it was made out of wood, painted gray, and looked like metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and very quotable","review":"I'm old enough that I first saw this movie in the theater shortly after it was first released. Over the years, I've been back numerous times to lift my spirits and to get a refresher course on great movie quotes.Cary Grant plays the submarine captain who just wants his ship to get off the seabed and into the war. Tony Curtis is Lt. Holden, the bane of his existence AND the only person who can help him get what he needs to do the job. Arthur Kennedy is the crusty machinist's mate, Tofton, who is trying to hold a submarine together with bailing wire and anything else Lt. Holden can get his hands on. When the Captain asks whether he thinks they can survive a sea voyage, Tofton responds \\"I'm a religious man, Captain. I believe we can get through if the good Lord puts his mind to it...of course, He'll have to give us His undivided attention.\\"We may not be talking about award winning performances, but we always finish this movie laughing and feeling better about the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old classic","review":"This is a wonderful movie, funny, smart, clever, sweet. It has great humor with out stupid gross or fraternity jokes.

Unfortunately I had to go somewhere that day, so I taped it. When I got home I immediately put the tape in the vcr and watched it. It wasn't as good as I expected but it wasn't the worst thing either. I think the movie would have been better with Corey Haim as the star and I also didn't like the guy that played the boyfriend of the mom. I also thought that the movie wasn't really realistic because when the older brother hid the stash of coke, he wouldn't have told the guy where it was and expected him not to hurt him. I thought that part was really dumb. So, if you want an okay movie to watch for about an hour and forty minutes watch this, but I wouldn't buy it if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE!","review":"The one big problem I had with this movie is the scumbag, coke-dealing boyfriend is supposed to be the bad guy when the kids come off as bigger assholes. Kinda made me wish the boyfriend would've killed her son after recovering the stolen coke. While it turns out the boyfriend has some illegal dealings and comes on too strong, the role portrayed a sincere effort to reach the kids. Conversely, the children are either constantly fighting, mouthing off to teachers and resisting any attempts to get along (notwithstanding suspicious behavior and ongoings). Not that black and white cowboy hats should be used to know good from bad, but through the large gray area came a sympathy for the boyfriend and thought that the kids needed a good skullcracking (opposite of what was intended). Few adjustments would've taken this from so-so to a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weller Nailed The Part","review":"Peter Weller was superb as the low-life riff-raff boyfriend in this film, from the first hung-over moment he appears on the screen to his nonchalant comment, after the kids later catch him and the mom with cocaine, \\"Life goes on.\\" Living in apartment complexes during the first half of the 1980s, I saw this same guy again and again, preying temporarily on single women, leeching off them for awhile, leaving their lives in varying degrees of shambles and abruptly moving on.

With that said, I highly recommend this reader for anyone who is learning Latin. It is presented in straight-forward, basic language which is accessible to anyone with a grasp of the basics and a workable vocabulary. It contains four enjoyable stories; Perseus, Hercules, The Argonauts, and Ulysses. Each story starts with a brief English overview, followed by fairly lengthy retellings in Latin, with each major story broken down into shorter sub-chapters, generally from 50 to up to 200 words each. Extensive and informative notes are provided, organized by sub-chapter, unfortunately located at the end of the work, making them impractical to refer to in Kindle format. On the positive side, the Latin narratives are uninterrupted, preserving the interest of a continuous story.

While it is true that Norman's writing ability increased from the first, her characters are poorly developed - neither Kusak or Carrie, the two main characters, experience any growth throughout the book. The plot is also extremely contrived. I knew the moment it said she was pregnant that the fact she would lose the child was as much a certainty that she would survive for the next installment of Norman's series. Norman didn't disappoint - or did, by showing that she wasn't below using lame plot devices and contrived events to make sure Carrie isn't \\"burdened\\" by a child.

Oscar Almengor is effective in the title role. Neto's antics with his young friends are reminiscent of the film \\"Stand By Me.\\" The drama involving Neto's father and uncle is well acted out.

And what was up with the 'crazy' Marshall guy? Are you kidding me? And the \`plot twist' with the FBI guys or whatever was brutal. Nonsensical garbage at best. It seemed like the movie was thrown together by about 10 different screenwriters who didn't bother to read what was put on paper before them. Wow - just lame and weak.

This would lead one to believe that it was a version that was originally produced for HDTV. This theory is further supported by the fact that there are absolutely no bonus features on the disc....none whatsover. There is not even a start up menu screen. The film simply begins when put in the player. There are also audio-video sync problems throughout the film. The image quality is exceptional, but if you own the DVD, I would not upgrade in blu-ray, as you lose more that you gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"this was a gift for my mom...she loves Bruce Willis and I know that she loves this movie so I got this for her for Christmas"},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTION PACKED, THRILL RIDE!","review":"Bruce is back!

The movie kept you interested with a nice surprise ending. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a horror movie than Bruce Willis film","review":"I did not like this movie at all. It reminded me of more of a horror movie than a typical bruce willis film especially at the beginning when the woman cop is shot, thought it was kind of gross along with the kidnappers themselves, white trash. Guess if you like suspenseful horror movies then you would like it but for sure not a family movie or one for kids. Check out 16 blocks instead for a better well rounded bruce willis picture.Peter J. Miller"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love You Bruce!!","review":"I am a HUGE Bruce Willis fan and have been since \\"Moonlighting\\" so I have seen all of his movies. (My favorite to this day is Die Hard 2). So of course I loved this movie just for the fact that he was in it. What was it about again? (Just Kidding). It was a really good Fast-paced action-thriller.I LOVED it and feel that it is one of his best movies. FYI: His daughter in the movie is his oldest daughter in real life with Demi (Rumer Willis)."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Bruce Willis, you will like HOSTAGE","review":"This is a good hardcore action movie. The plot is a bit contrived and far fetched, but who cares."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real substance ..","review":"I like Bruce Willis but he couldn't save this movie, even if he cried more. The plot was unoriginal and the script was laughable in some scenes. Above all i would have to say the acting was miserable, with the exception of Bruce W. The daughter and mother had no chemistry with Bruce Willis and they acted terribly. I think they should have hired better actors. This movie was wholly predictable. The little child in the film, the one who is supposed to be smart , was rather annoying and also a lousy actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"Hostage begins with an interesting premise: ie the former negotiator from a big city police dept seeks refuge as a small town police chief.However the movie quickly degenerates into mush, when we are shown a mansion with a multi-million dollar, Mission Impossible-style security system, and it can't even keep out acouple of hillbilly carjackers. The intent of security cameras is that you need someone(preferably security persons) watching them"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought Hostage was good!","review":"I thought Hostage was an entertaining thriller, and you can't beat ben foster's death scene. one of the best death scenes I've seen in a movie in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Willis to the rescue again","review":"As usual with a Bruce Willis movie there has to be things blowing up or catching on fire and there was. Interesting high-tech house and mostly believable small-town villains who are the hostage-takers. The underlying story of the rich dad & his swindles detracted from it I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please ask me why??","review":"Why 4 stars? this is a brilliant action pack thriller , the story line is good , the acting good and it's a all round balance drama suspence thriller ok!!! i know i said that all ready.so why did it do so bad at the box office this is called over ther hill syndrome thats when your action star has lost the appeal of the movie goers Bruce Willis is great actor and if he had done this same movie ten years ago it would rock the box office but this is not ten years ago and the majority of movie goers are now between the ages of 9 to 21, to them Bruce Willis aint no Brad Pitt, he has lost his appeal to the viewing audience this is sad! because this is a good movie, it's no classic but still it's entertaining, laterz folks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!!! Very exciting~~~","review":"I really liked this movie. My husband rented it and I had not heard anything about it, so I was hesitant to watch. I am glad I did! It was very exciting and the plot kept me enthralled until the end. Great exciting movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Suprised, Sort of...","review":"While I didn't expect much out of Hostage, (I've found that not expecting much is sometimes the best way to approach mainstream cinema) I did find myself appreciating it for what it was.It wasn't groundbreaking cinema, but it was an entertaining experience. It didn't have groundbreaking performances, but the subtleties that it delivers are worth the time it takes to watch. It's your normal hostage drama, with basic action sequences and your almost superhuman bad guy.Willis delivers his standard performance as a man with a tarnished past. Ben Foster, also seen in Disney television series \\"Flash Forward,\\" was surprising in his portrayal as the standard villain you love to hate.Again, I went into this not expecting too much, and got just a little more that I expected. 4/5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the book instead...","review":"I totally recommend reading the book by Robert Crais (5 stars in my opinion).

Better than some of the crap out there. If you like Bruce Willis you shouldn't miss this one, maybe a little dramatic for some people, but I think they did a good job.

A thriller to the end, with unexpected subplots. Obviously, hostages are involved. Bruce Willis was an ex-SWAT hostage negotiator, and is now a small town police chief trying to rescue two groups of hostages, held by different bad guys, at the same time.All bad guys are not created equal. Lots of cell phones, and bullets are flying. Plan an escape route in case the movie gets too intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was good!","review":"This one was really good. I saw a side of Ben Foster I'd never seen. It was full of suspense and I kept watching. Bruce Willis was really good in here. The whole movie was good.The plot had a little bit of parts that were left out, but if you would come in on the middle of the movie, you would watch it till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a good book, if only there wasn't so many bad words!","review":"I bet this book could have been good, if there wern't so many cuss words! They litterly said the \\"f word\\" at least four times on every page. To me, one or possibly two cuss words once in a while would be fine, but the Zoe Trope (the author) wrote SO MANY that it was distracting from the book. I finally had to stop reading because the bad words were so annoying and I forgot what the whole plot of the book was. All in all, if you are offended or annoyed by the use of cuss words, I would ABSOLUTELY NOT reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disgusted...","review":"Honestly, I think Zoe is an okay writer. She uses some good imagery. But I don't know why I would ever want to waste my time reading about the 'horrible' life of a suburban middle-class high schooler. I am also suburban middle-class, but I don't publish books about it.The homosexual and bisexual parts truly disturbed me. I hear about that enough at the U, on the news, and everywhere else, I don't need to read a book about it.And I have to say, her hypocrisy overwhelmed me. People call her writing 'mature', but I say it's the farthest from. Her hate of everything and irrational liberal opinions only prove what happens to children's minds when they grow up in the 'burbs. She was wildly judgemental, which some people consider 'expressing opinions', but I got very annoyed with it after only a few pages.Through the whole book I just wanted to shout 'Get Over It Already!' at the top of my lungs."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth your pennies","review":"this book is not for freshmans only. nor high schools. this book is, as zoe puts it, 'about you'. anyone who sat in a class, feeling their mind about to explode if the clock won't move faster. and your lip being sore from biting it so hard from going through so much frustration and confusion, all so fast. basically, anyone who went to school, anyone who was 14, would sympathize in one way or the other with this book. i don't think i'm good in words, not to write a decent review for this book.all i can really say is that i stopped not twice to melt over certain sentences and paragraphs that hit me right in the stumach. not wanting them to ever fade away from my memory.buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Loathe This Book but the Prose is Decent","review":"In all truth I loathe this book with the burning passion of a thousand dying suns. Admittedly the prose is very very good and if I, at fourteen, had written a memoir it would not have been written so elegantly. The reason the book makes me cringe is just the sheer self obsession of it, the all-pervading melodrama and the masturbatory navel gazing. In short, ghastly premise, very effective execution. I'm conflicted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Hype","review":"I have to admit that while I cheer on those who champion for the underdog, this over-extended chapbook was more of a disappointment than anything else. The true talent possessed by the writer will grow with her age, wisdom, and life experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"I picked this book up at Borders without looking inside the book. The title caught my eye since I'm a freshman in HS. I haven't read the whole book yet, but I'm a little weirded out by this book. I can't relate at all to the homosexual issues and I don't really like the F word used in every sentence. It's an interesting book, but I'm not sure if I like the monotony in it. Like other's have said, I've read more interesting stuff at Livejournal and Xanga! I guess it's a good read if you don't have anything else to do..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my time and money....","review":"I have a lot of hatred directed towards this book. I know everyone is saying they might recommend this to a 16 year old, but I am 16 and I hated it. It was lazily written with no clear plot or character development; half the time I had to look on the front page to find out which person was which. Reading through this I kept thinking \\"what the heck is going on!?\\". This book is crap. It was a waste of my hard earned money (which I got back after returning the book to the store), and my time! I wasted part of my life to read about some self-absorbed, selfish brat is my age (at the time of writing). I picked up this book because I thought it would be a funny, lighthearted satire on high school life. I thought that me, being one of the social outcasts of my school, could relate to this girl, but all I saw was a self-righteous, annoying, immature little girl who doesn't deserve to have her book published.And now I've had my say, thank you. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A room with too many beautiful views.","review":"I've been reading Zoe trope's \\"please don't kill the freshman\\". Wow it was refreshing. She conjures up an image of a teenage cyndi lauper and madonna morphed together into a literary punk instead of musical, but with better lyrics. She could easily slip into the cast of Sarah, jt leroy's book, as one of the lot lizards and give another angle of hope and love in her own special way. Maybe when i was younger i used to love as many people as zoe does but now i am a bitter 30 year old who looks for the worst first instead of the best. I don't think i will ever be asked to be a best man.I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade: C-","review":"I picked up Trope's book with high expectations. I read an interview with her on a website and my curiousity was piqued. I bought the book and finished it within a few hours. It was good, but not that good. There is no plot, the meanderings are meaningless, and the vocabulary is weak.The next \\"Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" this ain't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just horrible","review":"Pretentious, self-absorbed, and very, very poor writing.

It's not great but it's not terrible. It's a teenage girl's journal, nothing more. (Actually, it's about 100 pages \\"more\\" than it needs to be, so maybe it was better as a chapbook.) I read a lot of young adult books, and this just doesn't stand out. It's not clear whether or not this girl is talented enough to become a writer, but this bland book is not a terribly auspicious debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"2-cup classic white tea pot","review":"When I received this item, it arrived with a broken lid.

Don't get me wrong, \\"Plank of Fire,\\" \\"If I'm a Man,\\" and the poppy \\"Artic Snow\\" are all really good songs and hint at the potential this band has, but the rest of the songs on this album sound too much alike and even the shorter ones seem to drone on forever. Here's hoping their next album will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn of the plastic disc.","review":"Another band that sounds like fifty others in exsistance.

In many ways it sounds like Unwritten Law, so if you like them then you will like Burning Brides. The only problem is the vocals can be hard to hear sometimes, that's why they don't have perfect score of 5 stars, other than that, this is a great album by a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of content. More of a refence book.","review":"This is NOT the book you should buy if you are looking for a concise teaching of Rhino from beginner to advance. It is more of a reference book that explores the tools of Rhino further. It more or less compliments the user guide that comes with the software.

You are better off sticking to the tutorials on the Rhino CD, or via their website."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to follow instructions a good start to Rhino","review":"Have been using this book for about 6 hours now. I notice a few ommissions in the directions, a couple of typos, too. But basicaly this is a great book. The CD comes with a demo version of Rhino 2 which allows for 25 saves. I do not know what happens after you use the 25 saves.There are good step by step instructions for making a couple of items like a VW beetle, a joystick for game control, and a telephone.

That's about it.I never knew people had such strange reactions to Anne Geddes' art before reading these reviews. The artist takes photographs largely in Australia and then has them digitally placed in flowers or butterfly suits and what-not in Auckland, New Zealand(she doesn't actually contort the babies). Perhaps some people out there aren't familiar with this technology. Also, the crazy charge that the art contained in the book will make women have uncontrollable urges to produce babies, well, that must be a personal issue I suggest taking up with a therapist. The world population is actually growing slower than expected - global population figures are being scaled back as modernization and education spread.

I love the pictures of the babies, they are beautiful and amazing. I was surprised by the nudity in it and was a bit uncomfortable with it- no matter how \\"natural\\" and innocent it may be. My 9 yr. old daughter was looking at with me and was a bit embarrassed by some of the photos. I know that the picture of the 2 & 4 yr. old kissing was to be cute and innocent, but they were naked. And the 4 children naked in mud was very different but a bit disturbing. In these days with children being exploited we need to be especially careful with childrens photos. It would be great if somehow that could be mentioned in the desciption of the book to make a more informed purchase. I will be sending the book back and replacing it with on of her other books, because I do love the baby photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all ages","review":"I recieved this book as a gift.

Not the usual kind of \\"porn\\" or even \\"kiddie porn\\", but something that would easily manipulate a woman's maternal instincts until she's almost feral. This stuff seems to be designed to make a woman ache like an untamed animal to feel a baby pushing through her birth canal and its toothless maw kneading at her nipple. But childbirth is originally for adding to the population, not just exciting a woman's most primal urges. So this kind of exploitation can be almost frightening in a whole new light.So such books only objectify babies into trophies for women to covet after - and it's already long after the womenkind decided not to be labelled just as something that makes babies anymore.

It only worked for the first 24 hours - after that, many of the lights just stopped working (it was a really cute product that our son LOVED when it was working). Friendly Company (the seller) was excellent in their customer service - paying for the return shipping and sending us a replacement light within 48 hours. However, the replacement traffic light ALSO stopped working after the first 24 hours. Quite surprising, seeing as the German manufacturer supposedly offers a THREE YEAR warranty on the toy. We aren't going to bother with a third light, as we figure it will also stop working after 24 hours.

Some of the poets I didn't know until I bought this book, so I'm grateful to Michael Lerner for introducing me to their work.

I did, however, like the background mythology and the way the rabbit behavior was animated.I'm unsure why this movie has received such rave reviews. I can only assume that it is from people who have read the book and are projecting its quality onto the screen adaptation.

I have NEVER heard of such a thing. I thought a dvd was a dvd. So if you are from the USA DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION OF THE DVD. IT WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR PLAYER. Now I am out of some money but good thing it wasn't that much or I would be mega mad.

Most people have given this movie poor rating only because they have allowed their children to watch the movie and it scared them. Does this automatically mean the movie is bad? By no means is this movie better than the book, but most of the times books are made into movies I expect them to have a life of their own. This movie succeeds in having it's own life it is able to stand up without the support of the book. What I think is when a book is made into a movie the movie has to be different for us to enjoy it. Last of all if you do have young kids don't let them watch it and if you do don't blame the movie for violence and gore. Don't try and judge an adult movie under child appropriateness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but still creepy...","review":"It was a good movie. There are 3 parts I know of that are creepy. There is a lot of blood and violence and a lot of fighting and attacks. But it's ok. The blood isn't super detailed, just enough so you know what it is. Though I think the bloodiest part is when Bigwig is caught in a snare. They animated the collie very well but the lab could use a bit of work. It's a good movie but NOT for kids.

Keep in mind that I was raised in the Roadrunner/Woody Woodpecker era, which offered nothing but mindless comic violence and guffaws, which are good, but ... I would recommend parents, especially parents these days, to watch this show with their children and talk about it afterward. It's very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grand Adventure(condensed).","review":"The best thing about this movie is that the main plotting from the novel is still there. The worst thing is that the details in the novel, the mythology, the strange word-usage, the epic scope, are all under-defined or just plain confusing to any who have not read the novel. The best advice I can give here is to read the book first. Get all the minute details and definitions down, then watch this movie as a rehash of what took place. This was one of my favorite movies as a child, but looking at it as an adult it looks too intense and violent for children. There are bloody sequences that still give me chills. There is too much information that is not explained. However, I loved the novel, and this film reminds me, albeit only slightly, why I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a favorite","review":"I saw this movie when it came out (1978). At the time, I was 7 years old. It made a definite impression on me - which is the reason I am looking to buy it now. No, most people would not consider it a movie for children, but I would rather my 9 year old son watch this than many of those silly Japanese cartoons that are so popular now. This is a remarkably well done adaptation of an incredible story, and considering the technology available at the time, very well done. While the animation itself is not the best, it really doesn't have to be to involve you in the story and pull you into the lives of its characters. Highly recommended - and afterward, you MUST read the book, if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best story ever","review":"I just finished reading the book for the eighth time, and am eagerly awaiting the release of Watership Down on DVD in March. This novel is not about rabbits. It merely uses rabbits as characters to illustrate struggles that we all undergo at one time in our lives in some way or another. It is the superbly told story of everything and everyone that has ever lived. There is something for everyone in this story. Blackberry, the smart one. Bigwig, the strong one. Fiver, the wise one. And of course, Hazel, the one to bring all their talents together to make a band of individuals that cannot fail in their mission to survive. The lessons they learn along the way about each other and themselves strike a chord of understanding and recognition in me. Every time I read the novel, I get something new out of it. You certainly would not waste your time to see what this is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks the power of the book.

She has had countless nights where she couldn't fall asleep because she would invision the head evil rabbit leering down upon her.

It is not for kids. I saw this film thinking it was a kids film and was shocked at the terrible things this showed. This film is PG not G and should have been PG-13. This film started off good with rabbits looking for a new field. If it would have ended when the rabbits good to field it would be decent. After it gets into a disturbing scenes of rabbits brudaly murdering other rabbits with there claws showing flesh and blood. It has for blood than some war films. Seeing this bloody film made my younger sister cry. Some R rated films are more kid friendly than this horrific film. Warning don't let your kids see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I does not follow the book no matter what!","review":"I loved the book. the movie did not even follow it one stinkin little bit. for staters Blackberry was not a doe and Dandelion told the stories. balackavar did not die.

It changed my images of the watership down rabbits which in my book is a horible sin. This movie is not a kids movie and will never be. The movie sickend me by the graphic nature and how un like book it was. The only reason I rated it one star becuse Kehaar, he was realy funny.

Highly recommended for adults and kids 8 and up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully done","review":"I have never seen animation this lovely. The animators, necessarily I suppose, culled some of the journey from the cartoon but kept all the good stuff -- Efrafa, the snared warren and Kehaar. My only quibble is the cartoon is actually more violent than the book -- who is Violet and why did she have to die in front of my kids? Hmmm. Other than that, the music is beautiful, the rabbit myths are visualized nicely and Hazel and friends achieve civilization before our eyes. Rabbits rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stellar, although abridged, adaptation","review":"More than typical Disney fair about fuzzy animals that learn to love and share, Watership Down is an epic tale of exile, courage, and survival wrapped in a parable of totalitarianism. Legenary Brit John Hurt voices Hazel, the brave rabbit who leads his people from doomed warren to the promised land at Watership Down. This is not your typical disney fare, blending psychedelic nightmare visions with a suprising level of gore. The world is superbly captured at the eye level and scope of the rabbits it follows. Fans of the novel will find some of the timeline of events altered, some plot points shortened, and some characters left out completely. (no Strawberry?) Otherwise, a strong film with a strong message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watership Down","review":"Is a magical journeyits just a shame that it wasnt a little longer.. like extras would be great to see Fiver and Bigwig havin a crafty Ciggy round the back of the studio.i read the book about 5 years after watchng the film which i think i watched 1st in the 80s when i was a little boy, triggering me and my brother acting out the scenes in the garden..after reading the book i think the film could have done better but also i feel that they did extremely well in keeping with the detail of the book to be squeezed into the production..what i do not like is the modern versions of watership down which is a series of adventures..the artwork ust does not live up to the Original Film.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"Greenfeld is an accomplished writer with a terrific sense of humor.

Greenfeld's human mission is 'to get loaded, go to nightclubs and f* models'.This book contains a few impressions of Asian politics (the Suharto regime in Indonesia) and of the Asian economic meltdown at te end of last century, 'a full-scale economic cataclysm ... locals saw their average income drop from $ 23 a week to $ 4.' The countries involved could't repay their foreign loans and had to turn to the IMF (see J. Stiglitz).The reason for this catastrophy was 'sentiment' among speculators, who attacked ferociously and greedily local currencies (the Thai baht dropped by 50 % overnight).But apart from these impressions, this book is mainly the story of the would-be (s)exploits of somebody who runs through Asia after his eleventh finger.I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Quiozel","review":"I have this light.

Seriously, this problem started at 11pm and it is now 12;20am and we just finshed. I am not happy about this!

Don't get me wrong, the coverage of many various Graph Theory topics is very thorough, but it seems to jump around from theory to application to much. One minute you seem to be reading a fairly detailed proof, and the next the book wants you to break out your favourite IDE and write a program, and then put on a hard-hat and pretend to be a structural engineer, all on the same page! While I think it's perfectly fine to include many applications in a book on a mathematical field full of them, I do have to wonder why the authors didn't seem to organise and mark said sections better.

If wisdom is to be found in a text, you will find it in this compendium which contains selected texts and quotations from the Bible, ancient philosophy, native American culture, Eastern religions and modern English poetry. The volume also contains illustrations that portray wisdom pictorially. As useful and inspirational as the quotations are, so also are Hickey's introductions which precede each separate set of readings and which, in my opinion, are worth the price of the book by themselves. Perhaps one day, the author will write a personal account of his own search for Wisdom.

They also letterboxed the film in a 4:3 ratio instead of showing it in its original, widescreen ratio.On top of that, the subtitle translation is not idiomatic English; there are many awkward phrases to the point of distraction. There is even a five-minute (!) advertisement preceding the main movie. It's shameless that the distributor would even put a product like this out.

Usually I feel as if I get my money's worth if there are 3 or more songs I like on a CD, but BINGO, 11 out of 12 great songs. I cannot believe how pretty their music is. It's a combination of music to dance to, fall asleep to (I mean that in a good way) and get lost in thought.

Great, great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great record","review":"I love the folksy/ western swing sound of The Ditty Bops. I first came across them while listening to Pandora. I picked up this record a couple of days later and it didn't leave my CD player for more than a month. Every song on here is solid and different.\\"Ooh La La\\" reminds me of Rasputina. It is dark and has a great talking/singing chorus and an evil, rumbling bass line.\\"There's A Girl\\" is a garagey song with a real jangly electric solo.These are just a couple of the stand-out tracks, in my mind.

Maybe they are a little musically like Nellie McKay and Regina Spektor? Country music and ragtime, and all sorts of music inspire them. The dual vocals make them almost sound like the Andrew Sisters, as on \\"Sister Kate.\\" There is a high quality of musicianship on the entire record. It is obvious that Amanda Barrett and Abby Dewald can play. They have the musical knowledge. They have history. It's fun music and not at all political. The song \\"There's A Girl\\" sounds more like paisley bands from LA. It's like a dream. This record is perfect. It's much like Pet Sounds without the killer production and the wrecking crew. It captures a band at the height of their powers. Hopefully we will see more of Abby and Amanda this year. I am a fan. I can listen to this forever. What exactly are Ditty Bops?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fun music","review":"I'm an old codger but most say that I'm open to new things including new music (even some rap). The Ditty Bops make this old man smile and dance. Can't remember when this last happened, but then I don't remember much of anything anymore. They have an original new sound for the 21st century but they are so much more than that. The lyrics make you laugh and are sung with such a whimsy indifference. They let us know the Ditty Bops are independent ladies and are not going to fit into anyone's mold, and the guys are told that these gals have \\"bigger fish to fry\\". I love the piano and banjo and never seem to want to change the CD. Hope my \\"aged\\" review doesn't harm sales.

To this effect, tracks 4 and 9 are the most similar to the Andrews Sisters signature song.The rest of the album, on the other hand, ventures between country to acoustic guitar driven 20's jazz. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as all the tracks really are quite good, you are left wishing for a few more tracks like \\"Sister Kate\\" and \\"There's A Girl\\" (tracks 4 and 9).Overall, the entire album is very upbeat, but not to the point of being annoying (ala M2M - Shades of Purple). It is very enjoyable to listen to and wil definitely brighten anyone's day."},{"rating":"2","title":"General Review","review":"Never, in my years of existence on this planet, have I heard a group as talented as The Ditty Bops.

One can only hope that this is the first of many releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shimmy With The Dittys","review":"I don't know how to describe The Ditty Bops except perhaps maybe a bit like a band you might see in those old travelling carnival shows. Full of little music interludes featuring accordians and acoustic guitars, these girls tell pain stakingly stories of death and love with the utmost sense of morbid humor.Featuring lines like \\"you can find the meaning of life in the barrel of a shotgun..\\" this is not the teenagers pop song but I love them - perhaps more because of that rather than in spite of it. I first saw the video for \\"Wishful Thinking\\" on Logo and immediately ran out and got the album. Now I can shimmy like my sister Kate as I dance with the Dittys... and so could you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some fans know no variety...","review":"I've read a couple reveiws by fans of The Dresden Dolls posted for other artists recommended with them, only one for this Ditty Bops CD I believe, but it still leaves me disheartened. Don't let a couple fans push their simplistic musical taste on you, The Ditty Bops are, much like The Dresden Dolls, a unique musical experience.If you're looking for music that is original, different, and genre-breaking or redefining, try The Ditty Bops. Their style ranges from jazzy, folk, swing, a bit of sixties rock and even country. Even if its not your cup of tea, their musical zaniness cannot be denied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Lamp","review":"Just got my lamp and it came packaged well without any damage.

I was happy to find although there was some oily residue on the glass it wiped off easy with windex glass cleaner. The base is made of metal and very sturdy and easy to assemble. It gives off good lighting but not enough to do much reading. The light is a nice warm glow perfect for my bedroom.

Sitting down to watch this movie is like embarking on a weekend holiday with a group of terrific friends. You feel the excitement as you step on the train with Gene Wilder's character, and you're off! For anyone nostalgic for the 70's, this has the clothes, the cheesy decor, the innocent sense that saying \\"dirty words\\" was naughty and funny, and of course it has Pryor and Wilder -- two of the decade's greatest icons.

They are made of cheap plastic instead of nylon. The plastic often tears away from the cloth cords, and the cords tangle easily. Added to these problems, the chute often does not fully deploy if the plastic chute is not powdered to make it less \\"sticky\\". And forget about launching in cold temperatures as the plastic has a \\"memory\\" and often fails to open in cold weather.Estes plastic parachutes, no matter what size, are a disaster to be avoided. Pay la little more money for a nylon parachute and it will last as long as the rocket.Jim Konedog Koenigp.s.

McNamara, along with others, were dubbed \\"the best and the brightest\\", but failed miserably in their estimate of the situation in Vietnam and in the execution of the war. McNamara exposes the mistakes that were made. He concluded that 3 critical elements required for success were lacking in Vietnam: a stable government; a stable economy ; and support of the war effort by the Vietnamese people. He finally realized the war effort was futile and departed the Johnson administration. Hopefully the lessons learned from his experience may assist members of government from making similar errors of judgement in the future. This book is well worth reading and lends credence to the cliche \\"hindsight is always 20/20\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"For me reading this book was a real disappointment.

That is correct. This book is yet one more attempt to evade the issue, which is, as with all wars, \\"WHY?\\" Why the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War at all, never mind issues of mismanagement and what-not? WHY was it thought to be important to prevent \\"Communist take-over\\" in Vietnam, or elsewhere in S.E. Asia for that matter, when at the same time Communist rule in, say, Yugoslavia was not seen as any sort of threat and provoked no such response? McNamara knows; he says not a word about it. There is as far as I know only one book \\"out there\\" that deals with the real issue -- \\"Why?\\" -- and that is The Tragedy of Vietnam, by Patrick J. Hearden, soon to retire as a professor of history at Purdue University.

I thought a man as smart as McNamara would finally spill the beans after all these years. However sincere his aplogies in the beginning and ends of the book, the entire read seems as if it is nothing but a complicated rationalization for the tragedy. It offers no new insights in to the decisions or the main players in the tragedy, and even the lessons i nthe end of the book seem painfully obvious (Though not always followed) to any student of foreign policy. Though McNamara undoubtedly adds some interesting footnotes to history, this book adds little to the existing literature. Halberstam's THe Best and the Brightest, Neil Sheehan's A Bright Shining Lie, Karnow's Vietnam, and Frances Fitzgerald's Fire In the Lake look better than ever.

Overall, not a bad investment for a fun film from the early days of sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timekillers from Space","review":"When I was a kid, this movie seemed to crop up at least once a month, and signalled (to me) it was time to go outside and play, no matter what time of day. Peter Graves is a scientist who dies in a plane crash but is resurrected by aliens who talk backwards and have ping-pong balls for eyes. Seems they want him to steal atomic secrets so they can grow more giant insects. Or something. Graves spends most of the picture either running through the same cave set or wearing a bathrobe and trying to convince people he's not nuts. Not bad enough to be good; just bad enough to be horribly dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big bug want-to-be","review":"No big bug collection is complete without \\"Killers from Space.\\" It might not have the stature of \\"Them!\\"\\" But the formula is there. It starts off with the narration to describe what you see, and then goes quickly into the mystery. The only thing missing is a flamethrower.Dr Douglas Marvin (Peter Graves) while at an atomic test sees something suspicious on the ground. When the pilot takes his plane closer the controls jam. The plane crashed and the pilot is burnt to a crisp. Dr. Marvin mysteriously shows up later with a scar on his chest and no memory. Where could he have been? And is it important? Only time will tell. If we have time left with Killers form space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Matinee Type Sci-Fi","review":"Peter Graves started out in old black & white Sci-fi movies & was very good at making you believe in the plot & his part in it. The \\"special effects\\" are, of course, outdated & not up to todays standards but it's still just a short fun movie that lets you get into the \\"alien invader\\" mentality that was very prevelant in the old sci-fi movies. I know the younger people today would say it's dumb & has poor special wffects, etc. but I enjoy it for what it really is...a look back at the \\"old\\" times when we did pretty good with the effects we had!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bait perfect for the MST3K crew...","review":"If you get a kick out of these kinds of movies (like me), then you will enjoy this one, which is better than most. Read other reviews for the plot highlights, but here are some details I noticed: 1) The planes dropping the nuclear bombs for tests are prop planes, while the jet fighter following to gather data flies a ve-e-e-ry slow circle of about 25 feet in diameter, 2) The call sign for the jet chase plane is \\"Tar Baby 2\\" (HOLY CATFISH!! They could NEVER get away with that today...definitly NOT politically correct...tar baby indeed...), and 3) When our hero goes to make a call on a pay phone, he drops a coin in the NICKLE slot...and I know I saw it correctly, because the pump jocky calling the police on our hero dropped a nickle also. What really cracks me up is the aliens are humanoids, but they have these big googly eyes like Cookie Monster or the South Park kids...or like zombies from even older movies...too good for words..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this, and \\"Press On\\"!","review":"Max Cleland's second book, Going for the Max - like his first, Strong at the Broken Places - is a tribute to the courage and heroic life of a great American, soldier, and public servant.

What the author did not understand, and probably never will, is that the readers are not the least interested in her life or the lives of her children or husband. I am not in any way interested in her own impressions about St Helena, I am not interested in the Island's history or geography or what others might have thought about it. It is Napoleon that concerns me and when I purchased the book I though it would be about Napoleon's journey to the Island and his last days there. Instead it was the author's journey to the island in the 90's and her own days , which does not interest me and I doubt if it would be interesting to anyone bet herself. It was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest, most readable books I have ever read.","review":"This is a beautifully written book, not in any poetic sense, but in the sense of being readable and thoroughly interesting.

The Newcomes were very messy. Rats came into the house. Tom Little decided to play a trick on Newcomes and dressed as a rat. He wanted them to set mouse traps. But the Newcomes decided to bring in a cat. The Littles were very scared and they wanted to get rid of the cat. But Tom became friends with the cat.

Conversely there is no information on the amount of the cis-resveratrol isomer, which nullifies the effect of Trans-resveratrol. Resveratrol is not an easy supplement to manufacture properly. It is subject to oxidation and degradation by UV exposure. Only one company here protects their supplement from these effects by active packaging. It is not this one.

Frey's writing is brilliant, the way he describes and tell his story is done in such a way that you can feel his every emotion as if you are going through it yourself. This book focused on Frey living a life of sobriety following a stay at rehab and time in jail. I found myself crying, laughing and most importantly rooting for James through this entire book. Frey's genuine friendship with Leonard is one of loyalty and support, the kind that is all too often a rarity in our lives.Everyone should read this book, I promise you will not be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning work","review":"I read A Million Little Pieces and immediately went shopping for My Friend Leonard.

Still pondering the incredible story.

Leonard is a very close friend that James meets while in rehab.

I loved reading it and was disappointed when it ended, just like AMLP. MFL is not as raw and grueling as AMLP could be, the subject matter is a little softer, but it offers the same emotional depth.

It was fairly boring anyway without much going on and then to think most of the book probably wasn't true........I was extremely disappointed to find that Mr. Frey had portrayed this book as being true events that actually happened to him.

I loved the book! Any book that has the ability to make me cry, let me rephrase that...sob at the end...while I am at work...is a great book!

Much of the content was superfulous and didn't add to the storyline... There were too many characters to keep track of that weren't central to the plot. He should've focused more on convincing the reader why his relationship with Leonard was so significant. To sum it up, Frey falls very short of striking the emotional chords he struck in A Million Little Pieces. Wait and take it out of the library if you really want to read it or buy my copy.

If you didn't read the fraudulent predecessor, you'd be lost--or maybe not since it's written on a third grade reading level. Frey pulled a fast one on me a few years ago. I dismissed the writing style then because I thought we were dealing with someone with a fragile state of mind. Here, there seems to be a lack of consistency. What happened to his love of reading from the first book? It changes to drawings and paintings in this book. I'm supposed to believe a struggling screenwriter turns down massive amount of money left to him from a friend that loved him like a father-and what about the strife between him and his parents? It just melts away? I just hated this book. I read it because I bought it before the scandal broke and it was the next book in my TBR pile.

He did.On a lighter note, you may find some comedic value in it. Unintentionally, of course.

In the first memoir, Leonard was a dynamic character who was full of surprises for those around him. When I learned that the sequel's title was primarily about Frey's relationship with his mentor, I knew that it would be entertaining read. I wasn't expecting the heart-wrenching fate of Lily nor the final plights of Leonard. I felt as if I knew these characters personally so I grieved right along with Frey. The raw human emotion made this story worth reading and also made this book hard for me to put down, I easily finished it in a few hours.

Tragic, that is, because we now know that those life experiences were simply fabricated by Mr. Frey.Lies are lies and should not be told.

I loved the Leonard character, although he is supposed to be some kind of gangster, James brings out a funny and soft side of him. I just couldn't get enough of Leonard. Some parts of the book tend to drag a little, my favoriate parts were when James is with Leonard and his friend Chopper.

Certainly no guy's gonna ogle that cover in a bookstore and stop and say, gee, wonder what that book's about? As for the book itself, it's just more romanticizing of Frey's gutter history.

They all gather with their father's third wife, a Frenchwoman named Odette, to hold a memorial for their late father on the fictitious Mediterranean island of Santerre.They spend the whole summer on the island, and learn a lot about each other.

There's also an introductory chapter that gives an overview of Colorado geology and geological history, as well as very clear explanations of geological terms.Driving on Colorado highways you see some pretty amazing rock formations, and visitors to the state are always asking about them. This book will tell them (and you) anything you might want to know, and explain it clearly.

You could turn the sound off and get the idea, which is that an old man whose wife has died is trying to reconcile with his estranged elder son. The younger son has been taking care of him, and of course that causes a lot of problems. The pace is extremely show -- \\"leisurely\\" if you like -- and you may lose interest if the visuals aren't enough to keep you involved. I was stationed in northern Japan in the US Air Force many years ago and the winter scenes in the local village brought back a massive amount of memories, which kept my interest more than it might yours.

I couldn't believe my eyes -- checked and double checked the manufacturer's name, part number, etc., to be sure this was real. It was. I ordered and we now absolutely love the beautiful Tiffany style lamp that sits in our library.

This should be the Y2K BIBLE. Invaluable info for people who may very well be trapped inside a large urban area. The section on \\"Roast leg of dog\\" is not, however, for the faint hearted! Most importantly, this book teaches you that true survival is NOT hunkered down in the woods, chewing on hides and eating raw snake. It shows that true survival must maintain a decent quality of life or life isn't worth it. ALL OF THIS REQUIRES FORESIGHT AND PREPARATION!!! If nothing else...this book shows you how to get ready.

Captain Easychord is feautured here in a ridiculous short version (the whole second part is missing) but the B-sides make up for it. 'Long Life Love' and 'Moodles' are quite similar, long songs which seem to be made up out of several ideas that are just stitched together. 'Moodles' is the better one, 'Long Life Love' has a breathtaking end, melody-wise. The best song here is 'Canned Candies', absolutely one of Stereolab's most moving songs ever released (and I'm a big fan) and indeed a brilliant slice of avant-pop, as someone here mentioned earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are ghosts real?

The wide subject matter is great too as in Haunted houses, it's nice to travel all around the world in these stories. Another neat thing about Robert D.

My biggest complaint about this album is that the edited-down versions of songs like \\"Waiting for the Man\\" and \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" have STILL not been restored to full-length for CD release. This has to be the fourth or fifth time this album has been put out without addressing this issue.

They then went ahead and released this album under the name The Royal Albert Hall Show.Some time later, the band members corrected the label's misconception (this is actually a show from the Oakland Coliseum) and future pressings removed the Royal Albert Hall title, and simply called this In Concert.Not sure why this particular CD is still mis-labeled as this occurred before CDs were invented.

I doubt whether those recordings still exist after four decades and numerous compilations of the band or combined with solowork from John Fogerty.

Back in the 80's extended versions of many songs were creatively lengthened into more of the same song - not some bombastic piece rendered unrecognizable. Usually it was the producer of the original album who would handle longer versions, but for the longest time now, it's contracted out to people who just want to make a name for themselves and FAILING to improve the original work. Sad. You can see it happening with cutout bin destined works recently by Dave Gahan and Martin Gore. Maybe they should make one last stab and do a Duran Duran by reforming the original 4.

After about 14 months, I walked in my office and smelled a very strange smell that was like an electronic-overheated-type smell. Turns out it was coming from this monitor. After unplugging it and letting the smell dissipate, when I turn it on, all I get is a white screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the thing -- 4 1/2 Stars","review":"Just to put my review into perspective...I'm not an uber-monitor junkie like my husband. I basically want something crisp and detailed that is a no-brainer to set-up and calibrate. Matter of fact, calibrate shouldn't even be in the converstation.This monitor is great for simple every day functions like viewing text documents, powerpoint type files, internet sites, digital pics, etc. The one thing I think it could improve upon is the clarity of the images from the satelite tv hooked up through media center. It's not near as crisp as I would've wanted. Even downloaded clips from the internet are kinda fuzzy...not necessarily pixilated, just not so sharp. DVD's that I play on the computer don't seem to have that problem, though.The price, however, worked for me. So I can live with less than stellar movie images because it's a great monitor...slim, big, and easy. Just like I like 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FLY","review":"I think this movie was very well made and the actors did a wonderful job. Vincent Price was as terrific as always.

Because I've watched the series so close together, the little nuances and questions that have been unanswered for a couple of seasons are now finally being tied together (although there's still plenty unanswered going into Season 6).This season deals with time travel, which can get confusing to some people so be ready to pay extra close attention to the little stuff to get the full effect of it. Despite several people having told me that season 5 was not up to par when they saw it on TV, I think the show is as strong as ever with this season and am looking forward to starting season 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"I am one of those LOST fans who never really wavered during the season 2-3 slowdown...to me this show's always been amazing from beginning to end (Well almost end). Of course some aspects of the story have been more interesting than others, but that only makes the intense times all that much better. The reality is that LOST has never been bad and the parts people complain about are only less than stellar in comparison with the amazing heights of this creative and engrossing show has achieved.With that said, season 5 is LOST at it's most compelling...a true benchmark that I wish more shows would even try to aspire to...bravo!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Loop Conundrum","review":"This season is a good season.

Why change it now? Two seasons to the end? Was it REALLY necessary? BE AWARE, this box set does not have that vivid plastic box glove that made this series to be the most beautiful on the shelf. It comes in that cheap low-quality small-cost old-looking cardboard box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound quality not great","review":"I am, like many others, hooked on this series and was really psyched to get this set when it came out. I'd never seen any of the episodes before, and I found the story in season 5 to be interesting enough. However, I found that the sound was screwy. I have a young child who sleeps close to where I watch movies and I have to turn the tv way down so she won't wake up. Sometimes, this works. But mostly, I find that I have to fiddle with the volume on my remote constantly. It is such a pain in the rear to have to constantly dial down and up to keep up with the impossibly quiet moments and the crazy-loud moments. sheesh.The packaging is different this season than the previous four. Gone is the plastic slipcover and pamphlet inserts, and in place is a sleek case with the episode list written on the back. So much neater and less wasteful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Season 5 Best Yet!","review":"I have been a loyal LOST fan since the beginning, and I must say I think Season 5 will go down as the best season as a whole of all the seasons put together. True, there are still more seasons too go, but I really can't see how the writers & producers could do much better. I hope I am wrong, but I think Lost has hit its peak with Season 5. If you stopped watching lost for any reason this season, pre-order the DVD set for the December 2009 holiday season, and get lost again. This season (Non-Specific Basic Overall Plot Spoiler Now!!!) is very well focused and fine tuned on just a few familiar classic characters with an general emphasis on time-travel so you won't have a problem getting back into the action. Then again, you might get intellectually lost with some profound thought experiences following the drama. What a great show! That is all I will say about season 5. Go get lost again, and pre-order Lost Season 5 for a great price on amazon.com. I will..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I recently purchased the series #5 Lost.

Season 5 has a lot of intensity, and is at least as good as Season 4. The story is picking up speed, revealing a lot more pieces of the puzzle, and putting a lot of those pieces into place. There are so many pieces now, though, that the story is very complex, on a par with \\"Twin Peaks\\", so it does not lend itself to casual viewing. In fact, as I watched I felt as though I should be taking notes. I never did, but I paid very close attention. The science fiction elements are front and center in this season, and a lot of fun. The characters also have a lot to do and a lot of difficult choices to make, so it's great to watch them. I'm very glad I did not give up on this show when it looked like it was going downhill in Season 3. If you enjoyed Seasons 1 and 4, then you should also enjoy Season 5.

The focus is primarily on using it as a Java IDE, both in general and in the context of Agile development.Weighing it at 300 pages--instead of 1300 pages, it's a book that you can actually read cover to cover and use as a reference.I've already recommended to people that I work with and they've been very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"topics are discussed too abstractly - can't find source code. book skips too many steps to be useful. might be good for experienced developers. not useful to me. wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth 29.99...","review":"grand master zhang is an amazing martial artist but this video is terrible. it teaches 10 spring leg only and cuts off offense after 3. there is not 50 minutes worth of learing techniques on this mayhaps about...25-30 mintues. it was very cheaply done, it didnt do her any justice. i would not recommend this to anyone...unless it was under $5."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Buzzcocks addict\\"","review":"First heard Buzzcocks in London many yrs ago, and have been into their sound ever since. Their image, for me, is totally attached to punk movement -- as it's main symbol. All songs sound so \\"instinctive\\" and classic at the same time than when you first hear them it feels as if you had already been done it many times before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band, great songs.","review":"The Buzzcocks are a great band, orgasim attict is the best of all the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly remastered, poor quality audio","review":"This CD has extremely poor audio quality, this is the worst remastered CD I ever bought. Buy their other CDs, not this shoddy compilation. I can't understand how they botched this so badly since their other CDs sound great. The content is first-rate, but this CD is an insult to the Buzzcocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The birth of POP-PUNK","review":"This is like the very first pop punk band ever.I love this album.My personal fave is \\"Ever Fallen in Love?\\"My dad and I both think that \\"Orgasim Adict\\" is a very hilarious song!But other than that, the whole record has a catchy beat.Some songs aren't that great but it's still a good record.But Never Mind the Bollocks kicks it's ass (sorry all you hardcore Buzzcocks fans!)So thus, I give it..4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this version and buy the import...","review":"This is a splendid collection of songs, simply one of the greatest punk rock albums ever made. BUT...as previously noted here, the mastering on this CD is pathetically tinny, as bad as I have ever heard a CD sound, and will sound like dreck on anything but the most pathetic boom box. I found it unlistenable, but fortunately the CD has been reissued in Britain with good booming sound. That import is available on Amazon, and should be purchased instead, so you can here these gems in their full five-star glory."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],R={key:0},L={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",H,[(i(!0),a(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(i(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),a("span",L,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",R,"See more"))],8,C)):v("",!0)])}const W=d(N,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-c97bfb5f"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/20.md","filePath":"library/20.md"}'),M={name:"library/20.md"},j=Object.assign(M,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
