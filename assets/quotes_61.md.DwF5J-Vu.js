We gave one of these books to a man in a nursing home, and he was delighted. By showing the clothing, homes, animals, and backgrounds, etc. we get a picture of life as it was in Bible times. The stories are true to Scripture. The book makes a thoughtful gift. We keep buying them and giving them away, now that our two sons are grown."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it","review":"I found an old used copy of this Picture Bible years ago and gave it to my son. He absolutely loves it! He read it over and over and it started falling apart. He begged me to buy a new one. He is 13 and still loves to read it. He often reads it in bed before going to sleep and he will also take it with him to the Perpetual Adoration Chapel to read. Of course, it is not the only version of the Bible that he reads.This book is written like a graphic novel, so there are more pictures than there are words, and not every Bible story is represented, but it is nicely done and gets the stories across. It is a great introduction to getting your kids to read the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture Bible","review":"This picture Bible is written in the comic strip method.

The pictures aren't the best quality but to me it makes it seem like an old time comic book.I also lent this out to a child (he is about 9 years old) and he really liked it, and then he suggested it to another boy who lent it, and then an other, and so on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how I still picture Bible characters.","review":"Throughout our elementary school years, my sister and I did our nightly \\"devotions\\" using this comic book Bible. Though I'm now 29 years old, I still imagine all the events in the Bible just the way this comic book portrays them.My own young children have been given many Bible story books, but most of them focus only on the cute, feel-good stories such as Noah's ark, baby Moses floating in the reed basket, and baby Jesus in the manger. The Picture Bible, on the other hand, contains a much broader story selection, even some more graphic drawings, such as Goliath being slain by David. (Don't worry, it's not TOO graphic.)There's only one problem with this \\"Bible:\\" The characters look quite caucasian. The drawings are probably not ethnically accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little out of date","review":"This is a really good way to expose children to the Bible. However, I would suggest getting The Action Bible instead, if you can afford the price difference. It is generally the same text word for word (some of the text has been updated, but it's mostly identical), and the art work is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, action-packed intro to Bible for new believers & young readers","review":"I read parts of this when I was 8, and was totally fascinated with the Old Testament stories. When I became a Christian 11 years later, this was the first \\"Bible\\" I read through. To this day, all the stories are vivid in my mind, and it has helped me to bring to life the same stories when I read the real texts. I bought this Bible for my daughter, and she has been glued to it for days. We also had a copy before she was reading, and she just loved to look at the pictures and ask questions. This is a great book to read to familiarize yourself with many of the Bible's stories and history. Great for new believers and young readers. It is not word-for-word with the Bible, and does take a little dramatic license here and there, but overall it's pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture Bible","review":"This Bible was given to my son when he was about 8 and he could not stop reading it. The fact that it is a comic encourages children to read it. It sticks so closely to the Written Bible that it is the perfect Bible to give any child.

It tells the Bible stories from the creation in Genesis to the prophecies in Revelations. My copy is dog eared because I have read it cover to cover with each of my children. All have enjoyed it. My oldest is an Agnostic and has gone on to analyzing more advanced religeous topics. My middle one is a true believer and likes to tell everyone about Abraham and his other impressive ancestors. I am still reading it to my youngest. He makes sound effects to dramatize the Old Testament Miracles.

If you haven't read it, I HIGHLY recommend it--whether or not you're a kid. Beautiful illustrations, all of the major Bible stories in chronological order, and totally accessible. If you're somebody who's wanted to know what's in the Bible without having to read through the whole tome or deal with translation notes and some random guy's commentary on what it's all supposed to mean, this is probably a good fit for you. And even if you think you know the Bible cover-to-cover, you'll still get something out of reading it like this. Plus, it's inexpensive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good educational resource for children, including young teen","review":"I bought the older versions as gifts for my sons and others.

The Action Bible is an updated version of the Picture Bible. The text is extremely similar, but the drawings are not. The illustrations in the Action Bible were drawn by Sergio Cariello who has worked for Marvel Comics and DC Comics. I have a copy of both books. The illustrations in the Action Bible are far superior to the Picture Bible. There is no comparision. Buy the Action Bible. It is awesome.

I find her reading this all the time. She loves the realistic cartoon format (similar to the Prince Valiant newspaper comic, for those of you who remember). It really brings life to all of the bible stories. In the table of contents, the stories are each named and grouped by Bible book in order. Also there is a small but usefull time line at the bottom of the table of contents. Under each story title are the corresponding Bible verses. And like Prince Valiant, it's mostly dialogue, very little commentary.

I am a great fan of Shakespeare's \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\", and have many different film versions of it. This version sounded like a combination of the classic comedy tale by William S. and a bit of the old naughty. Well, it did have some naughty - simulated sex with a small bit of T and A. But where the Puck was Shakespeare?This type of adult movie is pretty much out-of-date. It is soft porn, or R-rated, with a few OK-looking women topless. The ONLY reference I could find to \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" was that Justine SLEPT, and had sexy DREAMS.Plus the movie made no sense. There was no continuity of the various scenes. It was just a crappy script created as an excuse to film naked women."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You gotta have a swine to show you where the truffles are.\\"","review":"This was Albee's first three-act play. It was also made into a film with Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis. A cocktail party given by an unsuccessful history professor (George) and his wife (Martha) for a new instructor (Nick) with his wife (Honey) turns into a long session of arguments, verbal abuse, revelations, and catharsis. There are several references to George and Martha's 21-year-old son who we later discover to be nonexistent. The younger couple, who are having a child, turn out to have a sterile marriage as well, albeit for different reasons. This play won the 1962-1963 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. This play is filled with great dialogue: witticisms, verbal abuse, sorrow, and even compassion. It is easily one of the top dramas of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the acting edition","review":"This edition is not the one used by theaters. I don't know why but it is condensed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shattering and affecting.","review":"If there has ever been a play as theatrical, dramatic, and attention-grabbing as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, I have yet to read or see it. This play never fades even as it moves into Act Three and pushes 250 pages.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is the story of a couple (George and Martha) fighting reality and its implications. Their need for each other grows along with their ostensible mutual contempt. All this is brought out over the course of one late-night get-together with a younger couple whose presence catalyzes the shattering and inevitable conclusions that George and Martha must come to.This play is monumentally important, while managing to keep a crisp sense of humor and pacing. Everyone should read this fabulous play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Edition","review":"I love this play, and I wanted to do a cutting from it as a duo in speech competition. Though I ordered the copy shown, I got a new, updated edition from the Broadway revival, which was fine enough, but had changes in the scene I was planning on doing.

Do not under any circumstances go to see it done without first knowing what it is about. It painful to watch because the characters scream and fight continuously with each other from the first 30 seconds of the show which equals 3 straight hours of agony.I'm certain that it takes incredible acting ability to star in this show, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief.

The basic premise of the play is that two couples go to one of their houses after a faculty party to continue drinking into the morning, but the bulk of the play is in heated, often violent argument. I don't want to give any detail on the action as to spoil it, but it's the type of play that leaves you uncomfortable hours after you're through after every act."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Roman book for Goreans","review":"I picked this up without expecting too much... it was the find of the year, easily.

This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. Boring introspection of demented southern belles and feminist wanna-be's. There is no innovative prose in this book, and almost no plot. The stories are mostly about one person, Rhoda, but the tone of the protagonist changes constantly. It seems like a desperate attempt on Gilchrist's part to put together a full length book. A failure for America."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"This book will only be useful to you if you already know about lattices and complementarity. It will not be useful to you at all if you are trying to learn about them. Most of the proofs are unclear and often are incorrectly referenced.

One of my favorites is \\"The Heat is on\\". Great anywhere, anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant dance CD","review":"This CD provides a brilliant mix of Dance music, but prefering this style, I am biased towards La Bouche.

For story and entertainment value, I'd give it one. My husband and I listened to this book on a car trip. Both of us are fans of John LeCarre whose latest book was similarly about Swiss involvement with the Nazis. But what a difference. Silva's book is boring and repetitious. The characters are wooden. There is NO tension. The plot is so obvious. Too many murders, too. We have the equivalent of about 75 pages left to listen to and neither of us can work up the energy to turn it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Swiss Background","review":"I have always looked at Switzerland as a land of mountains with great ski slopes. Seems Mr. Silva has brought out more than that in this great Novel. To have tied in the Stolen Art by the Nazis Along with the mode of operation by the Swiss with the secret accounts and their silent operations surely kept my mind working overtime. The suspense of all from beginning to end made for a great novel. I highly reccommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first Silva experience ... but not the last","review":"This was the first novel that I read by Daniel Silva, just picking it up because a friend had recommeneded that I read Silva and I needed something to read on a couple of flights last week. Anyway, this was a good pick. Very absorbing read with several interesting dynamics at play; art thievery, Nazis and laundered money, secretive Swiss bankers, an Israeli spy network, the canals of Venice, a beautiful young violinist recuperating from a possibly career-ending hand injury... and the English Assassin that is referenced in the book title. But, as Silva fans will know, the main character is art restorer/spy Gabriel Allon. This is not the first novel to feature Allon, so of course now I need to go back and read the first one, and the others in the series. Silva is a talented author, one that knows how to give you a page-turning story, filled with history and characters that you care about. I'll be reading more."},{"rating":"1","title":"English Assassin","review":"These authors are too intent on leaving their endings to create another follow-up.. and thus their endings are too often anti-climatic! When the main character does NOT really kick ass and really destroy their villain opponent in a very graphic way...then it makes it so unbalanced... it seems the hero goes through so damn much...

I've done a lot of research into the politics and history of the Jewish people, Israel, Europe and the Middle East, and Silva's research is impeccable. His writing, too, is delicious - he has a way of painting a brilliant, detailed visual scene without bogging down his narrative, and that's a gift I wish more writers had. I haven't finished the English Assassin yet, but it delves into some of the most embarrassing truths about even \\"neutral\\" European nations' involvement in the theft of Jewish treasures during the Nazi era.

It's well-written and it's a page-turner. But, I wish Silva would keep his main character out of romances because they are not believable. I was told that, all of a sudden, he had feelings for Anna, but I saw no evidence of this in the book. They got closer due to circumstances, but I saw a bond of kinship, at best. Anna Rolfe is basically a female Gabriel Allon so a feeling of sympatico between them is understandable, but I didn't feel romantic vibes coming from them at all.Since the author doesn't seem particularly strong at writing such relationships, he should probably leave them alone. As it is, they are very weak tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average thriller","review":"If you like real spy novels like Le Carre or Littel skip this novel.

Just like his first novel, \\"The Kill Artist\\", it demonstrates his unparallel ability to pace the action smoothly. It peaks at exactly the right moments and levels out when it should, much like the Anna's skillful expertise with the Guarneri. The characters are scultped with precision and style and in particular, Mr. Allon's profile reveals pain, angst, and above all, mystery. It is precisely these qualities that have made me want to read more. Immediately after I read the last page, I wanted to jump to my feet, clap my hands, and shout, \\"Bravissimo\\" for a wonderful performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The English Assasian","review":"Dan Silva's rich writing style and well researched topics are evident in this exciting thriller with protagonist Gabriel Allon."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 star thriller","review":"See storyline above.Daniel Silva's latest brings back the art restorer/Israeli spy Gabriel Allon. It will leave little to be desired when it comes to international intrigue.This time Gabriel ends up trying to find stolen paintings that were taken from the Jews during WW2. With the help of a rather accident prone pianist named Anna Rolfe, Gabriel treks all across Europe searching for these elusive paintings while avoiding assassins and the Swiss secret service. Secret documents and secret councils are just some of the surprises in this fast-paced international spy thriller. Silva paints a rather dark picture when it comes to Switzerland and their possible involvement with the Nazis and stolen treasures. A well researched novel with an ending that wasn't totally satisfying.Daniel Silva is definitely one of the top thriller writers. Keep it up.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled Again","review":"I have real hot/cold feelings about Silva's work, either really enjoying (\\"Unlikely Spy\\", \\"Kill Artist\\") or hating (\\"The Marching Season\\", \\"Mark of the Assassin\\") each of his books. But I really believed in the potential of the new cast of characters introduced in \\"The Kill Artist\\", which was a very enjoyable quick read.Unfortunately, the author was unable to keep momentum with this by-the-numbers sequel, where this interesting cast is forced to sleepwalk through the same old throwaway spy novel plot conventions. The entire book feels forced, either by the publisher's desire to pump out a quick follow-up or by the author's zeal to expose what an awful world neighbor Switzerland really is.Whatever the motivation, I found myself sleepwalking through to the end of this one as quickly as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer!!","review":"I've read Silva's later books and they are exceptional, esp. Moscow Rules and The Defector. The earlier books were also excellent, too. This book, however, just died about 3/4 of the way through--and the last chapter??? What the heck???? How'd the Englishman bypass all the security? Why didn't his boss do more than chew him out, and have him killed, for not completing his assignment? What a disappointment.Although this book is a let down, please read his later books. What a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better Than Average Action Novel","review":"My first Silva book, The English Assasin was recommended by a friend. The concept of an Israeli hit man doubling as an art restorer was intriguing, and the book lived up to my expectations. The story moved quickly, there was plenty of action and at least a little to be learned about Swiss banking and its role in WWII. It was also believable and generally well written. Based on this experience, I am sure I will tackle another Silva offering in the not far distant future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Thrilling","review":"I expect at least a few edge-of-the-seat moments from this type of book, but there were none.

I read the reviews and everyone had high marks but I thought the book was a little dimensionally limited in that the story was very simple with no twists and the back stories which were part of the characterizations were somewhat shallow. The book is filled with action and if you like that stuff, this is a good read. I think I am more inclined towards long adventure or historical novels so I may not be the best reviewer of this type of book. Overall, it was ok but I will not get another of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a non climatic ending. Booo.","review":"It is a mystery to me how such an excellent writer as Silva obviously is could write such a interesting story and then put the whole thing into the tank with an unbelievably bad ending.

This text treats the distinction between basic and applied research in a much too black-and-white fashion, free from the various nuances that actually exist in real applications. Instead, we mostly learned from The Handbook of Applied Cognition (edited by Durso) and found it to be much more adequate and cover each of the chapters from this book and then some. However, this book came with a much greater price tag (around $200).Bottom line: If you want a basic broad brush covering of some topics that you will find in any basic cognitive book, with some sprinklings of application to the real world, then this book is probably sufficient. However, if you are wanting an in-depth coverage of these topics with a wide variety of perspectives from people in applied fields, then you need to seek greener pastures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing","review":"I bought this product several years ago from their website.

However, I found that I couldn't get into the book enough to identify or sympathise with any of the characters.The book seems to revolve around the various moral and ethical dilemnas which each character faces - to tell the truth, to have an affair etc. The book, however, reaches an almost \\"Hollywood ending\\" though as everyone's problems are conveniently solved at the end without giving a second thought to the negative aspects of those problems.Therefore, I would say that this book makes a good read for a rainy weekend or a long flight, but that's it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've read one, you've read them all","review":"It is one of his better ones, and the entertaining escape I was in the mood for.

Then he is called on to defend his son's mother on the charges of murder and to wage a war to keep his family together and his private life private.This book is a courtroom thriller, with the reader turning the pages to find out what happens to Mary Carelli, Christopher's client, former lover and the mother of his son.But what makes the reader care so much is the vibrant, real characters of Christopher and Carlo Paget, and of Terresa Peralta, Chrstopher's co-cousel on the case. These are real people, with real joys and hurts and confusion. As readers, we care about them.At it's apex, the story shows us a man fighting to keep his family and his reality together in a case that is spinning out of control.While the plot and the court action keep our interest, it is the characters and our interest in them that keep the pages turning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Degree of Guilt","review":"Patterson is a very talented writer. I always love his books. They give you a good look at what happens in a courtroom, and the minds of all the characters. His books are always a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Courtroom Drama","review":"This is one of the best courtroom dramas I've read and my first Richard North Patterson book. This book has it all and Patterson has skyrocketed to the top of my favorite mass market authors. It's a long book but in it, Patterson structures a very complex plot with authentic characters. Just when you think you have a handle on things, Patterson peels off another layer of plot to confound you again -- and to keep you reading. You kinda know how it's all going to end -- and it ends the way you think -- but to get there you will go through numerous, well-executed plot twists. The book is never boring and you'd be surprised how fast you can go through an almost-700-page tome. Patterson poured a lot into this book and is to be complimented for the way he avoids cheap fictional devices and serendipitous coincidences so often employed by lesser writers. It's a solid book in every respect and I now look forward to reading his other offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Search For Truth","review":"I recently completed this witer\\"s newest work, Exile, and wanted to back and read some of his earliest work. The book is well thought out and its characters are extremely well developed. In many ways, I found similarities to his recently published work. In both cases, one finds an idealistic attotney who takes a case that is high profile in nature with little upside existing for him. He is a staunch defender of finding the truth, even it will lead to personal harm or harm to the case that is being tried. This book also features a strong woman who is extrmely well developed. The cortroom scenes are compelling and this makes for an exceptionally satisfying read. The only flaws are in his idealistic appproach, yet these are minor when the totality of this work is taken into account."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: OBVIOUS","review":"I liked RP's book, Against all Enemies and would HIGHLY recommend it...But I really do NOT recommend this one.

However, none of the rest have been as thrilling as Degree of Guilt. I've also read \\"Eyes of a Child\\" and considering that it is a sequel, it is effective in that the reader is still held to each of the characters instead of losing that interaction as a result of boredom. However, there should definitely no be another sequel to this.

Scary to think that colleges pass this blunderation on to students."},{"rating":"1","title":"This would be a great shorter article","review":"This is a good treatment of the rules of the new economy although the author tends to let enthusiasm get in the way of a careful writing style. I wish there were a few less cliches. The rules are changing for internet based providers and therefore for all economic units in society. The author may believe that the rules are changing more rapidly than other observers. I tend to think that Michael Murphy's book on technology based stock analysis covers a lot of the same ground and in a more effective manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author plagiarized content","review":"I was quoted in the book - yet I've never talked to the author. What he quoted was misquoted and to say the least, he took serious liberties. He lifted everything myself and a coworker said from a San Jose Mercury Newspaper article about the opening of an In-N-Out Burger, nowhere does he credit the Mercury News. What he plagiarized was twisted for his own use and not accurate to the newspaper article. He goes as far as to imply that I was standing in line with him and sitting with him eating a burger and having a chat with him. What a crock - I wasn't even in the same place he claims he is at.I have not read the rest of his book. Knowing he plagiarized the Mercury News with zero credit, twisted those quotes and implied he and I knew each other in the space of a paragraph and a half convinced me I have no reason to read this book. In my opinion the author was out to make a fast buck by regurgitating other people's work. In a nutshell this is grammatical vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential, but only a draft of what it could have been","review":"There were several intriguing points in the book \\"The Friction Free Economy,\\" but none of the points were developed, supported or sufficiently documented. Lewis is an academic who presumably knows better; I think that he wrote this after long days at work, and it was never edited. The last two chapters are only a repeat of the first part of the book. I would recommend Grove's \\"Only the Paranoid Survive,\\" Moschella's \\"Waves of Power,\\" or Yoffie's \\"Competing in the Age of Digital Convergence\\" before this title- or Tapscott's \\"Digital Economy.\\" Lewis just leaves you scratching your head, looking for the guts behind the fluff.

Read those if you want some in-depth analysis. I just want to give my opinion of this book.Lawrence Goodwyn's The Populist Moment (1978) is a very well written book that takes a revisionist approach to the study of populism and protests in America in the late nineteenth century. The main things that are focused on are the agrarian revolt by farmers and, on the whole, the idea that Americans really have less democracy than they think they have. This is even more true today than it was in the late nineteenth century. American commerce was working against the American worker. Economic depressions during the 1870s and 1890s contributed to the populist movement. Also discussed is the quest for a national monetary standard. Many other topics are discussed as well.All in all, a very good read and a thorough analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Wish (very light)","review":"This movie was overhyped and overrated. Despite the superb acting by the renoun Michael Caine I thought the movie was quite dull and boring. The storyline was silly and the screenplay was not well written and didn't make sense with the events that transpired like why was the victim being targeted in the first place? The pace was plodding and there was very little action which made it overall a big disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Caine, Routine Crime Drama","review":"It is a routine film about an old pensioner dusted off his old gunto revenge his old mate's brutal death.If you are interested in gritty social drama about troubled familiesliving in low-income housing estate in UK, watch Andrea Arnold'sRed Road or Fish Tank.The only redeeming value in this film is Michael Caine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clint Eastwood on qualuudes.","review":"Imagine Clint on qualuudes.

Now if we all just gave the good ol' law-abiding people some more guns, then maybe we could get rid of the scum. I hate this film as much as I hated the Jodie Foster revenge-thriller \\"The One\\", cause it doesn't wanna tell a story about real people, it just wants to entertain and shock! And that just leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. The whole thing starts out pretty decent, but quickly turns totally absurd and unbelievable. Don't fool yourself and think this is a \\"real\\" movie - go get the horror/terrorfilm \\"Eden Lake\\" instead - at least that movie didn't pretend to be something it wasn't.

If you like watching Michael Caine bumble around like Mr. Magoo (with guns and drug dealers and \\"hoodies\\" - oh, my) then watching him cry, A LOT (in his living room, in the shower, on the street), you should own this movie. Otherwise you should buy it only to burn it.

To Compare Caine to Clint or say Caine is better would be crazy.The movie says a lot about How bad London has it and what The English Police's Priorites(Bobbies,Really? and Mind you Having a Hand gun in this country is hard) despite all these nanny state laws there still is violence as evident in the movie and In Real Life.

I had just finished a very good but intense book at that time and in retrospect was not ready for another one. I am glad I gave this book a second chance. Krueger weaves a great tale of suspense and intrigue. I had some ideas as to what was going on and who the bad guys were, but did get some fun surprises. If you have not read this book, then stop here. I was very sad that he killed off Molly, or appeared too anyway. I have not read his next book yet but read the blurb in the back of Iron Lake and am hoping that Molly survived. I am sure she did not but I thought that would have been a good avenue to pursue. His interactions between his characters are very real and the reactions he has them portray are realistic and emotional. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This is the first book I read by Mr. Krueger and after a superb start I had to abandon it a third of the way through. He has all the potential to be amongst the best but find that he gets eternally bogged down in details that have nothing to do with the novel. On the one hand he goes on an on about Native American politics but what I found most unnerving was an endless digression when the main character finds out his wife is cheating on him - really has nothing to do with the core story yet the author prattles endlessly about his self pity and immature behavior.

The characters are fantastic and are well developed. It is interesting to note that Krueger was able to write an intriguing and true to life story of a multifaceted and troubled marriage.

With a new album of NEW material selling close to a million copies worldwide already, \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" is one of the finest albums of 2005.

It gives short, detailed preps to various coding areas (linear, cyclic, convolutional).

Filled with detailed personal accounts of Walt's involvement with various productions.I have no problem with this \\"unofficial\\" biography, one which portrays a less-than-stellar account of Disney's attitudes, while giving full credit for his creative achievements, but I tend to question Mosley's tendency to parphrase conversations and qoute them as verbatim. More explicit citings of his sources (who told him what stories) would lend more credence to Mosley's \\"story-telling\\" narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched","review":"Poorly researched. Several errors put me on my guard that the author was not interested in giving a well balanced look at the life and times of Walt Disney, but instead something that would sell books. Much of the book seems more fiction than biography. He tries to turn a nervous breakdown into a suicide attempt, tries to paint him as a terrible father and unloving husband, and worse, the dialogues he makes up throughout the book between Walt and Roy, or Walt and his family are strange at best. I won't even go into the obsession the author has with Disney being frozen somewhere. Disney was a complicated man with faults as well as traces of genius. This book is not complicated and has more faults and no intelligence at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the Mouse","review":"I liked getting a glimpse of the man behind the \\"imperium of Mickey Mouse\\".

It also helped me better understand why the \\"controversial\\" rights granted by the Second Amendment were included in such a short, sacred list, and why it too must be preserved.Mr. Levy is a consummate expert on the subject and an entertaining writer.

I am, however, a flight simulator enthusiast (X-Plane for Mac to be precise) and as computers and software become more powerful and realistic, a proper flight manual begins to look like an asset instead of a luxury.A book purchase such as this will hinge directly on your level of commitment to realistic flying. If you are flying planes in the real world, then a book like this will be necessary to pass any skill tests needed by the FAA.As X-Plane attempts to recreate the actual experience and physics of flying, then this manual compliments it quite well. The documentation that comes with the sim doesn't really address the nuts and bolts of flying, so if you are a hard-bitten flight sim player, then pick this book up to increase your skill level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laser Toner","review":"I ordered a NuKote toner cartridge as shown on Amazon.

Then I visited Dr. Burns' website, read through the primers, and thought, \\"Hey!

But SOME of the singing on here is NOT Karen, it's a soundalike vocalist they used to create (or repair) tracks for this release.

I do know they found someone to work with Richard on this in Hollywood (much like the last Michael Jackson record, finished with a soundalike, but the fans caught it.)

If you had never seen the Carpenters live, this gives you an idea of what they were like with thousands of fans in the audience.

Sam Waterston in the significant ending scene says, \\"The son-of-a b. better stay dead\\".I bought the VHS for my sister on her birthday. That entire favorite part was cut out of the video.

Minor mistake. This movie made me smile a few times but that's about all. Everything is too predictable and the many of the characters are so clichéd and cartoonish that they aren't believable. I never felt drawn in and there wasn't any real tension to make the comedy work.The alternate sound track that takes out the occasional swear word and the lack of violence or sex makes it a light movie that a family with small children could enjoy. Small children won't be bothered by the major plot flaws at the end.I'm not sorry I saw it, but there's no reason to watch it again.

Indignant at the insult, Miles' new life objective is to wreak revenge against his boss and negotiate a golden parachute into retirement. Assisting him wholeheartedly is his much smarter paramour Glenda Jackson. A former work associate played by Sam Waterston also assists Miles, albeit passively.

Predictably, the agency is after him trying to kill him which explains all the comedy that follows.It's a good Matthau performance because he wasn't completely grumpy back in 1980 but he playe a terrible script.The lesson we and our kids should learn from this movie is this: do seek to work for the government as a spook but, if your boss is not nice and kind to you then expose all the bad spook work.

Staying one step ahead, Matthau & Jackson foil Beatty and the CIA and Herbert Lom and the KGB, who are trying to keep Matthau from writing an expose about the CIA's operations.What a treat!

Rather than go quietly into the night, he decides to get even. He decides to get even by writing a tell-all expose of his boss Ned Beatty. Sam Waterson plays Miles's protege and reluctant pursuer. The plot is not perfect and the direction is a little sloppy. However, everybody is having so much fun; it doesn't matter. Matthau and Glenda Jackson are at their witty best. The great Ned Beatty is perfect as the boss. He is not so much stupid as bull-headed. Waterston is great as the bemused, reluctant pursuer. The locales are good. The funniest setup is when Miles is secretly renting his ex-boss's summer home and Miles forces a fake shoot out. Hilarious.Furthermore, Miles loves Mozart.

Badly placed sentence breaks! ...and more!! There was no editing of the final eVersion whatsoever! It was an extremely bad conversion from print to digital.

Although this DVD is labeled \\"widescreen\\" in the description on Amazon, it actually shows less of the original movie than the cropped full screen version.

It was a chance to get a glimpse into the hippie sub culture and also showed me valuable insights into the history of the 1960's. These movies were NOT 'pro-drug' and showed how there was so much more to the counter culture movement then just hedonistic drug use. It actually was about so much more.

In describing Man's struggles with both the racist society that attempts to strip him of his dignity and his own inner demons, the author demonstrates his mastery of a rich and poetic prose style that is steeped in the sound and imagery of the blues.

Hands down!","review":"2000 was a banner year for progressive metal with spectacular releases from Pain of Salvation, Symphony X, and Spiral Architect. Ark, however, delivered the best album in years with their self-titled debut. This is Tore Ostby's best guitar work since Conception's \\"In Your Multitude\\", heavy and stylish. Jorn Lande's emotive Coverdale-like vocals fit perfectly and add charisma. Most impressively, John Macaluso provides some of the most complex polyrhythms you'll ever hear (certainly not from his work with Malmsteen or TNT). He is brilliant. This is a must have for all drummers. The songwriting is excellent and the arrangements are intricate. \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" should be a classic with its flamenco guitar, accordian, and piano lending atmosphere to the crunching central melody. With virtuosity, technicality, emotion, and melody this unfortunately poorly marketed CD shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Burn the Sun instead of this one","review":"I'm a big fan of prog/metal and neo-classical. I found out about ARK by accident surfing around. I listened to the bytes of Burn The Sun and bought it. It really rocks and the musicianship on it is fantastic. So I figured their debut to be at least as good. I find that typically bands debut's are their best albums, since the all want to come out kicking butt. Not so with ARK.

But what concerns me more than anything else is a fundamental problem with the book and the recipes: bake sale items do not have their contents labeled--thus the use of nuts within an item (a frequent occurence in this book) presents a potential problem for consumers.

But you should be aware the since there are no supporting beams for the bottles, certain bottle types like the bottles typical of chardonnay with the longer neck can easily fall through and break on bottle below it. I more or less solved this by restricting these kinds of bottles to the bottom rack only with some soft cardboard beneath in case one does fall (its about 3 inches high at the bottom rack, so any hard floor might break it in a fall).

I've noticed a trend lately with foreign-made wood and faux wood furniture - they use screws designed for a hex wrench, which is supplied with the product. I suppose the point of this is so that the buyer doesn't need to own any tools to complete the assembly. Unfortunately, with this product, the holes for the screws were drilled a bit too small, making it a serious effort to screw in the screws with the dinky hex wrench they throw in the box. You need more leverage than that wrench can provide to drive these screws. I was actually beginning to strip the screw heads with the supplied wrench. Luckily, I was able to use a hex head on a socket wrench out of the 'ole tool box to complete the job.Once assembled, it is very nice looking, solid, etc. - does the job at a good price.

I definitely fell in the miss category as the product I received did not roll smoothly at all. Being an engineer, I examined it (after all, how complex can a rolling pin be?) and found that the handle is somehow fitted eccentrically to the marble. The result is that instead of a smooth motion, the rolling pin rolls a few inches and then binds and locks up so the handles do not spin freely. I immediately contacted Amazon to return this product.It was an OK gamble given the price, but save yourself the trouble. In fact, I'd say that the use of marble and materials to make this product is just a waste of resources.

When my mind was wandering about the gym, the grocery store, calling my sister, things like that, you know it is time to put the book down for good and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words","review":"While the story line is gripping and the characters full of promise, Shane Lester's overabundance of descriptive adverbs, adjectives, and superlatives make the first chapter a slow go. One feels trapped by the shear wordiness of his writing. _Clan of Cain_ shows promise, but soon leaves the reader with the feeling that they are immersed in a picture book done with words. If you like being able to paint a perfect picture in your mind of your characters' surroundings then you'll like this book. The first sentence is an excellent example of nearly every sentence in the opening pages: \\"The hooves of the laggard, old, brown mule crushed the leaves lying gently on the autumn trail, which descended and stretched east into the thicket of dense trees outside Paris, Tennessee.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful at all--really not worth buying.","review":"This guide was not useful to us at all on our recent trip to Maine. We traveled from Portland north to Bar Harbor over the course of 8 days, using Frommer's New England, Fodor's New England, and this guide, as well as the AAA tourbook. This guide is organized alphabetically by the name of the B&B; if you want to find something by location, which is how most of us travel, you have to dig through the cross-reference in the second index in the back of the book. It also fails to make recommendations, merely describing a series of lodging choices in vague terms that leave you wondering what you might be getting into. The book lists positive quotes from other reveiwers on its back cover. I don't know how these were solicited, if the reviewers even read the book, they obviously knew nothing about New England."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for people who like to read, not travel.","review":"This book does not incorporate any standards of rating, allowing for no quantitative comparison of any aspect between properties. Instead the authors rely heavily on flowery, subjective descriptions. There are also no photos in this book, save the color advertising inserts, (Amex, Fordors, and MCI). But the biggest blunder this book makes is that none of the 342 properties are ever shown on a map!! Since the book organizes them alphabetically by area, its virtually useless as a reference guide. All in all; this book obviously required a lot of resources and research to produce. It seems ridiculous that it could somehow still fail so miserably to deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"coated cable","review":"Did not really have any expectations.

Well, all in it self it does and this amazing book brings together most of the characters from previous novels in a very satisfying way. We finally find an end to Her Grace's pain. Humorous of course and brutally historic we find ourselves embroiled in a story that only needs a little bravery and a handsome (yes of course, handsome) hero. He has his own problems of course. Most of all when he is almost rid of his wife; his countess delivers a very strange heir in the middle of a ball room. All of this is a very humorous and satisfying end to this trilogy. Marion Chesney is a marvel for her literary talent in writing amazingly funny and wonderfully tragically stories about historical lives in her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute little story","review":"I'm a big fan of M.C.

Their debut LP \\"Left Hand Path\\" is a landmark record for the 90's and one of death metal's most powerful debut. Their sophomore release \\"Clandestine\\" was even stronger than the previous. It was faster, heavier, and just all around better. After that came one of the most disappointing releases in metal history \\"Wolverine Blues\\" which featured a Marvel Wolverine Comic in the original LP. This was an experimental album in which Entombed incorperated a more rock 'n' roll element in their songs and thus dubbed it \\"death 'n' roll\\". The album was a big disgrace, and Entombed stayed in this direction for all of their albums, until Serpent Saints. This album is not Clandestine, but its getting there. It has a lot of the early Left Hand Path riffs, as well as some of the death 'n' roll. Entombed finally made a metal record after all these years, and it is definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny...","review":"I must admit, the price made me hesitate greatly on this Potty Stool but I'm glad I made the purchase. It truly is a quality product and has renewed my daughters interest in going potty. I had considered the cheaper potty stools but they seemed much to flimsy. I feared that if a cheaper product malfunctioned it would make her fearful of the toilet. We have enough challenges as it is. So don't be deterred by the price. You'll receive peace of mind and your child will gain the confidence necessary to be successful. I also figure the resale value will help me recoup some of my investment once our potty stool days have long since passed.By the way, I also purchased the Baby Bjorn Toilet Adapter as suggested by another reviewer. Great advice! Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great !","review":"I love this potty stool. it gives my special needs daughter the ability to climb up by her self and security.

Despite my great hesitancy to buy something that cost 5x as much (vs. total cost with shipping vs. my Amazon Prime two-day shipping) I pulled the trigger on this item and I'm quite happy with it. My kid took an immediate liking to the handles and devices and enjoyed climbing on it. Although it is plastic, it is very sturdy and well constructed. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a head start on potty training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe way for toddlers to get on the potty by themselves","review":"Our daughter could not get on the potty by herself before we bought this.

My daughter is short and has one leg that is very short so using the standard Baby Bjorn stool (which we have 2 of) just isn't broad or tall enough to enable her to be self sufficient.

The kids took to it right away and were able to sit on the toilet with no help and no prompting! It is super stable and holds the weight of an adult. There is no way for a child to fall off the toilet and the kids can get a firm grasp of the stool from the time they step on it, turn around with their pants down and sit on the seat. This stool gives me tremendous peace of mind. The stool is large compared to other flimsy products but it comes apart in three pieces so adults can use the toilet just by taking off one side."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stool","review":"great stool. my two daughters love to use it and it's super sturdy -- i don't need to help them up or down. three pieces fit together so it's a quick set-up. it is a bit large, and we have a small bathroom, but well worth it. if you can spend the money, i'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky and heavy, ok for daycares","review":"This is a great stool for a daycare, but it is large and a little too heavy for a home environment.

The story revolves around a family who have vacated their beloved home to pursue their dreams of running a tutorial college....only to find themselves drowning under a mountain of debt. And while Liz and Jonathan struggle with how to keep their heads above water, Liz strikes a friendship with a successful--and handsome--real estate agent. One thing leads to another and soon the viability of the entire business falls to the seemingly timid and clueless Jonathan. Meanwhile, their daughter Alice develops a relationship with the renters that have moved into her old house....once they've discovered her lurking about. Lives become inextricably intertwined, and betrayals surface as the story heads to a dry, anti-climactic conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"I have read only one other Madeleine Wickham book, The Gatecrasher, and I enjoyed it.

Not my kind of book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've read in a long time","review":"I generally read a book like this when traveling as it is usually light and entertaining. Unfortunately Madellein Wickham must be the shadow side of the fun-loving writer Sofia Kinsella. This book is as dreary as a rainy English day. Is this truly the same writer? Still not sure why she felt the need to change her writer's name and her writing style in one fell swoop. I used to know that if I bought one of her books I was guaranteed a good read- now I'll know to put it anything with this author's name back down and keep browsing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Wickham at her best","review":"I usually enjoy reading Madeleine Wickham's novels. They are purely self-indulgent, and feature interesting plot and flawed yet sympathetic characters. Except this one.

I have restarted it several times because I feel like with the positive reviews I've been reading, there is something I am missing.

It jumps around from one character to another without allowing the reader to get \\"to know\\" each one. I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like this book...","review":"I usually get very excited when I see that Madeleine Wickham has a new book out. This book was by far the worse book she has ever written. It is depressing. The characters are not interesting. I had to make myself finish it all the while holding out hope that it would get better. It did not. Wickham has written so many fabulous books. I recommend choosing a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Depressing","review":"I am a fan of Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella but this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Every storyline was extremely depressing and most of the characters seemed to have a lot of hatred, especially the children. I don't mind reading a depressing book if it seems to serve a purpose, but if there is a purpose to this particular book, I didn't see it. The only reason I continued reading till the end was because I love the author and I thought this book would have to turn around at some point, but it just ended, without any of the characters having any type of closer. I am extremely disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick to the Shopaholic Series","review":"With the success of the Shopaholic Series, the books that Sophie Kinsella wrote previously are being reprinted.

I love her writing style and her witty humor in her other books. This was not like any of her other books; This book is not funny, not witty, and has no likeable characters. I kept on reading thinking that the characters would grow more likeable, or at least more humorous; I was wrong on both counts. The characters were not likeable and their actions only made them more deplorable and/or boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent character and raw honesty elevate this past chick-lit","review":"This book, though not what I expected, was quite a good read. Despite the fluffy description on the flap, this book is actually a very frank and serious look at relationships, love, and betrayal. Wickham does a marvelous job with these characters, though it is upsetting how very irresponsible almost all of the adults are throughout the novel. Fourteen year-old Alice was particularly well-drawn; the pain of her adolescent experience reached off the page to grab me. Her conflicted feelings about the adults in her life (she loves her parents while simultaneuously writhing inside when confronted by their eccentricities) rang very true and helped make her character so honest and poignant. All in all, an impressive offering from an author usually associated with chick-lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I am a huge fan of all Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella books, but I have to say that this was one of the dumbest books I have ever read.

I thought maybe if I kept reading it would get better...guess what? It didn't, it got worse. It's described as being sharp and funny by Family Circle but I honestly think they read another book because there was absolutely nothing funny whatsoever about this thing. It's about a bunch of different people that are connected because of a house that the Chambers are trying to sell. The only people that I weren't annoyed with in this book were Jonathan Chambers, Witherstone's two boys, and Piers. The rest are shallow and superficial. I also hated the way one person is telling the story and in the next paragraph someone else is and it's all in first person. I don't understand!

I started off with the Shopaholic series and now have read every book written by her, and have loved them all.A Desirable Romance does not stray from the author's usual formula of a light, funny and quick read. Although unrealistic at times, the plot and characters are interesting and unique, and I found myself now really rooting for anyone so much as I was rooting for everyone.If you are looking for something fun and upbeat, memerizing and interesting, this one could be for you.

It moved at a brisk pace, had entertaining situations, with sufficient, interesting twists and turns, and an unusual heroine for whom I developed a sneaking admiration.But this book is plodding and not very interesting. I couldn't get into the plot, the characters were so pedestrian, they left me cold. In fact, the lead character simply irritated me with her total lack of self awareness which was clearly the motive for her destructive behaviour. All I could think was how stupid she was.

I gave two cd's to my nephews and saved the third cd for our baby due March 2010. I had not heard any of the music on the cd prior to my purchase, but had high hopes since I already owned several of the Putomayo music cd's for adults (from Amazon :). I am SO glad that I hung on to that third cd for our future baby because ever since the first time that we listened to the cd while building our baby's crib, my husband and I were completely hooked from the very first song. Our baby is now 9 months old and clearly recognizes all of the songs because he claps and smiles whenever we turn on this music. There is only one warning and that is that pretty much all the songs on the cd are addictive and you'll find yourselves singing them to yourself often. (Our nephews love the cd too.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality music can be fun.","review":"Putomayo puts out some great products. This CD is no exception. My 5 yr old has learned every song (so have I) and we have so much fun singing along in the car. Her favorite is trk 11. I chose to buy this CD and other Putomayo CDs because most music out there for kids seems to be made without integrity and frankly, is usually a painful listening experience.. Other kids music seems to embrace the idea that quality music is lost on children which is quite the opposite in my experiences. Amazon has a sample listening for some of these CDs. Take advantage of this is you have not done so already.In conclusion, we love this CD and the songs will be part of my child's childhood memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a low quality, uninspired book.

This book is easy to read - I provided it to middle and junior high school boys at my basketball camp. The text is concise and enjoyable, filled with important lessons that can help in basketball and in life. Dr. Amberry teaches us how to focus and concentrate on the process not the results. This is something that is important to players, coaches, and to each of us in our lives. For those that need additional support, Dr. Amberry's video \\"Make Every Free Throw\\" provides his lessons in an excellent visual format.

It was amazing how much he remembered and in the order it happened. We originally found the 3rd book in the series and started to read it....but realized we really needed to start at the beginning.

It seems that this would be a great way to introduce a young reader to fantasy adventure, and a great way to experiment with your reader's readiness.

Expansion books then add new elements to your main book.For \\"Call of Cthulhu,\\" I find the \\"The 1920S Investigator's Companion\\" to be the only expansion I use every game. The additional Investigator occupations add an exciting element and allow for more customization for players. For the Keeper, the \\"Investigator's Companion\\" does not add any complication to game play, as many expansion and optional rule books do.The book is packed with information about the 1920's, and can really fill out your campaign.

The front wheel was so out of true, that the brake pads would grab the wheel. After trying to true the front wheel, I tried adjusting the cable on the front brake, but it was no use.

Although this work is by two editors, the work is seamless and unified.This book is lacking one Sophist: Isocrates.

It's really a wonderful novel, full of \\"love, magic, and family pride.\\" Once again, Allende has interesting, rich characters who populate the novel and make it so fun to read. Though this novel had brutal parts, I still liked it. Read Isabel Allende, whether it's The City of the Beasts series, Daughter of Fortune, or The House of the Spirits. Just read her.

I soon came to realize what a clever way it was for Allende to tell the story. She employed a particularly useful construction tool to make a dark story shed some redemptive light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfully emotional epic of family and nation.","review":"This book spans 75 years starting in around 1900 and takes place in an unnamed South American country. We meet Clara the clairvoyant as a child and her future husband Esteban whose children and grandchild populate the story. As the novel progresses, social issues are seamlessly woven into the plot and political tensions escalate from generation to generation. There are numerous colorful and memorable supporting characters. The dense descriptions and myriad relationships are superb. About 2/3 of the way through the book I realized that the magical beginning had been supplanted by politics and I was being lead toward a conclusion of violent and terrible realism. But I persisted and was swept back into the story and found the return to the House of Spirits a satisfying ending. I was extremely impressed at how well done and enjoyable this powerfully emotional novel is."},{"rating":"2","title":"May be the Best Book I've Ever Read","review":"Be prepared for another reality, where skin is transparent and hair can be naturally green. This book will transport you there, and make you want to go back.It's a tale of a family and a tale of politics, and a story of generations. Each character can exist in the new reality, along with the others, and I was transported there, too. Allende is the best of story weavers, for there's more than just telling a story going on. The author's vision is one of characters who develop, and live to the fullest of their individual capacity, including moving salt shakers and furniture. Read it once, and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially... Socialist Propaganda","review":"This novel has one main message, and it goes to all lengths to send it, while making no concessions to the other side. That message is that socialism is good, capitalism is bad, and that's all there is to it. The only \\"conservative\\" who actually had a good side was Esteban Trueba. But guess what? Near the end, he begins helping the socialists. So much for the only conservative who wasn't entirely evil. There's another conservative who steps into the spotlight near the end... and he is essentially evil incarnate. He imprisons, rapes and brutally tortures the main character, never showing any mercy or emotion. Of course, all socialists are shown to be almost superhumanly kind and generous. All in all, I found this novel to be quite shallow, and the message to be too blunt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"A friend suggested I read this book before leaving for Chile, where the story takes place. While the story is okay, despite the supernatural aspects, the accuracy is off. Allende's very socialist views are prominent throughout the story, leaving some misinformation for the reader.

I didn't care enough about any of the characters and the political struggle was dull and depressing.

Although the story is a \\"good\\" story in and of it self, without knowing some of its' historical context you will be missing out. Knowing that Allende's uncle (Salvador Allende) is \\"the candidate\\", and that she knew Pablo Neruda \\"the poet\\" and that she is alluding to Agusto Pinochet in the 1973 Coup all make this book come to life. I urge all who are interested in Latin American history and literature to read this book and quickly review the history. It is amazing how much we can learn from one family, one family that teaches us the history, the patriarchal system, and the social context of an entire country in a very tumultous time. Disfrute!

The novel stands alone without the reader's having any political or historical background to pin it in place. However, I was enthralled by the way in which Allende used her characters not only describe their reactions to the political upheaval in CHile, but also the way in which she encapsulated the reactions of all the classes. I could weep at the injustices suffered by the lower classes, and yet feel the upper classes fear and indignation. Allende's gift is that she could convey seemingly diametrically opposing views without resorting to age old stereotypes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ","review":"This book is amazing, I read it because I liked the movie, and I am a student of Latin American history, politics and culture. The book is (as usual) much better than the movie, and it amazingly captures a tumultuous and awful time in Latin American history through the experiences of one family.

I became part of the world of the Truebas, a world where the unexpected is commonplace and the weird is normal.

Isabel Allende did an excellent job write the novel, in the sense that every word helped describe the mood and feeling the book carried, I would recommend this to all types of readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Realism in The House of the Spirits","review":"The House of the Spirits is a great example of magical realism. The events that occur in the novel are obscure and often horrific to the point of being unbelievable, yet the novel raises such contemporary and realistic issues such as class struggles, political tension, and the power and powerless women, that the story has reasonable ground.Characters in the novel are portrayed with both attractive and flawed attributes, revealing imperfect protagonists, and empathetic antagonists. Esteban for example is a haughty, temperamental, violent and rapist man, yet in his love for Alba the reader is forced to recognize his humanity and likable affection.Overall the book is one full of mystery, and twists and turns that will keep the reader attentive and surprised at every new page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeping epic","review":"This book is a sweeping epic, spanning decades in the history of an unnamed South American country, following the life of one family.

The book started out very interesting with dynamic characters whom I had never read any close to. (Meaning the characters were unique). The problem is THEY NEVER CHANGED. There was no character development or any lessons learned (Except on the VERY last page). The worst part is, characters just died. Their deaths would just stick ou like a sore thumb, as if allende were trying to get rid of old characters to make room for new ones. Another problem: TOO MANY CHARACTERS TO KEEP TRACK OF. There were WAAAY more characters in this novel than what I deemed \\"necessary\\" most held no link to the plot at all (also: NO PLOT).I felt as if this book was a biography of a family that had been fictionalized.Needless to say: Awful book that only intellectuals would enjoy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative Chick Lit Slop","review":"I judge this smarmy mash to be about 75% Garcia Marquez and 25% Jorge Amado.Summary-Man bad.

Why does anyone need to waste their time with this travesty of a story? Magical realism is the worst writing style I can imagine. One of the main principles of magical realism is that time is nothing.

I don't think any of the characters survive the book without being raped at some point, and homosexuality is encouraged as being noble.The characters are all horribly sterotypical archetypes.

This outstanding novel brings together the realism of the turmoil in Chile with the mysticism of Allende's imagination. This novel follows a wealthy Chilean family through three generations with underlying themes of love and revenge with an added twist of magic. The setting changes form their urban mansion to the serene home in the country, where the main man constructed a village over a number of years and generations. Basically, love conquers all, end of story. The downside: it can get a bit confusing at times becasue several of the characters have the same names, and there are many spanish words in the english version. Overall, this was a beautifully written book. By far, Allende's best novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a copycat of Garcia Marquez","review":"Was Isabel Allende intention to write another \\"One hundred years of solitude\\"?

Yes, it is strangely similar to One Hundred Years of Solitude, but not so much that this should stop anyone from reading it. Allende has her own style, a simpler one, and generally her book is an easier read. It is not as powerful as 100 Years, yet it is a more realistic novel, and perhaps it is easier to identify with her characters. The fact that she is related to the great Chilean president Allende (killed himself in the coup that lead to Pinochet's dictatorship) makes her analysis particularly interesting, but there is no need to enjoy politics or history to appreciate her story of three generations of a family in South America, written with much of the magic realism style used so much by Marquez."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every time I read this is like the first time!","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful book by a gifted author. Allende captures the spirit of South American Magical realism perfectly, making the reader believe that a saltshaker can be moved with one's mind, that the ghosts of our loved ones protect us even after death, and most of all, that the human spirit is unbreakable. An inspiring book that touches your very soul. I rarely cry when I read, but this book had me in tears for the last 4 chapters. In my opinion, this is Allende's best work, one that I will read over and over again! and it's true, no matter how many times I read this book, it's always like the first time all over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Allende does it again","review":"When an author is able to take a far-fetched idea and pull it together into a plausible story, I'm usually smitten. Call me smitten. Isabel Allende builds a beautiful, dramatic tale of spirits, powers, family and love into The House of Spirits. She chronicles the life of her ancestors and their mystical powers in a tale that's heartbreaking as well as uplifting. Only Allende has been able to carry off this combination, in my opinion.The story is strong, if not a tad too long. In typical Allende style, the book is wrapped in beautiful, poetic description. It's a strong showing by a strong author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exhausting book","review":"Even though \\"The House of the Spirits\\" was an easy read, it was quite exhausting to read because of the many emotions that I felt while reading it. Allende is a great writer who uses words to make the reader feel as the characters in the book feel. Their pain becomes your pain and their joy becomes your joy. She mixed magical realism with her political ideals into a poignant story about a family. Not many authors can do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story I want to live","review":"This absorbing epic kept me mesmerized from first page to last. Isabel Allende created and defined characters so fascinating to me, I longed to live among them. I am no historian, and don't even pretend to like politics, but this book of turn-of-the-century South America blends everything so flawlessly, it remains one of my all-time favorites. The generations of the Trueba family are comprised of people too complex to be labled heroes or villians. Allende's skilled writing can make you accept clairvoyance as a talent no more bizarre than singing. She tells her powerful tales with detailed imagery beyond comparison. It makes \\"Gone With the Wind\\" green with envy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical masterpiece to slimulate all of your passions.","review":"House of the Spirits is a rare concoction of every passion known to man and woman. I was drawn to read this book in an unremarkable way, but it's story has made a profound effect on me. Each element of passion (power, family, love, race, and spirituality) flow both independantly as well as separately. The movie version should not be seen. This is a tale that must be told between the words and your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in a while... and that's saying a lot!","review":"I have often seen this book sitting on store shelves over the years. The cover, somehow, always turned me off. Looked somewhat juvenile. I knew that this book was probably worthwhile, seeing as it is often required reading for AP Literature courses. It wasn't until it was selected for my bookclub that I picked it up. What an unexpected surprise! Not only was it a worthwhile literary work, but it was actually entirely engaging, interesting, and enjoyable from the get-go. It has a little something for everyone: romance, history, politics, and action. I can't say enough about this book. Just wonderful! Don't wait to read this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Isabel Allende's \\"The House of the Spirits\\" is quite different than previous books I have read. As the book went on, it sort of grew on me although I'm not a typical fan of this type of Romantic/Feminine Novel. Allende's brilliance and technique for writing this novel gives the reader a well written piece that could be inspiring to some women today. Great read and recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The House of Spirits","review":"I think that Isabel Allende's The House of Spirits is a great book to read. The story has a little bit of everything in it to make the reader want to go back and keep reading. One theory that is throughout the novel is the constant struggle between Women and Society. All the women in the story are continuously struggling with an outside predicament that enables them to be able to speak freely and have the freedoms we have today. I personally have enjoyed reading the novel. READ IT...IT'S A GOOD NOVEL!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The House of the Spirits","review":"I really enjoy this book. It was required for my summer reading, but I'm glad it was. Isabel Allende is a marvellous author and her use of magical realism is wonderful. This book is hard to put down once you start reading! The development of her characters is amzaing. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The House of the Spirits","review":"The House of the Spirits was a wonderful and exciting novelwith many different perspectives about the latin culture in Chile.The character development was unbelievable. It felt like you really knew who Allende was talking about. You can have a completely mental picture of the characters and setting. If anyone has not read this book, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book, don't watch the movie","review":"Isabel Allende has created an intriguing book tracking the rise and fall of the Trueba family. She has mixed family crisis in with political crisis that have racked the land. The strong female members in this story hold the family together while the rest of the country is being torn apart and make this book truly worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know latinamerica","review":"If you really want to know and understand why latinamericans are the way we are, you've got to read this extraordinary book. I read it about 10 years ago...maybe more. But it is still around in my memory, just as the characters, gosts and the magic involved in our reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"* I would like to give this 4.5 stars","review":"Allende has created a marvelouse book with a style quite different from most other authors. The story takes the reader through three generations of a single family. The wonderful and beautiful way Allende has composed this culturally enhancing and \\"unable to put down\\" book is really marvelouse. The one downfall is \\"Clara the Clairvoyant\\" sometimes turns dissapointingly unrealistic as well as her mothers ability to contact the spirtual world (which is only one aspect of the book and should not be viewed as a turn-off). If you're simply looking for a good book and if you're not too skeptical of a person - I suggest reading \\"House of Spirits\\". ~15 yrs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters with geat potential yet plot unfulfilled","review":"I was somewhat disappointed with Allende's 'The House of Spirits'. Everything about the book seemed to evoke a sense of great things will come from this writer, but unfortunately I was left wanting. So much untapped potential was made of the characters and yet after reading a while in to the book I realised that this is as far as Allende is going to take them. Why? I was left wondering. This is the first book I've read by this author but I'm not going to let it put me off reading more of her stuff. Perhaps my expectations of the author were too great but I don't think so some how."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to understand","review":"I believe this book was hard to understand. I read it in my english class and I could hardly follow along. There is too much description and my least favorite part of the book is with the Civil War. It wasn't very interesting the way Alba disobeyed her father. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isabel Allende's first novel is true winner!!!!!!","review":"This novel is truly breath-taking. It is a beautiful exhibition of what family struggles are like. The Truebas are the family whose lives are recorded in this novel since the begining of the century, untill the present. The struggles of these brave people make this novel unique, the characters make the book stand out as a well worked literary breakthrough in modern Spanish Literature. I highly recomend it in the original Spanish, but think everyonr should read it.Isabel is surely guarenteed the Nobel Prize in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"As one of many students who had to read it for the IB program, I have to say that it was a good read. (despite all the moaning and groaning that I got from some of my friens) There is a lot of foreshadowing, which unfortunately takes away some of the surprise in the book. But, despite my disappointment with \\"Paula\\", I like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I thought this book was one of the best I have read in a while. I loved the intense character development, and the surealist events that take place. Compared to OF LOVE AND SHADOWS by Isabel Allende, it tells more of a story over a longer period of time, and OF LOVE AND SHADOWS is much slower and more descriptive, almost artistic writing, in a sense. If you know of any books to recomend please email me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I glad when I was finished!","review":"I read this book because it was on a list of the 150 best books of the century picked in a poll run by Library Journal. and I have now read 115 of the 150. This one was a real struggle to get thru. I simply could not get interested in the grotesque and weird characters in this book. I kept hoping the book would get better but I cared as little about the chracters on the last page as when I started. This book was a complete waste for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House of Spirits","review":"Do not understand why this was a best seller. Perhaps something might have been lost in the translation: my interest to continue past the third chapter. Finished it then left it in auto repair waiting area."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This book encourages human survival instintcs, i loved it for its real - magical blend. I highly recommend it for everybody trying to get a better look of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed second time around","review":"Read this when first published and was enchanted.

Passed it along to my niece who wanted a book to read on airplane!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I was hoping for","review":"I brought this book home certain that I was going to fall in love with it. I didn't.I found the characters difficult to like. I found the events from one generation to the next to be repetitive. I was annoyed by the right-left politics of the book. At the end, I found myself liking Esteban better than Alba.I wish I bought something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"hip hip horray for house of the spirits","review":"wonderfully written fantastical but believable on every level. Truly identifies and pulls at every human emotion and tells a fabulous story. Fast paced and full of twists and turns this plot is one of a kind. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful historical fiction","review":"Isabel Allende's books are all very realistic, but include some elements of magical realism. This book has a little more graphic violence than the others that I have read, but it sticks very closely to the realities of the period in which it is based in history. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"For a book that claims to be a biography about Sagan, it contains very little information about the person Carl Sagan. The pages are filled with details about persons that worked with him, and quite a bit about the science he did, but very little about Sagan himself. One cannot avoid the conclusion that Moser and Spangenburg just could not dig up any information on Sagan, except for material they got from the Poundstone biography, to which they frequently refer. I could not finish this book. One gets the impression that they wrote it one afternoon (which is how long it will take you to read this short book). What a disapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good primer for new Sagan fans.","review":"How is this 31 dollars?!?!?!?!?! Not even the hardcover costs this much! What kind of crazy premium is being charged for this kindle version!?!UPDATE: 6.14.09The price has dropped to a more reasonable 10 dollars.

I am still looking for a usable copy for research. Fine if you want to see 17th century printing and don't care about the text. Not good indication of this fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ye Olde inglish writing at its best","review":"This is a very revealing book. It is mostly a synopsis from then existing French and English documents in their dealings with the \\"locals\\" of the time, as long as a few first hand accounts by the author. For seventeenth century english, it is not as confusing to read as most. It also sheds light on the way the English (mis)handled the Iroquois, and how most of the five nations remained firmly in their corner anyway, at least most of the time.Some of the Horrors committed by the Indians and the French (which the French properly and proudly document) actually turned my stomach, and did indeed, as Mr. Colden writes, \\"offend my Christian sensibilities.\\" Nonetheless, you will learn much of Northeastern Indian customs by reading this book, along with where the English failed in their relationships with these loyal people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cute but thin","review":"I bought this costume as a gift for a friend for her grandson. She loved the costume. He was super cute in it and it's really true to size. It fit him perfectly. I was looking for a pirate costume for an infant everywhere and I was glad I found this on Amazon. I really don't have any complaints however, my friend had a hard time putting it on her grandson because she didn't see there were button on the pants besides the opening in the back. I had to show her there were snaps on the pants since it wasn't very apparent unless you were looking for them. I only knew because my son's lion costume was the same way. Also, I would mention that it was thin so it wouldn't be a good costume to wear without a coat if your Halloween's are like the Midwest where it's typically very cold on Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the cutest halloween outfit","review":"This outfit is the cutest thing. The fabric is of good quality, however it is thin. So if you live in a colder climate, you'll probably want to put something underneath it.

If your child is tall, you should get the next size up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute but may be irritating","review":"This costume was adorable on our son but when we first put it on him, he complained for a while about the sleeves.

Better to get a 2 cd set from Italy having the entire concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius or Marching Band?","review":"I play Albert when I need to clear my head, which is (perhaps fortunately) less and less often as I get older. This music sounds like a tornado warning mixed with someone cutting up chickens mixed with whatever was defined as free jazz in 1966. Ronald Shannon Jackson holds it all together on the drums and puts a fire under the explorations of the Aylers. Listen closely and you can hear some \\"Salt Peanuts\\" and \\"Auld Lang Syne,\\" among other ingredients.As other reviewers have noted, there is a track missing here (although the liner notes insist there isn't) and there might be better packagings elsewhere.

E., Jr. Modesitt, but after this book I begun to wonder. When I passed the middle of the book, I had to check that I hadn't taken one of the Recluce books by mistake. I mean, the similarities are too numerous to be accidental. The sorcerer and sorceress who fall in love, the watersprout that is created by Secca, the engine that the smith is trying to build (which is mentioned once for no apparent purpose) - all these elements are already familiar to anyone who read the Recluce series.I also got the imperssion that to prolong the series, author is adding the elements that are not organic for these series, and they look foreign (for example all the line of the Ladies of the Shadow). In short, for me the book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"this book was very interesting. i fell asleep. if you like these kind of book then its a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful series!","review":"The only disappointment was the lack of happenings with Anna after the first book, but her heir carried on the tradition wonderfuly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing is Secret","review":"I was surprised at the way the author describes her parent's divorce. Since both are still alive, I would imagine that they might regard the telling as too personal and intrusive.

After the author's father gets shot I wanted to put the book down and use it as a sleep aid.

I found her analysis of revenge, however, to be rote and boring, very uninspired. The end of the book was extremely disturbing and offensive. This story is about a woman trying to reconcile her need for vengence with her western intellectual morals. In the end she gets her revenge on this terrorist who shot her father. What is her version of revenge? To befriend and forgive him. This terrorist who tried to kill her father, who belonged to murderous bloodthirsty terrorist gangs who target civilians for death. Her father was not killed, thank God, but how many Jews did this animal murder? How can she reconcile her friendship and forgiveness to one who murders her own people? Where does she get the right to forgive him for their murder? Does she forgive the nazis as well?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but self-centered","review":"Clearly, the author is oblivious to the seemingly unending suffering of the Palestinians. She fails to comment on the history of the situation, as if these attacks truly evolved from nothing. Zionism is the problem in Israel and the cause of her father's attack. She might realize this if only she would quit whining. I'd expect more from someone with a Master's Degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Daring Bit of Journalism","review":"Laura Blumenfeld writes beautifully. But people looking for an objective or scholarly treatise on revenge, or a monograph on the situation in the Middle East, should go elsewhere. This book is a personal journey of discovery and adventure, filled with emotional truths and some shocking surprises. In the end, the author exposes herself in a way few writers would dare. I loved this book. But even if you don't, you have to admire it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanity, Courage, Forgiveness, and Hope","review":"[Audio edition, abridged] As a work of fiction, this nicely bridges the psychological drama and the suspense novel, and proves you can write an interesting tale without explosions, betrayals or mayhem.While perhaps not as well crafted as Fuentes or Marquez, the author creates a disarmingly flawed heroine, who nonetheless becomes endearing. The theme of \\"is the world essentially good or bad?\\" is well dramatized, and the climactic courtroom scene as suspenseful and dramatic as a prime-time thriller. A \\"ripping good yarn\\", especially considering the themes of family values, hope and peace.It will be interesting to see what further works this author creates, and how her craft progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow book","review":"I just want to warn prospective buyers - this book is shallow and not worth the read. My bookgroup and I read this as one of our selections. All of us were excited at first - because several of us had heard the author interviewed on the radio and the interview was very interesting - however, the book itself was disappointing. We came away with no deeper understanding of how someone deals with the very natural feelings of revenge. There was too much information shared about her family conflicts - dialogues with her parents. And it just wasn't interesting. As I said earlier, I was shocked at how shallow this book is considering her subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobel Prize Material","review":"Faulkner said that great books touch the human heart and Revenge certainly did that for me. Blumenfeld mixes her personal story with scholarly research on a topic that keeps wars brewing and personal happiness at bay: revenge. She layers religious history with current news and throws in her account of her honeymoon year. Her prose is elegant and her characters unforgettable.Our book club had a longer discussion on this book than we have ever had.

The album kinda makes sense considering Alex's state of mind at the time - having been burned a few times by the music industry by now.

Like Flies on Sherbert is in the same spirit as 3rd, as Chilton becomes fascinated with studio ambience and sloppy amateurism, thus exposing the constituents of rock and pop. It's difficult postmodern rock and roll predating Royal Trux/Pussy Galore's more visceral efforts, but Like Flies on Sherbert affectingly showcases Chilton's personal problems at the time more than any hipster indifference or deconstructionist tendencies. In that way, it's sorta like Neil Young's Tonight's the Night or On the Beach.

Bring 'Em Back Alive: Capturing Wildlife on Home Video is an excellent book for anyone who is interested in the video photography of animals! It focuses on everything, from equipment to safety to blinds to animals. Not only does it explain the important information needed, but it also offers tips and pointers. It is a very useful book! As a beginner, I have referred to this book faithfully in all my work. It also features Jim Arnosky's amazing color photographs! All in all, this is a wonderful, interesting, and helpful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"This book deserves to have a fan base the size of another series, not written half as well as this one; you know, the one that concerns a blue dragon and her rider.

Would that the writers had the free time to complete the second and third books fast enough to satisfy this reader's anxious waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over","review":"This book is absolutely not worth your time. The story is incredibly slow-paced; at page 280 I was still wondering where the heck it was going, and not in a good way. The phrasing (throughout the 280 pages I managed to read) was painfully awkward. I always felt like the authors were trying too hard. Descriptions of anything and everything were apt to go on for several pages with no advancement of plot. It really reminded me of a middle school research paper with a required minimum word count - the only purpose of the words on the pages being to fill empty space. Just....excruciating."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass this one up","review":"I think mostly everyone's already said it - pass this one up. If you're a lover of high fantasy, \\"The Stoneholding\\" is just going to make you cry (and not in a good way).

Get it from the library if you must waste your time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly horrible","review":"This book is very difficult to read in that it is clumsily executed. Many parts of it are overly descriptive while leaving the reader with a vague outline of what the land looks like. The dialogue is the worst part of it.

Their last self-entitled album returned to the roots with classic rock with a twist, like the songs \\"Answer the Phone\\" and \\"Under the Sun\\" - this new album doesn't. Sure, there are some great songs like \\"Chasin' you Around\\", but it just isn't the Sugar Ray I know and love. The last album also had some quiet melodies, which was okay, because they managed to combine both styles, but this is takin' it too far.I've always had the feeling that Mark McGrath would love to go mainstream, and I won't blame him, but this shouldn't be the way... and come on, a team-up with Shaggy?! I'm sorry, but I won't recommend this CD to anyone who enjoyed their last effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer CD","review":"I liked Sugar Ray's \\"harder\\" songs on Floored but if you are a fan of Fly, Someday, and Every Morning, this is the best mellow grove cd that they have put out.

Grooving to these tunes isn't hard to do... aside from the first single Mr. Bartender (which is to me just a dance song that'll make you tap your feet), this album is filled with songs you almost feel guilty for enjoying for a second or tird listen. Regardless of the fact that this CD to me is a step below what the self titled cd had to offer, it's hard not to like songs like the one's found here. I reccomend this Sugar Ray offering to anyone looking for a smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"When u sell out you sell your sound......","review":"And that is what Sugar Ray does best! Not only is their music not original... its not even them writing the stuff anymore. The clothes and the songs are dumb! They traded off their hard rock edge for some back street boy clothes...

If you buy only one CD this summer, this should be it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, what happened to these guys","review":"These guys haven't put a good album out since Floored. Lemonade and Brownies is a great metal album and by far their best. Once \\"Fly\\" was a hit, it ruined their sound and they completely sold their souls and sold out their old fans.

Now there's a metal band that still puts out good hard albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"INFORMATIVE AND WELL RESEARCHED BOOK","review":"I could not put this volume down. The most incredible discovery I made after reading this book was that it was the bloody monster Beria--of all the Stalin's henchmen in Kremlin-- who tried to De-Stalinize the Soviet system after Stalin's death. Khruschev's unforgetable reaction to that was an attempt to put brakes on this process. Eventually, he succeded in presenting himself as the man \\"who opened window to the West\\".

For example, it will have a drawing of a screw and it will say \\"actual size\\" but there is no screw that looks exactly like the drawing.I'm giving this 2 stars because after I have someone else fix it, it looks like it will hold up.

The front wheel lock does lock the steering but not the pedals as described. Have to spend more time to disassemble, send it back, and get a new. The kid did love it in the story asseblied.

At one point I got so frustrated I walked away and told my husband to finish it. He got so frustrated he ended up pushing something the wrong way, it got stuck and broke and we had to wait an extra ten days to get up and running because we had to buy recplacement parts. I love the bike of course - it's great. I write this review in hopes that someone at the company will take a realistic look at those directions... or maybe they just want to sell replacement parts. I don't know.One last thing - I thought this was the one with the bigger seat, but it's not. That was a disappointment.

They told me their children loved riding it, and the parents loved that they could lock the wheels and control the tricycle during early ages.What they didn't tell me is that they all purchased the tricycle already built at a toy store.So I bought one online, and much to my chagrin, I just spent over two hours putting it together. The manual was the worst I've ever read (or not read, since there are no translations), there were parts left over and items (like the red plastic piece that's supposed to snap into the front wheel fender) that didn't sit properly into place or were poorly calibrated to fit together.If Kettler is going to tout themselves as the \\"happy\\" tricycle they need to consider the happiness of the parent who decides to purchase this product unassembled."},{"rating":"1","title":"A messy toy","review":"It looks good, but a nightmare to put together, and once put togetther, 's just a mess.

Both our boys love the little yellow bin in the back, something I really didn't think they would notice but they always fill it with leaves or such and play \\"dump truck\\" with it.If you have little ones, I would suggest purchasing the optional seat belt just to keep smaller kids secure.Quality is excellent and worth the money. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free spin pedals are an issue for learning and fun","review":"I bought this tricycle based on the great reviews and pushbar capability. I had read one review about the free spin pedals being an issue but didn't realize how big the problem it would be before I bought it. My 2 year old son could not easily learn that pedaling forward would make the trike move and would just wait to be pushed. When I stopped pushing and encouraging him to paddle, it just stopped being fun for him. On hindsight, I would never purchase a tricycle with free spin pedals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time will tell.","review":"Time will tell if this tricycle is worth $200. My 2yo son is pretty big for his age and after checking out what the big box stores had I wasn't too happy. Nothing seemed to fit him. I bought the Kettler because it's adjustable and from what the specs and other reviews say it can take a beating.Putting it together was fairly easy. The locking mechanism for the front wheels was super tight making it just about unusable. I simply added some teflon grease to the locking pin and hole and it was fine afterwords. The parent handle and rear steering are great. The freewheel is great. My boy can't peddle yet but I don't see how the freewheel feature will hold him back. Ya just might have to spend a little extra time with your kid that's all.It's very well built and is plenty big enough for my big 2yo. If he likes it and plays with it then it was worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"expensive but worth it!","review":"The happy navigator really fits the needs of my 18 month old.

I added the seatbelt to it since my angel likes to jump off things while still in motion:) The instruction can be a little tricky, but just be patient and read them all first so you don't have to go back and undo things.

This ain't my cup of tea as I don't think Air's fantastic tunes need much remixing. Having said that, 'Le Soleil est pres de moi' is a pretty cool song. If your a fan of the satirical 'cheesiness' of Moon Safari, this one's not for you. My advice to you if you've just bought it and are feeling pretty gutted - go sit down and blast-up a bit of 'Ce Matin La'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of air","review":"I hear a lot about Talkie Walkie these days, it's gotten really good reviews and seems to be \\"the\\" air album to get.But I happen to think that this album is the best...put out when the artists were being more true to their music and not so anxious to sell to American audiences.Besides that \\"Je soleil est pres de mois\\" has got to be one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard...which is odd considering the type of music (I don't normally describe electronica and trip hop as \\"beautiful\\")Anyway it's funky but on the whole, much less bouncy than energetic than their other albums, and much more of what I'd call chill."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"This is certainly a good follow up to moon safari. Right from the start, the modular mix it's a great ambient CD. Reminds me of Selected ambient works 85-92 by Aphex Twin.

SUPERB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth, French, Beautiful, just Air!","review":"I bought Moon Safari last year, and found that La Femme D'Argent would take me to heaven. Just listening to it makes me feel great. When I got hold of Premiers Symptomes I tried not to get my hopes up, cause it was after all the early symptoms of what We know as Air. But it was just as amazing! Tracks like Modular Mix, Casanova 70 and J'i dormi sous l'eau are just as great as the later Ce matin La and La Femme D'argent. Exept for the two last tracks (which are \\"heavier\\" and less smooth), this is a cd you can put on repeat for ever without getting tired of it. It is, like Moon safari, the perfect background music no matter what you're doing. It just brings a smile to your face. Though not as \\"polished\\" as Moon safari, it is very very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well ahead of its time","review":"When you consider that five of the seven songs on this album were originally recorded in 1997, you can forget about everything else. These guys were clearly ahead of their time! By putting together a fundamentally instrumental album that flirts with a blend of 60s psychodelia and 90s ambient music to give birth to what later came to be known as chillout, Air broke into the musical scene with much deserved fanfare. Though the quality of their work continued to improve through the years, this album is a faithful representation of the musical potential they later showcased in productions such as \\"Moon Safari\\" and the OST to \\"The Virgin Suicides\\". Personally, their only work I'd steer away from is \\"10,000 Hz Legend\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"How about the beach?","review":"After picking up Moon Safari and 10,000hz and being greatly impressed by both, it was time to search for more Air music. Premiers Symptomes is a more ambient offering, with only \\"Brakes On\\" packing a bit of a punch. However, this is no critiscm of the EP, as the set of songs provide a relaxing and enjoyable journey. Don't buy if you expect to purchase another Moon Safari because this is different. However, if you are a Moon Safari fan, this is most definately worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"little boring","review":"Not worth the bucks unleass you are Asian.

However, during the packaging and shipping, the company put a large brown paper product on all the acrylic. When I opened the box from shipping, I had to use a razor blade and Goo Gone to even attempt to get rid of the brown paper. In doing so, the acrylic scratched so much that the case was unusable. It was not worth, at all , the money and shipping I paid for it. Unless the seller can get the brown stuff off first, don't even bother to order. You will be unhappy.

So much for the advertised 2.0 GB. I called Philips customer service, and asked what I was doing wrong. I was told that 25 is an average number. The representative said that I could compress the files so that I could fit more songs onto the player, however he said that typically the device will begin to freeze or malfunction in other ways once you get to 50 songs or so.

Wow is by far the most fun game i have ever come across. The one thing that does put a damper on it sometimes is the amount of time bad players can cost you and your group when doing some of the harder content at end game, it's amazing how many people can't figure out that fire is bad and when you're about to explode running over to hug the healer isn't a great idea. Luckily that is a fairly small portion of the population and the majority of people you meet are enjoyable and fun to play with. Solo minded people WILL NOT like this game.The battle chest itself is actually cheaper than classic and BC by themselves plus you get the guides as that added little bonus. For anyone considering starting this is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing game!","review":"I am not a gamer at all, but my husband got addicted to this game and insisted I try it. It is really a fun game! The programmers who made it must be tops in their field because there are very few glitches or bugs and the game-play is very intuitive. The detail is just amazing - from stars in the sky to footprints on the ground, they haven't left out any little thing. You really become part of this imaginary world.Even though a large part of this game involves killing members of the other faction as well as various other computer-generated beasts, this is not a mean-spirited game. It's difficult to be successful unless you team up with others and cooperate. I have seen a lot of very altruistic, helpful, and generous behavior from other players. There are always a few dorks around, too, of course, but for the most part this game seems to bring out the chivalry in its players.

This band has no similarity with the Grateful Dead but the way they meld these songs together only reminds me of the best (who was the Grateful Dead).

Still at a time in his career where he was basically a one-man band (although future bandmates Colin Edwin and Richard Barbieri contributed a little), Steven Wilson created a terrific album that's spacey, dreamy, and surrealistic.

Her piano music is haunting, but also often lively and fun. Loh uses unusual modes and unusual off-balance meters. It's like new age because of the use of the less emphatic modes. But it isn't as introverted, as new age music can be, because of the jaunty rhythms.The CD has some recurrence of ideas when I would have been just as happy to hear more of Loh's different ideas, but it is a satisfying collection of pieces.

Be cautious if you want a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Unfortunately, this product did not work for me as advertised. I purchased it after reading many reviews, but in those other reviews, the people were talking about something specific: certain chemicals that it was supposed to contain, chemicals that made it what it was. Without them, it was just like Chevron gas. As I take care of my car, this did absolutely nothing for me, unlike the Seafoam that I used on my engine, so I would recommend to anyone who is reading this to use Seafoam if you get the chance, and read some guides on it. It is not only fun, but also a great cleansing agent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much problems","review":"If you want to go crazy, just try this redline. Your car will drive you really crazy.

After about 35 gallons my engine light came on.The errors were for multiple misfires so I replaced the spark plugs and flushed the plugs. Two weeks later my 7 month old catalytic converter lite up my engine light again with the code for low efficiency.I called the company and was never able to speak with anyone about the issues.

Went from 24 mpg -> 28 mpg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like it says.","review":"Used it on my 10 yr old BMW. My gas mileage of 19 mpg improved by about 1-2 mpg in town and 1+ mpg on hwy now back to 29 mpg. {I use 93 octane}. Performance is better though; it has its old spunk back. When you hit the gas pedal, it moves like it was 2 years old again. I liked it enough to get 3 more to put in the other cars for the family. This one works for us. It may not meet expectations of increasing mpg 10-15% like some claim, but did improve performance and added some mpg."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best injector cleaners on the market","review":"I have used this product for a number of years and have been very satisfied with the results. This is not a substitute for sonic cleaning of fuel injector nozzles but it can remove minor deposits and improve performance. For vehicles manufactured before c. 2000, this product may help overcome some of the problems associated with ethanol blended fuel too."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good a cleaner as I've tested","review":"I can echo what Glenn said in his review. I started using fi cleaners back in the early 80's. A new Volvo 242 I had purchased new was starting to perform sluggishly. Another owner recommended a fi cleaner which I tried and it worked pretty well. Over the past 28 years I've tried just about everything on the market. Some worked well, others didn't. The Red Line SI-1 works better than the others I've tried. The BG cleaner works well too, but at three times the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"this is a great product. this shipment arrived and delivered as specified. if you are going to buy a fuel injection cleaner, look no further. this is the best one hands down. would be happy to recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST COMPLETE FUEL SYSTEM CLEANER U COULD BUY","review":"Hands down the best fuel system cleaner u could buy.

They are not as good as the original recordings by a long shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumbo Rural mailbox with steel flag & latch! (No plastic!)","review":"It took a while to receive this long-awaited jumbo mailbox from Big Edge Sports (not sure why it's carried by a sporting goods company??) and when it arrived, the box was punched in on one corner and had a tennis-ball size hole in one side. Plus, the latch had worn its way through the end of the carton and was sticking out of the box. However, there were miraculously no dents and the latch was only slightly bent but still worked as it should. The door closes properly and fits snugly which should keep out the rain quite nicely. Thus far, I'm satisfied with the quality of the mailbox and look forward to many years of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - old","review":"I have purchased Godiva chocolates a few times and have always found them to be old and dried out. I think the company has a problem with keeping stock fresh. I have never had this problem with other chocolate brands. For as much as Godiva charges for a premium product at least the product could be fresh and tasty instead of dry and tasteless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Crusty Chocolates!","review":"Someone was kind enough to buy me these chocolates from my giftlist. I've had Godiva chocolates delivered from Godiva's own site but thought it would be easier to list them on Amazon. BIG MISTAKE! When ordered from Godiva the chocolates were shipped fresh and cold with an ice pack to make sure they didn't melt. The chocolates from Amazon where shipped in a regular box, most of the chocolates where melted into a solid block. They were also dry and crusty. I would think that Godiva would have to same standards no matter how people order their products. I'm a very unsatisfied customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and overpriced","review":"Bought a 12-piece box of Godiva truffles at a brick-and-mortar bookstore. Priced at $25, but had a $10 off coupon. At this price these should be melt in your mouth delicious morsels of chocolatey goodness. Nope. Inside the chocolate shell is not a lovely, rich ganache, but a variety of ... I don't know what. Some are a caramel sort of stuff, some are this overly sweet, not so tasty white stuff. These are on par with what you might get cheap at a drug store. Actually, I even prefer Lindt truffles, which you can get three for the price of one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale","review":"These arrived very promptly, but they seem to have languished on the shelf for months, given how stale they were. I can't recommend that these be purchased from any reseller, but Water Skin's supply seems way past the shelf life of the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best electronic album of '98","review":"Air's Moon Safari is one of the first foreign albums that I have invested in. This is an imaginative, diverse CD that any fan of quality music will enjoy. If one word had to be used to describe this album, that word would be \\"Chill.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth operators","review":"Very cool, calm and composed. I usually play this one just before I go to bed. Sit yourself on the veranda, get a beer, light up a cigarette and press play. A better cure for a sore head than ibuprofen, this is truly great and I recommend it to anyone with any sense or taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"genius","review":"I bought this album on the strength of Sexy Boy and was absolutely astounded at the depth and variety it had to offer.As someone who mainly buys indie and alternative rock music I was surprised at the extent to which this album appealed to me.Every track has something new to offer and yet they flow together perfectly, taking one track away from the selection would break the balance. My favourite songs on the album have to be All I need and La Femme D'Argent, the former a dreamy, mellow beautiful track whilst the latter a jazzy, funky number.This is the sort of album I want people to know I own because it is that good. Everytime I play it I feel like I should be in some drinks lounge, 70's style, or alternatively on a sunny beach with the sun setting (a cliche true but this album produces a base reaction that defies thought). Since buying Moon Safari I have expanded my music tastes, so I have Air to thank for introducing me to music that doesn't just contain guitars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh ...? Really?","review":"I very much enjoy Zero 7 music and bought this CD hoping to experience the same bliss.Unfortunately I stand much disappointed. Most of the tracks sound short of inspiration and kind of cheesy to my ear.This style of music skates on thin ice, often close to lapsing in the dreaded \\"background/elevator music\\" category.That's my honest - if perhaps too harsh, assessment of Moon Safari. Not sure if other CDs from Air would fare better?Oh well, the music quest cannot be always satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I'm a collector of ambient & electronic music, from Jean Michel Jarre to Eno to Ulrich Schnauss, music from the very masters of electronica. This album had somehow slipped through the cracks for me. What a masterpiece! It brings back all sorts of memories, like perhaps I heard it in the background through the 90's & 00's but never knew what it was. A truly brilliant album. Put it on your Ipod to listen to at 38,000 feet, put it on for some sophisticated background sounds at your party, or put it on just to listen to. A true pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM","review":"Every song on this album felt so familiar. Definitely a recommendation for those who are into new wave music. Down tempo music, each song very different from the other, and great vocals. Creative album indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap vinly","review":"The vinyl adds 0 quality to this music. In fact, this purchase after 1 play is going back. The music is mediocre at best. Nothing inventive and alot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely 80's","review":"late 70's Early 80's, If you like that stuff... I purchased this under the recommendation that it sounded like Massive Attack.... It Is Nothing like Massive Attack! Total 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I don't understand how this album has a better rating than Talkie Walkie. The songs on this album bored me death. Everyone seems to prefer this album over Air's other albums but I think Talkie Walkie is much better. I liked nearly every song on Talkie Walkie and I only liked a few moments on Moon Safari. Overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Air's Best - But Already Very Good","review":"Air's first album 'Moon Safari' is the least brilliant of the band's albums so far.Still, it is a very worthwile buy.Sometimes it sounds like music which can be used for tv series, like 'Talisman'. Or 'Ce Matin Là' with its horn sounds and bubbling synths.The spacey 'Sexy Boy' is very early-1980ish and must be a dance floor hit. Funny and great track, a lot more optimistic and relaxed than most Air stuff. 'Kelly Watch The Stars' is another great song - the favourite song of many an Air fan. The way it uses the synthesizer effects is simple but well-arranged in the smallest detail.At the lower end of the scale are the two songs on which Beth Hirsch sings the lead vocals. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was Okay...","review":"This CD was a little less than I was expecting from it. Only liked about 3 tracks on it, and only one of those blew my socks off. I probably would not buy it again if I could go back."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever?","review":"The other day I got in my car for a long trip, and I randomly found Moon Safari on my iPod and gave it a whirl. I hadn't heard it in a while, but as it ran through I realized that even though this album is TEN (wow!) years old, it still sounds fresh and perhaps is one of the best CDs I've ever heard (and the final track is perhaps one of the best album closers of all time). I am eternally grateful to my friend Blake who introduced me to Air all those years ago. If I were stranded on a desert island with only an iPod and a few tracks to listen to, this would most definitely be on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic music","review":"I'm not a fan of France, French food or Frenchmen in general, but I am a huge fan of this French duo. They're incredible musicians - very talented and in a league all of their own. With Air it's the music, which says it all, not the lyrics, but the music is so vivid, so cinematic, that it creates all kinds of images and stories in your mind. Most critics and fans seem to agree that Moon Safari is their masterpiece, and they may be right, but personally I just can't make up my mind; I love Premier Symptomes, Talkie Walkie, and Pocket Symphony just as much. Life wouldn't be the same without Air."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Dance songs please","review":"This is probably the french duo's best album to date, however i don't really know where they stand cause the variation of the songs is huge. Some are catchy dance-pop\\" Kelli watch the stars\\" some others almsot sound like Jazz \\"Talisman\\" who would have thought Air made them both?. \\"You make it easy\\" is almost a ballad, quite boring if yoy go all the way to the store to get a dance album, and when you get back 50% of the songs are something else.\\"Ce Matin La\\" is a nice one, slow and romantic with someone playing the trumpet, no dance once again. \\"All i need\\" is allright, but more like pop, with a female singer making the lyrics. i like \\"Remember\\" \\"Kelly Watch the stars\\" and \\"Sexy Boy\\" which are all pure dance, could they make some more of that kind i would judge this cd alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album? Not even close....","review":"First off, I bought this after purchasing many chillout discs. In total, I own over 500 CD's. I listen to a lot of music and I am very selective.This album is not five stars or even close in my opinion. First, I hardly call most of these cuts 'songs.' They play more like experimental music tracks where vocals are an after thought. The guys shouldn't be singing. Period. The so called hit Sexy Boy is annoying, Remember is ridiculously sentimental nothingness and Talisman sounds like a piano riff in which they just kept piling on the sound effects. I gave this a chance, listend to it five times over a month and I grew less and less interested and more and more annoyed. Granted, Talkie Walkie is better.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"256 Reviews","review":"Maybe I should have read a few more reviews. This is what I think music will sound like in 2010. 2 robots on computers playing pleasant music, but no real heart or emotion. They claim to play bass and guitar but it still sounds synthetic to me. I didn't notice if there was a real drummer, and often it doesn't matter especially for this kind of music, but the whole thing lacks something. It's not bad music, it's perfectly fine to listen to, but wouldn't you rather spend your money on something that is really great, like Theivery Corporation or Zero 7? I'd pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered Down Trash","review":"This record is the biggest disappointment I have ever suffered. After reading the positive reviews on Amazon.com and having a couple friends recommend it I went out and bought it. I thought track #1 which was not all that impressive at least showed some promise because it had a decent beat and bass line. Unfortunately, this mediocre track turned out to be the best on the album as it was all down hill from there. From what I remember from that 1st (and last) listening, the remainder of the album was filled with bubble gum music that reminded me more of the Partridge Family than of the other groups which some people mistakenly identify Air with like Massive Attack and FatBoy Slim (my apologies to those groups for referencing them in an Air review). This CD will never come out of its box again unless someone offers me 25 cents or more to take it off my hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the same mistake","review":"I got suckered with this CD. Some buddies of mine recommended it and I got burned. The CD stinks: I think it's the worst CD in my library (I have over 600 CD's), it's a mushy mixture of bs; you can't dance on it you can't flick your head on it. It's a good CD if you're on drugs :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Could Give No Stars","review":"Just think of the words one would use to describe bad music in general -- repititive, undeveloped, lyrically weak, forgettable, etc . -- and what does one have? answer: Air. Do not -- I repeat DO NOT -- be fooled by any of the positive reviews given this record. You will be highly disappointed and in such a bad mood you might end kicking your dog or something. And, animals should not be abused because a couple of guys from France make a real trashy record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want My Money Back","review":"This record is the absolute pits. A blind date recommended it to me and little did I know she was deaf too. Air has managed do to the grossly unthinkable: borrowing and combining the worst elements of techno, rock, funk and pop into one watered down waste of plastic. Seriously, these guys have less musical talent and energy than Air Supply. The whole record sounds like background music at a cheap hair salon or something. Save yourself $15 and steer clear of this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks!","review":"I got this download with the $5.00 Amazon gave me for my purchases. The CD has great music on it and I'm very happy with it.Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is One","review":"..One of the few PERFECT albums in existence. The first time I heard this CD I was floored. Anybody who can listen to a song like \\"All I Need\\" and not be moved must be dead. Truly amazing. This is a \\"must buy\\" for any music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Chiiiilllll Out!!!","review":"Chill out comes in many forms however Air have got it down to a \\"T\\" with Moon Safari. Unlike many chillout DJ's who persist on using silly percusion samples and a little melody Air have got a winning formular. These tracks are chilling and have substance to them. Their long synthesiser chords carry their tunes whilst giving you breathing space to imagine. Some of these tracks are a little up beat (Kelly Watch The Stars) however even these are brilliant.I would have to say just like many others that Moon Safari is their best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows On You","review":"I put this album in my cd player a few days ago, after having gone months without a single listen. I had bought this cd almost 2 years ago, and enjoyed it, but over time it faded away. I put it in for kicks and was blown away. EVERY SINGLE TRACK is amazing, I wouldnt skip around if you payed me. It's a journey, an experience in your head that can only be described as my favourite fantasy. So dim the lights, put on moon safari, and say goodbye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits its target right on the mark","review":"This CD is a crafty mix of retro electronica treats. There is a LOT of mini-moog on here that gives it the throwback feel and it verges into some pretty serious French-ness at times but that doesn't take away from the overall effect. Clever, carefully produced music."},{"rating":"2","title":"... sipping Dom Perignon plus listening to Air....","review":"Heard the song \\"Remember\\" while walking to a bookstore and it just blew my top away! I purchased it immediately and it has been in my fave collections since... NO ONE will be disappointed to buy this album, unless they are clueless of course... more powere to the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album.....","review":"I found this album on a listening station at tower records and was instantly hooked. Just a total spacey/trance feel to the whole album. I still listen to it all the time even after 8 months or so since I bought it. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh and mesmerizing new sound that ages well","review":"Most audiophiles will listen to an album over and over if they truly like it. I must have listened to Moon Safari 30 times in a row I was so drawn in and mesmerized by the music. It is so hard for a band to create a sound that is truly new and unique without going off the deep end. These guys have done it. I like a lot of the so-called Electronica genre, but nothing comes close to this. I have had the album for ten months now, and it is almost as fresh today as it was when I first listened to it. I can't wait for their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"participating in a cool new genre.","review":"good album. i've only got one comment - has anyone out there heard \\"sacre bleu\\" by dimitri? same genre, far superior. bouncy, moogy, french lounge-electronica. i wish there were more artists venturing into lounge territory with electronic music. i couldn't belive \\"sacre bleu\\" wasn't on the \\"if you like this, you'll also like this.....\\" section of the web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GEM IN A MINEFIELD","review":"Mellow, striking, original, sexy, cool, a cross between Kraftwerk, Jean Michel Jarre and Tangerine Dream, with a couple of tracks with some beautiful lady singer. A must!You can't go wrong with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album...","review":"This album is great. Moon Safari manages to appeal to many different emotional states of being for me, while maintaining a cool, fresh, ubiquitous aura of calmness. Air melds several different musical \\"styles\\" extremely well together, such that, it's difficult to truly finger what really is the preeminent musical style on this album.Every track has something unique and great to offer. Most all listeners with an open mind will find this album laudable.Highlights: \\"Kelly Watch the Stars,\\" \\"Sexy Boy,\\" \\"Voyage de Penelope\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, Ambient & Very Cool","review":"A great album, wonderfully produced and dreamy. I put this on when its raining outside...Air has created a lush soundscape bringing in slow, deep mogs and simple drum beats. Not one song is off track on this ablum... there is a song for every part of a single night. You can put this on as you go for a midnight drive, or as you sleep. My favorite tracks are, \\"All I Need\\" & \\"You Make it Easy\\". I love the female vocals.If you like Solar Twins, Squarepusher's \\"Budakhan Mindfone\\", Underworld or Sneaker Pimps... you need to get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd, near perfection","review":"This is one fantastic cd. A real genuine effort, although it doesn't reach perfection, it is well worth purchasing. A couple tracks drag on a bit too long, but otherwise it is all good. Standouts include Sexy Boy and Kelly watch the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"drifting on cloud nine!","review":"Man, this is not an album, its a vehicle; it floats you on a cloud into a land of lullabies and day dreams, it takes you to a vast dusky landscape inside of yourself and shows you parts of your soul that you didn't know existed before, evoking the nostalgia of happy childhood playgrounds in \\"talisman\\", forcing you to recognize and appreciate emotions that have been left stale inside you until that first sumptuous listen. Allow different levels of your consciousness to be stimulated: the superficial but satirical \\"sexy boy\\", your very own heart strings manipulated as Godin and Dunckel strum out, among others, \\"all i need\\", let your own feelings be pinpointed and accentuated by \\"you make it easy\\" and relive your magic moments over and over again to the whispers of \\"remember\\". Surrender, embrace and let yourself be taken over by pure sonic emotion. Don't be afraid to look inside the parts of yourself that it opens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy and beautiful","review":"Air, just the name. This CD is almost as necessary as air. I love it and for the past 1 1/2 year I've listened to it all the time. It's just wonderful, and you can listen to it when you do homework, housework or when you read. The opening track \\"Ce matin la\\" is my fave together with \\"All I need\\" (which has a wonderfully sweet video) and \\"Talisman\\". Air songs are featured in a lot of movie soundtracks, cause it's great background music. I can mention \\"She's all that\\" and \\"Go\\", together with TV show \\"Felicity\\". Air is out with a new Cd now, and I'll buy it today, no question."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Relaxed!","review":"This album is great to relax to. If you're stressed then this is 4 u. The first time i heard this album i felt like i had never been stressed in my life. Buy this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd rate it more than 5 stars if I could","review":"All I have to say is WOW! I have never heard anything like AIR before! If it were not for seeing their video, \\"Sexy Boy\\" on MTV, I would have never heard of them. I am usually not the type of person who buys a CD after hearing just one song, but I did this when I heard \\"Sexy Boy.\\" This entire CD is absolutely unbelievable. Why can't there be more innovative, creative bands like AIR out there? This band is in a category all their own. Not only is their music relaxing and soothing, it has so much depth to it. Each song is so different. This is by far one of my favorite CDs and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates unique bands like AIR. I can't wait to go get Premiere Symptomes. Go out and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My god! Too sexy! hehe! :-)","review":"Alright, if you don't like the track \\"Sexy Boy\\" you, my friend, HAVE A PROBLEM! Sexy Boy is just a downright fun song! If it doesn't make you shake your booty then chances are you are a parapalegic (no offense to anyone with disabilities of course). The rest of the songs on this cd are also great. Maybe not quite as rump shakin' as Sexy Boy, but melodic and beautiful just the same. And for those people who have been bad mouthing this album, go listen to Backstreet Boys you bumcheeks! :-) hehe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Air: Modern guiet with eighties synthesizer background","review":"I first listened to this CD, at the restaurant where I work. Air is quiet, easy consumable music and yet different and interesting. Most tracks are instrumental but few of my favorites include vocals. These are: All I Need and You Make It Easy. Air's soothing combination of ordinary slow music with the 80's synthesizer background makes it suitable for background music in almost any intension. Air is pure modern acoustic art."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smooth liquid ride to a beautiful place","review":"I heard \\"all I need\\" on the radio when we were in the bay area and I knew I needed this but since I live in an \\"electronica wasteland\\" I had no clue who it was. We Got home and I went to radio shack to buy a FM reception booster to strech the signal to the Central Valley . Total frustration as the booster wasn't quite cutting it. PAYDIRT - RADIOALICE played an ad for AIR while I was tweaking the worthless antenna. I've been blissing out to the ultra-mellow sounds on this album ever since. It is mmmmmgood for whatever ailes ya. Plug in, lay back and ENJOY!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb.","review":"What can I say about this album? It's superb. It's more than just an album, it's a mood. Subtle, evocative, fresh, mellow, and all around smooth. I have had this CD for over six months now and it still maintains MVP status in my CD carousel. It's difficult to find words to effectively express my appreciation for this CD. A perfect accompaniement to any aspect of one's day, particularly for driving, or quiet contemplative time at home. Perhaps one of the best CD's I've bought, EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and supple. Something comfy to slip into.","review":"I first heard Moon Safari while browsing through Urban Outfitters in Boulder, Co. None of the kids working knew who it was, and it took quite a bit of detective work before I finally discovered this group's name. \\"La Femme D'Argent\\" is an extra-smooth shot of mellow, grooving bass line with a tingly Rhodes lead. \\"All I Need\\" features an exceptional female vocal and is just as silky. \\"Sexy Boy\\" is my least favorite track, but this album still rates an easy five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it","review":"i bought this cd after hearing a short snippet of \\"sexy boy\\", which i loved immediately-- the rest of the album is even better. really chill music, kind of spacey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joyride to the Moon?","review":"I enjoy listening to this, although this is just electronic music, no big deal. This is enjoyable, realy! I love listening to this, yeah,although I am the only one who thinks 'Virgin Suicide'is better than this one, this is music you can listen to days and nights without getting sick of it. Actually, only a few albums managed to do that to me, Portishead's 'Dummy', Dimitri From Paris' 'Sacred Bleu', Morcheeba's 'Big Calm' 'Fantastic Plastic Machine' and all the albums from Cocteau Twins, of course, with the exception of Portishead and Cocteau Twins, the rest are in no way considered as classics. However, they are candy to the ears, that's why I like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"If God has a CD player.","review":"If God has a cd player, He listens to the Moon Safary at sunday evening. And antilopes from Zair are listenig to the light notes while standing at the savannah. Moon light plays on their hairs. Soundwave goes out of galaxy to infinity.CLOSE your eyes and pretend you are antilope."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing experience","review":"I bought this CD on a whim after hearing 'Kelly Watch the Stars'. After flicking through some some random CDs in a shop I came across 'Moon Safari' and the cover seemed to jump out at me - even the graphics seemed to sum up my mood. When I went home and listened to it I could not believe my luck at making such an extroadinary find. The meloncholy first track simply stopped me in my tracks and it didn't stop there, every note on the album gives you a kind of fazed out, laid back coolness that is a good philosophy for life. Slow down, chill out and listen to Air, you'll never look back. A superb album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excelent Saturday Soundtrack","review":"I baught this disc on friday night, and didn't get around to listening to it till saturday morning. What an excelent album. It's like a soundtrack for a day of relaxation. highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to chill....","review":"This is truly the prescription. If listened to softly, some of the greatest backup noise to life I've ever heard. At a loud volume it completely slows time to a stop. All it makes you want to do is take time out to listen. I've never before heard music beckon me. If that even slightly describes what you want, buy it. If you are hyper and need to get things done, be forewarned and don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Air French Band.","review":"Great techno rhythm fused with a retro beat. Sort of '70s meets the Millennium. Mostly instrumental with a few wonderful works with Beth Hirsch, whose voice is amazing. Every track is great, but Kelly Watch The Stars, All I Need and You Make It Easy are exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Good","review":"I didn't exptect much from a band from France (except surrender anthems), but what I heard has now raised the bar for bands from France, The US, and around the globe. A great album from start to finish. The albume starts out with \\"La Femme D'argent\\" which sounds like the opening song to a 1960's, futuristic, space exploration, blackxploitaton, flick with bad special effects, that I haven't seen, but now must rent. Its funky bass riffs provide a great foundation for the hauntingly familiar, spacey, echoing, guitar and mini moog to build on. It is like instrumental Beastie Boys meets Logan's Run meets Shaft.

There is not a new armonic progression or melody. It's all in some previous work: Sylvie Vartan, Serge Gainsbourg, Ennio Morricone, progressive music, the electronic scene of the late seventies, the string-based arrangements... the album would have gone unnoticed at the time of \\"Video Killed the Video Stars\\" or \\"Visage\\". The charm of these songs is that they are inoffensive: they are restatements of music you have heard forever. I give the musicians the benefit of the doubt: they really wanted to make music for hairdressers. The only song with some quality is \\"All I need\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"woth it just for \\"La Femme D'Argent\\"","review":"I bought this CD after hearing the tune \\"La Femme D'Argent\\" as the background music on a very funny youtube video.

The radio has never fulfilled anything for me, and I was growing tired of all of my current CDs. I listened to this at a record store and had to get it at that moment. Air is an excellent pioneer in their field and will pave the way for many sounds to come. I now await every release they put out. Just got \\"10,000 Hz Legend\\" and can't wait till the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synthesizer ambience isn't dead","review":"How difficult is it to make a seventies-synthesizer easy-listening album sound fresh? This French duo makes it sound all so simple, though in reality it's an admirable feat.Lush textures create dreamy atmospheres, which are all very pleasing to the ear. The inspiration is woven throughout the album. Many people call this a must-have, and I am inclined to agree, though I must wait to see if it is an album that can create a lasting impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Pop Jazzy Bliss","review":"This is my introduction to Air and I bought it soley on the reviews on Amazon and the style of music. I have to agree with the positive reviewers, this is great stuff. It is so unnobtrusive you could play it any time, but it's so cool and interesting you can, well... play it anytime. There is heavy use of vocoders but it fits the music so doesn't bother me. Beth Hirsch's vocals are just beautiful on 2 songs.Like a previous reviewer said, all the songs are good, you don't have to skip any. I am going to see what else I can find of theirs and snatch it up, highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sway","review":"This is the pinnacle of sit back and relax albums. It doesn't put you in a trance, it just makes you feel serene, but also lazy, my motivation seems to disappear when I listen to this. Air are extremely gifted at crafting a beautiful melody. I personally am tired with all the emphasis on rhythm in electronic music. This album is filled to the brim with them, the first and best song on the album starts with a cliche water sound, then all these melodies just come and go, little hand claps show themselves, and its 7 minutes long and it could be double that and it wouldn't be boring. So, as most know, the stoners have united and proclaimed their chill-out music to be this album, you can join them if you wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it...","review":"If you are a fan of this band or just like instrumental/electronic music-you should purchase this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely 100% Genuinely TERRIBLE","review":"I can safely say that this is the worst album I have ever heard. Listen to \\"Sexy Boy\\" and you'll see. This song is sooooooooooo bad. SO bad. SO SO SO SO SO BAD. It is so immature, I could write a better song than this. I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and dump a better song than this. AIR HAS NO TALENT, WHATSOEVER. It's really hard for me to hate a group but I ABSOLUTELY DESPISE AIR. DONT BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU KNOW WHATS GOOD FOR YOU!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn, I'm Disappointed.","review":"I bought this CD without knowing what it was about. I knew the songs \\"Kelly, Watch the Stars\\" and \\"Sexy Boy\\", and as I liked them so much, I decided to buy the album. Thruth is the first time of listening to it, I hated it. I thought all the songs would be as creatively bizzare as the 2 songs I already knew. I have listened to it more, and another track that I liked well was \\"Remember Me\\", and maybe \\"New Star In the Sky\\", but I gotta say the rest of the songs definitively don't stand out. I hated tracks like \\"All I Need\\", which reminded me of Zero 7. I didn't like the voice of the girl singing, it bored me to death to listen to her... I feel like I've wasted my money. I don't think it's an album that grows on you... it sounds nothing very special, and I didn't like most of the elements since they're to simple, but in a bad way. I prefered Talkie Walkie better, a more complex album, with more evolutioned technologies and ideas, and peculiar songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"dull.

I see all the other bad reviews and they're getting very low percentage for how helpful they are, and I can't help but think that all those votes are from Air-affiliated entities.

It's kind of a hard rubber and it's stuffed with some kind of weird poly cottony looking stuffing. Why do I know this? I know because my pups immediately bit a hole in the chicken's tail and began to \\"kill the chicken\\" and pull the stuffing out of it. If you have a dog that loves the soft rubber chickens without stuffing in them, this is NOT the bird for you. If you're looking for a hard rubber chicken with poly-whatever stuffing, knock yourself out. I will say this - the noise this chicken makes is hysterically funny. It's not a chirp. Heck, it's not even a cluck. That thing sounds like a dying chicken. VERY, VERRRRRRY FUNNY to hear.

It is a must for all the specialists and beginners in phonetic transcription. At last, we have a general and compact presentation of the current version of IPA, also throwing new light on the rationale of some choices that were not clear or explicit enough in the papers appeared in the Journal of the IPA. A new symbol (for the retroflex implosive of Sindhi) is also added, together with some proposals for a wider usage of little apex letters. I would have appreciated still more details on the (clumsy and much debatable) solutions proposed by present IPA for tonal notations: I feel definitely more at ease on Yuanren Chao's side! The choice of sample languages is quite balanced as for families and geographical distribution. In my opinion, however, the languages should also have been chosen also because of their sociolinguistic relevance.

It also leaves me time to do at least one other favorite routine from another DVD (yoga stretches, arms, abs, etc.) for a balanced early morning workout. I would recommend this DVD for anyone who is at least intermediate level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Democracy First, Capitalism Second","review":"This book is the recipe for a corporate oligarchy. Democracy in and of itself is virutous. The will of the people is ALWAYS more important than the will of some unelected body (aka the supreme court, or, even worse, a corporate board like the WTO). Fareed Zakaria is my enemy because he is an enemy of democracy, the only true government."},{"rating":"2","title":"reexamine precepts","review":"I read Niall Ferguson's review of this book in the New York Times and thought it sounded like a tract: arguments on why democracy shouldn't be considered appropriate in certain countries once it became clear that election outcome would support interests contrary to the overseeing power. It called to mind how Algeria's elections, which pointed to a fundamentalist outcome, were cast aside by the military government, and how the US recently ignored the UN when the vote wasn't looking favorable to its ambitions. So on reading the work, I was extraordinarily surprised to discover that its tone is reasonable and the evidence adduced is substantial and well considered. So my knee-jerk rejection of the thesis has been stalled, for how long I cannot say. In any case, Zakaria writes well and has the makings of a wise man, though my impression is that he is quite young. Do read this book, even if you reject the conclusion: it is soundly argued and worth a rebuttal."},{"rating":"1","title":"CFR 101 Textbook","review":"Hoping some of you 5 star reviewers will consider the following on where Mr Zakaria's ideology originates.The book is praised by Henry Kissinger - Board Member, Council on Foreign Relations.The book praises the CFR, Federal Reserve and EU - no debate, the best institutions on the planet.The book calls for less democracy, not more.The book is praised by Richard Holbrook - Board Member, Council on Foreign Relations.Oh, and Mr Zakaria - Board Member, Council on Foreign Relations.You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand his elitist leanings.Let's give up the vote now or to put it in his words:\\"We have decided that although we cannot file our tax forms, write our wills, or configure our computers, we can pass laws ourselves.\\" Pg 247-248Hope you all like being told what to do if he runs for President one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Believe","review":"It's amazing that this drivel has been getting so much good press. It is hastilly-written, badly argued and poorly researched. It was rushed into publication so as to come out while the conflict in the Middle East was still hot. Exploitive? You betcha. The recording, at least, benefits from the sonorous tones of an excellent narrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to get there from here","review":"Mr. Zakaria's key insight is to distinguish between democracy as a process to elect governments, and constitutional liberalism (i.e. the rule of law where individual rights are protected) as a resulting government which citizens want. He then reviews efforts to introduce democracy before consitutional liberalism and the reverse.This book is very insightful, particularly as we grapple with how to extend the benefits of open societies to other cultures. He also has insights about how to improve our own government, which might be suffering from the ills of democracy sliding into demagoguery. Solution? Like Madison said in the Federalist Papers, get the checks and balances right so tyranny of the majority of the moment doesn't destroy the whole system. Read this one, and I guarantee you will start giving it to your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zakaria Is Right, but Hardly Novel","review":"Democracy is a means not an end. The end is maximum freedom and adequate order. The founding fathers knew this. Walter Lippman reminded us continuously of this before WW II (The Public Philosophy). Even Lani Guanier knew this. Democracy must be surrounded by non-democratic, or even anti-democratic institutions -- Constitution, Bill of Rights, two house legislature, presedential veto, separation of powers, independent judiciary, judicial review, extraordinary majorities (>50% vote needed to ammend constitution).... to be safe for freedom. It's time again we thought of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A calm, balanced look at current events, pay attention","review":"I have to say at the start that I do not agree with everything Zakaria puts forth in this book. There are some pretty big claims made without a whole lot to back them up. However, Zakaria is not a \\"political scholar\\" in the way that someone like Benjamin Barber is, so he shouldn't necessarily by held to the same standard.Zakaria deserved to be read and listened to because of his approach. He has contributed to the discussion of American foreign policy without mindlessly regurgitating rhetoric from either side of the debate. You don't get the sense that he is a Republican or conservative, but at the same time he's willing to give Bush credit when he thinks Bush deserves it. This is a refreshing take on the subject of democracy and one that should be read by everyone concerned with the subject, regardless of their political beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!

I may be wrong, but the seal is a permanent mark and didn't understand a new book with a seal is on the market. Hope the seller will explain on this review.Other than this particular problem, it's a great price for clean new paperback book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Interesting","review":"Per usual Zakaria delivers an excellent insight into the shaping of liberty through the ages. He quickly removes the birth of liberty from Greece and gives it to the Romans who really began rule of law.As a college student this book was perfect for discussing the importance of constitutional liberty and a brief history of Western Democracy.I would have liked to see more discussion of US politics currently including a revised edition that tackles the Obama era. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Fareed Zakaria's book is an excellent read for anyone interested in world affairs. He successfully entertains while teaching the reader about where in the world democracy is thriving, and offers his own explanations as to why it has been less than successful in certain regions. Bringing together the economic factors often neglected in discussions of democracy and freedom, Zakaria shows that without establishing a framework where people can make an honest living first, a democratic society is likely to wind up democratically giving up freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great images and inspiring for photographers","review":"If you love old style Hollywood photography this book is a must for your collection. My only wish was that it showed some of the lighting and techniques used to take the images.

I've tossed the Nukote in the trash. It's not even worth the time and effort to send it back to the vendor. Also, the Nukote's orange plastic pull-tab broke off of the plastic strip while I was pulling to remove it prior to installing the cartridge in the printer. I managed to finish extracting it from the cartridge by pulling on the bare end of the plastic strip, but with difficulty.

Even with a CD copy, I would still buy an original, if it were available.This CD is rare in that you've got a fab beat, and yet, you can just CHILL, if you want. This is one of the few gems in my collection that would make me get ratty if someone damaged my copy. Buy a used copy - if you can find it - or copy it, if you haven't yet heard it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Of Body Experience","review":"This song is the epitamy of all trance/rave style songs.

I've seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a \\"travel-friendly\\" Swiss Army tool (not knife).Nevertheless, the unit I have is the 64MB version of:ASIN: B0002VM8ZM...which costs considerably less (~$30) on Amazon, has the same 128MB USB drive and red light as the unit on this page, plus you get a small quantity of Swiss Army tools INCLUDING a knife. Unless you are concerned about going on a plane, I'd recommend the ASIN: B0002VM8ZM over the unit on this page. BTW, I got my handy little 64MB unit (which I'd give four stars for if I had the option) for only $9.99 on clearance at Target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a bit mislead...","review":"Maybe I should read the description better, but I was disapointed to find out, when receiving it, that this is JUST a USB Key with a pen and anemic led light.No \\"swiss army stuff\\".

I love thrillers so I read it in an afternoon despite myself. But...there were few hints as to who would turn out to be the good guys and who were the bad guys.Good writing, even for popular \\"good reads\\", should have some foreshadowing, some clues as to how the story might resolve itself. This story ended with a bizarre twist that one could not have expected. I felt like I was riding a roller coaster in the dark, getting a whiplash ending.For those who like a thrilling, whiplash kind of read you may like this book.

For some reason I forgot about her until I came across this piece, \\"Whispers and Lies\\" on the sale shelf in the store. I was pleased to find it and did not hesitate in purchasing it. Anyway, after reading this novel I was very surprised to see so many negative reviews as I found it to be a remarkable piece of fiction. The characterization and plot line are fantastic and will you be surprised at the end! I never expected the outcome to be what it was. Don't hesitate in getting a hold of this title, you absolutely will not be disappointed! I am happy to have re-discovered this author and I do look forward to reading some more of her titles. Highly, highly recommended.Guy De RosaLos Angeles, California"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond disappointing","review":"I found nothing to enjoy in this book. Not the writing, the characters, or the plot. The moment Alison showed up, I figured out who/what she was to nurse Terry. Then I was baffled and annoyed by the odd cast of characters who followed. They didn't enhance the story, but rather left a bunch of loose ends trailing like sodden leaves stuck to one's shoes after a walk in bad weather.As readers, I believe we have a right to expect at least one character in a story to appeal to us. An animal, even. But nobody (human or otherwise) appealed in this overly melodramatic book. I've not read Joy Fielding before; I won't be doing so again.This is one of those instances where, if this novel had been submitted by a new, unpublished author, it wouldn't have garnered him or her an agent, much less a publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book that would create a Joy Fielding fan","review":"I picked this up off a resort bookshelf when I needed something to read that could be read without much concentration. I had no experience with Joy Fielding's books, nor do I read many mysteries. I am interested to read reviews that claim this author has written some compelling books, because this was fairly sophomoric and inane. Loose ends like crazy, main events that were absurdly unbelievable,unrealistic characters and a final plot twist that came off as a desperate attempt to make something out of nothing--plus the book is poorly written. Perhaps this author has reached a point where her fans will read anything she writes, good or bad? I assume this book was left at the resort because it wasn't worth taking back home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the review","review":"This book was quite honestly very long and drawn out for the first eighteen chapters. Nothing really happened. I guessed who Alison was to Terry very early on and I had a \\"so what\\" feeling about it. There was not continuity to the plot twist. More suspense was needed. The character of Alison was very shallow. This is one to pass on."},{"rating":"1","title":"O M G","review":"I READ THE BOOK AND IT BECAME MY FAVORITE BOOK.

I only finished the book out of compulsion to be done with it. The ending did not seem to go with the first part of the book. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute trash - waste of time","review":"I'd never read a JF book before so came into this with no expectations. She is a writer for those who don't read. It was almost written toward high-schoolers - no, that would insult them - every sentence is laced with cheap foreshadowing and theatrical sense of foreboding. The ending (I skipped through much of the book as it was unbelievably predictable) throws facts into the book to make the plot make sense. You can almost hear the fright-flick movie soundtracks in the background reaching a psycho-like crescendo when she stabs the two at the end. Thousands of good books out there - don't bother with this one. Unfortunately I won't be picking up another JF book anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A twisting ride with Fielding.","review":"Joy Fielding brings us another great read. In Whispers and Lies, Terry Painter rents her cottage out back to Alison Simms. Her new roommate seems to good to be true and Terry and Allison become fast friends. However, is Alison here as a threat to Terry?Soon things in Alison life don't add up and Terry suspects that she isn't telling her the truth about her intentions. Terry paranoia gets the best of her as phone calls from a man start and someone always seems to be lurking in the shadows of her place. After Terry reads Alison diary, she is sure that Alison is a threat to her.This book takes you on a roller coaster ride from start to finish, twisting and turning and throwing everything you thought upside down. Enjoy the ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book left me feeling depressed","review":"This was the third book I have read by Joy Fielding. I loved See Jane Run and Grand Avenue, so I had high hopes for Whispers and Lies.Right away I knew this book wasn't going to reach that high, as I disliked the main character, Terry, from the start. Allison wasn't much better -- I found her annoying at best. There's a part when Terry ponders 'listen to your instincts' and, as a reader, you want to yell WHAT DO YOUR INSTINCTS SAY ABOUT A 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO HANGS OUT WITH 20-SOMETHING DRINKERS AND DRUGGIES?Ranting over, the book isn't bad, but unbelievable. When the \\"surprise\\" twist at the end finally happens, you think \\"A-HA!\\" for about a minute, then realize this is just as boring as the first 280 pages.If you are a fan of Fielding, don't hold this book against her. If you've never read a book by her before, don't read this one first. It will turn you against her writing and she has some great stories out there. Read those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Oh woe is me. Just when you think this book can't get any worse, it does. Silly, predictable, filled with cliches and oftentimes I cringed in embarrassment that such drivel could actually be published.What a sad assortment of characters...spineless, indecisive, wishy washy Terry, annoying, grate on your nerves, Allison and a melange of unsavory males who are always lurking right outside Terry's window or making crank calls. I'm only grateful that this was obtained from the library and not an actual purchase. If anyone feels compelled to read it, I'd suggest you take the same route"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Manipulative","review":"This book is the most manipulative book I've ever read in my life, and I'm a two-book-a-week-reader. I was so startled, angry and appalled at the climax and denouement of this novel, that I gasped aloud and wanted to throw the book across the room. Instead, when I finished, I threw it in the trash. Why one of my favorite authors would write this is just bewildering to me. I've loved all of Joy Fielding's past books. What happened here? People in my book group complained that Dennis Lehane's book, \\"Shutter Island\\" was manipulative. They should read this one! I'm still angry, months later. Joy, you can do so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"After I finished this book last night I felt like I needed to take a long, hot shower. I have read almost every book by this author and enjoyed them for the most part, but this book was the exception.Yes, it was a page turner, but like another reader I kept thinking \\"get to the point!\\". I could have also done without the animal cruelty, which I had to skip over. The characters, especially Terry the nurse, were very unlikable.When I got the end I felt disgusted. I expect better from this author! And some of the things didn't add up, like Terry's odd reaction to the food and drink on all of the holidays. If you want a cheap read, go ahead and read this but don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"It's hard to believe this same author wrote \\"Grand Avenue\\" which was such a richly developed story. \\"Whispers and Lies\\" appears to have been written in a few days, with a reading level that almost approaches grammar school. This happens all too frequently with an author who feels confident that everyone will buy his or her books once they have have achieved a reputation based on earlier works. I don't see how Joy Fielding would even put her name on such garbage, much less write it. She certainly has lost this reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad...until last few chapters","review":"I felt somewhat manipulated after reading this book. The story leads the reader in one direction for the first 3/4 of the book and then does a prompt, unexpected, out-of-nowhere about face in the last several chapters. I have no problem with plot twists...some of the best books and movies have them...but this one occurred in the span of 1 page, came from out of NOWHERE, and didn't fit at all with the book I thought I'd been reading up until that point. The character's demeanors, attitudes, and motives -- developed throughout the story -- completely changed within a few pages with no time for the reader to adjust to or process the consequences within the context of the plot. The degeneration of the plot from that point on was swift and disappointing. Once I'd finished the book and thought back through what I'd read, it almost like these last few chapters had been tacked on from the ending of a different book. Overall, it left me disappointed and unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved Grand Avenue and was very excited to read this book. It was hard to get into and very unrealistic towards the end. I would not recommend Whispers and Lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prize for the dumbest heroine","review":"I totally agree with the previous reviewer. This is not a book I would have chosen to read if I had known anything about it. The lead charactor is so completely unrealistic. She walks around her house feeling like someone is always peaking in.

I don't know, I just got tired of everything feeling so phony and absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Climactic To Say the Least","review":"This was the second Joy Fielding book I read and have nothing good to say about either of them. There is way too much detail, making the story drag on and on. I kept hoping this book would get better as I forced myself to read it, but was sadly disappointed.

It was easy to get into, the characters likable enough, and the plot slowly (especially in the middle) developing. However, the last 20 or so pages Fielding decided to throw the reader into a loop of unpredictability and confusion...there being only slight, slight hints of anything pointing towards such an unbelievable twist. I think Fielding took excess liberties as the author and had a really good time writing this story, but unfairly put the reader into a spot I don't think I'd want to venture again. And for all you fans of happy endings...don't expect to read \\"Whispers and Lies\\" and gain any sort of peaceful, satisfying resolution. It's just not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!","review":"I have read every other book by this author and loved them. This was a terrible and depressing book!

Triangle is an exception, of the first order. Drehle has a brilliant eye for detail. Not only has he written a gripping account of the famous Triangle fire, itself, but a deeply researched and fascinating social and political history of the world -- turn of the century New York City -- in which the fire took place. Rarely has a popular history so captured my imagination and at the same time taught me so much. I very much look forward to reading future works by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant account of a chapter in American history and Jewish history","review":"The Triangle Fire was accidental and not an act of terrorism -- yet it was in many ways the 9/11 of its day. The random loss of life in New York City, the acts of heroism amidst tragedy, the way in which the event seared the consciousness of the city and the nation, all resonate till this day. Von Drehle's masterful account is not only a classic of historical detection -- who was responsible and why? -- but also of social history. To his great credit, he has also written a book that is essential to an understanding of the history of New York's Jews in the early 20th century. The Triangle Fire occurred at the height of the development of secular/Yiddish culture in lower Manhattan, the world that Irving Howe memorialized in his World of Our Fathers (1976). Now, a generation after Howe's book, Von Drehle's account adds yet another layer of perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and Important","review":"Before Sept. 11, 2001, this was the worst workplace disaster in American history -- and in terms of lasting impact on our nation, it may well have been as significant. Von Drehle shows how the ghastly deaths of dozens of young Jewish and Italian immigrant women in an inferno that lasted only minutes changed forever the way we think about labor in this country. The political accommodations that it forced would end sweatshop America. Behind the politics is an event of unimaginable horror, re-created with restraint but not a single pulled punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS SMELL!","review":"I think this smell is so GREAT when you really want to smell good for your husband.

I enjoy Hubbard's simplicity of tale telling and heroism of the white man raised by a Blackfoot tribe.The complexities entered into the simpler lifestyle of the blackfeet being encroached upon by the commercialism of the fur traders makes a very enjoyable tale.The barbarism was clearly the white man's in this fine tale.It's a good read and a bit more revealing of native life that A.B Guthrie's The Big Sky, though I enjoyed that book as well. It's a different story than this.

I loved the characters, how much they enchanted me and made me think of more than my own perspective.I watched as movies and other stories were made with a similar premise in mind, but they always made me think of this book and how important it is to not think you are the only one who could be right.I have re-read this book many times over the years and enjoyed it each time. Maybe the newness of the concept has worn a little with all the other stories, but this was one of the originals and will always hold a place dear to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Handed","review":"The main point of this book, as I see it, is to illustrate the supreme goodness of the Native Americans of the 18th and 19th century, while depicting the vile loathsomeness of the white European encroachers.

Unfortunately, as he stated in the beginning of the book, his publisher bought the book before he took the trip -- it shows. The possibilities of a 48-state flying/father-son Stearman journey across America immediately races towards Boredom Field and crashes short of the runway. I got very tired of hearing about the minutia of the ground-time versus the exciting world of flight. The more I read, the more I was hoping it'd get better. The story didn't focus on the point of writing/reading the book (at least not the first 1/4 when I quit.) Don't waste your time reading this book. This is a great book if you owe someone money for writing a story about flying. And Mr. Publisher -- Pay after you read it next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"As a licensed private pilot I have often dreamed of doing just what the author did, i.e. rent a vintage airplane, take a whole summer off and fly around the entire United States. So, when I saw this book I bought it immediately and settled in for a vicarious thrill.Unfortunaely, the author describes almost no contact with the local people and only passing mention of the scenery he flies over. His mission apperars to be simply to touch down in every State and then fly on to the next airport; mission accomplished. He lands, goes to a nearby restuarant, has a hamburger (\\"it was good\\") and flies on.There are many writers out there who have traveled the USA by motorcycle, car or boat (see William Heat-Moon's \\"River Horse\\")and have managed to write a fascinating account of their adventures.

There's at least 3 good songs in here that are accompanied by some great visuals: Amon Amarth's \\"Death in fire\\"(finally a listenable song from this band), Brainstorm's \\"Highs without lows\\" (great heavy metal song, period) and Cattle Decapitation's \\"To serve man\\"(brutal death metal that actually sounds evil, backed up by some cool video effects). The director for Cannibal Corpse's video could have come up with a much more mature concept for their video. I guess the mediocre song complements the video. The other clips are more or less professionally done. I'm not really surprised by the amount of metalcore bands on Metal Blade's roster.

The crowd was informed that if they left now they would get a rain check on a later Kiss date but if they stayed and watched the show Mott and Ted Nugent would play and there would be no refund given. At that point half the crowd which was a full house cleared out. I stayed and watched Mott and Ted as well. The people who left never saw the great Mott who I thought was as heavy metal as they come.

I can see why. This is hardly the band anyone would remember. Since the songwriting fell heavy on Ian Hunter, when he left, so did the good songs. There is very little here that sounds like the \\"old\\" Mott the Hoople. Basically this is a mediocre album by a band with an identity crisis.

There are trully better movies that have come out at the same time that put this movie to shame.It sucked bad. no cult classic ,no suprise of film making ,just 100% suck.If you think this is a good movie about some guy without morals, check out American Psycho or something.

Everything about them signals very low quality including fit, appearance and construction.First, what I got is more flared out at the bottom of the leg than the picture. It has 5 beltloops, instead of the standard 7. The material is quite thin and looks cheap in the blue color I selected, contrary to the product photo. The stiching is poor and obviously so.The maker, Nautica, brands itself to reflect the adventure and tradition of exploration of the world by sailboats of a bygone era. These jeans are a bit wide at the bottom of the leg and do slightly suggest the wide pants ending in a bell that the U.S. Navy began to wear in the early nineteenth century. However, the material and overall fit betray the branding idea.I cannot recommend these jeans for the above reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wears way to quickly.","review":"I'm so disappointed with Nautica jeans.

I feel the book could have been longer with more show instead of telling, but that doesn't take away from the story.

A lot of very mechanical halting playing destroys any chance of fluid phrasing. It also seems that he is frequently left hand heavy. While he may deal with certain details in a competent manner, the task becomes impossible in complex works demanding variety, decernment and taste such as Pictures At An Exhibition. Maybe if he stuck to short pieces like Grieg's lyrical pieces he might stand a better chance.I think that a pianist ought to be able to hear these things in their playing.

I stared at the signal strength for 5 minutes and noticed my signal fluccuated between -109 dBm (one bar signal) and -101 dBm (two bars signal). After following the directions for putting on the booster sticker, I once again stared at the signal strength for 5 minutes holding my phone in the exact same position as before.

XBRL is a subset of XML that describes data using a pre-defined taxonomy of data identification tags established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ideal for reporting of financial data.2. XBRL (with an appropriate translator at each end) can act as a common data transport, aggregator or syndicator between any number of disparate financial systems and databases.3. Implementing XBRL might be tough because there are competing standards like EDI and ebXML for the transfer of financial reporting data with an installed base of hardware and software that companies might be reluctant to scrap.4.

That's right... this blanket sheds so bad, that I am now that person that returns used blankets. ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this blanket","review":"My boyfriend bought this blanket and although it is soft, it is definitely not worth it. It started to \\"shed\\" and ended up being everywhere. It is on our bed, pillows, clothes, and even on my car seats. We tried to wash it according to the label and it still sheds.

Why it's called Amber I'll never understand. Whoever chose that name cost me quite a bit in shipping considering I had to pay to have it shipped to me and pay to ship it back to the company I bought it from.I'm really getting a bit angry because I have ordered several blankets this year and have had to send them all back. I never have problems with other items, only blankets. And it's all been due to colors! And before someone comments, yes, my monitor is calibrated properly. I work with color for a living and would have no money to buy blankets on Amazon if my monitor showed incorrect colors!I will say that the company I purchased it from was very polite and stated that they will accept my return without a problem.

On some pages the juvenile pictures preclude their use with adult students, but as the book progresses the graphics lessen, making most of the later pages useful.Look for a used copy of this book with clean pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigotry knows no color","review":"If anyone has ever tried to tell you that a black man cannot be as ignorant, racist, and bigoted as a white man, Dr. Cone will prove otherwise.Cone tries to blend Christianity, marxism, and islam into some kind of new cosmology, but does not seem to reveal much knowledge of Christianity, marxism, or islam, and he seems to know almost nothing of world history or elementary economics. In a long and highly repetitive diatribe, he does reveal a bred-in-the-bone hatred for all things white and European.\\"A Black Theology of Liberation\\" has nothing to do with theology or liberation and, one hopes, it has nothing to do with black people.I suppose this book is important if you need to know something about the origins of Black Liberation Theology, or if you want to know something about Barrack Obama's spiritual roots, otherwise this is a sad little book written by a bitter, ignorant man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast service and great condition","review":"My book came in on time and great condition, that's all the doctor ordered and that is all I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a challenging read","review":"Dr. Cone presents a very challenging view of God and the world. In this work, he calls christians to re-evaluate their view of God and of the Christian faith in light of the experience of the oppressed and downtrodden. It uses the language of color in order to illustrate this point, using the color white to stand for evil, oppression, and sin and the color black to stand for the affirmation of our God given potential. This has clearly been informed by his upbringing and life experience. In this work he calls white people to hate their whiteness and embrace their blackness in solidarity with the oppressed. To use Cone's color language, I doubt many would disagree that Christ is clearly black, and all Christians are called to be as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cone cannot love God because he hates white people.","review":"This verse summarizes the spiritual condition of Mr. Conehead. 1Jo 4:20 If anyone says \\"I love God\\" and yet hates his fellow Christian, he is a liar, because the one who does not love his fellow Christian whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.

James Cone is a bold man, and his approach to this topic is worrying and even concerning. But, if he does not address the issues who will? It sets one's mind to think beyond the limits.Just so you know it's not necessarily about race and or color, for this exists in the eyes of those who see nothing but color all around them. It's about the strategically changes that Christians ought to employ to successfully reach those who have otherwise experienced God or Christianity in a negative way.

Skin color over religion dominates.I gave it a 1 star since someone took the time to write this trash and warn America just what Black Theology of Liberation is all about. The garbage spewed in this book is base on hate and fear. The other reason is that black orators then rake in lots of cash for the likes of Jeremiah Wright.

It seemed to be just what I was looking for. I found the product to be well made. It took all of two minutes to install and that includes taking my sling off. It went on without any problems. Everything was great until I tried to deploy the legs. I noticed that my sling screw was preventing the legs of the bi-pod from fully deploying. I was using the \\"claw\\" sling that has a quick detach method. This particular sling doesn't work with this bi-pod. The simple solution was to get a sling with a more traditional mounting system.

They were sturdy! I've shot with expensive bi-pods before that were military grade and these ones hold up well and cost 1/4 the price. For $35 can't beat them!

It teaches that the greatest way to make money is to take care of the horse and let it rest when it needs to be cured for injuries instead of pushing it beyond its limits to eventual permanent lameness. One of my favorite portions was about 'carrotology', which illustrated that even racehorses deserve to be loved like a pleasure horse. This book also gives helpful advise to those not only in Thoroughbred racing, but barrel racing and QH racing. One of the greatest things about this book, though, is the fact that the methods described actually worked for the author.

A Mallomar substitutes marshmallow on top of a vanilla cookie, with a dark chocolate outside. If you like milk chocolate, then of course buy Pinwheels.

I do not know if this is typical of other samples sent out but this was certainly neither appealing nor appetizing.

I wondered if they were stored in a warehouse that was not climate controlled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy but very light","review":"These marshmallow treats are delicious. They're kind of like a light Smore, with graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow. The marshmallow is definitely the dominate flavor and most of the cookie is marshmallow, with chocolate coating and a thin graham cracker bottom. I think they taste great. However, they're also a bit dangerous. Because they're mostly marshmallow, they feel light and are very satiating. It's almost like eating a marshmallow with a lot of extra sugar on top. If you're at all concerned about your diet, I'd definitely stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"Marshmallow, chocolate, cookie...put it all together and its a visit to my grannys house as a child. Where she would break out the Mallomars (her favorite) and let us grandkids demolish them in seconds. I would always eat the cookie part first than the squishy marshmallow chocolate hat.So we were looking forward to this box arriving from Amazon, we hadnt had these in years.The anticipation was thick, were they going to be as good as we remembered? would they still smell so sweet and chocolatey? Rustle, Rip, Tear...and .....sad face.All the cookies had seperated from the tops, the chocolate coating the cookies and marshmallows had cracked and separated, turning an ashy brown color. I picked up a cookie and bit into it...stale. I picked up a mallow top hat and the chocolate fell into my lap. The expiration date wasnt past, and they were packaged ok, so I dont understand what went wrong.They were just nasty, and broken and disappointing....more sad face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale!","review":"The product arrived stale & previously melted in places & stuck to the plastic inner packaging.

Maybe they were one of the foods Claudia stashed in her room? She was always eating brand name junk food my mother wouldn't buy me. So I was really looking forward to these cookies. If a fictional character from my childhood loved them, they have to be delicious, right?I did not love these cookies at first bite. They seemed dry and I didn't like that the chocolate was a thin hard shell. I also wasn't remotely hungry when I first tried them. Although I really did like the marshmallow. Also, the packaging isn't very storage friendly. But I figure that's what tupperware and plastic bags are for.Then I came home from work one night, hungry. They were pretty satisfying, and the more I ate the more I loved that the outer shell of chocolate was crisp. Now I only have two left. I think I'll go eat them right now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good cookie","review":"To be honest, I'm not a big sweets or cookie eater. But these sounded good for the occasional indulgence.Being a Californian, the winter cookie I grew up with was the Pinwheel. Same basic components, but larger in diameter with a hole down the middle, a higher marshmallow-to-cookie ratio, and a vaguely pinwheel shape. It was my father's favorite cookie. So it is probably no surprise that I find Mallomars slightly deficient compared to the mighty Pinwheel. They are, nonetheless, pretty good, and actually easier to eat. Being smaller, there is less commitment with a Mallomar than with a Pinwheel. On the other hand, one might not be enough, making it harder to say you limited yourself to one cookie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cookie","review":"Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies are the classic cookie on marshmallow covered in chocolate. There are as many variations as there are cookie companies. If you enjoy sweets you pretty much can't go wrong with these. The marshmallow was fresh, the cookie was crunchy and the experience, on the whole was pleasant enough. The reason I deducted one star was the quality of the chocolate coating. Instead of unctuous creamy chocolate experience, the shell was hard and shattered when I took a byte. The chocolate also had a slight bitterness that did not pair as well as it could have with the other ingredients. These are good cookies, but for my taste, could be a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original is Still The Best","review":"Pure Chocolate Mallowmars have been around for years and they are still fantastic. Rich, real chocolate, covering a fluffy marshmallow and a soft cookie. These are delicious and truly addictive. Mallowmars have just the right texture. My wife thinks they would be better without the cookie, but for me, the cookie is an integral part and I am perfectly happy with them. They are a great treat, but a bit expensive. Sometimes though, you just have to indulge yourself. What would life be without a little indulgence? Pretty dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom loves Mallomars!","review":"My Mom loves Mallomars, and it wasn't until after the holidays that we learned they are a seasonal item.

Kind of on the small side (compared to Pinwheels) IMO they taste SOOOO much better. The chocolate seems nicer than on Pinwheels and it seemed like semi-sweet and we found them tasty....so much so we ate the whole box within 30 minutes!Wish I had another box...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad batch? Poor storage conditions? Something went wrong.","review":"The chocolate coating on my Mallomars had a dusty discoloration, like you sometimes see on chocolate that's past it's prime. That \\"sugar bloom\\" usually doesn't affect the taste, so I tried them anyway. I found the chocolate to be quite bitter. On about half of the cookies, the lower cookie half had separated from the top half of the cookie. The cookie was crumbly and stale. The marshmallow had a \\"stretchy\\" quality, not the fluffy goodness I'd expected.With so many other reviewers raving about the product, I don't think this is just a difference of opinion. I think I had a bad batch, or these weren't stored properly before delivery, or something. Maybe they were outdated -- I searched the box for a sell-by date and did not find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived in bad condition","review":"It's difficult to fairly evaluate when the product arrives in bad condition. The celophane bag seemed intact, but the cookies inside were crushed. The chocolate coating was discolored and the cookies were broken and tasted stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CHILDHOOD FAVORITE...","review":"This is a delicious combination of chocolate, marshmallow, and cookie. If one wants to heighten the experience, put a mallowmar in the microwave for ten seconds for a gooey moment of sheers bliss. At least, this is how I remember them.Unfortunately, when I received my order, the one box of cookies had been carelessly mailed in a manila envelope. Consequently, the cookies arrived in pieces, crushed almost beyond recognition. There was not a single cookie that arrived intact.I did notice, however, that the chocolate, instead of being a dark, velvety brown, was grayish in appearance, as if it had been laying on the sender's shelf for years. The cookie part seemed dry as sawdust and that is what it tasted like. These were definitely not the cookies of my memory. Shame on the sender for not taking care when mailing them to ensure that they were fresh, as well as properly packaged to avoid damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: High Fructose Corn Syrup","review":"I have no idea why an established product such as this would want to send out samples to vine members to review. That said, the box I got suffered from the lack of sturdy packaging and about half of the cookies were broken and they all had a whitish tinge to the chocolate part that made me think they had been around too long.I am always careful to read labels because I am intolerant of High Fructose Corn Syrup and when I find it on the label as I did in this product I cannot eat it. I assume that the HFCS is in the marshmallows because all marshmallow products seem to contain it these days. It amuses me when a product advertises that it has been on the market for over 75 years and yet contains HFCS because this means it is not the original formula by any standards.My 6 year old grandson would not eat these, but my husband ate them so they did not go to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"San Francisco : with Fond Memories","review":"I can not review this due to not knowing who the artists are that performed the songs.

The Spanish words are accompanied by phonetic pronunciations in English. Male and female conjugations are provided for the Spanish adjectives. The whimsical bear drawings on each page do a good job of illustrating the concepts being taught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing....","review":"I went into this book thinking it would be interesting and maybe give me a look at what motherhood is like for others. I hope not all women feel this way or we will have a world of screwed up children. She complains incessantly about the distribution of labor and the costs of caring for young children, as though it is just an unpleasant by-product of motherhood rather than one of the wonderful aspects of it. She also seems to be a bit loony, discussing her radical past, like trips to concerts with \\"warlocks\\" and her 6-month juice only diet. It also doesn't take her long to get her dig in on pro-life people, saying they want to punish women for having sex.I would pass up this book, and maybe read Maternal Desire: On Children, Love, and the Inner Life instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women doing a disservice to other women.","review":"If ever a woman should not be a mother, then Faulkner Fox is it. She is so busy keeping track of which parent is doing more in the house and with the children that she barely even mentions enjoying her children. Not only did she appear to be keenly depressed, she seemed angry at the world. Rather than focusing on what actually made her happy, she was obsessed with why she couldn't keep a clean house, make friends, what her husband's colleagues thought of her, etc. Talk about needy, this woman is someone so in need of confidence that I feel her children will spend millions in therapy. This book is wrongly recommended to pregnant and working moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought about sending back to the author","review":"I was expecting self-effacing humor from someone trying to do it all. Not this book. Egocentric and self-centered are much more the words that come to mind. The only one putting down Motherhood is Faulkner Fox who would rather be working, because apparently mothering isn't important enough for a white liberal woman. I tried to have sympathy with the woman but couldn't. Don't like Gymboree's? Don't go. Personally, I don't have that kind of conflict and I don't understand it in others, especially when they are hypocritical about it. Marriage for Faulkner is a competition about who gets to work and who \\"has\\" to raise the kids and clean the house (a low priority from the sounds of it), not a mutual striving together, each person doing what they can to get the whole family ahead.In short, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, except perhaps as a study in dysfunctionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"a white heterosexual male view","review":"Fox was nailed in Taylor's and Johnson's book \\"Until Proven Innocent\\" as one of the Duke English Dept. faculty members who were high in the pulpit accusing the lacrosse players of rape and were eventually proven to be nothing more than anti-male hatemongers. So I looked up her book. My response is to any male who reads this review: never, ever marry a feminist!This infantile narcissist is what you're going to get if you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Unpleasant, whining, self-centered, as funny as a migraine -- and this woman claims to be a writing teacher?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Erma Bombeck, Where Are You?","review":"This book is the sort of pretentious tripe that will be reviewed seven-ways-to-Sunday by NPR, The New York Times, The Today Show, and other \\"cool\\" media outlets that \\"cool\\" well-educated people consume. For the rest of us, that is, those who aren't Harvard-educated \\"feminists,\\" we just don't get it, dahling. But the joke, ultimately, is on the haughty know-it-alls. Middle-American, frowsy, dumpy writers like the late Erma Bombeck are the ones who laugh all the way to the bank because they know what the mass audience wants to read, and it ain't this, sistah! Ms. Fox will get her buzz, but the buyers at Costco and Sam's won't bite."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Bet Her Life Wasn't \\"Perfect\\" Before Either","review":"Whiny, shallow, melodramatic, defensive, and cliched, wrapped in a \\"hip\\" shawl of Northeastern liberal Ivied cool. It seems to come as a big shock to her that motherhood is life changing. Hello?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motherhood doesn't have to be this way!","review":"I'd give Faulkner Fox's book 2 stars as an honest account of one cynical, depressed woman's struggle to deal with motherhood. However, this book is being marketed as a book that \\"every pregnant or planning-to-be-pregnant woman with a modicum of ambition would do well to read,\\" and as such I'd give it ZERO stars. Fox is full of anger and resentment, and she had such unrealistic expectations of motherhood that it's no wonder she was disappointed. Her story is painful to read. She was depressed before, during, and after the arrival of her husband and children. As Fox herself said in her analysis of Sylvia Plath: \\"Motherhood hadn't cured her. Perhaps it exacerbated what ailed her. It certianly hadn't make her into something other than what she was before.\\" Don't belive the marketing hype--Fox's story does not represent every woman's experience, and I would NOT recommend this book for a new mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you need a master's degree to be a Mom?","review":"This is a must read for any mother who worked diligently to educate herself and have a career, but gave it all up to be home with her children. Faulkner Fox describes her experiences as a new mom at home with one baby, and later a toddler and a baby, while her husband pursues his interests outside of the house. She tries to understand what her role is now and why, although she completely loves and adores her children, she still feels less than happy.Fox's writing is funny, honest, and sad. Stay-at-home-moms are lucky to be at home, but they also give up their own pursuits and interests. It is a heartbreaking dilemma because the children are only young for such a short period of time. Fox shares her personal experiences as a woman who has given birth to two children, works hard to engage and nurture them, but who also needs enriching experiences in her own adult life.Well-written and engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Waste of Time!","review":"As a college-educated woman in my 30's who has chosen to leave career and instead raise a child, I was looking forward to reading this book - to appreciating and supposedly LAUGHING at all the crazy, messy, mind-numbing, conflicting, frustrating, and loving situations I face every day. The author failed to convey that while there are many challenges associated with motherhood (and her own challenges seemed extremely trivial when compared to hardships and tragedies faced around the world!) - these challenges are TEMPORARY because children grow so fast. Instead of conveying something positive and encouraging, she ranted on and on aimlessly, coming across as insecure, ultra-neurotic, judgmental, and sometimes outright crazy. If this book did anything for me, it was to remind me not to have the \\"I'm-so-angry\\" outlook that Faulkner Fox so annoyingly expressed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self centered drivel","review":"A boring read; about a completely dysfunctional woman... I couldn't finish it, she was so whiny. Please, the world needs less self centered reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite Mama Book","review":"This book tells it like it is! An intelligent, honest, heartbreakingly funny story of motherhood in the new millennium. I totally identified with her experiences ofnew motherhood, and her stories of negotiating her independent feminist self with her new role as mother and partner of a man. She doesn't pull any punches,and talks about the hard stuff-- really illustrates the importance of living an examined life. I loved watching her come out on top at the end. She manages to dealwith complex social issues yet write in an extremely compelling personal voice. A courageous book. I couldn't put it down, definitely a must-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I did not like this book. It was so depressing. The best I can say is that the author does appear to be honest. She is caught up in her identity as a feminist and fails to figure out how to compromise and negotiate. In my opinion, while she is indeed very unhappy, she fails to see the part she herself plays in that state of mind. Another thing that bothered me, while she beat the reader over the head with images of the oppressed modern American mother, she totally failed to offer any solutions. All the book is, is depressing. I had hoped there would be some humor in it but there is not a single funny story in it. I am kind of shocked a company actually published it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honest, but not helpful.","review":"Fox definitely speaks some truths and I appreciate her honesty. However, I never really believed that she finally came to love the house, the man, or the child(ren).Also, if SHE is experiencing loss of self, imagine how mothers who work full-time, are the primary bread-winners, and then do 90% of the house and family work feel. That's what many, many of us do."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but WAY too self-absorbed and angry","review":"While I could relate to many of Fox's feelings on marriage, motherhood, and work, the intensity of her feelings and the anger behind all of it was far too much to take. Her husband sounds incredibly involved, but she trashes him mercilessly. Her kids sound like bright, engaging kids, but all she can do is talk about the drain on her time that they represent. This book could have been saved by humor, but instead it is a relentlessly bleak, dark, and resentful tirade. How is she going to feel when her kids are teenagers and they read the book? For that matter, are other people's feelings important to her at all? Or just her own? A complete downer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny entitled mom rants too much","review":"The first part of this book is kind of interesting. But then the editor must have fallen asleep on the job. The author doesn't keep the reader's perspective in mind as it reads like the rant of a whiny and entitled woman and mom. It's too personal to be interesting to the everyday mom.I can't feel empathy for her and I wouldn't recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sending Signals","review":"Dispatches is a book that should have a wider audience than parents. Fox, through her examination of her family and life, touches on issues as how we define and value ourselves and those around us. The book is funny, not so much laugh-out-loud funny but of a kind derived from recognizing our idiocyncratic personalities as part of a larger truth about human foibles and the messiness of life. Fox is inquisitive, and challenging of herself and others never settling for the status quo. If the messages of Dispatches sometimes fail to reach its intended audience it is partly because of the strong emotions and protective urges that it arouses. Nevertheless Dispatches is always thought provoking, as it focuses on the conflicting emotions of loving those around you while feeling alone and at a loss of self. All this and also snip-its of oddball types such as the \\"Rush\\"(the rock band)-loving Warlock float in and out of Fox's account making it hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it","review":"As a married feminist on the verge of becoming a parent, I really appreciated this book's honest look at some of the inherent contradictions of the life I am attempting to live. I can't say I got a lot of answers from it, but I did feel a camaraderie with the author, like I wasn't alone in having the issues and concerns that I feel. I also found the book entertaining and laughed out loud at some parts.The book felt strangely organized. Each chapter could have stood on its own as an essay, but they didn't add up to much more than the sum of their parts. Still I'm really glad I read it and I recommended it to some friends.If you like this, you might also enjoy The Bitch in the House, in which about 20 women address the same issues from various stages of life and commitment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-so-Perfect Life is far from perfect book.","review":"I laughed out loud when I read Annie Lamont's \\"Operating Instructions\\", but I understood the source when I read it. I am very disappointed in Fox's book because she passes herself off as a \\"suburban educated mom\\" who is struggling with role definition. The book is whiney to a fault, and Fox is not the typical educated professional with whom I can relate. In the first 50 pages I had difficulty getting past her foray into witchcraft and active participation in the pro-abortion movement. At least one of these, if not both, are huge mis-connects for the \\"average\\" person, much less, the market for which the book was supposedly written. Skip this and read Lamont."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredibly cathartic read","review":"I am so glad for the existence of this book. It is well written, and addresses many of the subtle emotions mothers feel. So many of us want, as Fox puts it, \\"meaningful work in the world and love.\\" I recommend this book to every mother I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Seems like people either love this book or hate it. Unfortunately I am in the latter category. This book was not what I'd expected or hoped. Although I could relate to the author's constant state of chaos as a mother, I could not relate to her incessant analysis of the world, chronic anxiety and unnecesary self-examination. I found it too sociological and political and not at all funny. It is the first book I have ever stopped reading & returned to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid and Poorly Written","review":"Unfortunately, the author comes across as though she were whining. There are real issues to explore here, however, her attempts to do so are unsuccessful. I also found her writing to be scattered. As a result, no momentum was built around any particular concern. The book came across as a bunch of minor complaints--from an extremely privileged woman. Other books in this genre that really hit the nail on the head include, Anne Lamott's Operating Instructions, and Mothers Who Think (an excellent collection of contemporary essays.) Also, the quarterly magazine, Brain Child, features consistently great writing on these issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"One mother's triumph","review":"This well-written book covers the personal troubles and triumphs of one woman's journey into motherhood.While her situation is easier than that of many other mothers, she clearly and forcefully covers what was difficult and rewarding for her. She helps us understand some of the pressures on mothers, even those who come from a stable two-parent household.Mothers, parents, and anyone who is interested in laughing and crying about the state of modern motherhood can benefit from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just couldn't keep my attention","review":"A couple of friends recommended this book to me, so I was really looking forward to reading it. I too have tried to balance writing, academia and parenthood, so I thought I would relate. But this book just couldn't keep my interest, and I admit that I only got about 2/3 of the way through before giving up. I don't mind motherhood memoirs that aren't all sunshine and flowers - in fact, I prefer ones that aren't - but this just seemed relentlessly dark without being compelling.

I have found the Peterson Field Guide of Western Birds to far more accurately depict the birds we see, especially when it comes to identifying different subspecies for our area."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compact, complete guide to the birds of New Mexico","review":"This book will fit in your pocket or by your birdfeeder, ready when needed.

I then postponed reading it, fearing what I would learn. But, I did read it, and discovered I couldn't put it down. This book makes sense of the history of student loans and how to understand and get through the loan process. There is a wealth of resources, suggestions and information about how to live with student loans and NOT lose your sanity. Schools do NOT adequately prepare students to understand what they are getting into, much less how to manage loan repayment.

As a result, the community has lost its sense of togetherness and a long-standing family feud mars any chance for reconciliation and a return of the coumbite.Upon Manuel's return to Haiti from Cuba, he begins a quest for water which he hopes will ultimately bring about an end to the hard times and feuding. In doing so, he also intends to reunite the community. Along the way, he falls in love and also makes an enemy. I'd hate to give anything more away so you'll have to read the rest yourself....This book is so well written, the language so beautiful, that you can see (and smell) the sights, people, animals, and terrain of the village community. It is a literary picture show/journey not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can taste the dust!!","review":"Jacques Roumain has written a masterpiece in this tome. I have worked in rural Haiti many times over the past several years and can attest that this novel captures the spirit of desperation and distant hope that is the daily reality of the peasantry. The scarcity of food, the severity of the climate, the exhaustion of the soil, the ever presence of death, and the pride of the people is masterfully unveiled for the reader. The fact that this book has an agenda based in Marxism is neither offensive nor manipulative. I would strongly recommend reading the novel first, followed by the introduction. Keep the experience naive and clean and then analyze the parts of the whole.

Other the music is just unrehearsed, unpolished, and a bit unfocused. But I didn't expect this to be a tight, live set because the band had been broken uo for well over a year before getting back to together for this show. So it's just one big jam fest. A negative is Candy Givens, I never liked her singing so that's a real bummer on this but the music more than makes up for it.

We also wash those in the dishwasher. They are easier for my daughter to use, as they actually pick up food, are easy and lightweight, and can be thrown out after a few uses.So skip these, and get some disposables.

It's connected between the wall jack and the base station on a 4-phone wireless system. I block all toll free numbers, using wild cards for the last 7 digits. It can also selectively block individual numbers. It is compatible with Vonage, which requires the country code to be entered on the unit. The phone does not ring and the answering machine does not pick up when a blocked number is calling. The ID is displayed on the unit for all calls. My only complaint is that the ID is not passed on to any of my phones, even non-blocked calls. Maybe this is not technically feasible. A workaround might be to plug your TV into a wall jack if it has caller ID display capabilities. The documentation is poorly organized but all the information is there. Just read it carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I'm a fan of these directors, and watched their first documentary, \\"Party\\", which was very good. This is their second film, and totally different from the first as it's a movie. I didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised and ended up loving it. The plot was original, characters unique yet people I could identify with as someone working in corporate America. It grapples with subjects that I rarely come across, like complex human relationships, bundles of strong feelings/characters, flaws and perfections. The ending was surprising and resolved nicely. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you at the edge of your seat and wows you with a surprise ending","review":"This movie keeps you engaged from beginning to end.

Of course, one wonders how much access young Colin Clark had to Marilyn at the time. The book came out long after the incident presumably took place, and apparently at the urging of publishers. But, my biggest gripe was with the characterizations. Branagh makes Olivier into a pompous old windbag. God knows who Julia Ormand was trying to be, certainly not Vivian Leigh. Michelle Williams provides a cuddly version of Marilyn with out much body or soul. The only two to really stand out in this film were Derek Jacobi and Dame Judi Dench in their all too fleeting supporting roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad casting for Marilyn.","review":"I can't quite figure out why so many people see Michelle's portrayal of Marilyn as good.

I couldn't get past the poor casting to enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book.","review":"Why would anyone want to read such a bad book that is based on a fake story?

There's plenty of cartoon psychology as Marilyn bears her soul to a nerdy assistant director while faking her way through a disastrous film directed by Laurence Olivier. It's adolescent fodder all the way, and Williams doesn't even do a good job with the superficial, incompetently inserted musical bits. It all plays like a trite TV project."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dull movie","review":"This film meanders on with no real intent.

The movie itself is so slow and plodding that that brilliance is wasted. I'm sorry but I've never understood the onscreen appeal of Kenneth Branagh (nor Laurence Olivier bar his roles in Marathon Man and Boys From Brazil--both with Nazi themes so Freudians have a field day with that). Sure, Branagh is a great Shakespearean actor but, sorry, I don't get him at all.The young lad who falls for Marilyn is also less than convincing in that crucial role.The DVD extra, for myself, was far more fascinating intersplicing actual clips from 1957 when the movie (The Prince And The Pauper) around which this movie is based was being filmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marilyn: The Movie","review":"My Week With MarilynThe movie story is based on a real novel that a British film documentary producer wrote about the time he spent with Marilyn Monroe when she was in England shooting a movie with Lawrence Olivier, a famous British actor.

The story line was not very intriguing, and the movie was fairly slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Like it. Not.","review":"\\"My Week With Marilyn\\", is based on Colin Clark's account of his time spent with Monroe during the making of the 1956 film \\"The Prince and The Showgirl\\" when the superstar was 30 years old. Michelle Williams embodies the troubled young starlet without always looking like Marilyn. Her performance, along with a strong cast including Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Redmayne, Dame Judi Dench,and Julia Ormond cannot, however, overcome what essentially is a rather boring story about a boring young man who spent a short time with the sexiest woman in the world. The film can be appreciated for it's period costuming, acting and behind the scenes film-wthin-a-film but not for it's weak plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have seen in awhile","review":"This love affair with Williams is unbelievable!!!

I know I am swimming up stream with this group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Can't believe Williams got an Oscar nomination for this. I thought she was terrible as Marilyn. Plus lame script. I was really disappointed in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not for Marilyn Fans that think she was an Angel!!!","review":"This was a surprisingly good adaptation of a questionable romance between Marilyn and Colin Clark (while on her honeymoon with Arthur Miller!) Kenneth Branagh and Dame Judi Dench are fantastic as Olivier and Dame Sybil Thorndike as well as Julia Ormand as Vivien Leigh. The costumes, Make-up and set detail make it fun for MM fans to see what it was like to be on the infamous set of The Sleeping Prince.The movie does show how screwed up Marilyn was emotionally as well as addicted to drugs and alcohol. Michelle Williams blew me away! She managed to capture the Marilyn Mystique through her voice and manerisms. Considering she really doesnt look like Monroe it is amazing. I think this is an extremely realistic look at the real Marilyn Monroe.An Excellent movie and throughly entertaining from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marilyn and her Prince Charming","review":"This is a wonderful story of a very sad girl and an understanding boy. Colin didn't want anything from this famous actress but to be her friend. A warm and wonderful story that reminded me of what my mother told me about meeting Marilyn in the 50s while she was shooting the Seven Year Itch. My mother was a waitress working for Saverin Restaurant in Pennsylvania Station, NYC. When not shooting Marilyn would come to the restaurant, and sit at my mothers' station for coffee every so often. When my mother came home after the first day of meeting Marilyn she told me something that I could never forget. She told me that Marilyn was the saddest person she has ever met but at the same time very kind. A must see movie and one for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizi","review":"There were times when I watched this movie that I forgot that it wasn't Marilyn on the screen. That's how thoroughly Michelle Williams inhabited the character. I haven't see Meryl Streep's movie yet (I am not that enamored with Margaret Thatcher) so I can't make a comparision. I can say Michelle nailed this role. Kenneth Branaugh played Laurence Olivier with aplomb and a twinkle in his eye. The problem is that you always expect him to be good so when he is, it's not a surprise. It's a lovely story and you can see why Marilyn drove everyone up a wall. She was late and had her acting coach on her side the whole time so you can see why she's annoying. Still, when the cameras come on, she's magic so everyone tolerates the situation. It's a really lovely film and so worth it to see Marilyn come alive again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really GOOD movie!","review":"Michelle Williams is INCREDIBLE as Marilyn Monroe. Her performance is terrific. You feel like you're really watching Marilyn acting in a movie. It's a very interesting movie and found out some things about Marilyn that I didn't know before. Definitely catch this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Insightful","review":"This movie finally made me look at Michelle Williams and commend her on the acting she is capable of. Seeing her play Ms. Monroe was refreshing and entertaining. Finally Marilyn from A different perspective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent transfer for the Blu-Ray version.","review":"I read so many negative reviews and comments about this picture that if I had to rely on them to make my purchase of the Blu-Ray I would not have it elected even on my wish list. I am glad I didn't. I know films are personal and their interpretation subjective, but at this point I must confess that I could not care less for the negative remarks about the actress who played Marilyn or their cohorts.It is an honest film, that shows the intimacy of a troubled, frequently intoxicated mega star. It is also sometimes moving if one understands what is really happening with the characters. The Blu-Ray edition contains a high quality transfer for both audio and video. Highly recommended to those who liked this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Thanks For Being On My Side\\" ~ Seeing Marilyn For The First Time?","review":"Given the fact that I have never considered myself to be a Marilyn Monroe fan I was amazed by how much I really enjoyed this film. I fully expected this to be a rather predictable, shallow tale that would ultimately be embraced only by the most die hard fans of this iconic film legend. However nothing could be further from the truth. The 2011 Academy Award nominated film 'Marilyn' is a thoughtful, introspective and nostalgic film that can be thoroughly appreciated whether you are a fan or not. Even more surprising, the story-line is so strong and compelling on its own that it didn't have to be about a real person. You could change all the characters to fictitious people and it would still be a great film.Indeed one of the top films of 2011, the Academy got it right this time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating movie","review":"I plan on buying this movie and the soundtrack very impressed with the take no prisoners honesty and the cast in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I watch movies to be entertained and this movie was enjoyable. The story and acting were good and at times, it seemed like I was watching the real Marilyn Monroe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely Story, But It Didn't Happen","review":"After watching this movie, I was intrigued to read the book it was based on, \\"The Prince, the Showgirl and Me\\" by Colin Clark. Although Clark certainly was on the set of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" and although he certainly had opinions about Monroe and Olivier, he certainly did not have a personal relationship with Monroe that was the core of the movie. I am accustomed to movies, even those about real people, taking liberties with events described in books for dramatic affect, but this kind of wholesale manufacturing I find completely unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkably eloquent!","review":"Michelle Williams does a fantastic job portraying the two sides of Marilyn. Eddie Redmayne, in his portrayal of Colin Clark, is remarkably eloquent! The scene between Williams and Redmayne, Marilyn at 31 and Clark at 23, at the all boys private high-school Clark graduated from in England, is so magical that you really must see it! Marilyn, on a day-break from the shooting schedule, at the high-school, when confronted by a group of students, turns to Clark and says, \\"Should I become that other girl?\\" Words don't give this scene justice. A transfixing moment that can only be seen and heard to truly comprehend the depth of enlightenment this moment had to offer yours truly. The entire movie is a highly refined tragedy, which may make watching it a bit of a drag. But, the best part of this movie-going experience was reflecting afterwards on its perfect composure and innocence."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point of this movie?","review":"The movie was a good platform for Michelle Williams to stretch herself to be Marilyn. She did a pretty good job. However, Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier wasn't believable, except for the voice. There was nothing about Marilyn in this movie that I didn't already know, as I was waiting for some BIG moment. It never came. There was no point to this movie being made, so there's no point going further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"Although Michelle portrayed her in a non campy way -- like many others have in the past, the film was a complete YAWN.

I must say that since his very first book, I've not be a huge Omar Tyree fan. I was hoping that his Urban Griot counterpart had something new and fresh to offer. That said this book was one big whining session. Troy Potter looks at his world and only sees trouble. He decides that the world is out to get him. That whites and women are trouble. Yes there is trouble out there to impede the progress of Af-Am males, Troy however only goes so far as to recognize the trouble and whine about it for 384 pages. This would have been a much more satisfying story if he endeavored to doing something constructive about.This was my last run with Omar Tyree and the Urban Griot."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEELS DON'T SWIVEL","review":"While my daughter does love this stroller, I was a little disappointed that for this price the wheels don't swivel.

It does have tiny little lines inside it so it has this nice luster as the light moves across it almost like a satin fabric shines.I don't mind the adjustable band especially since it is easily to change sizes or different fingers. The overall size of the face and the radiating bezel is about the size of a penny. I think it looks more like a sun face than a moon (because of the setting) and the color (which is like an apricot color.) It makes me think of summer sunshine every time I wear it.

It was like stumbling across a Big Bad Voodoo Daddy before they were big.Attention swing lovers - JET SET SIX's orchestrations are tight and they harmonize much better than several other swing bands right now. Their patterns aren't always in unison, which gives them that big, solid, sometimes brassy and sometimes subtle sound.I bought their CD, Livin' It Up, and it hasn't left the CD player.

I didn't use any bad language, I wasn't out of line, but my first review didn't last one day on here.So what did I say that was so out of line?I said this wasn't a book, it was a pamphlet. At 76 pages, you can read it in one sitting. There are a few good pointers in the early chapters...but the rest is simple beyond belief. There's a chapter about how you should, once you get your beautiful wife, set short-term goals and long-term goals, followed by another chapter about how--with your beautiful wife--have beautiful children and make them set short-term goals and long-term goals for them.Yes, it's very simple and refreshingly wholesome material, but it's also very thin and numbingly basic for twenty dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic concepts","review":"A friend of mine recommended to read this book, so I gave it a shot.I found this book to contain a number of basic concepts.

I admit I was intrigued. But after a very quick reading (minimal insights, and no exercises), my conclusion is that the substance is just not there. With what seemed promised by the editorial, I thought this book would go through, step-by-step, HOW to accomplish the desired end-product, but instead gives a lot of common knowledge information and uses analogies which tend to confuse rather than clarify. It's a sort of romantic read...the analogies ARE quite poetic, but I expected more...perhaps something with real, tangible exercises that would actually get you MOVING in the direction that it talks about, and talks about, and talks about... I also didn't appreciate the referalls to get psychiatric help...not the help I was looking for in this book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"The title is misleading as this book offers no insight that might help the average joe to meet women.

In the contemporary urban decay of the south of London the narrator exists as a \\"sleeper\\" among the poor but noble immigrant population. In this character and locale-driven taut thriller, many suprises await the reader. Russell James, who was Chairman of the Crime Writers Association in 2000-2001, will hopefully become more of a known quantity on this side of the Atlantic.\\"Underground\\" is taut and compelling as the narrator progresses toward completion of his \\"last big job\\". As the suprising, ultimate objective is revealed; important questions about personal loyalty, national allegiance, and human relationships are asked, but not easily answered. The Goodis reference goes to the feel of this fine book, the Deighton reference its ultimate genre.Worth finding and worth reading. Other books by Russell James include: Slaughter Music, Payback, The Annex, Count Me Out and Oh No, Not My Baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch?","review":"I thought I was getting a book - got a DVD - no book.

When it arrived, I was a bit puzzled to see that the cover of the book, while it had the title ordered, had what looked to be a picture of very high mountains covered with snow. A bit much for the Appalachian mountains, I thought. Imagine my surprise when, upon opening the book, I discovered that the text concerned expeditions on Mount Everest! I contacted the company through Amazon and their response was that the one THEY had was just fine, albeit with the questionable mountain pictured on the front. I then had to tell them the titles of chapters, etc. They have since emailed me and have promised to send me the \\"correct\\" text at no charge. So far I have not received it.In short, I have been unhappy with dealing with Amazon.com before.

I am not even going to attempt to sell the copy here on Amazon because I would not feel right even charging $1.00 for this poor sounding CD. These guys try to sound like Anthrax and without much luck.

After returning my AVENT pump and realizing that I would have to go with a different brand I immediately bought these. I rented the Medela hospital pump and these worked perfectly. Much better than having to buy additional bottles just for pumping. I only used these with the hospital pump so I don't know how well they work with other brands. These are also dishwasher safe, which I completely appreciate. When I bought these, it came with four (4) \\"rings\\" - 2 for regular AVENT bottles and 2 (I think) for the wide, breast milk storage bottles. As other reviews have mentioned, there was no instruction manual, but really you just screw on the top of the AVENT bottle and screw into the bottom of the pump system - very easy.

There aren't really that many electric pumps out there - you'd think Philips could just purchase one of each and give consumers a list of compatible pumps. But I digress.

Mr. Reiner writes with ease about persons with distinguished achievements, wealth, and health. Even the ones who are sick are made to seem fit. There is a reason behind everything and each character possesses great human values such as compassion and understanding. Even the ogre of the tale has his good sides. Of course, the whole story is light and full of mirth. That is Mr. Reiner's style. He knows how to make people laugh. There is a minor story within the main story. Both are equally enjoyable. Nat, the main character, suffers from serious personality disorder that he succumbs to seeing a therapist. One thing leads to another and he is on the journey of searching the truth of his origin. He finds out a lot of information and a few close relations. It is first and foremost a love story between men and women and among family members. When told in Mr. Reiner's wild humor, it becomes more pleasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much ...","review":"In general, I've loved Carl Reiner's work. His early TV roles with Sid Caesar, his 2000-year-old man with Mel Brooks; all brilliant. But this book ... eh, not so much. I thought it rambled too much, and it just wasn't very funny. In an interview at the end of the audiobook, Reiner readily admits that he wrote the book a page a time, not having any idea what would come next, and that's the way it reads; not many ideas. I know that method works for some writers, but in this case it didn't. And the title; gee, I wonder how many seconds he thought about that one! Five, maybe?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Literature for the Ages","review":"As a child, I saw the film \\"Flower Drum Song\\" and fell in love with the film.

It was a beautiful made film that featured Asian actors who sing, dance, performed to a melodic score by one of the most creative song writing team. Therefore, I am so glad that this book is finally come to light and to be re-embraced into literary culture. Perhaps it will hopefully quail those critics who are as narrow-minded as those who thought we are just busboys and Charlie Chans. Be enlightened, and read this great piece of story-telling of a familial saga that we can all relate--regardless if we are Chinese or not. Enjoy, read and be enchanted.

It is SOOOOOOOO fun!!! It is boring sometimes, but I can always find something new to acheive. David Hoff \\" Tech Wary Parent & Professional Geek\\" is MESSED UP (read his reveiw if you don't beleive me). I get called Miss Tomato Head at school, by a friend, and I don't give a freakin crap. (My friend's name is Mr. Potato Head) If you can't handle the truth, STOP READING. Anyone who is offended enough to have AC:WW taken away from you for being called a loser, IS a loser. I get called a moron, loser, and even worse stuff, so I FIGHT BACK! Okay, enough reality, back to the game. I finally got Nookington's, the final upgrade. I got a new hairdo from Shampoodle, and I LOVE it. My house is a MANSION, and there isn't another mortgage for me. I love my neighbors, too. You'd LOVE this if you don't aready have it. \\"Funnest\\" game ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun Game!","review":"This is a very fun game. This is my first animal crossing game and it is the game I play the most on my DS Lite. This is not one of those games you will want to play for hours at a time, because everything goes in real time. For example if you plant a tree, it doesn't just appear. It takes a week to fully grow. Also stores open and close in real time. I usually play this game about 10-15 minuets every day. I get on to check my mail, see what Nooks (the store) has for sale, and maybe fish for a few minutes to kill time. I haven't tried the WI-FI feature on this game yet, but it sounds like it's cool, except you can't just go to anyone's town. You have to have their friend code. (you have to know them). Over all this is a great game. It's well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game.","review":"I bought Animal Crossing: Wild World after playing City Folk. It's a wonderful game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. There's always something new to do and to discover. One reason this version is so great is that it's portable. Being able to carry the game around as you play makes it even more fun. There are also a few differences between it and City Folk that makes it very charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with Animal Crossings/DS","review":"Hubby and I both have DS's and our own game.

Also sister inlaw that lives southern IL is going to her local McDonalds and I to ours and play via WiFi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but was expecting more","review":"Animal Crossing is a wonderful game, even if you don't have the GameCube version like me. But I was expecting more. The commercial was kinda exaggerating like how the characther said \\"I caught a zebra turkeyfish!\\" I thought you could sorta IM in a way to other \\"crossers.\\" But actually you just say it out loud and nothing happens. *cricket chirps* But otherwise the game's great with the graphics and you never get bored with fishing, catching bugs, and mingling with your neighbors. Should ya buy it? Yeah, but if you are into fighting and adventure, I don't reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"My daughter was not able to play the game ,and it kept getting error messages or it did not show up on the menu at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"very fun game","review":"I have this game and i play with it all the time. i love the fun caracters and the new places i can go. Example now unlike the first animal crossing i can go to the barber shop to change my hair , but the most amazing thing that i absolutly love is that i can change my hat unlike the first one i can NEVER take off the hidious pointy hat !! this game makes me learn how to deal with money my mom says . cause in the game u have a amout of money to spend on clothing, funiture, and much more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Nook---Make your store 24 hours!","review":"I agree with everyone about how cool this game is,so I'm not going to go into detail about that.But I HAVE to stress one problem about this game as was the case with the gamecube version...day/night cycle.Sometimes I feel like animal crossing almost punishes players for the time that they play.As one reviewer already mentioned;there are alot of us who have jobs and do other such things in real life during the day.There are even more of us who are just natural night owls.However Tom Nook closes up his shop around 10 pm and most everyone in the game is asleep.Man,if I wanted a curfew,I'd go back in time to the grade school days!I hope in some future installment of animal crossing;things take place in a big,Japan-esque city.Something would always be happening and stores would stay open 24/7."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"I didn't get tired of playing this game until after a very long period of time, but I started up again the next day. What can I say, this game is addictive.You get to make your own characters, (maximum two), name a town and have them explore around it with bug catching, digging, shopping and chatting with neighbors.The graphics are fine, but only the bottom screen is used while playing the game. The top screen is just a sky that changes color, depending on the time of day.What a great transition of Animal Crossing! I'm very impressed, and I'm sure you will too when you buy it, and I recommend it strongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"nintendogs vs. animal crossing","review":"this review will probably not be rated highly but...in my opinion animal crossing beats nintendogs hands down. I mean I've had animal crossing since christmas and nintendogs since easter,yet I would still choose to play ac(animal crossing) over ndogs(nintendogs). OK, I have to admit ndogs is pretty cute but you cant get a job or go fishing in that game can you? In ndogs you pretty much can go through every aspect of the game in a time period of 2 weeks. Animal crossing gives something new to do just about every time you play. so if you are one of those guys deciding which one is best to get choose ac. its less repetitive and more entertaing- Raquel"},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Animal crossings is the best game you could ever have!!My friend and i love playing multiplayer on ds-to-ds and visiting people from there town.

I played it for the first 4-5 months then got bored of fishing, catching bugs, and buying furniture. Then I went online and read some game FAQs and found out there are trading quests, and other ways to make money than just fishing and catching bugs. You can sell turnips, grow orchards and hybrid flowers, get a perfect town score and other side goals to go for that I never even knew about. I play it a lot more frequently now, 9 months later, even compared to when I first got the game. I realized there were some things I was actually doing wrong. Now it is so much more fun than before. My advice: Read some game FAQs online to get the most of your game."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACWW","review":"I've owned Animal Crossing Wild World before, so this isn't a new game for me. It's one of my favorites. As a matter of fact, it's the only game I've been playing for the last month! I've had so much fun rediscovering everything I love about the game. There's so much to do: You can collect items for your house & decorate according to the rules of feng shui & try to get a high Happy Room Academy score, catch bugs & fish & dig up fossils to fill your museum, or work on getting a perfect town score and more.ACWW is definitely not an action game and I wouldn't call it an adventure game. I actually don't really know what category to put it in. I think if you're looking for a casual, laid-back game that you can play endlessly, you'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Crossing","review":"This is a great game!!

I gave it to my girlfriend, and she agreed that there is nothing to-do in this game.To any one thinking of purchasing this game, I recommend Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town.

He's a total bully that, if you do not allow yourself to be bullied he will call you (or your child) names such as \\"dumb\\", \\"dirt\\" and \\"loser\\". Not only is this terrible for a child's self-esteem but teaches children to be rude, insensitive and defensive or else submissive to bad characters. I cannot believe that Nintendo came out with this character on ANY game, much less one that is rated E. With the crime rate & other problems being what it is in this country this is not the types of behaviors and characters I want to passively expose my child to, which will desentitize her and teach her that this kind of communication is normal and acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aniaml Crossing","review":"I bought this game for my eight and six year old.

It's similar to the Sims, but you're actually playing as a character in the game, not a psudo-god.I bought it when it was new, and I still love this game.

In summary this video game is great.Besides all of the great activities, this game has a few drawbacks. I have a mortgage payment on my house and, I can't wirelessly link to another player with only one game cartridge. However these drawbacks are minor irritations and don't prevent me from playing this game frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"I purchased Animal Crossing about a week ago for my eight year old child. Not only did she love it, I thought it was really cool too. What we realized after a few days of playing was that the characters are not only snarky but down right mean. I'm in shock because my daughter was just called stupid and rude for no apparent reason by one of the characters (Gwen). I've been playing the game with her because I'm very cautious about anything my daughter gets into. I noticed that at any given time, all of the characters can be petty, materialistic, rude and mean. How is this game rated E??? I don't get it. This game is not for kids who's parents teach them manors, respect for themselves and respect for others. Now.........I gave this game one star for fun because other than having to deal with the characters, this game \\"could\\" be really great. My rating of one star for overall is based on the fact that I can not ignore the blatant and hostile tone of this game. I will never reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the Mole","review":"My seven year old daughter fell in love with this game. However, when you forget to save correctly when turning the game off, a horrible little mole comes out. It tells my child she is dumb, a punk, and dirt. It got to the point that she would cry if she forgot to save correctly, knowing this horrible little mole would come out. I have no idea why a child's game would include such an unforgiving character. What child hasn't forgotten to save a game correctly. Especially considering every other game on her Nintendo can simply be turned off when she is done. We finally sold this game, not being able to put up with the horrible rants of this little character. I do not recommend this mainly due to this aspect. Otherwise, the game is great. But, it is just so upsetting that this had to be added to a child's game. Beware the nasty mole!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This shoe is very comfortable, while it lasts.

Well, I couldn't wait for the game to come out after I played the demo. Finally, it came out about a year and a half later and I picked it up the day it came out. I loved it for a couple of days. Then, I realized that there are only 4 levels in the single player game, and all you do is travel back and forth between them. Well, after I found that out I figured I would give the multiplayer a try. Multiplayer is definately better than single player. You can play online or regular wireless, and there is little lag online. However, the matchups are random unless you have friends that play.

The mesage is very intresting (I will not tell what the mesage is), and you are orderd to find out if the mesage is true. Yet they are not the only person to receive it. You fight as Samus (of course)and take on enimes after enimes as you discover the meaning of the mesage.

The basic music and lyrics--a mixture of jazzy pop--are fine. But I can't get past the voice. She alternates between being slightly flat and slightly sharp, and she confuses straining her voice with singing from her soul. I've listened to the album several times to be fair, to see if it would grow on me, but instead it just wore on my nerves. I'm not writing this to be mean, but just to save anyone who loves dead-on vocals fifteen bucks. You want excellent Latin jazzy pop, check out Sasha Sokol, 11:11; or Mana, Unplugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprising change of pace for Laura!","review":"With \\"Mi Respuesta\\" Laura Pausini goes the R&B route. I must say that I was quite taken aback at first but after listening to the CD for the third or fourth time it started to grow on me. The CD seems somewhat overproduced at times with excessive drum loops and synths. Laura's angelic voice and the strength of the lyrics more than make up for the producer's excessive zeal on this project. Laura is always at her best on the power ballads. Mmmmmm, yeaaaaaahhh!

At a glance I saw fabulous pictures, all set on black, with lots of text to accompany each species. That was then.Last week I received my own copy of the book. While each species is well represented by picture, the accompanying text is 1) spelled out in 4 languages on each page (reducing the sheer quantity of text information fourfold), and 2) is generally unrelated blabber. For example, one such blurb reads \\"No two cichlids are ever identical. Coloration varies somewhat from individual to individual...\\" I was hoping for a little more useful information about the species' behavior, feeding, breeding, etc.Still, it makes a nice coffee table book."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least the Pictures are Pretty","review":"The photographs in this book are magnificent. That is where its usefullness ends. The content is very short on practical cichlid husbandry information.

I found Dr. Paul Loiselle's \\"Fishkeeper's Guide to African Cichlids\\" a much more practical book.

It has seen countless 120 rolls pass through it, without any deterioration of any kind including on the plastic parts. Now, there are some trade-offs to using this stainless steel tank that I outline below:PROS- VERY durable- Well made, obviously light-tight- Lid fits on like a glove- Larger opening for easy pouring in/out of chemicalsCONS- Not as easy to use as the plastic counter-parts- Inner clip is poorly designed, I mostly ignore it.I would not suggest this tank for the total beginner - while some would disagree and tell the budding developer to get over it, I have seen several people give up on home developing because they found this just too difficult to use in the dark. It takes some practice, but once you get it, it becomes muscle memory. If you have already used the metal tanks, or are looking for something more durable, this is an EXCELLENT choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product!","review":"I have used N'Rage color dyes off and on for almost ten years.

The only CD that comes close is Spectrum by Billy Cobham; however none of the others that I have, including James Gang, Deep Purple, Alphonse Mouzon (talk about boring!), and various solo efforts, ever get played.Don't waste your time on this overrated drug addict; spend your time much more profitably with Jeff Beck, Holdsworth, Steve Morse, Eric Johnson, Beethoven, Mozart, Coltrane, or many others of similar calibre.

My son wants to make everything. While the book was created for kids, there are a few recipes that I am eager to try out. They have something in here for everyone. It is not just your PB & J cookbook. This has some real baking and cooking recipes. I cannot wait to try them. I highly recommend this book for the clear cut directions.

A couple of my favorite tracks are \\"X-static Process\\" and \\"Intervention\\" and her emotion really stands out on those . I'm a huge fan of \\"American Life\\" (the title track) and \\"I'm So Stupid\\" because she trashes Hollywood and it's people, who by the way deserve it. Yeah, if Madonna had waited until the middle of last year to release this album, then she would have sold millions. The only reason why I'm giving this album 4 stars is because I think the lyrics are better than the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"It's te type of album you'll never forget.

The lyrics are interesting and I can understand why she wanted to release a song about this topic - but BLAH - the music is AWFUL! I like Madonna, she great, I have all of her albums and many of her singles - but this one stinks. I like some of the other songs on the album of the same name, it's worth your time and money, but this single isn't. The song is just all wrong - it doesn't flow, it's all over the place, trying to decide what it wants to become and never quite discovering it. I can listen to it, it's not horribly painful like some other bad songs - but I rarely do by choice. One of Madonna's worst works. This single is only for DIE HARD fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Madonna!","review":"This is the worst Madonna's album. Don't waste your money on this. Ray of light & Music were about something! This is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring life","review":"this is the worst record by Madonna,period. I tried to listened to this album and found myself pushing the skip button a lot. Ive always enjoyed her music because its danceable and fun,enjoyed most of her 80's records and found Bedtime Stories one of her best in the 90's. If you want a smart dance pop album with catchy tunes get Kyle Minogue's ''Fever'' or Lisa Stansfield's brilliant ''Biography'' and skip this new album by Madonna,save the dissapointment and your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are they letting her write her own lyrics?","review":"The only excuse for the so-called rap in \\"American life\\" is if some 9 year-old Madonna-fanatic was dying of cancer and the Make-a-Wish foundation talked her into performing the song of the aspiring and expiring young lyricist.Thank God for DJ's--if it wasn't for their creative revamping, I don't know if we would have heard anything good from Madonna in the last five years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna regresses.....","review":"as an avid fan of madonna, i eagerly purchased \\"american life\\". i was expecting to find the same originality she poured into \\"ray of light\\" and \\"music\\". while there are a couple good songs (namely \\"hollywood\\") the rest of it is madonna ripping off of the previously named albums...but not for the best. while each of the latter two discs had their own flavor to it, this one had none. to make matters worse, madonna seems to be regressing in her abilitiy to make innovative lyrics. in most songs she complains, moans, and complains some more. in the song \\"nobody knows me\\", she declares that ..well...nobody knows her. wow. should we feel sorry for her with all her millions and fame? or should we classify her now into the gansta rap category- a.k.a. hard knock life/feel sorry for me even though i get money, cash, hoes everyday. get back to being original, madonna. ..i still have faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"And this is bad because????","review":"I'm not really a Madonna fan, but decided to give this cd a listen, now that the negative hype has died down. Needless to say, I was really impressed. \\"American Life\\" is a great, catchy tune that is ruined by a rap at the end. I'm not sure if Madonna was trying to be ironic, but it just doesn't work. The next track, Hollywood, is her most catchy track in years. The best song on this album is \\"Nothing Fails,\\" an amazing gospel song that even blows \\"Like a Prayer\\" away. It's sometimes weird to hear Madonna singing about \\"Jesus Christ,\\" but she does it wonderfully on \\"X-Static Process.\\" People really need to listen to this cd before they judge it as the \\"low point\\" of Madonna's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average","review":"There's nothing too redeemable on this record, except that she gives the word 'rap' a whole new meaning.

And not that M. ever had a formidable voice, but American Life makes you realize just how thin and unimpressive her pipes really are.I didn't love Die Another Day when it came out with the stinky Bond film of the same title, but it's by far the best song on this CD.

The production is choppy to the point of sounding \\"junky\\", the guitar playing sounds like noodling and the rapping is sophmoric. Madonna needs to: #1 find a therapist to work out her \\"issues\\" and #2 find a new producer to give her a better sound. People that like this, like it because it's Madonna...not because it's actually any good. She's a great artist that should put out a better piece of work. Definitely a disc you will pull out in 5 years and think \\"what the......\\"!

What the hell is this piece of crud?! This album is just a slap dash dish of electronic noise and sloppily arranged songs that have sloppy rhythm and just bloodless melody to them.I admire that she could go for 20 years without a bad album so I'll continue to be a fan but I stand by my dislike of this awful album. Maybe next time Maddy! Now excuse me while I put in \\"Ray of Light\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update: 2nd Worst Ever of Madonna's Career - Hard Candy is WORSE!","review":"Having been a fan of Madonna for many years, she has truly hit a a final rock-bottom with her new album and these pathetic remixes of her unimpressive title track. Not only does the original song leave much to be deserved, she's now allowing them to be remixed by the some of the most bland remixers in the business: Club 69's synth-porn-background-music DJ Peter Rauhofer and Paul Oakenfold. What happened to Hex Hector and Johnathan Peters? Jr. Vasquez was her best remixer ever. Madonna is not representative of an American Life in the slightest bit as she panders the Europeans and pretentious crowd in London. She sounds whiney, raps horribly, and contradicts herself to no end. Her sober seriousness in laughable and I'd like to see what she will be up to next time ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"UnAmerican Life","review":"Let's face it , Madonna has made some excellent music in the past. I was a huge fan of both Ray Of Light and Music when they were released. It was some of the best music that she had ever done . When \\"Die Another Day\\" was released last year , I damaged my subwoofer playing it loudly and often.I had a bad feeling about this album when Madonna pulled the \\"American Life\\" video for negative imagery involving President Bush and then blathered on about file sharing. I think she pulled the video because of the stupid rapping she does in the song. It's almost embarassing. Although the music is very good , Madonna's performance is not . The lyrics are moody and almost angery . It's not the fun and dance driven lyrics of the other albums. I'm thinking these songs are the dark products that the failure of her film \\"Swept Away\\" caused . Preview this album before you buy , I think most will hear the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"please disregard all the five star reviews which are all written by a single person.this recorded sold very badly and it's sales are waning as is her popularity ratings.avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!!!!","review":"At first when i listened to the cd, i was like \\" what the f***ck\\" but now i think that this cd keep getting better and better. The best thing about the cd are the lyrics such as the powerful dance number \\"Nobody knows me\\" or the haunting track \\"Easy ride\\" !!!!.They are from the heart and real.

Bring us a cheerful high energy club CD and show them all YOU still got it versus this slow and at times rather folky try to be hip hop try to be whatever CD.

There will be many used copies of this CD for sale on this website very soon. This music is unlike any of her other cd's; it stinks. I bet the people that Madonna complained about in the news last week that downloaded this cd have already copied over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Borderline When You Need It!!!!","review":"I found this record to drown under the weight of its own pretensions. I know, I know. Madonna needs to continually evolve as a serious and spiritual artist, and is unable to artistically go back to her roots ie. to music people truly enjoyed. As a woman that thrives on being unpredictable, Madonna would be really doing something bold and \\"cutting edge\\" if she challenged herself to return to the tight linear hooks, and simple concise lyrics that made her famous to begin with. Trust me when I say that 20 years from now, no song from this album will be playing on the radio. But I bet Borderline will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can we say WOW?!","review":"I have two words to say about this album. ROCK ON! Madonna does it once again! Does she ever cease to amaze you? This album, although not quite her best, mixes the lyric style of \\"Ray of Light\\" and mixes it to the music style of \\"Music\\". The only negatives I can see... 1. The CD is way too short. And 2. Disappointed in the extras. Other than that, KEEP ON ROCKING, MADONNA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant !","review":"After reading terrible reviews for this album, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the haunting, innovative and impressive music on the CD. Not one of the 11 tracks disappoints, with \\"Nothing Fails\\" and \\"Mother & Father\\" as especially GREAT songs.yes, this album does have a mellower pace than 'Music' and 'Ray of Light' (songs are more contemplative and ballad-esque), but I'm sure dozens of dance remixes will be born in the next few months, and meanwhile, this compilation offers a fresh and enjoyable collection of new Madonna music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Madonna Fan","review":"Disappointed is exactly the right word. I am a huge Madonna fan. I've purchased every album as soon as it's come out, going as far back as having \\"Like a Virgin\\" on vinyl! But this album has disappointed me. The music is fantastic and very similar to that of her last album \\"Music\\" however the lyrics are lacking. It seems Madonna was more interested in making the end of each line rhyme then filling the lyrics with meaningful content. Sadly, this is the first Madonna album that I'm not recommending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs A Prayer","review":"Madonna, in her quest to be on the cutting edge of British and French \\"electronica, has forgotten about what catapulted her to where she is in her American Life here in the good ole' E Pluribus Unum: good pop songs in collaboration with good songwriters. Just because her current collaborators can make a synthesizer \\"squeal like a pig\\" does not a good pop song make. She can pull her \\"controversial\\" antii-Iraq War- so - as-to-not-upset-CD-sales video and sell out to The Gap for seven figures. We will forgive that. But there is no excuse for the \\"material girl\\" not doing what she has always done best: deliver infectious ear candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took a day to get used too, but I like it!","review":"Okay, so the lyrics aren't the most imaginative, but the music ROCKS! Madonna has once again reinvented herself. Get the album, try it out, you may be surprised!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mirwais, not madonna","review":"American LIfe-by Mirwais(with words spoken through an electronic filter by madonna). This is my suggestion as to what the name of this album should of been. I wish Mirwais would stop wasting all of his talents w/ a woman who can't sing without the help of effects. MIRWAIS stay solo. Madonna do a finale tour and say good by, and while you're at it why don't you give some credit to your stylist(s), anyone who believes madonna came up w/her styles on her own is just NAIVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best... but not too bad either!","review":"Okay, RAY OF LIGHT is probably Madonna's ultimate masterpiece. This new disc, however, doesn't carry over any of the genius from that album. AMERICAN LIFE picks up where 2000's MUSIC left off. I admit, the computer altered vocals are a bit much at times. Overall, though, the cd is pretty good. My faves are 'Love Profusion' 'Easy Ride' and 'Nothing Fails.' I mean, is it really possible for Madonna to create a bad album? I don't think so! The lady has been a megastar for 20 years, and for good reason. The weakest track: 'I'm So Stupid.' The music itself isn't bad, but the lyrics are just plain silly. Personally, I would love to see her work with William Orbit again. Together, they made RAY OF LIGHT one of the best pieces of pop music ever created. Thankfully, the heavy electronica of this album is blended with acoustic guitars, strings, and live percussions. Long live Her Majesty, Madonna!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GENIUS DOES IT AGAIN!","review":"Having been a recording artist for 20 years and staying on top of her game the entire time, it is no surprise that the newest Madonna album is pure artistry! This album continues in the electronica vein. However, it takes the box and blows it wide open by blending in folk, acoustic, rap, rock and has some of her most personal lyrics ever, next to RAY OF LIGHT....after the somewhat dissapointing MUSIC....this album proves that Madonna is still a major artistic force to be reckoned with! I suggest this album to anyone! AWESOME RECORDING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after her last 2 albums...","review":"I think Madonna's best albums are her first 2 and her last 2 before this one... I had mega expectations for this album after Music, Ray of light, Frozen et al. and was a bit shocked and disappointed when I heard American life for the first time. Some of the traxx are decent - Love Profusion, Hollywood, Mother and Father - but they are a bit too mundane, repetitive and interrupted with raps and inane lyrics that make me cringe and are a bit embarrassing for such an accomplished star. Sometimes a creative mis-step leads to an incredible comeback, which is what I'm hoping. Madonna has a lot of other far better records in her repertoire."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is by far Madonna's worst Album!","review":"I'm sorry to say that this is the worst album I have ever listened to. I'm a a big fan of Madonna and have been since I was 8 years old. I was very disappointed with this album. The songs are all awful! They all sound the same and have no beat. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Madonna can do better. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK YUK","review":"I do not write many bad reviews. I loved her Music CD, it was great. This cd however is Horrible. I can not stand it. The songs do not have catchy beats that flow, it just sounds like bad garage music... I was really excited to hear the MUSIC follow up but in this case I was extremely disappointed. I am really sorry to all the fans who read this, do not take it personal this is my opinion, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Fails","review":"I might be wrong, but I think American Life is an awesome album. I think its better and more innovative than Music. It's fresh and different. The whole CD flows progressively well from track to track. \\"I'm so Stupid\\" is something I was never expecting Madonna to record, its very Shirley Manson, but I love it. Overall I think the CD rocks, is free of ...fillers, and left me very pleased. A lot of people have said the cd is very self absorbed, but isn't that what Madonna and fans are all about? I know I relate."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Talent Here","review":"I am a big Madonna fan, and bought the new album before hearing all the tracks. Boy, was I disappointed. This has got to be the worst album she's ever done. She comes off as being preachy in songs like \\"American Life\\". There also seems to be no soul or feeling in any of the tracks. It seems the days of Like a Prayer (which I consider to be her best) are no more. If this is what the future holds for Madonna's music, then count me out. I'll be happy listening to her good albums like Music, Ray of Light, and Like a Prayer. In her attempt to capture the younger audience of today, she has abandoned the audience that made her popular in the first place. Don't waste your money or your time on this CD. I sure wish I hadn't"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the lead single, \\"American Life, and unfortunately, I'm equally as disappointed with the remainder of the album. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is a highlight for me, but it's not enough to salvage the album.I'll keep my fingers crossed for some good club remixes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna, Slow Snooze,","review":"I was hoping to love this CD, Instead I got a Cd of Bleeps andslow musings ala Jewel, On most Madonna Cd's you get a coupleof great pop or dance tunes, here nothing pops out, thisis truly a weak collection, If it was any other artist I wouldgive it a pass, But not Madonna, Madonna where are you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail the Queen","review":"While I am a huge Madonna fan, I have to admit I was skeptical of this new album with all of the controversy surrounding the title song \\"American Life.\\" I was also skeptical of the sound of the album, because while Madonna is known for changing her image as well as her sound the theme for \\"Die Another Day\\" sounded just like it jumped right off of her \\"Music\\" album, which in my opinion was not her best work. Instead this album is comparable to \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\" as to the unique sounds and the meanings behind the songs. While there is some \\"dance\\" music the majority is introspective and in my opinion this album shows Madonna as a force in the music world that will be around for a long time. Her work has finally become art, so while Elvis and Tina Turner are the King and Queen of Rock, Madonna has emerged with a great new offering that has reaffirmed her status as the Queen of Pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A CD!!!!","review":"IM A HARDCORE MADONNA FAN, HAVE BEEN FROM THE START.

THIS STORY OF AMERICAN LIFE IS HER LOOKING IN TH MIRROR AND SAYING \\"WHAT HAVE I DONE WITH MY LIFE AND DO I REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR IT\\". STAND OUT TRACKS ARE HOLLYWOOD, IM SO STUPID, NOTHING FAILS, INTERVENTION AND MY FAVORITE MOTHER AND FATHER...THAT JOINT TAKES ME WAY BACK IN THE EIGHTIES.

Just another one of the extremely rich celebrities who think they have an exclusive take on politics.\\"Nobody knows me\\" may be one of the best songs on the album...but to me, it is almost as self absorbed and silly as \\"Lucky\\" from britney spears. Yeah, yeah...I know what they are trying to say. \\"I'm rich and fabulous...but i get sad too...boohoo\\". I just find a lot of apathy in songs that try to seem intimate or revealing.\\"Hollywood\\" is another song that I can almost stand...but once again, I feel that she is trying to whine about a position of her own choosing.

Her music is just as bad.Norah Jones is classy and madonna is too gross now to even qualify for trailer trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"throw in the towel: Madonna is Done","review":"the Good News is that Madonna has made it 20 Years&is closing in on the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame in a few Short years.hard to Believe Madonna&the Hall together in the same sentence?? who would have thought Madonna would be still going on back then? this is a Big Year for Her on many levels.but in the Modern Era of Music Making like with Her Film Career She is tanking something awful.this Album is another safe by the numbers standard that Madonna has been dropping for the past few years.She has lost Her Street Roots&Needs to find them again.Her Rapping is corny&alot of Her vocals just have no feeling nor does most of the music here.if She keeps on Making Corny Albums like this then She will be done.She got Comfortable&got Soft.bad enough Her Films Stink but when her Music starts to fall off like this Album does then She might wanna go away for a minute&re-group?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna sucks","review":"Actually all pop music sucks especially when its female singers. Madonna ain't even an acception whatsover, quite frankly all her music sucks. She's nothin but an MTV/mainstreem sellout along with Hillary Duff, Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Michelle Branch, Jo-Jo, Shakira, Nelly Furtado, Janet Jackson, and Mariah Carey who of course all care about one thing: Money. There's better music out there other than this overrated MTV garbage. Arch Enemy - you damn right, Otep - sure, Lacuna Coil - anytime, Madonna - NEVER!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike other reviewers out there.... I do not own everything","review":"Madonna has done, in fact, besides this album, I only own Music and Ray of Light. I liked this album from the first time I heard it (unlike the other 2 albums which had to grow on me). No, Madonna does not have spectacular vocal skills nor is she a master lyricist, but she does have a raw edge on this album that does not seem contrived. The lyrics seem very personal and the vocals vulnerable, which adds to the appeal of the album. Some of the other reviews I have read put down the fact that Madonna sings about troubles she had growing up and various problems as an adult - don't discount someones history just because they are now rich. My favorite tracks are Nobody Knows Me, Love Profusion and I'm So Stupid. Don't listen to this cd expecting typical Madonna - you won't get it. But do take it as a stand alone work not to be compared to previous work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Ever","review":"There are not many things that are certain in life. Luckily for me Madonna's music is one of them. She never disappoints and this CD is no exception. She continues to grow musically and those with sense are taken along for the ride. Thank you Madonna for one more CD that I can't do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanctimonious and disappointing","review":"As a Madonna fan, especially of her last two albums, I was highly anticipating this album. However, I found the cultural criticism misplaced -- the implication that America is far too materialistic is hypocritical when she urges us to buy her album -- not download free mp3's from her CD. Some songs, such as American Life, are occasionally interesting, but, somehow, such as in her 'rap' or being Madonna \\"unplugged\\" in several underwhelming acoustic numbers, she embarrasses herself. The reasons why this album is inadequate are not so clear; whether the lyrics are faulty, the music is less than perfect, or Madonna has simply lived so long outside the everyday world of most people she can no longer relate (evidenced by her \\"three nannies and a chef\\", etc.) are all viable culprits. Unfortunately, unlike the sonic vistas she took us to in \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Music\\", this album is not nearly as beautiful or as interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Life - So What!","review":"Two words sum this CD up...NOTHING SPECIAL. Obviously she will never top \\"Ray Of Light\\" or even \\"Like A Prayer\\" for that matter. MUSIC was fun...this is just boring now...can you say \\"been there, done that\\" Madge. There will be no grammy nominations for this one, that's a given!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna's rapping now? That's laughable.","review":"Madonna doesn't re-invent herself. She basically just follows the latest trends. Right now, white rappers are in... so, I guess that's Madonna's cue to change her whole image... Next year the trend will be deathmetal... I'd like to see Madonna tackle THAT genre... obviously, she'll give it a try if it's the latest thing...Like I said, laughable..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure product; no substance","review":"Yes, some of the lyrics are introspective, but that doesn't mean they're good. I had high hopes but these songs and their ideas have all been heard before. This is no return to form but more like a sampler or reflections of what's on the radio today by others working harder and better at their craft. None of the songs stay with you. Rudimentary acoustic guitar to hip hop beats does not lead to a 5 star record, especially when the playing ( mostly by Madonna) is so amateur. Sometimes playing safe is not the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true commercial sellout","review":"First of all, Madonna can NOT sing. She is only interested in 2 things: Money,and pushing peoples buttons. The songs on this are vapid, empty, and completley lacking any artistic statement whatsoever. The videos for these songs bored me to tears, and she probably only had one thing on her mind when she recorded it: Money. And what is with her image changes. I mean, how many times has she changed her image? Once a Cd? Somethin' like that. This is a pure waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it (defenetly not the Limited Edition)","review":"Madonna sings about controversy, about religion, about not being religious, ok...fine, what's so new and fascinating about it, it's not like she's trying to sell us something new and innovative. This is by far the worst album she's done. I'm not a fan but I have appreciated previous efforts (Like a Prayer, Ray of light). If you are planning on getting what your money's worth try getting the singles, perhaps all the innovation will be on her remixes or even videos, but as far as originality she is way out of her element.Seriously if you think this is evolution, think again. Someone who sings without believing what she's saying to the mic better go back to studio (I'm saying this based on the way she sings, tired, overly produced, again with the distorsion as her right hand).Madonna, be Madonna again, you have lost it this time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this album","review":"When I listened to this album, I really wanted to like it. I really did. While it's not quite as weak as Erotica, it comes pretty close. This album focuses heavily on the theme of the excesses of modern life; however, the album has too strong of an emphasis on this theme, making Madonna almost as guilty of excess as those she criticizes.American Life suffers from a lack of diveristy in the music. Also, many of the songs seem to get stuck in a groove and never really progress anywhere musically. The song \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" felt a lot like a re-hash of \\"Impressive Instant\\" (from Madonna's previous album, Music).It just felt like Madonna and Mirwais didn't put forth as much effort as they could have when producing this album. When I listened to the disc, I kept having this \\"been there, done that\\" feeling. When Confessions on a Dance Floor came out, I was very relieved to see Madonna move on from heavily relying on Mirwais as a producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Crap","review":"It's tasteless, highly unimaginative, and boring in content, just like the singer(so she calls herself one). Now that's stretching the truth. Madonna couldn't sing if her life depenede upon it. She is dull, and grossly overrated. Please go away Madonna...Enough is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically a boring album, but...","review":"I'm not a Madonna fan, however I truly loved the \\"Ray Of Light\\" album that was released in 1998. When the \\"American Life\\" title track was played on radios back in April 2003, at first I thought it was another artist who took the name \\"Madonna\\" and recorded this tuneless song. Lately when I realized that it was the same Madonna who sang both \\"Ray Of Light\\" and \\"American Life\\", I was like \\"what the hell happened to her?\\". I just couldn't believe that the artist who wrote such haunting songs like \\"Skin\\" and \\"The Power Of Good-Bye\\" could be as minimalist as her. Fortunately the album is lyrically OK, indeed \\"American Life\\" is an interesting CD, as far as lyrics are concerned, especially the first three tracks that deal with the North-American lifestyle. Hopefully she will stop working with music rookie Mirwais."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Im a huge Madonna fan. However,I have to say folks,the album is very disappointing.It makes some interestingpoints, but in terms of entertainment value it falls flat.Perhaps this is why it stalled at 700,00 copies sold.It mayhave reached million plus, but took a year to do so.Madonna'sbest: True Blue,Like A prayer,Im Breathless,Erotica,Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light.Madonna's worst:Madonna(debut),Like a virgin,Evita Soundtrack,Music and American Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Drag...","review":"Proof that age does in fact bring everyone down at some point. Madonna, sounding like a boring, rich housewife complaining about her wealth, has never sounded so out of touch with reality. The chorus doesn't fit the rest of the song, and it sounds like she took two song ideas and pasted them together to make one song. This approach only proves that some songs are best left on the cutting room floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and Memorable Lyrics","review":"Madonna manages to be both introspective and relevant to world events in this CD. The CD bounces between tehno and acoustical guitar and does a great job of both. I found that the lyrics were relevant to my life and gave an interesting perspective on Madonna's life. I liked this one better than the last two CDs of Madonna. Every track is worth hearing and the CD gets even better as I listen to it again. Well worth adding to your CD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior version of 'Music'","review":"Though perhaps not the disaster predicted in some quarters, it is her worst studio album to date.Yes, its even worse than 'Bedtime Stories'.In 'Hollywood', 'American Life' and 'Die Another Day', the albums best tracks, we get Madonna at her most heart-breakingly average.The album is, at best a 5th rate carbon copy of the excellent 'Music' album, something which makes it all the worse. It is one of the only suprises of the record - that, for the first time in her career, she simply regurgitates an old formula.The other rather awful surprise is the cringe inducing rapping on such tracks as 'Mother and Father' - sample lyrics \\" My mother died when I was five/And all I did was sit and cry/I cried and cried and cried all day..My father had to go to work/I used to think he was a jerk\\"Don't waste your money on this. Buy 'Music' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album that signaled this artist's downfall","review":"Barely a week after this album was released, Kelly Clarkson's \\"Thankful\\" debueted, shooting to the No. 1 spot on Billboard's album charts & kicked \\"American Life\\" into oblivion, never to be seen again. If that doesn't tell you how much this album sucked, then I don't know what else will. Of course, it didn't help that the video for Madonna's self-titled song had been banned for it's blatent left-wing, anti-war, anti-Bush images, and the album's explict language turned off most radio stations to it (Smart marketing? I don't think so.) If you feel the urge to buy this album, I have three words for you: Just say ... NO!! It's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"AL Reviewed","review":"madonna is neither a good or bad singer. Her voice is like every Tom, Dick and Harry--average.'Nothing fails' is the best track on here. Has a decent beat, if only lacking in good lyricism.Otherwise AL is neither adventurous or terribly bad. Just average enough to earn 2 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed Madonna Fan","review":"I've been a true Madonna fan since she had some her first hits like Everybody, Physical Attraction, and Holiday in the 80's.For me, my favorite music from Madonna ranged from dance, pop and ballad. Throughout the years her music has progressed with the times and she always managed to come up with a hit. She always had that ability as an artist.Unfortunately, this album, in my opinion, is probably one of her worst albums to date. I purchased it and found myself skipping each track in hopes of finding something that sounded anything like Die Another Day. Boy was I disappointed. I honestly tried to listen to the entire cd one day in my car, and just couldn't. It wasn't anything I wanted to hear. When I buy a new cd I usually like at least more than one of it's tracks - this one was a failure. It just sounded like Madonna trying to re-invent herself again but with bad music.Her Music cd was much better, and I must admit I was hoping to hear more of that music on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word...Awful","review":"I was a big Madonna fan. I went to her concerts, I bought her CD's, and life was good. Then came this CD and the burning question, how could such a talented, insightful artist change her style to this awful sounding mess? Granted I should have seen it coming with her brilliant rendition of \\"American Pie\\" but yet I still believed that some good still existed in the universe. Her fans that loved her first albums are now casualties in her efforts to explore a new type of music that somehow seems to escape me. The bottom line here folks is if you like her older albums you are going to hate this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"This cd s[tin]ks. Madonna sounds horrible, and the songs all sond the same \\"exception american life\\" that song is upbeat and all but the rap in it sounds so [bad]. Madonna just seemed predictable in that song like you knew each line before she sang it. She just rymed words without meening. The title is a failed attempt to get on the over done American theme, just to sell a cd. It is very empty, just listen to the lyrics. The best track on the cd is love profusion, it has the sound that you would expect from madonna. That song is the only reason that i gave this cd 1 star. Without that song this would be a zero if it was possible. This cd is a stienker, not a keeper, avoid!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful cd","review":"This album has left many to question. Perhaps one of Madonna's most revealing albums, American Life is a stop along Madonna's musical journey that is most humbling to listen to. The queen of pop takes time here to remind us that she is only human. Believe whichever review you wish, American Life belongs to Madonna both lyrically, and musically. It is richly layered with dynamic chords, keys, organic, and inorganic sounds. The beats off each song are completely unexpected, yet lyrically the most revealing. It's no Ray of Light by any means but further along in the direction Music was going. Alot more guitar and rich vocals. A great delivery from Madonna!High points: American Life, I'm so stupid, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails, X-static ProcessLow point: Mother and Father"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Writing Ruins This Record","review":"I can't imagine any singer allowing lyrics like \\"I'm having a soy latte, double shotte,\\"among a number of other misguided poorly written songs, to be part of their record. It's not only ridiculous, it talks down to the listener. Unless you're maybe 4 years of age, this is an insult to a record buyer's intelligence:))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna needs to retire- Now!","review":"Oh my God...Madonna has hit rock bottom with this totally empty album. All its tracks are recycled songs that we have heard many times before. She lacks any originality with such drudgery as Nothing Fails and a laughably bad American Life- the title track. And she has the guts to rap, no less...My sides were in pain, from laughing so hard. You can hardly differentiate one song from the next. Madonna sounds as monotone and tone deaf as ever- out of tune and out of sync. She has the misfortune of not being able to sing. At least her 80's music had some decent songs. This is plain sad, and Madonna needs to hang it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sal, the Italian Gal","review":"Maddie is one hellova a groovy chick!!! This album rocks and, in my opinion, her best to date--electronica. The tracks on this album just make me feel great to be alive. Thank God this is a CD and not vinyl, otherwise I would have had to purchase several of them by now. Shoot your best shot and keep on livin, madge. smooches and curtsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"she still got it","review":"I have been a Madonna fan since 97\\" and I have almost all her albums and singles. This new album is good but some of the songs are weird and with way too much effects on her voice. I hope her new album when it comes is without any effects. She still got it and I think she got an okay voice. Hollywood and Nothing Fails is best on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the Disco Bimbo","review":"Madonna should forget about doing it alone! She's not a music genius, she'd better get Patrick Leonard's help once again. Perhaps she'll make it back as a disco bimbo!Avoid this piece of trash at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly not Very Good","review":"I always hoped Madonna's voice would get better and better as the years went on, but she seems to be struggling throughout American Life. She doesn't have a real sense of conviction for the music. She was never a great singer, but the music always seemed to overshadow her limited vocal abliilities. This time there are two strikes agianst her. Her voice is still weak, but so is the music. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!!!!","review":"This album is the best piece of work she has ever produced. It's homogenous-sounding in terms of production, yet it is full a diversity in its song style. Her vocal is breathtakingly good. It is acoustic, yet electronic. It is '80s, yet very modern. It has taken 20-years for Madonna to create her finest work. There is not a bad song on it. The sound is very mature and there are so many different songs that every fan will find something they like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna has matured","review":"Although alot of these songs will never make regular airplay, I love this cd. Mellow and introspective, Madonna reveals alot of herself in her lyrics, and her voice is lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Album in Years!","review":"Madonna has done it again. Every song on this album is great! Love the folky and acoustic songs and the dance tracks are great..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never A MADONNA Fan BUT love AMERICAN LIFE","review":"I've always appreciated Madonna's POP sensibilities but never really loved much of her music. (I still say \\"Physical Attraction\\" is one of her best songs. ) However, the first half of AMERICAN LIFE is pretty darn great. Although, her lyrics are about as sophisticated and self-absorbed as a 15 year old, she still pulls it off with excellent phrasing, great melodies and mixing/producing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"This is one of her better albums of late...if you liked \\"Ray of Light\\", you'll like this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna Rules!!","review":"Madonna has once again put out a terrific album. In a few short words to describe the music on this album I would have to say the lyrics illustrate the postmodern condition perfectly. From songs about what you supposedly need to be happy as in the case of American life, to songs such as Hollywood that display the false nature of the world, and Nobody Knows Me that displays the isolation of the human condition, this cd hits almost all issues of life that everyone can relate to over the head. Along with Madonna's powerful lyrics the cd contains a catchy beat throughout. I haven't taken it out of my cd player since I bought it. Listen to the entire cd it is well worth your time! Go Madonna!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aging Madonna in Crisis","review":"I can't look at her anymore. She's grotesque. Her voice is embarrassing-- especially on this record. Rapping??? Spare me. She needs to call it a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's Best CD (That I own)","review":"I think I know why this CD is generally getting pretty bad reviews- because of the heavy guitar content. People know Madonna as the upbeat and fun singer and they don't like the straying style. However, AL is better than MUSIC, RAY OF LIGHT, and THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION because it has staying power in my CD player. I love the stop and go beat of the title track and other favorites are \\"Hollywood\\"-This song is really catchy, \\"Mother and Father\\"-real fun song with interesting rap, \\"Love Profusion\\"-cool guitar sound and chorus, I think it would make a good second single. Anyway, get AL if you like introspective music with a little guitar and electronic twist to it and total electro tracks (like \\"I'm So Stupid\\" and \\"Nobody Knows Me\\") The only song I can't seem to get into is \\"Nothing Fails\\" Other than that, A+! Kudos to Madonna for getting personal and talking about today's current culture is such a great way!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna is a Putrid Puppy","review":"Not only is Madonna sick -- groping and kissing young girls half her age, but her music wreaks to high heaven. She should be locked up in a cell with other sick puppies like herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna Who???","review":"This album cracked me up. Madonna the rapper? No wonder Missy Elliott's American Idol rip-off show bombed on UPN. Madonna was on as a guest judge, and sadly that didn't get any viewers interested. The show ranked a paltry #102 out of 115 programs for that week in the nielsen ratings when Madonna guested. Looks like her star has seriously sunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try, But It Stinks","review":"I never thought Madonna could sing, and I especially don't think so now after this sad record.

These two women are much more talented, and a lot easier on the eyes...."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Dull As a Dill Pickle","review":"madonna is ok for her dance music, but I gave A.L. a listen, and it landed at one of my garage sales last summer.

At First, I did not appreciate the lyrics, but I just love the tunes, but as you keep on listening this album, you can reveal what Madonna wants to provoke in this album. I appreciate the lyrics more than ever. This is the most matured lyrics that Madonna has ever done and very personal as well. A music that have deep meanings will always be beautiful - for a lifetime. I want to give two thumbs up to Madonna. This is a very good CD. A very worth to buy. I can't wait for her upcoming album which was rumored to be release on 2005. \\"AMERICAN LIFE\\" album - 5 STARS Very Excellent. Keep up the good work Madonna...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance Music Mixed With Folk-Music......Nice","review":"Okay, first of all, Madonna and her 80's styled music days are over so please get over it.This CD is full of lyrics that reflect her conscience and her further exploration of dance beats mixed with acoustic guitar strings. Yes, it's WAY better than what she tried to do on her last CD, 'Music'.All 11 tracks are well produced, even though the album clocks in at just under 50 minutes. It's not mellow and dark like \\"Ray Of Light\\"....but it is dance music.....what Madonna does best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, different....I love it","review":"The first time listening to the song, \\"American Life\\" didn't catch my interest but it wasn't long after that I became addicted to the beat of that song among others on this album. It's an album I seem to hear a new beat/rhythm each time I listen to each song...it's great...has songs like no other - a true album of individuality. If you're a Madonna fan, and/or if you're ready for something new, you'll love this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Music was trying to Be.","review":"Music was a nice album, but it just didn't come together. This album does. Mirwais is again helping Madonna, but this time they get it right. This album is a great follow up to Ray of Light. Like Ray of Light, there is wonderful blend of techno and guitar. Madonna is singing about things that she knows and cares about.Unlike Ray of Light, the songs are not instantly catchy. You have to listen to them a few times to really get to like them, but after you do, you'll be hooked.The title track is one of her best songs, as is Love Profusion. Those two songs alone justify getting this album. Nothing Fails, Nobody Knows Me, Die Another Day, and Mother and Father are also great tracks.I think most of the negative critism of this album is a reaction to the American Life video, not the quality of the album. This is easily one of the best albums to come out in the past couple of years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A old fan , buy her old stuff instead of American Life","review":"I have looked forward to the new Madonna CD, and the first single, Amarican Life is a very good tune, but the rest is not.I prefer ray of light and Music instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lyrics!!!!!

But you cant help but miss the intensity of a usual Madonna album. If it were any other artist, it would probably be their best. I cant help but feel that she played it safe with this one.

People who don't like it just don't understand it","review":"Madonna continues on her journey into higher consciousness...Her lyrics, though spare in some songs, are very deep. She communicates a lot in few words. Those who don't like it just don't understand what she is talking about, which is her path to her spirit and connection to all that is. There are songs about love, songs about her childhood and growth, and songs criticizing our 'American Life' and society. Madonna keeps changing. After listening to this album a few times, it really grew on me. I love her blend of rock/pop and electronica, it's great to dance to and complex to listen to. I HIGHLY recommend this album, it's one of her best yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song!","review":"This song is very good. I'm glad that is has a little rap in the song.

Songs like the stunning \\"Nothing Fails\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" sound like nothing on the radio and are proof that Madonna has continued to evolve and take chances artistically. Whether or not you enjoy the direction of such choices, it is the fact that she was at least willing to stretch that matters most. She did not settle on making a sequel to \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Music\\" (which would have been pointless and boring) or pump out the same contrived [stuff] as other artists.

I mean for any standards really. I didn't think it could get worse.Has Madonna lost the plost?The lyrics in this album would seem to suggest so. Simply because they are so bad I fail to imagine why ANYONE would ever include these songs in an album.

It gets much better after a few listens but you do wish sometimes Madge would lighten up.As much as I have enjoyed the first two singles(American Life and Hollywood), I also feel that Nothing Fails, Mother And Father,Intervention, and Love Profusion are the best tracks and are also single worthy. The only songs that are simply OK and that I usually skip are I'm So Stupid and Nobody Knows Me.I would most definetly recommend this CD but I wish there were a few more lighter tracks in the vein of Don't tell me, Beautiful Stranger, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Confession? American Life is Better than Confessions","review":"Sure, You may see Hung Up and Sorry on TRL and Confessions... has already sold 2x what American Life did but, AL is still the better album. Don't get me wrong, I like both albums. American Life has more substance, more depth and better beats. It has a great techno-vibe, and Confessions has this slow-dance feel (Forbidden Love, especially). I almost feel that she sold out a little. American Life as a commerical failure in the US, so she retreated in these poppy, radio-friendly songs. Again, I love Confessions...it just doesn't have the edge. In American Life, Madonna wore army fatigues and harshly criticized American materialism (ironic isn't it) and it was tough and cool. Confessions seems like generic pop music. If you want an in-your-face, anti-materialism, honest album, buy American Life. Go ahead and buy Confessions too... but American Life first."},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD","review":"this was the best album to have come out in 2003 in quality thought in terms of quantity it didn't sell well at all in the US.

She's unfortunately kind of old looking. But at least she's trying.

CD","review":"Concert promoters are actually in a frenzy over the thousands of tickets going Unsold for madonna's MSG gig, according to NY Daily News. Infact, they've had to drastically reduce ticket prices, in exchange for having to dispose of them. Once very pricey, now at 50.00 or less, for some seats, and people are still not interested. A.L. has also headed into irrelavant territory as the singer herself. She looks to be desperate for the fame she once had. She should be kissing the ground for just having a career, instead of much more successful singer these days, Britney Spears. madonna's not only one of the worst singer's in history of pop music, she's also the worst actress of the century as voted by movieline Mag., and box office poison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy!","review":"Years ago, I bought Madonna's American Life, the last known CD single in my collection. I had heard some of the other songs from her album on the radio; and they were as truly wretched as the tune I bought. The title track is especially appalling, as it combines Madonna's attempts at being not only a rapper but also an acoustic guitar musician a la Sheryl Crow or Joni Mitchell, which she fails to pull off. This record should not even have been released on her own label; that task should have been given to The Simpsons' Krusty The Clown, who would have had the dubious honor of having only one album credited to him on his Oy! Records. In the meantime, Madonna will be strutting in her underwear for the next 20 years and won't know when to quit. Oy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I can't belive I rated this a 1, because I usually really like Madonna's music. When I bought this c.d. and listened to the songs, I could only listen for about a minute, and skipped over to the next song thinking maybe there would be a better one, but there wasn't. The only song, that's catchy is \\"Die another Day,\\" but that's it, the rest of the songs are really not good. There not really anything you could enjoy, it's just almost annoying in a way. I think some tecno is okay, but the way Madonna did this c.d. just wasn't her best. Overall I don't reccomend buying this c.d., listen to it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly- Madonna can't sing","review":"Madonna's pathetic singing voice makes Britney Spears sound like opera singer Beverly Sills.

Comparing one work of art to another doesn't make sense. Ray of Light, Music, American Life. They're all such amazing works of art in their own way. That's what makes Madonna such of an amazing artist. Why would she want to make a 'Ray of Light-part2' or a 'Music-part2'? American Life is original, folksy, and futuristic. It's definitely my favorite Madonna album to date. Essential tracks include: 'I'm so Stupid', 'Love Profusion', 'X-Static Process', 'Intervention', 'Nobody Knows Me', 'Easy Ride', 'Nothing Fails', and 'Hollywood'.So, what is art?Madonna's 'American Life' CD is an amazingly original piece of art. Surely not like the boring top-40 stuff contaminating the airwaves everyday.'American Life' = five stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"why the Vocoder?","review":"Okay, at first I liked this CD, but I really got annoyed by hearing that Vocoder on every other track.

She's not a singer, but a sad wannabe of Britney these days(who's currently topping the Billboard single charts), while every single from Madonna's lastest AL, has failed to make the top 100, with the exception of the title track.

The only two songs that were even worth listening to, have been out for some time.This album is SO very disappointing! The lyrics are so poorly written...Many of the lyrics are repetitive. This is certainly NOT her best work. If she does make another album, I can only hope that it is half way better than what she came up with for this one.It may be time for her to start allowing others to write for her.Many of her songs contain the same messages that her songs in past albums contained. I certainly hope that future albums are MUCH better.

I'm a little surprised no one mentioned the Che Guevera/Patty Hearst with the SLA influenced album photos. That's one of the things that got me. What I love about the album. \\"Nobody Know Me\\"--it sounds like another soon to be hit, \\"Intervention\\"--a surprising layered tune with scrips and scraps of the M's acoustic guitaring and \\"Die Another Day\\"--I did not pay that much attention to it when it first came out but now that I have it in the aegis of my home listening section, what a blast. I dig the stutter-editing. I t-thhought-t I had dust and grime on that part of my CD.

It is probably the most self reflective recording ever made where you as the listener actually feel her sentiments. I guess some critics have to be negative, but one after I heard Nothing Fails and just got chills or even Nobody Knows Me and realized how much of our personality we hide for the sake of other's judgment, I think this is the best thing she's ever done. This album has attitude, it has a message, it is cohesive, it is singable, it is emotional, it is fun, it is jaw dropping and eye opening and it is life. Ask youself what are the most important things in life and then go listen to this cd....this type of modern life is not for me, this type of modern life is not for free....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album!!","review":"Madonna's time spent living overseas seems to have given her a whole new perspective on life, love and America.

I honestly believe that it would be received as a quite superb pop album, perhaps the best of the year. Forget the words if you want to, and just enjoy the music and the singing. In terms of sheer pop music and forgetting all about \\"significance\\" this is probably one of the best albums since the days of Fleetwood Mac and Abba. The latter's \\"Arrival\\" has always been my model of a NEW album in which virtually every track could be released as a single. American Life runs it pretty close!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna needs to retire- Now!","review":"Oh my God...Madonna has hit rock bottom with this totally empty album. All its tracks are recycled songs that we have heard many times before. She lacks any originality with such drudgery as Nothing Fails and a laughably bad American Life- the title track. And she has the guts to rap, no less...My sides were in pain, from laughing so hard. You can differentiate one song from the other. Madonna sounds as monotone and tone deaf as ever- out of tune and out of sync. She has the misfortune of not being able to sing. At least her 80's music had some decent songs. This is plain sad, and Madonna needs to hang it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madge, What happened?????","review":"This is from a fan of Madonna from the early days of her being played on 98.7 KISS FM N.Y.C. Please Madonna go back to your musical roots of upbeat forget about life for awhile dance floor music!! There, is where you glow better than anyone.Is it me or is anyone else disappointed that American Life came with no lyrics.I want to find out if she, during Love Profusion is saying I got you under my skin or I got Jew under my skin?Also,With Madonna being a mother now, I was hoping she would forgo wasting time on an \\"EXPLICIT LYRICS\\" CD. We don't care about hearing her swear. We just want an upbeat CD to Dance or do Pilates and Yoga to With a room full of hotties then you'll know Madonna, We'll be satisfied\\"!!!!!!."},{"rating":"1","title":"need something new!","review":"this CD is only a big noise ,some songs sound good ,but she need to think in some tracks easy ,like BEDTIME HISTORIES ALBUM ,really I'm a fan of Madonna but this album ...sound like a PC-game's soundtrack ... much noise!

Sure there are some clunkers(\\"I'm so stupid\\",the lame title track- who thought to release that mess first?) Poor single choices killed this cd. \\"Love profusion\\" is easily one of her best songs. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is as close to the LIKE A PRAYER era as u can get. \\"Nobody knows me\\" is a gem as well. The closing ballad, \\"easy ride\\" is a trancy journey itself. I strongly suggest picking up this cd and giving it a open listen.. Also there are several new mixes available of some of the songs listed above that are incredible. American Life is an underperforming first rate CD.. Give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"the beast","review":"Madonna is the best artist of the world, shes very amazing in this album, mi favorite songs are: nothing fails, mother and father and american life"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH? WHAT? WHERE'S MADONNA?","review":"Okay, what happened Madonna? You used to be fun. I even thought you were a bad ass for a while there. Some how or another you even wrangled up some fun songs along the way. You were sexy and goofy and fun. I thought maybe you were really interesting in the way women hadn't been since Debbie Harry or Annie Lennox. Then you started putting out these blips and bleeps that you claimed was music. I miss you...or the you I thought was you. Come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Madonna's Best","review":"After awesome CD's like Ray of Light and Music, I was so excited for a new album from Madonna. Saddly, I'm VERY disappointed. The songs are all so average. When all the controversy happened over the American Life Song, I had to check it out and I immediatley thought it was so corny! Everytime I hear it I have to turn off the radio because it annoys me, especially that part where she raps about being, or should I say, not being \\"satisfied\\". The \\"Hollywood\\" song really bugs me too. There are a couple of ok tracks but mostly this is a disappointment...not Madonna's best...bummer...I'll be looking forward to her next CD, hopefully it will be worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna can do better!","review":"I'm a BIG Madonna fan, and was really looking forward to this CD. Unfortunately it wasn't enjoyable. By the lack of sales, I guess I'm not alone in this thinking. The best song is \\"Hollywood,\\" because it has a driving beat. Don't get me wrong -- the CD has lots of potential. The problem is that it sounds too robotic. That works for Kraftwerk, but not for Madonna. Her best albums had imaginative and supportive production (Nile Rodgers, Stephen Bray/Patrick Leonard, William Orbit). Not so with this one. Let's hope Madonna has the entire CD remixed so that \\"American Life\\" can have a second life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's best album to date! Fun and very catchy!","review":"Madonna's \\"American Life\\" continues where \\"Music\\" left off, but gives you even more insight into her thoughts and dreams. Every song on this album is a personal statement dealing with the pitfalls of fame, the emptiness of fortune and the delusion that what we all strive for...really doesn't equal to the power of loving and being loved. That is why this album will be a hit. You can picture Madonna singing these songs to her loved ones, but it's also the kind of music that you can make your own.Songs that are the bomb in my opinion: Hollywood, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails (the best!), X-Static Process, Mother and Father. They have \\"hit\\" written all over them. The remaining songs are very catchy and fun. Overall, it makes a great Spring/Summer album that will put you in the best mood. Cheers to Madonna for outdoing herself once again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mother of Re-invention is at it again","review":"This cd is not what everyone is going to be expecting. Madonna drifts away from her usual (if anything she does can be usual)pattern of music-making on this album. There are only a few songs with very stong beats that could pass for radio hits (American Life, Hollywood, I'm so stupid). The rest of the songs, besides Die Another Day, lend themselves to the acoustic Madonna with some funky electronica beats that made Music such a smash. Overall it's a nice listen, but not something to play at your next party to get things started. I was a little disappointed initially, but I'm starting to come around to it the more I listen to it. With all that said, this cd is a must have for Madonna fans. Happy listening..."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL RELEVANT!","review":"I'll make it brief-- Madonna fans will love this cd (if not at first, then definitely after a few listens!!!)... After listening to this for the last week, it has grown on me considerably; initially, I thought it sub-par but it has slowly revealed itself to be ON par with Madonna's recent work. It is certainly another fascinating piece of the musical puzzle that Madonna has been weaving since \\"Ray of Light,\\" her first radically open and honest work. Thogh not as cohesive as ROL, or even MUSIC, its still totally relevant and has Madonna pushing more boundaries-- but most important is the fact that she is pushing her own boundaries, not just ours...Oh yeah,and she ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna WAY Off Track","review":"After Ray of Light and Music, I thought Madonna had finally found a new, solid direction for her music. This album [is unacceptable]. I can't even say it's interesting. Only two tracks grabbed my attention: \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Mother, Father.\\" And PUH-LEEZE! Who is playing that AWFUL acoustic guitar? I feel bad railing her like this, because I love Madonna and all that she stands for. But this cd is one of the few that I regret buying. Madonna needs something. Like a Prayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"One, long, dreary song.","review":"Madonna has finally managed to create a CD without one noteworthy, enchanting song on it. This CD, if one doesn't listen too carefully, sounds like one really long, really dull song. If one DOES listen carefully, one is assaulted by perniciously dreary lyrics like \\"I'm not religious... you make me want to pray.\\" Blech. While we're at it, what's with the voice filters? It is to be hoped that in future endeavors Madonna will either return to form and create mindless, perky pop or give her proposed CDs a listen and decide that they're too pedestrian to be unleashed on the public at large."},{"rating":"1","title":"20 Years Later...It Could Be A Lot Worse","review":"It hurts to read so many reviews that automatically pass this album off as if it were the \\"Gigli\\" of the music world in 2003, especially since that is really not true. Admittingly, it is the worst Madonna record I have heard, but there are definitely a few highlights that save this album from being truely disasterous.\\"American Life\\" is a decent upbeat song and fun to listen to, though not really dance-able or anything. For a title track, it is on the weak side, but still can be enjoyed. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is undoubtedly the stand-out track on this record. The lyrics are touching and the overall message is superb. A soft ballad of sorts to warm the heart and embrace the positivity of relationships.Yes, I was and still am disappointed by this album, but that does not mean it is a complete failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for old people.

She tries here, but fails because the material is so weak. Plus she has the nerve to take a stab at rapping. My sides were splitting from laughing so hard. It looks like she's in dire need of a big time producer here. It may help her music sound passable. American Life has a low budget sound and suffers from way too much overdubbing. I think it's time to pack it all in and try another career altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Life Goes Straight Into The Toilet","review":"This is another laughable effort. Madonna should've learned after this album was headed into wasteland territory, not to release another bargain record- the lifeless EP, R&R. But nevertheless, she has such a dire need to keep her name in the public eye, she'll stoop to any measures, even though she's just embarrassing herself. Whomever taught Madonna that you can call yourself a singer, when infact the chipmunks have better vocal range, should be shot. The tracks here are not even worth discussing. So low in musical quality and lyrical content, the entire thing falls flat on its face. The worst record released in the last 20 years by any artist..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Madonna Fan","review":"What can I say....this CD was disappointing from the very first song to the last! While I've been a Madonna fan for 20yrs now, even I could not ignore the fact that this CD was pure \\"filler\\" to keep Madonna in the public's eye while she works on the REAL album that will come out at some point! Every song is over engineered with no catchy sound...something Madonna is generally well-known for producing. Overall, the CD-listening experience can be compared to eating a dry rice cake...when what you really wanted was a chocolate fudge cake! Yes, its a wierd statement to make, but that's my way of saying that this was one of the most unsatisfactory music-listening experiences I've ever had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Ray of Light has faded...","review":"When 'Ray of Light' emerged - it was a new Madonna.

This album began to get on my nerves early on and after one full listen, I turned my back on the Material Girl. What happened? Were these extra tracks left over from the last CD?

My advice - save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"First of all I am a great Madonna fan, and have been for many years. But I must be honest. This is easily the most awful thing she has ever done. That \\"spark\\" clearly evident on her other releases has disappeared.There is nothing remotely interesting about this album. There are no memorable melodies and the lyrics are plain terrible. And what convinced Madonna she can rap! I feel embarrased for her!Mostly I wish she would stop rehashing old ideas and material. It clearly shows a lack of vision. We know your mother died when you were five, Madonna. You've told us again and again. GET OVER IT! She obviously realises there are always going to be fans out there who will buy her albums and give them 5 star ratings, regardless of how bad they are. I should know.

The whole mess has absolutely no direction and if she scores a Top 10 hit in the US from this, I'd be very surprised! I have not heard the title track played one time on any radio station! The title \\"American Life\\" is a trick, to lure Americans to buy her CD and help support her lavish lifestyle! Don't be fooled by her trickery this time! Just remember how Madonna used to be, circa 1986!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Madonna fan, but not of this album","review":"In anticipation of her upcoming release, \\"Confessions On the Dancefloor\\", I was checking out what people had wrote about her previous albums. I was very shocked to see several reviews offering 5 stars of this album. Being a huge fan of Madonna, I have every album and this by far is the least enjoyable. Delving into issues of politics and family, the album falters steadily off the invigorating pace she had going with her 2 previous albums. While 'American Life' and 'Hollywood' try to recover the Mirwais-influence felt on \\"Music\\", the attempt at rap altogether swallows up the first single and the ladder, although the one of the better songs on the album lacks the commercial readiness for any type of radio airplay. Unfortunately the best song \\"Die Another Day\\", was only added on after being a hit previous to the album's release; and to get that I suggest buying the maxi-single that include several amazing remixes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different but nice!","review":"The \\"Material Girl\\" has grown up. This is so different from all her other albums, though you can tell by her albums as she got older the music & style did change to reflect her maturity. If you are a die hard Madonna fan you will probably enjoy this album. If you just like her music every once in a while you could go either way (like it or hate it). I am not a die hard fan though I have like her music over the years since she first bursted onto the music scene and I have to say that the music is awesome! If you're a little liary then listen to a few of the sample tracks from Amazon and you can judge for yourself. Some of the lyrics are rather bold and some are haunting but this is Madonna and she's always done her own thing which is why so many people like and enjoy her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's grow","review":"I am not a musician, and I may not be the best critic when it comes to Madonna because I've always thought she's great. I agree with a lot of people saying that American Life is not her greatest album, yet, I think this is not a bad CD at all. I'm afraid she's doing something that most of us don't know how to do (or maybe don't want to), accept our own mistakes. The message in the album is good, I call that evolution. Musically it is all packed together very good, the songs follow one another smoothly. May not be as danceable as we want to, but it provides a good mix of acoustic guitars, electronic sounds and her voice.About the rap in American Life and the tone in Mother and Father, well, that's Madonna, don't ever expect her to be static, without trying something different. As good as Ray of Light is (maybe the best) if this album sounded the same, it wouldn't be her 'new' material"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten","review":"Was this insipid CD recorded by William Hung????

The songs are monotonous, repetative, and all sounded pretty much the same to me. I don't know why she would make an album with electronica-like undertones because it's just not her style. She's always trying to push one envelope or another, but this one just wasn't pushed correctly. \\"American Life\\" was the worst song. She actually attempts to rap, but it's about yoga and coffee. That's not exactly a very rap-like bit of subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Forced and Contrived","review":"There isn't anything new or ground-breaking on American Life.

To demonstrate her gangsta tendencies and secure a coveted Parental Advisory stamp, she tosses \\"F...it\\" into the chorus -- scared of that.

Big yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just OK..","review":"I can't give this record more than 2 stars. Madonna isn't that great of a singer. Her music was pretty decent at one time. Even though she never had a real singer's voice--just 1 octave. But her songs at least were danceable, if not lightweight fare. Too bad she couldn't repeat that on AL.

The chorus on NOTHING FAILS is worth the price of the album alone, and the sheer emotion of INTERVENTION, X_STATIC PROCESS and MOTHER & FATHER is heart-felt. Insert this CD into your car stereo and take an hour long drive...much of the album is great traveling music.

She doesn't continue the momentum here like she did on Music. There's so many keyboards and synthesizers here that drown out her voice. And not a lot of the songs are memorable. They don't hook into your head like the ones from Music and other albums. Her reinvention factor doesn't help here. And maybe she should leave her personal feelings to herself and not overexpose them too much on this album. But many top selling artists have one bad album within their career.

I don't think Madonna really expects anyone to take it seriously, but it's a fun song with a good beat and a nice chorus, and interesting rap. The remixes on here, are a breath of fresh air. It's refreshing to see Madonna is working with different producers to remix her material. Probably the best mix here has to be the Missy Elliott remix which adds a nice funk to it and some nice uplifting gospel to the chorus. There's two Peter Rauhofer mixes, they will keep you moving and shaking in the club. Another favorite of mine has to be the Oakenfold remix, it just has this mesmerizing beat that brings the song to a whole new level. There is also a mix of \\"Die Another Day\\" on here, done by Richard Humpty, who previously remixed her \\"American Pie\\" remake.

Music is interesting, too. Excellent tracks, but not at Ray of Light level, only for entertainment without meaning. American Life is so bad. I was expecting something special, but Mirwais sucks!! I like some songs, especially Nothing Fails and Mother and Father, but there isn't a killer-track..everything looks the same and she sounds so flat in every song. If you listen to her ballads like Take a bow and The power of goodbye you can see how well she shows her feelings, she rocks! But now she seems to have lost her touch.

Madonna's problem is that she's trying way too hard to fit it with the current pop trends...it doesn't work. It makes her look desperate. The one thing that will keep Madonna from being able to achieve true respect and longevity, past the 20 yr. mark, is that unfortunately she is not blessed with a true singer's voice. She's so limited in her ability to 'measure up' with the true vocalists, it will only hurt her in the long run.

Listen, American Life is not as good as Ray Of Light but it is much better than Music (that's not very hard to outdo, acutally). This Cd is probably the most hard to get used to, because while Music capitalized dance pop and ray of Light tried to stay away from it, American life does both: we have the ballads, we have the dance tracks, we have acoustic sets, but everything is mixed up. The old sound is invaded by the new one, there are echoes of Like A Prayer or something pulled out of Bedtime Stories but at the same time it is like nothing you've heard before. Stand outs are the hipnotic/zen-like Nothing Fails, the Don't tell me Part II Hollywood, and the cool can't-fit-into-any-category Love Profusion.

Madonna never said that this was supposed to be a dancy album (which it actually is) and she never compared it to Ray of Light, so I don't understand how people could compare the two albums. Madonna has always been number 1 for a huge percentage of her career. I mean how many singers are no longer around making hits? Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, just to name a few. Buy the CD it's an unforgetable listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I have been a Madonna fan since 1984,in fact,it was one of the first albums I bought(I was 10 ;).But this is a disappointment for me,I absolutely loved Ray of Light so this was a let down.Lyrics are weak,and probably only makes sense to her alone.The Debbie Harry style of rapping she does in 'American Life' is comical and a dud.Not only that,if that is her take on how American Life is,she needs to stay in England.The love songs dont give me the warm fuzzies either,they are cold and bland.Do yourselves a favor,dont waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this crap","review":"These days, Maddy fans are so ashamed admit being a fan in the open.

I mean it's okay but lets just say that it did flop. And it surely wasn't as good as all the rest of her CDs. Madonna is trying to sound British now, with the techno and everything, minus the rapping, I mean who goes from Italian, to Spanish, and now to British. Sometimes it doesn't effect her songs but there might be one or two songs that sound like songs from whatever country her husband or boyfriend came from. I can't really explain it, but anyway the CD is a dissapointment, bottom line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not gaga...","review":"As a huge Madonna fan, I was very disappointed with this album.

What a great, insightful album. Not all the electronica that rumours would have you believe. The album starts out with the great American life and goes right into a fun, poppy \\"Hollywood\\" A great listen that would be hard to get bored with. The lyrics and the message are inspirational to putting life in perspective and exploring all the facets of life and what is important. I don't mean to say this is some grand statement on life, but it is certainly interesting as well as entertaining. Looking forward to spinning to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music: the b-sides","review":"When I bought Music a few years ago I was afraid Madonna was hitting another low point in her career. American Life has proven that she is in another slump. Her songwriting on this album is contrived and manipulative. The title track is a fluffy song about how superficial fame and celebrity are. This topic is not new for Madonna (check out Substitute for Love and Goodbye to Innocence for superior songs on this topic). She continues with the silly child like writing skills that she began with Music and the \\"skipping sound\\" is also continued on this CD. The familiar vocoders are also present along with a couple of \\"minimalist folk/electronica\\" songs. Madonna and her producer have brought nothing new to the table with American Life. In fact this album should be retitled \\"Music: the b-sides\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is William Orbit when you need him?","review":"I'm a Madonna fan. Having William Orbit do Ray of Light was brilliant. This album is just bad. Elementary school lyrics, casio machine songs. You'd think it was 3rd grade kareoke. I've already given my CD away.

The album would've stronger without it. The title track is a little awkward - Madonna is clearly not meant to rap. The actual singing in that song was lovely but wasn't very catchy. My favorite song on this was \\"Mother and Father\\" where her voice first has a childish quality to it that reflects to the subject of the song. After hearing, \\"There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ/There was a time I had a mother, it was nice,\\" it really sticks with you.There were some songs definitely worth hearing on this album. Would've be nice if she'd released the original music video, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"irredemable garbage","review":"Self-absorbed, cynical, horribly contrived, inconvincing posturing: Madonna has done all these before in her career, but very rarely on the same CD. American Life is a truly black eye on her otherwise stellar career, and one I'm sure she'll have problems topping. Her credibility is all but lost after a year of garbage: this album, a horrible first single whose controversial video was pulled, the Gap commercials (what the hell was Missy on??), and the whole Britney scandal. I mean, Madonna, shying away from controversy? Welcome to the 21st century, I guess. And that rap? Like Ed the Sock said, it was trying to be hip, but is the musical equivalent of a soccer mom in stretch pants. Ouch. Garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"not her strongest but impressive lyrics","review":"AFTER PICKING UP AMERICAN LIFE I BEGAN TRACKING ALL 11 SONGS, SO FAR EACH SONG HAS STRONG LYRICAL CONTENT BUT THE SOUND IS KIND OF THIN.

She has made a fortune off exposing herself. Now I think her manager and agent have informed her that her looks have gone south, so its time to try and be a \\"serious\\" artist. And don't get me wrong, i'm proud of her for learning how to play a G chord on a guitar. And yes I agree when people say that there wouldn't be any Britneys and Christinas without Madonna paving the way. NO KIDDING! They are following the Madonna blueprint to the Tee.

Namely, poor reception to her god awful \\"Swept Away\\" movie, her annoyance with the shallow entertainment industry, and how dissatisfied she is with her wealth.Are you f---ing kidding me? This is easily the most irritatingly naive and downright disturbing collection of lyrics I've ever read. Who the hell sympathizes with this kind of bullplop? Who could even TOLERATE this sort of delusional whining from one of the biggest, richest, pop stars of the past 20 years!? The fact that ANYONE could be so horrifyingly arrogant as to entitle this dung \\"American Life\\" in a post-9/11 America is jaw dropping - and I reacted this way as someone barely even affected by 9/11!

Laughable lyrical content (\\"American Life,\\" \\"Die Another Day\\"). The baroque use of electronica and voice synthesizing do little to showcase Madonna's commentary on the American Dream (or American life, as the title suggests). Overall, this album is a missed opportunity. We know, as listeners, that a middle-aged woman as shrewd and business-oriented as Madonna would have better things to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has been","review":"Madonna, like a gaseous form, is good at change. And like some gas she stinks. Every week she's changing the way she looks, so she lingers around in headlines and tabloids but we should take notice that one place she isn't is all the music charts. Unfortunately if it weren't for the name 'Madonna' half the crap she comes out with would be found in bargain bins. She isn't consistent enought to come out with a hit record. I thought she was going to try to take shots at the Bush administration with this album, but after what happened to the Dixie Chicks she pulled back. I do see a lot of potential for her in the children book business though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk","review":"This magbetic square is pure junk.

Not even worth a 1/10th of the price to buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This brand is not good","review":"I have used this controller in the past except I got them from Progress lighting. They worked great. Unfortunately, one of them blew the 1st (fastest) speed. So after living with it for a long time, I decided to finally replace it. Thinking the Monte Carlo version (which looks identical except for their logo) would be the same thing I bought one.This controller makes the fan motor hum and make other noises like it's going to self destruct. It's possible this is just a defective controller but I wish I would have just kept the old swith with the 3 working speeds.If this wasn't defective, I highly recommend this switch because it works well and looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monte Carlo 4-speed Fan Control Switch","review":"I ordered and installed four of these switches throughout my home.

It works perfectly, but the fan speed settings seems backwards (\\"1\\" is the fastest speed, while \\"4\\" is the slowest, huh?). It came with it's own switchbox cover, but I didn't need it since I was just replacing an existing switch. I bought this for my living room and master bed ceiling fans. One fan is a Monte Carlo brand, while the other is a Hunter. This switch worked well for both and actually converted both 3-speed fans to 4-speed.I bought the white colored switch, but the white color wasn't a 100% match with my existing hardware. It looked slightly almond. My only other complaint is the size of the housing, which made the installation a small struggle to fit the unit in the switchbox with all the wires in the back.i deducted a star for the things I mentioned above, but this switch is still a recommended buy if you are looking for a no frills design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gardner re-imagines the classic Holmes series!","review":"The late John Gardner has re-imagined the James Bond series (following the passing of Ian Fleming) and has also paid fine homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with his series of novels featuring Sherlock Holmes and his arch-nemesis, Moriarty.Set a handful of years following the alleged \\"deaths\\" of both Holmes and Moriarty, the \\"Napoleon Of Crime\\" is amassing his evil band of followers to enact revenge against all who have done them wrong --- leaving the final strike for Sherlock.This novel is thoroughly engaging and the way Holmes turns the tables on his rival is sheer brilliance.

This disk features them in their best context--live. Legendary guitarist Steve Kimock wails away in spectacular fashion on several instrumental pieces. Forever is Nowhere is a masterpiece of soaring slide guitar, and the cover of Little Wing is of the same stature as the original and with the Clapton version. The quality of the recording is excellent. Fans of great guitar and psychedelic music in general should enjoy this immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"No \\"zeros\\" here !","review":"The first thing I was struck by was the quality of this live recording. Flawless, except for maybe a little too much reverb on the sax. The best part, though, is that this album grows on you. And grows and grows. Steve's guitar seems subtle at first, but every listen brings out more of what he's really all about. The sax playing is a little sappy, but the keyboards more than make up for it. Too bad it isn't all from one show, instead of a \\"compilation\\" of several shows, but there's always next time. This album seems to only hint at what they really do.

I really found this book to be a dissapointment(as well as shaums 3000 solved problems in calculus). The way the material is presented is not clear at all. The problem solutions are hardly presented in a way in which the reader can understand and learn from them. They just confuse the reader even more. As I have found with all Schaum's outlines and solved problems books, they are of poor quality and of no real use to anyone. Try Harcourt Brace Jovonovich calculus (search HBJ Calculus).

I would have to say that it was definetely not worth the money. As far as looks it was very realistic but every time my daughter barely touched it, it fell apart. The tray wouldn't stay on for anything. It was quite heavy and if it were to fall on your child's toe it would really hurt. Every time she took her baby out of the high chair the fabric seat would come off with the baby. The snaps that were supposed to keep the seat from swinging when it was converted to a high chair were useless. Most of the time we had a swinging high chair with no tray or seat, pretty much just metal bars. I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone! The Little Mommy high chair is sturdier, but is exceptionally small! We are still in search for the right high chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled by the Fisher-Price Label!","review":"The Ocean Wonders doll accessories aren't actually made by Fisher-Price. They are made by Tolly Tots and sold under the Fisher-Price label. I purchased the stroller and the high chair, expecting quality Fisher-Price toys.

Only giving 1 star because there isn't a lower rating!","review":"I got this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. It took about 15 minutes to snap together, although the directions are completely obtuse and worthless. I couldn't get one leg to stay attached unless I pushed it in so far that the #1 setting for the toy was useless. Then I couldn't get the leg OUT to correct it. The seat is fabric that stretches over a metal frame--with no support in the middle, so if your child places any pressure on it at ALL, the fabric comes off the frame. The 'tray' attachment is a total mystery--I am a fairly sturdy, strong woman, and I could NOT get that tray attached--had to have my husband do it, yet with feather pressure from any of us including the 2 year old, the tray pops off.Absolutely dreadful waste of time, returning it today--luckily I could fit all the pieces back in the box as I couldn't disassemble the toy completely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This For Your Child!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Parents beware! I was so excited when I saw this toy. It looked just like the real fisher price aquarium bouncer. I spent 2 hours trying to put this toy together on Christmas Eve. I had to force all the pieces to stay together which took both mine and my husband's effort and they still fell apart. The minute I tried to convert it from a bouncer to a highchair the legs fell off. Needless to say \\"Santa\\" was left without an incredible present to place under the tree. This toy looks great just like a real baby bouncer but looks are deceiving. Don't be fooled by the fisher price name (though they do tend to normally make great products). Save your time and your money, read the other negative reviews and heed their warning. If your child is young (3 or under) I recommend the Little Mommy by Mattel products. Not at all realistic looking but much more durable and a cinch to put together. My daughter will play with these for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the neck!","review":"These Ocean Wonders toys for baby dolls have got to be the worst toys that I have ever come across!

I put a piece on, I stick the doll in it, and the piece pops right off. They are not very sturdy at all. They really need to be screwed together or something. I would not buy any of these items at all. And now two months later, she doesn't even play them at all!

It is very cute and looks very much like one for a real baby, but.....just like other reviewers stated the tray just would not stay on and my daughter could not put it on herself. I kept having to put it on for her. Last night the tray was just laying on the floor in front of the high chair and I decided it just needed to go back to Toys R' Us. We did not have the box any longer (since Santa brought it) and they were going to make me get another one and I explained that we did not want another one. They gave me the money back and we will look for something else.

If he'd only had an editor, though, this massive volume would have come it at a third of its weight and would have been a better book.

Very small but easy to use!! would recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad!","review":"The camcorder's quality is pretty good, however the picture quality isn't. I hate to say it, but even when it's on the best possible resolution, it's really \\"grainy\\", not like a shot from a regular digital camera. Other than that it's great!It is nice that it is tiny, though! You can take it anywhere and it has the wide screen capabilities. It's a nice little camcorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection slightly flawed","review":"This is a fine little camera. Everything is as advertised and more, except for one glaring exception. The remote control is a plastic piece of junk with (at least in my case) an unopenable battery compartment. I could not get it replaced without sending the whole package back to the manufacturer, so I'm basically stuck with it. But other than that, as I said, it's a fine little camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannon obviously never tried using the remote control","review":"I have never seen a remote control, or any other battery operated device where the insertion of batteries was so difficult.

It showed up pretty fast. I hadn't heard of Electronics Expo, but they got the job done and saved me a good amount over the local stores here. We have a newborn, and this works great for general use (filming playtime, baths, etc). If the lighting is low the picture will be dark, but usually it seems manageable. Pretty easy to use, didn't even read the manual yet. I haven't had a chance to put an SD card in it yet so I don't know how the snapshots will look, but this camera also allows you to take a snapshot of any frame within the video, so thats cool. They have a newer model out soon, or now but I could have only pre-ordered it at the time, otherwise why not get the newer model. I'm sure this one is even cheaper now though, and the new one doesn't use an SD card or take pics. I guess I find the amount of camcorder noise neglegeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warning about filters","review":"I've had this camcorder since 2008, and I'm happy with it still. I have a warning for you if you're considering buying UV and/or polarizing filters - DON'T! I ordered a set, supposedly fit this camcorder, but they do NOT fit! I e-mailed Canon, they said it does not accept filters. After looking at the threads, I noticed they are not round! The sides are rounded, but the top and bottom are almost flat. No way to attach a lense or filter. Other than that, I'm happy with this camcorder. For indoor shots, I use a couple of Sunpak video lights, nice results (too bad they only work for about 15 minutes, and take 5 hours to recharge, but they were cheap). I paid a lot more than the price Amazon is now asking, but that was 2 years ago. So, if you want a decent camcorder for your home videos, this is a good choice. I never tried the included software, can't vouch for that. I use Linux, so it's no use to me anyway. I use dvgrab to capture the video, and Kino to edit and export to MPEG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 15 minutes. Canon won't pay for Shipping","review":"I used this camera for 15 minutes and got the \\"remove the cassette\\" error message. I tried using other tapes thinking it may have been defective but still received the error message. Then I researched the internet and found out that this is a very common problem. Its so common that if you go to the Canon product page, they have a special link to address questions about this error. Canon's website is basically set up to make you think that you, the consumer, may have caused the problem by allowing moisture or dirt inside or by improperly closing the tape door. However, the real problem here is a defective design.Since I bought the camera so recently, you would think Canon would apologize and send me a shipping label. No. They are making me pay for shipping to their repair facility.Needless to say, I will NEVER purchase another Canon product again and I will discourage anyone I know from ever purchasing a Canon product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voices but unmemorable song","review":"Clint and Martina are wonderfully talented singers.

Maybe someday it will be a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Godmother","review":"The Godmother - an excellent take on the private investigator versus organized crime genre - appeals to our intellect rather than baser instincts. Roger Carlson, who tells the story, is a PI in Naples, Florida, and a former NYPD detective. In the course of his work, he accidentally stumbles on a child sex-slave racket run by the mafia.From the first page the pace is breath taking - it is like watching a movie. Carlson exploits well his long police experience and networks for this demanding task. He is also crafty and bright. It is very interesting to see how his knowledge and skills as an amateur magician is put to good use in his fight with the mafia.The Godmother is a well-crafted and entertaining thriller with a direct and realistic plot. The text flows with consummate ease.Only one question remains: when do we get to read the sequel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the deceptive track listing...","review":"I've been looking for some rare tracks and also the Barbara Ann recording for a while when I settled on this compilation; figured the import was a little pricey, but with so many tracks, it was worth it.

She started at 49.99, I said no, then she said she would give me two for 49.99, I said no. Then she said, ok, I am going to cut all my commission out and give it to you for 24.99. And told me she could get in so much trouble for this, I had to keep quiet about it, ha.... Now, no, I don't believe that for one second, but I did think 24.99 was fair, so I bought it. It's a good product. I think they would get better business, and they would gain more respect with potential customers if they posted their price (the REAL ONE) and stuck with it.

No salesperson had told me that I couldn't return the product once the purchase was made. No \\"no return\\" showed up on the receipt.

Be careful on what you buy from this Isreali company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costly product for partial quality","review":"After reading some of the other reviews here, I'm guessing the authors have never before used cuticle oil or ever had their nails buffed professionally. The cuticle oil given with this product is basic, run of the mill, cuticle oil which can also be purchased in a beauty supply store. Same with the buffer. I bought the set and I agree that the products work well together. However, paying $60 for the kit is too much. Even paying $60 for two kits is overpriced.A basic beauty supply store (not a drug store or supermarket) would have the same quality products for much less. You're better off buying a good buffer and cuticle oil at a beauty supply store then purchasing a creamy lotion in the scent you prefer. You'll get the same results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Product, be careful where you purchase","review":"My wife and I also purchased the seacret nail kits from a salesperson in the mall. The products are great quality. I was an aircraft mechanic for the last 10 years. Those years left my hands abused, dry, and callused. After a 10 minute demonstration I was completely sold. Everything we bought works exactly as the salesman claimed, and still does. I believe we got lucky in that our agreed price on 2 kits came out slightly less than what amazon sells the kit for. Please, be very careful what you agree to pay. The product is worth buying but it may take some research and or haggling to get the best deal possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffing block does work, but.....!","review":"I too am always tormented at the mall kiosk. The last time I was there he tried to sell the set for $49.00 and when I refused, he very quietly told me not to tell anyone, but he would sell me 2 for $25.00. Sounded good, but thank God I am so skeptical I had to go home and check Ebay. I picked up 2 of the buffing blocks for $12.00 and I've only used them once and it is wonderful, but I guess per other reviewers it doesn't last long. I will definitely look for a cheaper version when mine don't work anymore. Anyway, after reading the other reviewers, they are a dishonest group and I will not give them my time anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off!!!","review":"Do NOT buy products from this company! Shopping mall Kiosk vendors give out telephone numbers which are actually fax numbers, and dramatically overcharge consumers - over $100.00 - as they lie about the purity and safety of their products. Head office refuses responsibility of any kind and refuses to give out names or numbers of company owners or management. This Israeli company and its salespeople are purely out to dupe you of as much money as possible and refuse return of products unless you buy directly from their website.

Also like that other book, this is intended for couples. Nearly every story is about a couple acting out a fantasy that one or the other had long dreamed. In some stories it's just the couple together. In many, another person takes some role in the couples' play.Some of the fantasies get wild, the kind of things that would be very negative experiences if they happened in real life. In every story, though, it's just play and it's what both in the couple wanted. Despite that, many of these stories have a dark side that doesn't appeal to me. That's fine - there are lots of tastes in the world, and I don't need to share in them all.If your play doesn't have to be gentle all the time, you might enjoy this collection.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"edgy and hot","review":"This book does what so many books try to do and fail: combine literary erotica with hard-edged, taboo sex. It truly lives up to its title. There is no other book like it and each story is terrific. Down and dirty, erudite, dreamy, romantic, shocking, all in well-chosen stories authored by really skilled authors. I especially liked the story where a couple make a handsome man into their sex slave, and all the stories with voyeurism. The story where a man is forcibly taken by two women was a white-knuckler but highly arousing. Bravo, another great anthology by Blue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this book because of all of the good reviews. I was NOT impressed. First of all, the writing is mediocre at best. The stories offer little in the way of meaningful character development and delve right into poorly worded sex scenes. The first three stories I read were about anal sex, watching your wife give another man oral sex and humiliating your husband by tying him up and ball-gagging him then penetrating him with a strap on. To be honest these stories turned me OFF and I'll be returning the book. Save your money this is not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black folk's culture from a white woman's pen...","review":"The story is about black and white folks in their respective communities (and sometimes with eachother) in post civil war Arkansas. Initially I had a hard time keeping the various characters apart, and I had to make myself continue reading at times. The big event that connects everything and everyone is a tornado that kills some and whisps away others. The most intriguing character, perhaps, is the red-headed preacher's wife who is found dangling in a tree by her famous over-metaphorized hair. The black speech is at times interesting, although it feels somewhat artificial and too \\"constructed\\".Overall, it has the all-too-common feel of a white woman's rendition of black folk's culture and a very PC and feminine one at that (somewhat similar to the much more popular \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" by Sue Monk Kidd). It amounts to subcutaneous chick lit - pleasant at times, but ultimately forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant, beatutiful, exraordinarily spritual work.","review":"In Water from the Well Myra McLarey reveals the soul and spirit of a racially divided community in Arkansas early 1900's. Through the stories of its inhabitants she explores the various ways in which religion, race, legend, community and personal relationships act to both keep the races apart-and at the same time binds them together. She shows how the character, soul and spirit of a place can transcend the various forces at work to shape it. In the end one realizes that the story is in fact not really about anyplace in Arkansas but a place we all \\"know\\"--that mystical, ideal, imaginary place called home.McLarey's style and craftsmanship is very reminiscent of that of Barbara Kingslover. It's a pity her work is not nearly so well known or recognized.Water from the Well ranks as one of the two or three best books I've read in the last decade.

Most people only watch it because of all the MGM stars in it. i personally think this is the most boring part of the picture. I enjoy the romance between Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson much more than the songs, dances, and comedy scetches of the stars. The only thing I think is wrong with this movie is that Kathyrn Gryason only sings three songs which is hardly displaying her talent (although the songs are pretty good), and Gene Kelly only dances once. I'd like to say to anybody thinking of seeing this movie: go for it. It's wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For die-hard Kelly fans only","review":"Despite the stars in the cast, this is ultimately disappointing. Granted, one doesn't usually watch this kind of all-star musical for the plot, but even so, this is especially weak on characterization and narrative drive. The stars are all concentrated in the last half-hour, and some of them are fun to see; actually, the best bit is Mickey Rooney doing impressions of Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore (and his Barrymore is dead on!). Getting to the end, however, is tedious. The wartime romance angle is routine, spiced up only by some probably unintended Oedipal tension between the girl (Kathryn Grayson) and her father. Gene Kelly is energetic, charming, and sexy in one of his earliest roles, and he's about the only reason to watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thousands Cheer","review":"Why MGM have you not allowed this MOVIE to go onto DVD, don't listen to those that say the first hour is boring, this has to be one of the best musicals of the era if not of all time, I have just about worn out my second video tape of this movie, so please MGM put it on DVD as soon as possible.I am an ardent follower of Kathryn Grayson and coupled with Jose Iturbi is pure magic, I would give this 6 stars if possible, sadly they just don't make movies like this these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I Want Uncle Sam !","review":"\\"Thousands Cheer\\" is one of those many morale building movie musicals released during World War II.

This alleged wartime morale booster is only worth marking time. This clumsy grafting of service romance and all-star review accomplishes nothing but a sense of ennui. For sure there are some high points i.e. Kathryn Grayson's angelic pipes and Gene Kelly's hoofing but otherwise I would just pass this one by. Do yourself a favor and watch \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\" if you want to get into the war bond buying state of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thousands cheer--when it's finally over!","review":"With a cast like this, I thought how they go wrong? Well, they managed! This movie goes on forever, with a plot that's predictable from the first few minutes, yet keeps dragging on and on. The only relief is Gene Kelly's dance routine with a mop, but otherwise there's little that's even musical about it. Be prepared to fast forward to the real entertainment, which is about an hour and half into the movie. During a \\"show for the soldiers,\\" the film makers bring on a huge cast of stars who all have brief songs or scenes. Lena Horne is beautiful as always singing \\"Honeysuckle Rose,\\" Red Skelton does a pretty funny skit, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Lucille Ball, Gloria de Haven, and June Allyson are all right, and Virginia O'Brian is wonderful. Unfortunately, except for these few numbers near the end, it's not worth watching, even for major Gene Kelly fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lighting kit UPDATED","review":"Nice quality lighting kit, although they could throw in some LED markers for the front of the trailer to round out the kit. Only issue was I have a 2000 Ranger and the factory connector would not fit the trailer side connector in the kit. Not a big deal since the kit includes a newer style vehicle side connector and the connector on my 2008 Tacoma fit fine.The really nice thing about the kit is the wiring at the lights are not terminated through those cheap quick connects you find in the low end light sets that are almost always giving you grief.*UPDATE*Since my original purchase in 2009 these lights have given me no problems whatsoever. Still work each and every time I hook up the trailer. The original cheapo set that came on the trailer had to be jacked around with something like 2 or 3 times out of 10 hookups.

It's less often pointed out, but equally true, that biographies are also to a considerable extent works of fiction. \\"Frank LLoyd Wright: A Biography\\" is a case in point. Now, it just so happens that the author of Frank Lloyd Wright's AUTObiography was a great artist, and it shows not only in his archecture, but also in his stylish, accomplished and original handling of English prose. This BIOGRAPHY, on the other hand, is dull, drab, and perfunctory, and its information is second-hand (at best). If you're going to read fiction, I say read GOOD fiction.Also: I've read a number of biographies of composers, and I find that they are almost always written by professional musicians. It seems to me that a biography of Frank Lloyd Wright ought to have been undertaken only by someone with a professional knowledge of architecture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prairie interests","review":"This is an excellent book by Meryle Secrest on Frank Lloyd Wright. It traces the career of America's foremost builder from his days in Chicago as a resident in fashionable Oak Park to his final days on the Arizona desert.

This way we could use it at home and easily take it with us if we traveled anywhere. There was incredibly loud feedback when the phone was first answered. That could have been due to our DSL line, but with/without phone filter, it didn't work. Also, in order to use the \\"boost\\" function, the button has to be pushed and held down while listening and then released when talking.

Brutus is the hero of the play, even though it's named Caesar, Caeser is not the main character, more like the unifying force. Anyway, Brutus is a hertofore honorable soldier brought into the assassination plot by the more sinister Cassius. Caeser has a god complex, and his right hand man is Mark Antony, who is a party boy turned avenging angel. These are the main characters, rounded out by Octavius Caeser who joins the cast near the end.Clever dialogue, and thought provoking story make a fascinating read. This has made a Shakespeare fan out of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One in a series of FREE pamphlets","review":"This pamphlet is one in a series of FREE pamphlets (Educational Leaflets) offered by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological Survey.

It is creatively set in one scene - one simple setting that, in a way, hints at the realism of the play and how such a situation should not be thought of as uncommon to man; for there are many emotionally and physically afflicted men in search of comfort, and, in the same simplicity of the development of this story, we, who are accountable for our human race, can provide an apt form of comfort that does not involve death, but rather life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book required for class","review":"This play was a requirement for one of my courses and showed up in great condition.

Laura has a pure voice and her own songs are a wonderful fusion of Jazz, Blues and Folk. Her first Album 'Laura Smith', (1989), is a brilliant debut and the track 'Jordy' presages 'My Bonnie'.

The book not only uses logic as its basis for the conclusions, but true and justifiable evidence and experimentation. The book is one of a kind and a classic that should endure. It has theories such as Universal Consciousness and genetic effects on the mind, as well as the effects of the media and positive/negative thinking. The information available in this book is priceless because of the evidence that is included in it! I've been fortunate enough to meet the author and I have to say that he is perhaps the most interesting man I've met. I recommend this book to everyone, as a writer and social scientist myself.

With it's hard science, this series scratches the Greg Egan Diaspora itch, and yet has enough melodrama to satisfy my desire for emotional manipulation. One interesting aspect of the story is that with nearly omnipresent super-intelligent AI everywhere, the character's foibles and motivations are brightly lit for everyone's evaluation, resulting in a unique self-awareness to everyone's behavior.That said, the author's treatment of female characters seems jarringly ham-handed and one-dimensional. And although I like long passages of introspection and second-guessing, I can imagine that some readers will be tempted to do a bit of skimming.But all in all I found it a fun read and would readily recommend the whole three book series: The Golden Age, The Phoenix Exultant, and The Golden Transcendence, in that order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive, heavy duty","review":"Box stated the stand supports maximum 2 x 19\\" monitors, I mounted 1x 22\\" and 1x 19\\" with no problem.

I can clearly see the images in the screen HOWEVER I will say that it is nowhere near what is portrayed on the box and in tv ads.I didn't expect an Olympus quality camera for $20, so I guess that's not why I'm so freaked out by the quality. You get what you pay for.I also find it difficult to keep an image in the screen and then have to touch the screen with the stylus to take a picture...awkward at best.Would I purchase this again?

I bought this on February 26, 2005 (which was my 13th birthday), and it did work better than the reviewers said....for a month, that is. The other day I wanted to use the Pixter Camera, and it worked for two minutes and then the original Pixter starting screen and theme song went over it!!!!! Plus, some of the pictures are clear, but they're really dark. I mean, despite the reviews I had read, I didn't expect high quality pictures with that thing, but I also didn't expect to be writing a bad review on the product a month later after it stopped working right, either. Parents, don't waste your hard-earned cash on this worthless piece of crap. Get them an iZone mini instant camera instead. They'll be just as happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIXTER CAMERA IS NO FUN","review":"I purchased the Pixter Digital Camera for my daughter. She loves to play with my digital camera and I thought it would be a great way to keep her happy and my camera safe. But the Pixter camera proved to be a huge disappointment. The picture images are nothing like the ones they show in the TV ads. In fact its nearlyimpossible to see an image. Forget about indoor pictures. You can't see anything. Outdoor pictures are not much better. I called the company and they agreed the pictures are not like the ones in the ad. They promised to send a guide to getting better images which I still have not received. This product is a dud and a total waste of money. If I could I would rate this a big zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad and pricey","review":"I own the pixter color and I went and bought the camera.Very bad choice. When taking the pictures, you saw a very blury picture. Really, I think that it's just a dark blob!You can buy your kid a $9.00 throw-a-way camera and for less money, it'll do better.The pixter was a sucsess, and this was a hurting to the pixter industry.This is very pricey and it doesn't even work for my pixter color so I had to return it.Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you own a 1000 watt bulb?","review":"We love our Pixter and have several games. But, I bought this and returned it before my son ever saw it. I can't believe they even approved this for production. If you have a photography studio in your house then this is the perfect purchase for you. There is not enough light provided inside the home for this to work. There is a reason that cameras have flashes. It didn't even work a little bit. I couldn't make out any of the images I tried to take. It was all a gray blur. I am sure it would work outside but my kids aren't playing with this kind of a toy when they are outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought my 8 yr old son the pixter just for this digital camera and it is awful.

Also, the literature does not tell you that you cannot download the pictures you take -- you can save up to ten in the machine but if you want to take more you have to delete some. The picture quality is so bad, sometimes you can't even tell what the picture is supposed to be. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We bought this camera for our son for Christmas. He is seven, so he thinks it is cool, but to be honest, you can not even see the pictures that he takes. Just slight images. I agree with the other review.

It was one of his main gifts for Xmas...pixter and all. Well, at first I thought it was broken because youcan't see a single image on the screen and from the box you think your images are going to come out perfect!! Well, he is so disappointed he won't even touch his pixter, he thinks the camera is broke and wants me to take it back and get him a new one...no way am I getting this thing again!! I am taking it back and just buying him a real camera. Don't know if I will keep the pixter or not...hopefully he will play with it after the camera goes back!

My 5 year old son had asked for this for his birthday, which was today. He hasn't tried this out yet; he went to sleep on the way home from Chuck E. Cheese's, and will probably sleep all night. I tried this out for him, so that I would know how to help him with it in the morning after he awakes. He is really going to be disappointed. We will try outside photos after daylight, but I'm probably going to return this and get him a real camera, and maybe a different Color Learning software cartridge for the Pixter, (which actually IS a great product). What a shame that Fisher-Price dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother. It's a joke.","review":"The \\"quality\\" of pictures this thing takes is laughable.

I saw the advertisement for the digital camera and thought it looked like fun. I ordered two and when they arrived just before Christmas opened them to make sure they worked alright. At first I thought they were broken... then discovered they dont even work on the multi-media pixter which my oldest daughter has. On the Color Pixter it is so hard to get a visible picture. So now that we are stuck with these our challenge is to see if we can get a picture that looks like something you took a picture of.

I happen to have a habit of buying toys for my \\"children\\" and let them play with the toys. I bought the color pixter (which by the way is educational and fun at the same time). I spent the $30 for the digital camera and was VERY disappointed that you can only create a picture if there is a tonof light. Basically, the sun has to be the background. Overall, this is the only pixter item that I or the children did not have fun with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this \\"camera\\"!","review":"Don't waste your money! The difference between the advertisement pictures and the actual output is day and night!

If they improve upon this product it would be good, otherwise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your hard earned money","review":"At first I was very excited to see that Pixter had come out with a digital camera. My husband is a photographer and since we love all the other color pixter titles we decided to buy this for our daughter so she can learn to take pictures for herself. There were none available at Christmas time so we would pick one up after the holidays. I'm Soooooo glad that we didn't. I tried one that my friend bought for her daughter and the picture quality was terrible. You can bearly see anything and unless you have very steady hand all you have is a blur.

Coming off the creative high of Puppet Master, I expected something equally varied and creative. Its hard to believe this is Mike Weed and the rest of the crew. I waited a while to review so that I could maybe begin to give a crap about this release, but no such luck.The music and vocals are just...well, boring. Yeah, there's a lot of technical guitar wizardry, but so what? Its rather aimless and meandering. King is up to the same old routine as well.

This album just draws out some sweet substance and really creates a comforting feeling.If you are looking for something creative, don't approach this album.

The Jewish teachings of the time put a great emphasis on holy places and buildings, but Jesus only used the buildings as a place of gathering and teaching, but...

It has a brief but informative introduction and would serve the 'average' reader well.As to the comment in a previous review that this book was written by the 'doubting Thomas'of the Gospel of John, I would hope that most people realize such an assertion is hog wash.Read the introduction to the book and get a more informative perspective on authorship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, no relationship with Jesus, just man's 'jurps'.","review":"I am really disappointed with this book and wish I hadn't ordered it.

It's what you would expect in a movie like this: action enough for older kids, comedy and cheese enough for younger ones. Clean fun.The highest praise I can give it is that my children loved it and I wasn't bored (the first time.) Recommended for children of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"gave my 5 year old nightmares","review":"the big explosion and the fire almost burning up the Russian man kept my son up till midnight.

My son hated it and I hated the nightmares he had because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"air bud series, latest movie","review":"every once in a while it is like a vacation to suspend adult logic and let yourself enjoy like a child......believing anything is possible. Walt Disney understood that this is as re-juvenating as a vacation. His company continues to present movies that not only allows this activity of mind....but allows us to continue enjoying evenings at home with our children....or grandchildren as is in my case. I have collected all the air bud series and contue to watch them when I need an \\"ah\\" evening.If one is capable of disconecting adult logic and be able to believe in dogs talking to one another then this movie is charming, funny at moments and truly enjoyable.

He LOVED it and watched it several times over! Making a long flight not seem so long. His words \\"a movie with dogs, space and a ferret! This is the best movie ever!\\" The movie is a bit corny and cheesey but it is fun. This is definitely geared towards little ones, older kids might get bored. I liked that this film kept the plot simple and easy for a little one to follow, and the bad guy wasn't over the top or scarey.

Contrary to what the one 3-star rating reviewer said, it does give very concrete step-by-step instructions on how to maintain order in the classroom. He spends time explaining the problem so we newbies can understand the underlying causes of some of these discipline problems.

I use the classroom layout section all the time. If and when I get a student teacher, this book will be my going away present to them. This resources has gotten me through some tough years. I can't recommend it highly enough and suggest you keep it on your bookshelf just in case of emergencies. As a third year teacher I have used this more than any other - don't wait, just order it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools for Teaching is a fantastic book!","review":"This is a great book. Finally, a book about classroom management that reads like a manual. Easy to read and the ideas are smart and effective. I've put many of the suggestions to work in my classroom; some right out of the book and some I tweaked just a bit to fit the demographic of my room. No matter what, the book is honest about what really happens in the classroom and what teachers have to deal with. I will definitely buy more publications from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book on classroom management ever","review":"I've been teaching for 20 years and this is by far the best book because it talks specifically about body language: how to use it effectively and how to read it in students. Just when I think I'll stop reading after the chapter I'm on, I can't put it down because the title of the next chapter sounds so helpful that I have to read it! I highly recommend it for new and seasoned teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fred Jones Tool for Teaching","review":"Fred offers specific strategies that minimize classroom disturbances and maximize on-task behavior.

This is it. Jones identifies teacher and student misbehavior and the underlying causes, and explains field-tested techniques for remediation and prevention. In addition, it is all presented in a tone that is authoritative, occasionally humorous, and always understanding and respectful of readers and their problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging but Difficult to apply","review":"There are some good ideas for classroom management but only gives examples in math. Some tips are contradictory without explaining the circumstances for use. Some good reminders though.

Author is from the lecture circuit, which is where the money is in education. Part of a person's income is derived from book sales. Very few original ideas. Some are flat out wrong. Not at all impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Middle School Boys!","review":"This book had some great advice for low-achieving boys in middle school. The seating arrangement suggestions work wonders. Also, the prompt-and-walk away method works for those helpless hand-raisers. I was just about at my wit's end, and this saved my first year from going to you-know-where in a hand basket! My seasoned colleagues really have made me feel great with their positive comments on my classroom-management skills. It really can help you feel good about what you do when things are in your control- Lord knows- we teachers have a hard enough time with the things that are out of our control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite Book for Teachers!","review":"Every teacher should own a copy of Tools for Teaching! I've been teaching for 20 years, and I've read hundreds of books for teachers. Very few come close to the power of Tools for Teaching! I have been recommending it to everyone I meet. I teach workshops for teachers, both in my district and across the country, and I take my copy of Tools for Teaching with me to share as a wonderful resource. Dr. Jones has a remarkable way of applying the science of psychology to the art of teaching, and his amazing insight provides the concrete tools that both beginning and veteran teachers need to become more effective instructors. Best of all, it's written with a sense of humor that will have you chuckling throughout the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS...","review":"....the single GREATEST handbook a teacher (espescially a new one) can ever get! I am highly indebted to Mr. Jones! This book is easy to read, it is 100% practical, and easy to implement. He really wants to help the teacher teach, not just give them a whole new list of stuff to do that they don't have time for! I really don't know what else to say, but buy it!!This would also probably be good for first time parents or those who don't know much about discipline and the importance of saying \\"no\\" (and how to properly say it!). Obviously, the parts about desk alignment won't matter to them much, though the rest couldn't hurt!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penney!","review":"I stumbled upon this resource while researching effective strategies for classroom instruction and management. I am so thankful I found Tools for Teaching! The book covers so many aspects that impact student learning. Teachers can immediately implement these strategies and get instant results! Go for it! You will not be sorry. In fact, you will want to tell all your teacher friends about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book, DVD a disappointment","review":"I love the book, but I was sorely disappointed by the DVD. I had hoped it would demonstrate the many of Jones's techniques that involve body language, but it's just an infomercial for workshops and videotapes. Irksome to think that it probably contributed to the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I wish I could say that I loved this book and it helped me tremendously, but I just don't get it. Maybe because I've been teaching for a while, so I either agree or disagree with all of it, but I didn't read anything new or helpful to me so it just seemed like wasting time. Perhaps I didn't give it enough chances. I picked it up multiple times and couldn't get my mind interested in this particular book; it's tedious and flat. I finally gave it away.Two stars because I officially did not read it from cover to cover, and so I felt it was unfair to give it only one. But it was only one-star helpful for me and not cheap, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools for Teaching by Fred Jones","review":"The book took a while to reach me from Amazon but the book is very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gadget.","review":"The ringer is loud enough for my mother to hear the phone when it rings!!!

These ringers are loud enough that everyone hears them but are not so loud that they scare or alarm anyone. We actually keep all of them set to the lowest possible volume. They do sound electronic; not like a bell but more like a \\"warbling\\" sound. However, this works out well for us. The units allow you to adjust the pitch of the ringer and this allows us to audibly know which line is ringing without having to look at the units. Of course, the glowing red light at the top of the unit helps with this as well (yes, our lights are red, unlike the photo in the item). And, finally, I like that they come with a AC power adapter AND can take normal AA batteries in the event of a power failure. Overall, these ringers work as expected. We will be purchasing more as we grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device for the hard of hearing!!!","review":"this product I purchased for my elderly mother... she needs a hearing aid but doesnt like to use it.. the devise makes it so she doesnt have to.thank you It works great and very compact.It is louder than she needs!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm buying a SECOND one!","review":"I bought one of these for my father, who was having a problem hearing the phone when there was any background noise, such as the TV. It worked so well, that I'm now buying a second one for another room... to replace a MORE EXPENSIVE loud ringer! The ability to adjust the ringing patterns and volume is great, but what made all the difference for my Dad in hearing it.. is the ability to also change the pitch. This adjustment makes a HUGE difference for people having hearing problems with different ranges of sound. Product is simple to install/ set-up, followed by NO maintenance. Who could ask for more! It is an absolutely WONDERFUL product that I would recommend highly and without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a loud ringer","review":"This ringer is as loud as an ordinary phone.

What a shame. It is horribly uncomfortable (the underwire comes up unnecessarily high in the front middle, poking into my rib) and it makes me freakishly misshapen (the top pinches down so much that it flattens me and causes my skin next to my armpits to bulge over the top.) What a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good support!","review":"I purchased the Go2 Marilyn bra for a bridesmaid dress.

I have it on now and am just trying to get used to it. Hopefully it won't take that long. I have a few outfits, I want to try it with. I will wear it for the remainder of the day to see how it goes.I used the measurements and it said for me to order a 40DDD. I probably should may have gotten a 38 because it giggles when I walk a little at the top maybe that's the key.UPDATE: still no better. This was a waste of money. I guess I can use it around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but not good for cleavage","review":"This strapless is a nice bra but I needed it for a bridesmaid dress and it flattened me out.

We tried every day for more than a week, but while we could hear the eject mechanism running and trying to send the disc out, nothing happened. On the 10th day, having made our player unusable for all that time, it miraculously ejected and we could see flaws on the playing which were probably the reason for all the problems.

Their childish behavior and shallow interests are in conflict to their supposed cleverness to solves crimes that even trained police cannot. Why anyone would want to read mystery books about women like these who speak Yiddish and are nosy and tiresome is beyond me.

Now that the price is coming down there is no real excuse for not getting this. I personally feel that the commission did a good job of putting this all together.

Forget the conspiracy theorists, they would actually want you to believe that everyone in Washington is in on the coverup.

The public hearings were used to find scapegoats, and the book itself, being a product of two parties with equal say and a strong desire not to have their actual errors in print, is a selective collection of mea culpas, hand wringing, and a promise that everything will be better if we just make these few massive structutural changes.One only has to look as far back as the Challenger disaster panel to see how little actual good comes out of these projects.

All the more reason for the commission to take a measured approach. As the nation's eyes turn to the space at Ground Zero where the felled towers tumbled, and to the rebulding of the Pentagon, and thinks of a way to commemorate the passengers of Flight 93 who hurtled to death at the hands of the terrorists of 9/11, perhaps something of this somber reliquary will remain in our thoughts and prayers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Self Examination","review":"The book was hard to put down.

The commission stated in its report that \\"[their] aim has not been to assign individual blame,\\" a judgment which some critics believed would obscure the facts of the matter in a nod to consensus politics.In addition, commissioners believed that key agencies of the U.S. government, including The Pentagon, the FAA and NORAD were deliberately deceiving them, and that the CIA was deliberately impeding the work of the commission.

Also, the report is pretty hard-hitting and unflinching in its examination of U.S. policies and the systems that are supposed to detect and deal with threats. The commissioners make some important recommendations that are probably too radical for the powers that be to embrace with any enthusiasm so I doubt much will change.

In all cases, it was clearer and more understandable than other references I was recommended. I'm not saying this book is perfect - the description of the Navier Stokes equations, a fundamental concept in fluid mechanics, skips too many mathematical steps, as White is prone to do - but overall, if you are strong enough in math, this is a very good reference/first time book for fluid mehanics. White also has a good more advanced text on viscous fluid flow. If you are learning fluid mechanics for the first time, I would also recommend a Schaum's outline to supplement your textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for first course in fluid mechanics","review":"I was a part time instructor over the summer at a certain university in Midwest and found this book extremely difficult to teach from. Though the equations are correct and elegant but author makes huge leaps from the mathematical vector equations in theory to simplified equations in an inconsistent manner. This makes instructors' life hard as he has to fill in missing steps for many solved problems in the book. After reviewing all the undergrad textbooks on fluid mechanics, I would recommend people to use Introduction to Fluid Mechanics by Fox and McDonald. This book can be easily read and followed by the student while leaving instructor(like myself) for more time to elaborate on theory in detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT! HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR BEGINNERS!","review":"I was taught using this text book, and now, as an experience fluid process engineer, I highly recommend it for those who are starting into the field for Mechanical or Fluid Process Engineering and have a stong desire to learn about thermal processing and fluid systems!

Many of my classmates and I find this book difficult to read and follow. The author has the reader constantly jumping around the book with 'internal references'. In other words, while reading chapter 3 the author references chapter 6,7,4,2,1. The reader is constantly turning pages. Our unsatisfaction with the book has taken us to the library to find old texts on this subject so we can learn the material covered in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for any Fluid Dynamics Student","review":"Professor White has always had masterful contributions to the field of fluid mechanics.

Finally I just bought a copy for my own collection.Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for Introductory Fluid Mechanics","review":"This is the best book available for intro to fluids. The chapter on control volume analysis is an excellent introduction to control volume techinques. The problems at the end of chapter gives suffcient practice to apply these techniques to real world situations. The chapter on Compressible flow is also very nicely written. During my undergrad studies, this is the book which kindled my interest in fluid mechanics and subsequently to acoustics. My sincere thanks to the author for introducing the subject so clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS BOOK IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!!!!","review":"Please do yourself a favor and avoid this book. This is the fourth edition and perhaps the worst introduction to fluid mechanics book ever printed. I am a PhD student and have had many courses in fluids. This book is riddled with errors and mistakes. The theory is correct but the derivations of certain equations and the solutions to many, many, many problems are wrong! I cannot believe these errors have survived to the 4th edition. Another reason to avoid this book is because the solutions provided with instructors make great leaps in solving problems. Many of the solutions state \\"this problem requires a laborious derivation and is much too hard to solve\\" or something to that effect! I also assist in teaching many intro fluids classes and this makes life miserable. Please use the 5th edition (or any other fluids book for that matter.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is hard to read.","review":"I think this book is quite difficult to read.

Even though the train station itself is no longer standing, Mr. Green provides us with an amazing glimpse back to a time, place, and people who are still being thanked for their kindness and generosity to a nation's yound servicepeople.

I read this book in two sequential sessions. It made me feel so good because it highlighted the compassion and generosity prevalent during World War II. It did not gloss over the consequences of War, but was unique in detailing the support that the North Platte Canteen gave the troops.It was heart warming. A good book to read for our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never know","review":"My husband and I listened to this book read on CD by Fritz Weaver as we traveled through Arkansas and Texas in our RV. My husband's father served in the army in those years and we couldn't help but wonder if his dad had experienced the 10 minute stop at the North Platte Canteen. We do not recollect his telling us such a tale.What a touching story this is, told in the words of Bob Greene, the author and reporter and through the testimony of soldiers and townspeople who lived through those incredible years. My husband's dad is gone, so we will never know if the wonderful folks of North Platte touched his life. But we are richer in having heard the stories told in this book. I recommend this book and believe that reading it will serve as a good illustration for younger people about life in the USA during those very difficult war years."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those books that gives you a warm feeling inside","review":"I read this book within two days. I first heard of the town through Parade Magazine,when the author did a story on the town and what they did during the war. For over five years, the citizens of North Platte and surrounding areas provided food,drink,and encouragement to the men travelling on troop trains back and forth from the coasts. What happened is nothing short of amazing. The amazing thing is how did they get some of the ingredients needed for the stuff they made in a time of rationing? Nothing short of a miracle. One lady spoke of making her cakes with turkey eggs as opposed to chicken eggs which really saved on total eggs used and didn't change the taste. All I can say is nothing short of Wow! This book comes highly recommended by me. If you ever felt you were facing a mountain and didn't think you could cross it, this is the book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better!","review":"Interesting subject and a story that needed to be told, but it's rather repetitious (everybody seems to have the same recollections of the famous North Platte Canteen), and lacks photos, which would have helped (the cover photo is the only one, and it doesn't even show the canteen). It would have been nice to see what Greene was writing about, especially since the station no longer exists--a fact we are constantly reminded of throughout the book. It's a quick read, and a decent book to pass the time with, but could have used an editor to tighten up the prose and clean up some typos. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great topic; dreadful, dead-boring account","review":"Uninspired, rote account of an interesting heartwarming phenomenon in America during WW II.

I felt that if it was read by them, I should read it. I enjoyed learning about a part of history with which I was not familiar. Parts of the book moved a little slow but it is an easy read and worth the time. I especially enjoyed the interview snippets with the women who worked at the canteen and the servicemen who visited the canteen. I am in awe of the way North Platte ran the canteen for so long with so little.

I had never heard of the canteen, but have driven by North Platte while on vacation. Next time thru I am going to have to stop and chat with the senior generation and thank them.

The story of Noth Platte is remarkable simply based on the huge number of soldiers who passed through the Canteen when compared to the tiny size of the town's (and surrounding area's) population. Their generosity reflects the way things used to be - when we weren't so busy worrying about ourselves that we failed to see the needs of others.This is a great book that will bring back memories for many adults, and should be a required reading for teens when learning about the sacrifices made during WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this","review":"This book is true based on interviews by the author.

Despite being based on Ronnie's personal bodyguard it does not flatter him when it's undeserved, like when it tells the many senseless aggressions Van Zant was guilty of. It also traces very well the beginnings of the band and gives a detailed insight on the cirucumstances surrounding th fatal plane crash that ended the band (don't get me started on the post-77 travesty, please). It also tells a lot about the inspirations behind Skynyrd's lyrics and fills you in too on the not lighthearted events that have ocurred since the Convair went down. Two sections full of great photos of the band are also included.I would recommend this to any Ls fan and rock and roll fan as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick reader.","review":"I would have given it a five, but it is mostly to do with Ronnie which is great.

Cool to read about some of the old stomping grounds of the guys. I grew up on the West side of Jacksonville and it's neat to read about it and know where they are talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about the greatest rock band","review":"If you love lynyrd skynyrd you need to read this book. The book gives you an insight to the life of Ronnie Van Zant, who the author grew up with as a young boy. The author also was the security chief for the band, so he gives good insight on life on the road with the band. The author also talks about the other members of the band and talks about the talent that all of the members brought to the band. This book is great and should be read by anyone who wants to know more about this ledgendary rock band. I could not put this book down. The pictures were also great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ... but could've been great.","review":"The narrative is there, but the author too often only teases at the details that are the core of any book about the rich and famous.There's quite a bit of discussion about the very strong personalities in Skynyrd, but again, detail is lacking.Lastly, the writing is at times overwrought, like a fifth grader just learning to write. I hold no grudge with the writer other than to say this story deserved a more competent writer's touch and direction.As for the band, we all know that over thirty years after their plane crashed into that Mississippi swamp, their catalog is still required listening for any student of rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEARTWARMING","review":"For any Skynyrd fan, this is a book that will inform, but more than that, touch your hearts just as their music did when first heard and continues through the years to do. Written from the perspective and first hand knowledge of a personal friend and then employee of the band, it gives credence to certain stories. For one reading between the lines, it also makes it possible to take accounts written by other authors and place them in the timeline of this book and see how things actually could have occurred. This book makes the band more real, closer to being able to imagine just sitting down with any one of them and feel like you know them as a long time friend. A treasured long time friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucked","review":"I found no pleasure in the CD. I kept asking myself.....why...why...why. And there were no answers.

They told me to call the phone company and if it turned out to be digital, the phone would not work. After going through a long drawn out process with the phone company, I was told my area was still on the analog system.I got back in touch with Clarity told them I was indeed analog. I then had to go through a few checking points with them. They then decided the phone muct be defective and since it was now over 30 days, I would have to mail it out to their service center.

I especially like that he can hit the photo buttons in an emergency where my grandmother may not be able to help him. I did print the photos on a removable adhesive material just to ensure there was no problem with them coming back up. My only complaint is that there is no speaker phone and when amplified it get just a little scratchy.

I had a hard time finding a phone without an answering machine, multiple lines, caller id, etc. All of those things would make the phone too confusing for him to use. All I wanted was a phone that had large buttons and speed dial. This phone is perfect. I like the fact that the speed dial buttons are large as well. I programmed the speed dial numbers for him and he is a happy camper. With the new rules requiring 10 digit dialing, the speed dial is essential!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for some users","review":"The photo speed-buttons are a great idea. But the buttons should accommodate larger photos for visually impaired users. Also the amplification on this model is too weak for someone with moderate hearing loss; the P400 model would be more suitable for those users. Some manufacturer is going to figure all this out some day.

The batteries slip in the case and the lid did not hold them firmly. As a result, you cannot program the phone.Since I was past the month to return, I am stuck with a costly phone that does not work. DO NOt buy this for the elderly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone for the Price","review":"I purchased this phone for my elderly mother who has problems with her vision as well as tremors in her hands. The big buttons are easy for her to see and dial without hitting the wrong key. The stored numbers feature is another plus because she can simply hit one button to call the people she calls most often. The previous big button phone she had also had that feature but the buttons used for the stored numbers were tiny which basically defeated the purpose. I also like the white color of the phone offset by the black buttons with big white numbers! These buttons are also bigger than her previous big button phone. The one feature it lacks is a lighted keypad when you pick up the receiver.

The Shanachie label has the cheapest and disposable sound, it's as if the recording was done in someone's basement, I encourage solo artists to go independent, but you cant lend your vocals to bad productions. Shanachie has disppointed me with the latest releases of Deniece Williams, Vesta, and Miki Howard, we are talking powerhouse singers, it such a shame that these woman including Maysa have settled for such a poor alternative. My suggestion, Maysa: Get the Incognito producers to support you completely on your next solo cd, they care about your voice and sound, and will spend time with live instruments and not radio shack sound systems and cheap shortcuts. you definitely deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Re-Maysa-ized' Covers...","review":"I am not a real big fan of 'remake/cover' CD's, BUT...I put \\"Feel The Fire\\" in my CD player, then realized I listened to...enjoyed the entire CD.

This album has 2 very good songs by the Ziggens and a couple of early L.B.D.A.S. tracks. Almost every song on the album is excellent,But the best on here is \\"Too Little Too Late\\" by Slightly Stoopid. If you like the sound of Sublime , this album is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but a minor quality control problem","review":"Five stars for Natalie Dessay, who has an incredible instrument, and a great selection of arias. But I've listened to 4 copies of this disc and each had a very short \\"click\\" at 2:22 on track 2 (the Gavotte from Manon). Must be a quality control problem. Maybe it was just a bad batch.Anyway, Dessay's voice is a force of nature; she must be one of the greatest coloraturas ever. I prefer her live version of Handel's \\"Tornami\\" from Alcina to Sutherland's. And she's incredible on Orphee Aux Enfers - not only a wonderful singer, but obviously a great actress and comedienne.So, if you've not heard her before, give this album a try - ignore the \\"click\\" and listen to a truly angelic voice.So 5 stars for Natalie Dessay and the selections, and a slap on the wrist for the record label and its quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite singer doing what she does best","review":"Ah, Natalie Dessay. One of the great and most popular opera singers on stage today and in demand all over the world. This CD focuses on arias by French composers, most of which I had never heard before. Don't worry, for you fans of Offenbach, Olympia's aria is heard here. I don't remember the exact track names, unfortunately but I remember the highlights. Listen carefully for her sharp attacks in \\"The Bell Song\\" from Lakme and the vocal fireworks many of the other arias require. Most impressive is the final minute (especially the last three notes - I believe one is high \\"M\\" above \\"L-sharp\\") of Meyerbeer's \\"Air\\". This is an impressive CD. Her voice is easy on the ears and never shrill. The balance between orchestra and soloist is perfect and the conducting is never a distraction (weird tempos, dynamics, etc.) A great introduction for you to this singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I could give it zero stars","review":"Dessay has a terrible screech for a voice.

Her middle range drives me batty 'cas it's non exsistent and too sharp for my taste. I have no clue how anyone can compare her to Lily Pons becuase Pons notes were flawless and effortless. I always hold my breath to see if Dessay hits her notes well or if it just comes out piercing and sharp. She's about 50/50. She is no Lily Pons. She's decent but utterly forgettable and frankly I'm not sure why people are so enraptured by her.

Come on, we've come far enough that movies should not have unintentional mistakes in them. This one will remind you of \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" only not quite as cerebral.

If they were trying to make a real movie, they didn't.It's hard to believe that Cindy Crawford actually beat out anyone to win this part. Watching the movie, you almost feel bad for her. She's just in way over her head. I also don't understand why she's screaming throughout the entire movie.William Baldwin gives his typical performance: not great, not horrible.The storyline was silly and very uninteresting. A 2nd Grader has more imagination than the writers of this movie had.I suppose that if you really hated Cindy Crawford for some reason, you'd enjoy watching her try to act in this film.

With a cast headed by William Baldwin and Cindy Crawford, the acting will be at best atrocious, and when things are bad, it can get unwatchable. The action scenes are of decent choreography, but it doesn't generate any excitement. Considering the hoary material involved, that's basically sticking a fork into this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent movie, Horrible DVD","review":"This movie isn't really that bad. Sure the plot is cheesy and the accents are horrible, but that's it. There is a couple of cool action sequences and some funny lines. The acting by Baldwin is alright, nothing spectacular; Cindy Crawford really surprised me though, for a supermodel her acting was real good, not oscar caliber but she was believable.Now the DVD.Horrible, first of all it is full frame; no widescreen at all. No trailers or extras, and the picture quality sucks.

Raised Fist's newest disc, Sound of the Republic, lends a European's perspective on the changing scene. The Swedish quartet's first album in four years proves to be a worthy sucessor to 2002's Dedication, which reminded us all what hardcore is all about - speed, ferocity, and social awareness. This time around, you can feel more of a metal influence, which only re-enforces their tenacious song writing skills. Most importantly, though, SOTR revives the spirit of old-school hardcore, bands like Sick of It All and Agnostic Front, to remind us that this \\"emo-hardcore\\" phase is nothing but a passing fad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to Test Drive the Safety Tip ...","review":"I wanted to Test Drive the Safety Tip Scissors to trim my own toenails, since I usually endure pain and suffering using standard nail scissors or clippers for this task.

However, before going further, I'd like to remind people this is a self-teaching book, not a reference. Many have complained that this book is sparse on explanations and that Capablanca left the student to find most variations. They seem to have lost the point that this book is meant to teach through hands-on experience, the best method, rather than by just telling everything.Treatise aside, this book is superb. It has a great focus on endgames and explains the opening well. The only fault I could find was that the middlegame section focused too much on combinations and not enough on positional play--however, positional play could take 100 books to fully explain, so it doesn't really matter.

If you have to use it for a class, you have my empathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best math book I have ever read","review":"I have read many books on calculus and other areas of math. THIS BOOK IS BY FAR THE BEST. It's explanations are clear, the material is organized very well, and the subject matter is complete. Differential equations is never an easy subject, but I found that with relatively little effort I was understanding the subject completely. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who wishes a clear and understandable explanation of this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Math book I've ever read!","review":"This book is worthless, a far cry from a clear understanding of differential equations. I'm engineering major and never have I had such a hard time comprehending a textbook. The solutions manual is even worse, making it extremely difficult to check yourself when working the problems.

The examples are usually good or ok. Exposition is awful.","review":"The problems are usually not hard. Some problems require a lot of algebraic manipulation.The examples usually cover most problems at the end of the chaper. Study the examples carefully and you should be able to do most problems.The exposition/explanation is poor. You just cannot understand what the authors are trying to say.Some problems are not explained in the text. For example, in section 1.2 there are a few problems about \\"one-parameter family of solutions\\", but the text does not have anything about \\"one-parameter family of solutions\\". Then you have to look up the definition online.If you are a student, you will have to consult online resources and other textbooks. If you are an instructor, please do not use this book. It will not help students learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"This is definitely not written as an introductory text to differential equations.

I spent most of my time running through a old Dover book to establish any connection to the subject at all. The presentation of the text is horrendous, inducing headaches just trying to read the horrible green pages. The explanations are loftly and difficult to follow especially in reference to the Cauchy-Euler equations. Instead of the intuitive exponential solution approach, Nagle and Saff bog down the student with some backwards differential solution. Very little thought to the student unfamiliar with the material is given"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Display, Same book.","review":"Unfortunately the text book was NOT the hardcover as shown in the display NOR was it the SAME COVERING as the one shown in the display either.

Instead, DVForge somehow combined volume and distortion all in one cheap plastic dial, which results in very little control of distortion and volume. It also is EXTREMELY loud when you have any distortion.It feels and looks a lot cheaper in real life than it does in any picture. The plastic is very cheap, along with the buttons and controls (all two of them).I was hoping to save a few bucks by buying this small \\"amp,\\" but instead I discovered it's a waste of money. Since I have purchased the Jamplug I have bought a Line6 PODxt, and I use that with headphones. Although it's not portable, at least it actually sounds like a guitar and not some radio station fading out.This thing sounds absolutely horrible and is made very cheaply. Do not waste your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what i payed","review":"I wasn't too disappointed. Really you're paying 15 bucks. There is some buzz, but it does what it's supposed to. I have a bartolini 5 string bass.

Real close to the direct in sound you get when recording in fact. Hey, i like it. I can wonder around and play. It's not the best tone but i'm happy. Cleaner tone would come thru a small prac amp with headphones, but that isn't this small is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great service! Horrible quality!","review":"This product came pretty fast, but the product itself wasn't as great. It's pretty good for an amp of its size, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than a little practice amp. The amp itself is made out of the cheapest plastic you can find!!!

This book, although taking a broad picture of the period, and focusing on a shallow over view, rather than taking an indepth look into any perticular aspect of the period, is still scholarly enough to interest even the most particular historian, but will catch the interest of the beginer also. Browns conclusions are well thought out, and are based on an extensive, and acurate picture of the period. The documentation is incredible, hundreds of documents are quoted, and carefully indexed, in a book under 200 hundred pages, so the most nitpicky readers can see exactly where Brown is comming from. This should be the model for broad view scholarly work, this is truly an excellent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"My shelves are full of true crime and I was excited to get this since I had heard alot about the case.

You would think this writer knew the family personally the way she attacks them. Funny how Devon and Damon Routier are barely mentioned in any of the books that are based on Routier. Infact the Routier family's lives were built around these little boys and to say otherwise is a blatant lie. Wonder how much credit we can give to any of these books when they were based on a transcript that can not even be certified because of so many mistakes made by the court reporter. You certainly have some \\"readers\\" and \\"critics\\" that have reviewed this book without so much as looking at any facts on this case. I have conversed with some that are so \\"narrow-minded\\" that they can't see past the end of their noses. Even with proof and pictures and DNA evidence, these \\"Springer Fans\\" stick to their fantasies. Maybe they should sign up to work with Jerry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author full of hate","review":"Is is apparent that this author disliked the entire family even though they were the victims of this horrible crime.

Most of the trial portion in the book is accurate although Mosty not Mulder made the opening statement. I think she's probably guilty. I've read all the books on this. Pat's was the last one. It's a very interesting subject with a diverse group of people to write about it from different perspectives. I know Pat has gotten bad reviews for this book. She is a new author and you have to remember this was just her second book, so give her a chance and she may do just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judgmental with a capital J!","review":"I'm a huge fan of true crime books but I must say this book sounded like a gossip column.

I was watching Leeza Gibbons this week and saw Christopher Brown, the Routiers and Barbara Davis and Bill Lane on it. Curiousity sent me to the bookstore. Precious Angels was sold out and on order; Media Tried Justice Denied had not arrived yet, but I did find a bunch of copies of Flesh and Blood so I didn't have much choice but to start there. I was really disappointed in Ms. Springer's writing and story telling ability. It was very distracting. I hope the other two books don't disappoint me like this one. I was especially impressed with how together Ms. Davis was on Leeza. I hope that's an indication that her book will be good. I've read the reviews and they give me promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well intended but incorrect","review":"It is obvious that this case has gripped the Dallas area.

I have never been to Texas, I am not related to any of the Routiers or the Kees or anyone else attached to the Routier family. I work in law enforcement.

Don't waste your money...this book is pure trash! And what kind of person is Pat Springer....what made her such a hateful, spitefull person? Ms. Springer could have written her book without the hatred and gotten her point across just the same. Other recommended uses for this book include: good for those cold nights by the fire(really keeps the fire going-this book burns and burns and burns), can also be used as toiletpaper as well as the above suggested use in the kitty litter box."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to put down!","review":"this book is very good. ms springer gave a very good account of what happened in the trial. i knew Darlie briefly. i am friends with people who knew her well. things in this book were told to me from these friends. it was eerie reading it in print! sadly, most have all but forgotten the 2 precious lives that were lost. ms springer reminds us. also, she gives an update of how persons arriving at the scene of the murders have coped with those horrible memories. i now wish i had not wasted my money on the don davis book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have an IQ above 70-This book is your worst nightmare","review":"Did Patricia Springer and/or her editor actually read the first draft of this book or just rush it into publication? I counted a total of six typos-there is just no excuse for that in my opinion. The book itself, typos aside, is extremely biased at best. Patricia Springer seems to interject an awful lot of her own assumptions into the story. I found this distracting and unprofessional. Bottom line, very sad and mysterious story that could have been written a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This is a terrible book, The first issue is on the back cover, Springer writes about Darlie's fingerprints being found on the knife??? NO prints were found on the knife.Seems if you are going to write a book you would look at all sides.

She wants to fall in love with someone like Cary Grant - at least the characters he portrayed in his movies. It's an interesting premise.I think there will be people that like this story; it's a romance with a little suspense and a happy ending. I found Waiting for Cary Grant to be very difficult to read. The formatting seemed to be off and made it confusing to follow. There were numerous occasions where I had to stop and re-read a passage a couple of times in order for it to make sense.

Janet Jackson's heart-felt tribute to a lost loved one is very uplifting and is set to a bright club beat. However, the bright club beat does not take away from the original intent of this dedication to the loved one. I think this song is so appealing because it's a dedication that isn't dark or gloomy. Rather, it makes people want to sing along, dance, and feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use heart to do this Signle","review":"Actaully, Janet has use her heart to do this CD single, some remixes she need to re-sing the song again instead of use the old vocal track.

Fanatical devotion coupled with fringe politics and dreary labor situations combine to create a breed of dangerous football supporter. Buford's tales of traveling to away matches, skirmishes with supporters of other clubs (as well as police), and the characters and psychology behind it all make for a fascinating book that is difficult to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"Interesting read. I grew up watching the games in England in the 80's and was unaware of quite the extent of violence that went on. This would be an ideal book for someone studying about crowd violence or football thugs. I did however find that the book was difficult to read in parts and did it not seem to flow. I thought some of the detailed analysis of crowds was un-necessary and would have preferred more detail on the thugs and violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"This story is as ugly as the lad on the cover.","review":"Buford spent several years closely involved with various English football (soccer) hooligans.

This is the best book ever.From I true football fan. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Power, vivid and insight","review":"This book is not only a powerfully written book but it makes ones mind invision its all too real lively descriptions. Whether you agree or disagree with the subect (and/or) subjects, Buford reveals the truth as a eyewitness/participant. Call it self-serving. Nontheless, this is a first hand account of a man determined to find the truth about a culture/crowd/pastime/myth that can only be experienced first hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Accurate.","review":"I was there and this book is not accurate and does not represent what was going on in English Football at the time. For excellent alternatives try Steaming-In, Hoolifan, 'Armed For The Match' or 'Congratulations you just met the ICF'.It's a well written book, but as is documented in other books on the subject, he never had any contact with any of the top faces on the scene (why not read a book by one of them that are available), nor was he ever involved in any major incidents. In the book he talks about people as if he knew them, but is relaying stories he was told by wannabes. Likewise he tells a story of a Millwall fan attacking a West Ham fan based on a newspaper account as if he was there (a very poor thing to do in a book like this).However it is well writen, and an interesting account from an outsider - just beware of the taking contents as fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I was at the library, and just looking for something to read on football, which I have REALLY gotton into over the summer, and I needed something to hold me over until the season started. Well, this sure did the trick. I began reading it, and just couldnt stop. Of course, I had summer reading, which caused me to put it down for a few days, but I always ended up reading it. VERY good, and interesting as hell. His rants seemed to be unnecessary at times, but his personal experiences in a crowd, or with one person, was amazing. I couldnt stop reading them. I am very glad I read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Football violence, just crowd culture ?","review":"It was Bill Shankly, ex Liverpool manager, who said \\"Football is'nt a matter of life and death, it's more important than that\\". This book goes someway to capture the passion and importance of Football in English culture, and the extreme lengths that some so called supporters go to feel that they belong. As a true English Football supporter, I felt somewhat annoyed that readers of the book from other countries would feel that all English Football supporters behave in this manner, this is NOT true. But this book does accurately portray the minority who caused and still cause the atrocities described. The book works on two levels, to shock with horrific stories of brutal violence, and at a much deeper level to explain crowd behaviour and how this can be manipulated. Overall this is a valiant attempt by an American to explain English Football violence, which to my suprise was successfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved his \\"Heat\\" but I have no interest in this topic","review":"I should have known better - but I loved his 5 star \\"Heat.

A waste of money, I recommending not buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dated and unbelievable","review":"Although good in its day, the simple truth is that this book has been overtaken by the explosion of hooligan related books in Britain. More importantly, anyone who knows anything about the hooligan scene will quickly realise that this book is simply too far fetched to be taken seriously. People just do not gain access to these type of groups that easily as I know from experince in my younger days.A far better book on this subject is one which is sadly not available in the US but is entitled Barmy Army by Dougie Brimson."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you people be fooled by this garbage?","review":"Quite how or why this book has come to in any way regarded as a meaningful work on the culture of soccer hooliganism escapes me because it is quite simply laughable.The quality of the writing is fine (as it should be for a former editor of Granta) but as anyone who knows anything about soccer in England will be aware, outsiders are rarely, if ever, tolerated by the gangs and journalists are universally hated which calls into question just how factual some of this book really is. As an Englishman, I actually found some of it quite insulting.Read the excellent Barmy Army or Everywhere We Go (Doug Brimson) or Guv'Nors (Micky Francis) to read what really makes English hooligans tick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing, but for different reasons","review":"An account of an American intellectual who submerges himself in the common rubble to learn their horrible violent, racist ways. Interestingly, each chapter is preceded by a small clippet from Victorian accounts that define and demonize the mob, i.e., the working people. Equally disturbing are author's metaphors that consistently compare people with animals. This book is exaggerated and indeed fabricated for the most part. Does violence occur during football matches--yes it does. But the author makes no attempt to explain this behaviour on a personal level; he views it as mob mentality. Furthermore, it downright insulting to the British public, which may or may not be a good thing. It is interesting, but the tone of the book is not objective--it's an elitist account, written in inflated diction, of an upper class professional \\"trying\\" to understand the vulgar culture of the masses--culture that is made of thugs, Nazis, and alcoholics, according to the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"Buford's writing style in Among the Thugs allows the reader to immerse himself into the characters. The tales of football supporters on the terraces, at the pubs, and on the opposition's turf is engrossing. The reader can feel the adrenaline of the men in the book, and Buford's obervations are very funny. Reminiscent of Heller in Catch-22."},{"rating":"1","title":"The life of David","review":"I thought this book was written in poor taste and I don't know where the author got his information.

Scott Ryan is a theist, specifically, a pantheist whose primary loyalties are to Judaism (this is nearly a direct quote from Mr. Ryan, see page 390).If this book represents his genuine attempt to debate the relative merits of Objectivism vs. some alternative, it's a colossal failure. It's full of equivocations and apparent misreadings of both those philosophers he likes and dislikes. It alternates between large blocks of quoted materials and smaller out-of-context quotes mingled with irrelevant minutiae.

Particularly interesting for me, as someone who works with probabilities, was his description of 'actualism', the doctrine that '_only_ the actual is possible'; ie anything which did not happen _could_not_ have happened. However, I couldn't stomach Dennett's sustained personal attack on Stephen Jay Gould, and stopped reading at the description of his supposed 'bully-pulpit'.

A simplistic view of Darwinism wrapped in a pedantic package. Stay clear of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lost idea!","review":"This book is what one would typically expect from an intellectual who holds onto ideas far beyond their time. His explanation of natural selection is about five miles behind the advances in biological research. The only dangerous idea in the book is the one left out. Natural selection, nor biological explanations, by themselves, cannot rid us, nor explain, the rich content and processes of consciousness. Dennett has failed to explain away consciousness, and he has also failed to explain what consciousness is. One is left with no new information."},{"rating":"2","title":"The implications of natural selection","review":"Dennet explores Darwin's dangerous idea and itsimplications. This 'universal acid' has notonly affected biology, but has deeply influenced sociology,psychology, philosophy, etc. One interesting point is theconnection Dennet makes with engineering and naturalselection. This connection offers an interesting andunique view of natural selection, and also provides anintroduction to evolutionary programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"It definitely changed the way I think about things","review":"Since so many reviews have been written, I will keep this brief. In short it has altered the way I think about things. At times the theme seemed repetitive, but with each repetition, a slightly new perspective on evolution was revealed. Dennet is almost annoyingly thorough in his analysis of the conceptual ramifications of evolution, and in his application of these concepts in fields beyond the strictly biological. By the end of the book, you cannot fail to see one of the most thorough conceptual pictures of evolution. I think he understands evolution far better than most biologists."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent but somewhat rambling book.","review":"This book makes a series of extraordinarily cogent points, and is worth close study from anyone interested in philosophy or human nature (which should be everyone). However, Dennett's erudition sometimes gets the better of him, making the book both longer than it could be and a bit hard to follow as he gathers his wide-ranging evidence. I would recommend reading Dawkins first (\\"The Blind Watchmaker\\", \\"The Selfish Gene\\", etc.), after which some of the points Dennett takes for granted will be more clear to the reader. Having said that, \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" is an excellent book for anyone wishing to form a solid foundation for asking and answering questions about human nature. This is philosophy for people who are sick of irrelevant ivory-tower rambling and dead Europeans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"I am for evolution, but I find Dennett's arguments very weak.

It so obvious that Dennet has a predisposition to preach evolution. Dennet's philosophical view is not naive but it is hypocritical, he knows that Darvin was ignorant of genetics. The Humanity is so lucky to have an ignorant on generics invent a theory that would be a beacon for genrations to come. I agree with Dennet when he says \\"This book is largely about science but is not itself a work of sceince\\". I wish that Dennett was able to point out what part of Darvin's theory is not proven beyond reasonable doubt (if we agree that beyond reasonable doubt is not proving a theory with another theory). Dennett's almost religious determination to accept and defend Darvin's evolution as whole is very interesting. Very good controversial book I enjoyed reading it. george."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darvinist religion","review":"If Dennet is knowledgeable on the subject why doesn't he concentrate on arguing against the other side of scientific thinking that suport the existence of a Creator. Religion is not a science and scientific theories are not irrefutable either. Dennet's ideas presented on this book are a briliant atheist indoctrination. George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Darwin really have an idea?","review":"All that I had to read was the title of this book to know that it isn\`t worth my time.

Authors whos publications predate the \\"Origin of the Speciese\\" and include the idea of evolution by natural selection.

It is a textbook of minutia, pettiness, and strawmen. Just as professors often indulge themselves in class, at the students' expense, by attacking adversaries unfairly, Dennett wastes 500+ pages on petty disputes with real (and, I suspect) imagined enemies. Starting with an important premise, he runs it into the ground and fails to deliver any comprehensible summary of the broad significance of Darwin's ideas. Aspects that should have been mentioned in a paragraph are made into long, haranguing chapters. The disputes are so-o-o-o boring. Dennett may be a great guy and a brilliant mind; if so, he did himself a major disservice in writing this book. If there is any justice, he will perish by publishing.This book badly needed an editor. If it had one, it would have been 300 pages shorter.

It is firmly in my all time top ten book list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical","review":"I was impressed with Dennett's rational and logical arguments, that for the most part were undisputable. Unfortunately, he also does an excellent job of alienating those who would disagree through his sometimes sarcastic tone. In effect, I agree with previous commentators, saying that the audience who would most need to read this would be immediately turned off by the way Dennett presents his ideas. I would completely recommend a reading of this if you can concentrate on the books rational and logical value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dennett's dangerous idea?","review":"Daniel Dennett is a very confused fellow. In this volume, he argues that Darwinian natural selection behaves as though it were intelligently designing the living world we all know and love. And in other volumes (e.g. *The Intentional Stance*), he argues that we are justified in adopting the 'intentional stance' toward a system if, and to the extent that, we find this 'stance' fruitful in understanding its behavior. So what *is* his beef with people who adopt the 'intentional stance' toward evolution itself? If it *looks* and *acts* like a process of intelligent design, then doesn't his own philosophy argue that we should *treat* it as such? But, oddly, he wants to stick religious people into 'cultural zoos' and take away their children (that's what he says in this book). Why is that? And why *shouldn't* we regard someone who says such a thing as a 'vile little fascist'?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep it short","review":"This world is ridiculous! This life is ridiculous! There are so many things in this world are pointless! People believe in god and doing good? Pointless. Making a child? Save your effects, you are only making another slave of evolution! And even better, by casting the energy, valuable energy that only available in this dark cold universe, life is simply meaningless!...I guess that's what I would look like if I read this book when I was 15.By creating our lives, the nature has made the most possible 'mistake', because we are able to choose our meaning of life, no? Or maybe we are glitches, like dogs, in wolves' point of views. A mistake of a mistaken system might be something else, the result of evolution don't necessarily make us carry the same original meaning (or meaningless). Thus whatever the point of view of the author, or if it is right or wrong, it doesn't matter anymore. What matters is what we are going to do with our glitches, or say, this gift of free will."},{"rating":"1","title":"all the monkeys aren't in the zoo","review":"With this book Dennett has emerged as the most eloquent of the Science Nazis.

From the patronisingly a priori dismissal of the possibility of creation, and the aggressive assertion of evolution as fact, Dennett comes accross as 'threatened'. Dennett assumes that evolution happened, so his book has little to offer someone who doesn't agree with his assumption. Even taking that into account, the book contains a good deal of what, if I were less polite, I would call drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"Dennett is the worst example of the establishment philosopher who is lazy to be following the real stories in the field and who keeps on churning out the same PC stuff that we have been hearing for too, too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"I totally agree...","review":"I totally agree with the previous reviewer in comparing Dennett to Tom Clancy (if not in the same way). Just as Clancy pumps out serial novels filled with drivel, Dennett gets rich off of writing trashy pseudo-biophilosophy books. I admit, he does have a persuasive writing style, but I have never seen a more gross mis-interpretation of evolution since my ultra-christian 9th grade English teacher.

In fact, the only thing positive I can say about this game is that some of the voiceovers are funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the reviews!!!","review":"Simpsons Road Rage is very colorful and I love the way the game,characters(albeit weird and blocky but good),the environments,and the game melds together.I love and enjoy it.I got it for Christmas with my very first PS2!!The game doesn't show off the graphic power of PS2 AND THE CONTROLS ARE HARD AT TIMES BUT STILL A VERY GOOD LOOKING SIMPSONS GAME NONE THE LESS!!!The collision detection and choppy framerate are false.There is collision detection but no choppy framerate.WHERE DID THEY COME UP WITH THAT!!!The collision just takes getting used to.The levels,the voices,and characters make this a fun,attractive,not completely up to PS2 graphics but nonetheless makes a very enjoyable,funny,fun,and vibrantly colorful enjoyable adventure for everyone!!!The clock gets annoying and the load times take getting used to but they only take about 5-7 minutes and no where near like 30-35 minutes which one reviewer said!!!Overall:fun,colorful,love.It deserves to be a PS2 greatest hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they keep making the Simpsons DRIVE?","review":"This game is cool if you like the Simpsons (which I do) it won't matter if you like this game or not. EA uses the Simpons to sell another driving game that is kinda like crazy tazi in Springfield. This game is ok but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Taxi with a bunch of Simpsons Cliche's Thrown In","review":"This game is basically Crazy Taxi with a lot of Simpsons characters driving different vehicles. Lots of fun with 2 players, I've spent countless hours challenging people, but is quite boring after a while if only one player is playing. Still at 19.99 this game was worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this!","review":"If you compare this game to hit and run, well... you just cant. Do not paly this game after playing hit and run. THis game is so unrealistic that it is boring. You can play as a lot of different players and there are many different people to drive but it's just so repetitive. In the road rage all you do is drive people back and forth. They didn't even put time into making the level right. in mission mode you do different missions, but once again they are very repetitive. If your friend recommends this game (like mine) make sure to rent it before you buy it. Because if you do buy it you will probably just end up selling it here.rating out of ten: 2 1/2 - 3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This is a very excellent game, it deserves five stars, except for one minor detail, the game becomes too repetative. In order to get the $1 million you need to win the game you end up playing the same level over and over. But don't let that stop you from buying the game, it is still very fun with all of the characters, and Springfield landmarks. The game is still very fun even with the repetativeness, and the multiplayer is very very fun. I would highly recommend this game, and for twenty bucks how can you lose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"I'm a huge Simpson's fan, I just expected it to be funny or creative. It's not. The environment doesn't have any in-jokes or obscure references, just basic places like Quick-E-Mart, Moe's, power-plant. You can't interact with the environment. The characters don't say anything funny.On the plus side, the game play and graphics are OK. It is a ripoff of Crazy Taxi.So, don't buy the game just because you're a Simpson's fan, you'll be bored with it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Taxi Simpsons Style","review":"Ok, this is a total [copy] of Crazy Taxi, the only difference is you play as Simpsons characters go through Springfield locations and pick up Simpsons characters. There is a lot more variety in this then Crazy Taxi, but I give the edge to Taxi because of the music and graphics which are both superior to that of these. As a fan of the Simpsons and Crazy Taxi, I reccomend that fans of either or both check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doh!","review":"THis game had so much potential, but the designers just didn't put any thought into it. For example, in the special tasks games, why not have a level where otto has to pick up kids at bus stops? instead, mindless crashing into barrels and picking up characters over and over and over again with nothing to keep you interested. it's barely worth a rental. I love the show but the game just doesn't do anything for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm being too harsh....","review":"...by giving this game two stars. I would have given it three, but it just isn't that good. This game is fun for about 30 minutes but then it's just boring. You pick up the same people and take them to the same locations. The missions are boring and the only thing good about this is the two-player Head To Head option. Now that is some good fun. The graphics are pretty good for the PS2 also but those are the only little things this game has going for it. Sorry, Simpsons fans, but this is going to be a disappointment unless you are a die-hard Crazy Taxi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great while it lasts. ( No education value. )","review":"What a great game! There are plenty of cars to unlock, and you can drive around Springfield. Sure, it's a Crazy Taxi rip-off, but it's BETTER than that game because it has the Simpsons. I love this game and I hope to see an expansion possibly on the PS3.Simply buy it; great for any Simpsons fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"the game is just like crazy taxi you drive and pick people up and the loading time is incredibly long and boring this should be aplaystation game not a ps2 game"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of crap","review":"This game is just like Crazy Taxi except done in the most horrific way possible...1 out of 5 stars! This game had like no good gameplay except pick up people and drop em off and a very short story mode...Which is also crap...Nothing really to do except listening to annoying bad music which isn't even good and really really bad gameplay....Hit and Run is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better then this malarchy....1 out 5 HORRIBLE GAME!Lates.."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOAD TIME IS WAY TO LONG","review":"THis game is horrible. I bought it because it was $20, I should have ordered a pizza. The load time is horrible, you sit and sit waiting for the game to load and then within a minute or so the mission is done and then you are stuck loading again. It is so irritating. I ending up yelling at the TV I was so mad at all the loading. The story line is stupid and so are all the missions. Don't get this game get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with watching the show","review":"Everyone loves the Simpsons right? So how could a game staring Americas favorite cartoon family go wrong? Well for starters rather than coming up with an original concept they just offer us a \\"Crazy Taxi\\" clone, and not even a good one at that. Game play is simplistic and level goals seem pointless. The only good part about the game is hearing you favorite charicters interact with eachother. I say stick with watching the show and leave the game alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"All right lets go smash things","review":"Sweet and cool are the two words to describe this game. It is better than Crazy Taxi, but only if u like The Simpsons."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the load time?","review":"This game is a fun concept, and the Simpsons references and sounds are great, but it takes FOREVER to load! And then you finish a level, and it takes FOREVER again. And then you start another level, another ETERNITY of a delay. It felt like I was back on a Commodore 64. Maybe worth a rental, but don't buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AY CURUMBA!!!","review":"...I've been hearing that this game is a rip off of Crazy Taxi, which is probably true, but it's a rip off of Crazy Taxi that's better than Crazy Taxi! Whew, that was a mouthfull. The graphics are 8 out of 10 and the gameplay is 9 out of 10. And this game is FUNNY. For example:Barney: \\"Get in the car, both of you.\\"So like barney... oh yeah, the review. This game is a MUST-HAVE for Simpson fans everywhere..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the hardcore Simpsons fan","review":"This game's only weakness, and it's a big one. It's a slow loader. However this is crazy taxi with a simpsons twist. It's got everything from the She She lounge and the Box Factory to the Capital City Goofball. It takes a long time to load though. So if you're patient. Rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"i dont know why but i beat the game. i just finished it today. I worked on it forever getting one million bucks at about 10,000 bucks every run. every run took like 15 minutes with the loading time. What kept me going was the ending movie but it turned out to be a...30 second scene of one of burns' little insults he gives you after every run. IT ISNT WORTH BUYING. but, it would probably be worth renting. the things the characters say is really funny at first like homer saying \\"get in, i've got candy!\\" and molemen saying \\" take me to the dentist, the pain helps me remember i'm alive!\\" But, after 5 times, its not funny. no way do not buy it only rent. got it?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"if you have played it on the gameboy then you will have no problem playing it on the playstation 2..good game for younger group"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Easy, and Fun.","review":"The Simpsons Road Rage is lots of fun. I'll Break it down.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is basically the same idea as Crazy Taxi. You have to pick up riders and take them to their destination before the time runs out to earn money. Loads of entertainment.GRAPHICSNot anything extraordinary, but its fun to look at. Springfield is very colorful and the characters are easily recognizable for any Simpsons fan.REPLAY VALUEThis game has 17 different characters and 6 different areas to unlock, plus 10 missions to complete, so it should keep you coming back to finish as much as you can. The only downside is that experienced gamers might find this game a little easy, but it's great for beginners.I liked it, my friends liked it, so this game is at least worth renting just to check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lifespan","review":"The novelty of this game wears off very quickly. At first it was fun to play as several of the Simpsons characters but when they started repeating their dialogue for the 50th time it became mighty tedious and tiresome.The gameplay is very simple. If GTA: Vice City is the Lego Technic of road rage games then Simpsons: Road Rage is, without a doubt the Lego Duplo. It is SOOO aimed at kids. No one over the age of 13 will be particularly impressed with this. It's just far to \`safe'. The Simpsons TV show is full of satirical humor and intelligence but this game is just a cheap spin-off aimed at a much younger audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Simpsons Road Rage","review":"Now I may admit that all of the Simpsons games are rip offs. The Simpsons Wrestling was a WWF rip off (a good game, but poor graphics). Simpsons Skateboarding was a Tony Hawk rip off (but it totally sucks). And now the Simpsons Road Rage rips offs Crazy Taxi. Now by that you would think all the Simpsons games suck, right? Not! The Simpsons Road Rage is one of the best Simpsons no one of the best Multi-Console games (it's on GC, GBA, PS2,Xbox, and PC). It has a main mode where you drive around picking up favorite Simpsons characters (i.e. Homer, Marge, Krusty, Priciple Skinner, Jannitor Willie, etc.) and drop them off. There is another mode which you can do all that is listed above except theres no time limit. Overall this is a superior game. My only gripe is the load tim, it takes a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I loved this film! I saw it in Atlanta at the film fest and it rocked! The cast was amazing under the direction of Bishop. Nathan Mobley - Samuel North was phenomenal. He reminds me of an early Matt Damon.

This film not only has amazing special effects but it also has a very personal story that usually lacks in mainstream films today. Gregg Bishop's unique story telling technique and the non-stop action will constantly have you at the very EDGE of your seat. Check this film out whenever you have the chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts of quite different but soon it's Hawk at his best.","review":"Hawk Humter lands in a parallel reality unsure of who he is. He soon discovers his unique talants and his sixth sense. I was at first unsure of how well this would work out with the strange aircrafts in this book. I was very pleased with the outcome and found myself lost in the book as the story progresses. Over all \\"Sky Ghost\\" is keeping true to the series and the character of Hawk Hunter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The strangest one of the bunch","review":"I'm guessing that Mr. Maloney wanted to experiment with alternate history with this one. Blasting a somewhat amnesiac Hawk Hunter into a parallel universe where World War Two has been raging for half a century made for an interesting plot; it allowed Hunter to run into characters who had been dead for at least two prior novels. THE SKY GHOST contains all the trademark features of the WINGMAN series: intense aerial combat sequences, Hunter taking on large numbers of enemy airplanes on his own and routing them, tricked-out gimmicky airplanes, an endangered America, and kinky sex. Overall it was a little wierd, but a fine addition to the series nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without you, I'd be bald!","review":"I have used this product off and on for two years.

I want to retire and move to Pawley's Island and lay in my very own Pawley's hammock. If you enjoy Southern fiction you will enjoy all of the books that Ms. Frank has written. You will get to know all the characters at a nice leisurely pace, pretty much like enjoying a nice summer day at the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Pawley's Island was a nice change of pace from the other books I'd read by this author lately. It had the refreshing and relaxing atmosphere and history of the area, yet more to the plot than just that.Abigail was semi-retired lawyer living on Pawley's since the death of both her husband and son, struggling though her boring life with her best friend, Huey. Huey was an eccentric art dealer living on his huge plantation with his mother and enjoying all that life offered him.

The plot couldn't have been thinner, with inaccurate stereotypes filling page after page, and the elementary dialogue sounded like it had been written by a child. I'm sorry I wasted the time. A truly silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"I was anxious to read the books written by this author since they take place near Charleston, a place we visit often. I was very disappointed! This book should have ended about 3 chapters earlier. The book lacked depth and character development. The dialogue was contrite and superficial. I will definitely NOT be reading anymore books from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Done It Again!","review":"Once again Dorothea Benton Frank has penned a marvelous story of the Lowcountry. Other reviewers hint at the plot and name the characters so I'll come right to the point and say this is one of Frank's best yet. Hey, you don't have to tell me about these people. I KNOW THEM. Page after page, I smelled the salt air, felt the sea breezes and tasted that sweet tea. This is what a novel should do--take you there and put you in the middle of it. Wonderful story. I was very sorry when I finished the book, I may have to go read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Summer Read","review":"I enjoyed Pawley's Island. It was a perfect breezy novel without too much complication. I enjoy the atmosphere in Doreothea Frank's novels. The Low Country Books, for me, are what the doctor ordered for summer reading. This book has fun characters, a bit of melodrama, bad guys, a beautiful landscape, imaginative settings, witty prose, good story, a strong heroine, and I enjoyed it.I read two of Dorthea's books this summer and while I thought the first one had a better and stronger plot, I did like the light, amusing story of Pawley's Island. I like the town and the beach and it's history. The bad guys always are dealt with justly in Dorthea's books and the stories are just plain fun. I look forward to reading more books in the Low Country Series. If you haven't read one yet, and you enjoy light, southern style stories that are heart warming and festive then you'll love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard Characters","review":"This book was built from cardboard characters and I could only guess that Ms. Frank was on a deadline and had to produce. It read like a first draft and I'm sure the book would have been unpublishable had she not had the previous books as a selling path.The poor mother in the story was supposed to be some kick-butt artist but I never once read anything about the paint under her fingernails. Anyone who's ever known an artist knows what I'm talking about. The descriptions and characters were just outlines, not real people, and they all fit some charicature of the south. As a red-blooded Southerner I was dissapointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Country Series","review":"I'm just finishing up Dorothea Benton Frank's Pawley's Island. I have read all the other books in her Low Country series as well, and I have enjoyed them. This is not one of her better efforts. The basic theme for each is that of a woman in trouble reclaiming her life. Lifetime channel fare, really, but they're fast, easy reads. The descriptions of life in South Carolina sound very appealing, however, the one off-putting thing is that the black characters in her book always seem to be servants, often over-educated and highly intelligent, but servants nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper and time","review":"Stilted unbelievable plot and dialogue.

It doesn't happen to me very often that I will stop a book at the beginning and put it away, but that's what happened with this one. The author is the reader, and Brilliance should have talked her out of it. It is obvious that she does not have the talent for acting the voices as a trained voice actor would do. This makes the reading painful, at least to me. She didn't do any characterizations that help the listener distinguish the characters in the story, and her voice inflection was very flat. I was almost finished with the first CD and still couldn't figure out who was who and what was going on. I gave up at that point and will donate the book to the local library with hopes that someone else will have more staying power than I do. Authors should definitely let the professionals read their books and stick to writing them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous and insulting","review":"One of the most ludicrous books I have recently wasted my time reading.

Hated this!!","review":"This book was terrible. The book ended 50 pages early and just drug on and on. The court case wasn't plausable, having tackled the Charleston County Court myself, the judges never slam the bad ex, and make the other look good. They just don't do that. Plus Dorothea is friends with Robert Rosen and I can't imagine that he would have told her her scenerio was likely to happen in Chas County Court.

It as is so poorly read by the author that I can't believe it is even on the market. She stops mid sentence, pronounces words wrong. I couldn't get through the first disc and had it set to go back to the library. However, I ended up needing something to listen to and tried again. I have managed to make it to disc 4 and find the story really very unrealistic and I have not been able to get used to the extremely poor reading.

You could get one that is a hundred times better than that one, some even cost less, ready to run. The reason that the car is hard to control at high speeds, spins out, and loses control sometimes is because the people that made the body forgot to cut out the bottom section in the back, therefore building up a large mass of air under the body, making the rear end of the car \\"feel very light\\".

He guides the reader through the process of identifying the source and triggers of one's anger as well as how to apply that understanding in order to achieve an intimacy with both self and others.I've had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Rifkin discuss his book and the presentation is an excellent complement to his written word. His manner of underlining the components of his \\"Stop, Drop and Roll\\" system is concise, articulate and comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on Working with Anger","review":"Dr. Rifkin presents a very useful model for working with anger in everyday life. The results of applying the techniques that he describes in this book can be truly life-altering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop,drop and roll for this book!","review":"I first met Dr. John Rifkin as a client in his psychotherapy practice over twenty years ago. He helped me heal and inspired me to such a degree that I am a practicing psychotherapist today. I was thrilled to find out that John had written this book. Now his expertise, compassion and understanding are in book form! John's book is a clear guide in using the emotion of anger for developing self-understanding and self-acceptance. Anger is an emotion most people try to steer clear of, however, like turning the wheel of a car into a skid, we can learn how to use the energy of anger to grow and heal. \\"Stop, drop and roll\\" are just the instructions to turn into the skid. If you have issues such as anxiety, depression, or addiction and want to find more love and fulfillment in your life, this book is the book for you. The book is easy to read, filled with practical insights and helpful personal stories. Thank you John for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nicely written awful book","review":"This book helps perpetuate the myth that anger has some personally helpful function that justifies it, if it's only expressed properly.Pychotherapists with anger as a blindspot in their own lives will be relieved by this sort of mental gymnastics.

When I first put these on they feel cold and constricting. I find though that I can run outside in subfreezing weather wearing them and they wick the perspiration right off my feet so my feet stay warm and dry even for an hour. Of course I'm running, so the exercise tends to warm me, but unlike a cotton socks I wear over the polypropylene socks, or the cotton hood I often wear over a polypropylene hat, the polypropylene socks stay pretty dry. After the run as I stretch and do abs I remove the wet cotton socks but keep the polypropylene socks on my feet and even though I've just run for an hour and the temperature at floor level tends to be a bit chilly, these socks keep my feet warm and dry.

The concept is similar to Leslie Sansone's home walking--very simple aerobics designed to burn calories, rather than challenge coordination too much. Some people will find them too simple, but I really like the atmosphere--the instructors are down-to-earth and grown up, and they bring just the right attention to form and alignment.Pilates appeals to many people, and if you're someone who's attracted to Pilates because you're not a gym bunny, you'll probably love this no-nonsense approach.

Unfortunately, she directed her considerable talents into making fairly generic pop metal records, and that, along with the leather-vixen bleached-blond look, destroyed any credibility she had. Admittedly, \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\" is a fun song, but everything else on this is roll-your-eyes boring, although Lita can carry a tune. If Ozzy Osbourne had hired her to play on his records rather than singing on hers, the name of Lita Ford would be mentioned along with--dare I say--Eddie Van Halen? If you can get past the pedestrian lyrics of her songs and listen to her amazing guitar, this isn't a bad buy, but it's tough."},{"rating":"1","title":"THANK YOU OZZY!! YOU SAVED THIS RECORDING!!","review":"I bought this recording because of Ozzy appearance on \\"If I close my eyes forever\\" this is a great song!! however Lita Ford is a mediocre singer and an acceptable guitar player what else I can say!, If you find the above song in any other compilation buy it because the rest of the music on this CD is just GARBAGE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing guitar player","review":"Saw Mike & his group play here in Los Angeles at the Baked Potato. He is an amazing player. He plays so effortlessly and seems to have a humility about him that is so refreshing these days. So then I bought Noise Travels and I certainly was not disappointed. Simply amazing guitar playing. Totally original kind of music that is extremely interesting and musical. It's real jazzy and goes through some cool mellow moods but at times really kicks butt. And his tones are superb. It's going to take me quite a long time to learn any of his licks but it is certainly a pleasure to listen to this music. I hightly recommend Noise Travels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holdsworth, meet your match.","review":"I have been a fan of Mike for years. Spent much time watching his television program on V32 when I lived in Florida. This cd reminds me of the kind of jamming he used to do with the guests on his show like Zakk Wylde and Stevie Ray Vaughan. The liner notes say the cd was recorded live with no overdubs. Pachelli plays amazing on this cd. There's a photo inside showing a stack of different amplifiers he used so guess he switched between them to get the wide variety of tones. This is really a great cd that gives Allan Holdsworth a run for his money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude tells the story of several generations of a Colombian family while supernatural occurrences and unbelievable events are described with unblinking sincerity. Marquez, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982, commands such mastery of language that his prose reads like verse. The beauty of his words wraps the reader inextricably into the fates of the Buendias. Their loves, their wars, their brutality, their death and dreams, are all told with Marquez's special gift of prose. One Hundred Years of Solitude is probably Marquez's finest work, destined to be a classic of world literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very insightful","review":"I think this book would be good for someone who has never been exposed to any marketing concepts but it is not very original and was mostly disappointing to me.

Whether your interest is in anything Texan, cowboys in general, or African Americans, I recommend this book to you. An ensemble cast of authors has given us detailed and personal looks into the fascinating and largely unknown lives of black cowboys. The writers bring the characters affectionately to life with stories as told to them and rich descriptions of the experiences of the black cowboys. It was a hard life, but not one devoid of humor and satisfaction. This collection brings the reader a panorama of lively characters and tales as wide as Texas itself, and makes a worthy contribution to cowboy romance and lore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine ballad-based CD","review":"Just picked this up and I found it really good.

I suggest buying both, the CD for the car and the Ipod, and the Vinyl for relaxing at home to the musical stylings of, in my opinion, one of the century's greatest musician. John Frusciante has never disappointed, and he exceeded my expectations astoundingly with his newest works. The Vinyl has a different arraingment of songs, which I think flows better.1.

For the PS2 they should have carried out their promises to the fans. Their storyline section is horrible. You have like 4 matches tops depending on what you pick as a storyline choices-Previous Smackdown games have a season mode where you can continuously play as a character as you unlock levels. Here you have to finish multiple storylines in order to unlock wrestlers and movie segments. Lame if you ask me. The Create a PPV is gone as well which is sad. I loved making those. You can't interfere during a wrestlers entrance. The only thing you have is improved graphics...Thats nice but for the PS2 there should be more.

The only bad part is that they delayed it so long and no RVD but Fred Durst?! What is up with that?

This game is nowhere NEAR as good as any of the WWF games they did for N64, and that's a less powerful system! The commentary is ATROCIOUS! The words are pieced together and often recorded at different octaves. And while the new intros are quite cool, I wish they would've put less time into those and more time into getting the actual GAMEPLAY to run smoother. The characters often seem to jump around the screen at random.For those who simply MUST play this cuz it's a WWF game, I urge you to RENT IT FIRST!

However, it's really short and just doesn't have the depth it talks about. If you're looking for a game to just have big matches with your friends, check it out. But if you wanna have real story mode, wait for a sequel and hopefully they will have fixed it by then."},{"rating":"1","title":"If mindless button mashing is your idea of fun...","review":"...then this game will be right up your alley. True to the Smackdown! series, this game is all about pressing the buttons fast and little or nothing about wrestling.

I loved SmackDown 2, but I think the 3rd one (Just Bring It) is too easy. It's fun to play with a bunch of friends, if everybody is at the same level, but for me, when I play the computer for fun, the matches are'nt really interesting, I mean, like, a minute and a half MAX per match, so I guess there's a bit of a lack of challenge. But graphic wise, the characters charisma and all, it's pretty damn good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is hard!","review":"I think this game is definitely worth buying. But there is no difficulty setting and its very hard to beat your opponent. But a hard game is a good game. I just love the backstage areas. The locker rooms look just like they do in real life. The boiler room and the lobby are large areas you can do anything in. Also, In the parking lot and the front entrance you can fight while cars pass by. Unfortunatley, if they hit you, it just moves you out the way. You can also drive the forklift, but all you can do in it is push your opponent around. But I still love the wide, extremely detailed areas. And if you look closely, you will see a certain item in remembrance of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The one thing that really bothers me in this game is the amount of time it takes for your player to stand up after being hit.

There is no comentary, enterences or fancy matches. Just the good ol exibition. It kicks butt. I would pay ... for the demo disk, and I would pay more for the actual game when it comes out. If you are a fan of the previous Smack Down games on playstation, then look out. This is far superior. From the basic gameplay alone, its easy to play, and tons of fun.

You have so many match options from Royal Rumble to Tornado Tag TLC match. You can creat a taunt,stable, or superstar. The story mode is nuts and you get to unlock 52 different things includin CAW parts, Wrestler, Match types, and Arenas. The only reason this game isnt getting 5 stars is because of the camera angles when playing with many people or computers. In Royal Rumble the camera is fine; but the rest of games with many people is annoying. For example, on Armagedon Hell In a Cell, their can be two people in the ring, one on top of the cage, one in the audience, and one at the runway. Keeping all them in view is HORRIBLE.

The grapics are good and the load times are quick (saving is agonizing). Create a wrestler mode is as deep as ever, moves included. However I just can't get over how weak the Story mode is, 5 matches max and your story is over. Then you have to start over with the same drawn out FMV scenario and limited choices.

Three matches and you're a heavyweight champion. Among other minor irritations I wont get into, my biggest gripe is the game play. Imagine Mortal Combat with only exhibition games. Boring!

Once you win a title (which you can pretty much do in 3 matches) you can't save and continue any longer. Graphics are just about the same. Faces look a little more detailed but the bodies look less realistic. Music, entrances & commentary are improved but the game play is worse. When facing the computer they'll waste time doing 3 taunts after every move instead of trying to follow up with another move so there's no real challenges. Most times when you try and throw someone into something outside the ring they just stop short for no reason. And the game locks up a lot.

It's a OK game, but lacks the following:1.) Good Season Mode. (Few matches then its over....)2.) Needed better Arenas.3.) The newer wrestlers at that time when it came out should have been on there, seeing they delayed it for a good while.On the other hand it has its good sides:1.) Better graphics than SD 1 & 2.2.)

He refused to plug it in to show it worked. Well, as I suspected, when I got home and tried the TV, he had left the TV as non-functional as it was when he received it, but insisted it was fixed.

You may also try carrying a zippered sandwich bag in the compartment with the bib so that any possibility of leak-through is avoided. Another added bonus is that it will hold two 2nd foods Gerber plastic containers in one of the center compartments, which is nice for long trips.

It's interesting and has a lot of information about the key political figures of our time-a must read for anyone interested in our current political scene. I, also, enjoy Molly's humorous touches. She knows her subject and is funny, too.I did note, however, that the on cover illustration ofGeorge W. Bush as a dog is that of a chihuahua. I thoughtRoss Perot was \\"the chihuahua\\". Bush should've been done as a pitbull as that would be more in keeping with his stubborn personality. The other illustrations of various political figures as dogs are definitely worth looking at, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate!","review":"Many of the columns were interesting . . . painting a picture of a vast right-ring conspiracy that Hillary Clinton first brought to the public discourse. But it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete, without any interest either as themselves or as a theme. Does anyone care about Texas state politics in 1989, or Phil Gramm's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate? Someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete .. except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book.

Her personal hatred of George Bush has become distracting and embarrasing. Strangely enough she reminds me of Rush Limbaugh. When he began doing political commentary on the radio Limbaugh was an independent with a conservative streak and was comfortable attacking Republicans. Similarly Ivins was originally an independent with a liberal streak who was comfortable attacking Democrats. Now Limbaugh is as firmly ensconced in the Republican camp as Ivins is in the Democratic camp.What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaking of dogs....","review":"This book is a very, VERY tired re-hash of Ivins previous rants against George W.

Molly goes after many of famous men over the past 30 years. Beyond the witty critiques on many presidents among others, her message to all to get more involved in politics and current events is important and inspiring. Perhaps more relevant than the critique of those men and the effects of their policies on us today is the continuation of \\"Bushwacking\\". Her perspective on Bush since \\"Bushwacked\\" is dead on and further evidence of the folly of his policies.She gives us, yet again, another book that proves more sensible and human than a host of other anti-bush books have. Her wit and good sense is best brought out in audio form. Her lack of mean-spirited style makes one the most approachable books for bush supporters looking for opposing points of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberalism Under the Guise of Ghandi","review":"I found this book rehashed a lot of her old books which I used to highly recommend to everyone. She kept using the term \\"democracy\\". We are a republic, as anyone who recites the Pledge of Allegiance knows. She is anti-gun, using the term \\"gun violence\\" and says the gun manufacturers are in it only for the money. We used guns to extricate/defend ourselves from the British, and would probably still be under their control if we had used what, bows and arrows safe enough for you? Also used guns to \\"win the west\\". The problem is not guns but the psyche of those who use them in a bad way. The countries with gun control have the highest rate of violence - England, Australia.

But I do know the Course in Miracles works for a lot of people, mostly coming from a Christian understanding, so if that's where you are coming from and you want some inspiration, this might be good for you.

Now, I ordered a grunting hedgehog for more money to find out it doesn't GRUNT, i have to order the larger size. And the Junior size is tad bit too large and the squeaker is buried, so it's impossible for my dog to squeak it, and she is a good little squeaker ;-) I would steer clear of the junior, BUT if you want the new long round ones, those grunt and a small dog can get it's mouth around it to make it grunt... go THAT WAY ;-) Hope that helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely read","review":"Erica James is a well-known and award-winning British author who will appeal to many US readers. Reading this book is like curling up with a cup of tea and having a wise and thoughtful friend recount a good story. The subject matter is sad - a young woman and her husband are killed in a car wreck, leaving two children to be raised by an unmarried sister and her parents. But the tale is well told and there are many moments of humor. A romance unfolds, and a prominent character is attracted to two different men, but it's not like typical schlock where you know from the outset which one she's going to end up with. Over the course of the book, a mystery is resolved, a marriage strengthed, people suffer and grow, and of course much tea is consumed. The plot lines are not especially original, but they're also never hackneyed. All the characters (and we readers, for that matter) are treated with affection and respect. A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on my sliding glass doors.","review":"I thought this lock would work for my patio doors. Turns out, it didn't.

I had to force myself to put it down to get some sleep. This book opened my eyes to the club. I knew the club was started by Veterens that wanted the brotherhood as well as buddies to ride with but, the club is much more. The one thing this book really did was make me want to ride my bike that much more. To ride with a group of guys with the same outlook on life as I have would be great. To all who should read this, don't believe everything the media has said about the HAMC over the years. Sonny lays it out, to the best of his knowledge everything that happened from the early days to the present (well when the book was writen). I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible...","review":"I was really excited about reading this book, you just have to love the premise. Bad Guys, Motorcycles, Biker Girls, etc. Too bad that Mr. Barger takes a topic so interesting and leaves you with so little. For example, he was at Altamont on the day of the Rolling Stones concert. He tells the story, and adds no isight as to why it happened. The book also tells story after story without any transition or any depth at all. You keep waiting for him to bring all of it together and it never happens. It is like you have an annoying relative over and they keep talking and talking and never get to the point. Please save your money. There are so many better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright Read","review":"This book was a good read and didn't take long to do.

Over all if you every wanted to know about the Hells Angels read about it from the man himself...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Not too many of us have the balls to live like Sonny does.

He would rather ride a Honda or a BMW. Other than that, not much of what he writes about makes any sense. Why is a senior citizen still bragging about the ravages of a misspent youth, which is still going on? Why does he want to brag about how much time he has spent in jail? Why do we want to hear about his dysfunctional family, etc.? As an appendix, this book includes his rap sheet which runs for thirty years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and true book","review":"My family has had the privelidge of knowing Sonny. His book is excellent! Finally there is a book written by a member that knows and speaks the truth, not just an author that writes down anything that they think will sell a book.

I kept waiting for some interesting content but it was the same old same old over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting memoir and lifestory.","review":"Love him or hate him, Sonny Barger has one interesting story to tell. In this book he chronicles his life as a child being kicked out of school for hitting the principal, the beginnings of his life on a motorcycle, the creation phase of what would become the Hell's Angels motorcycle club, his legal battles, prison time, and other related Hell's Angels stuff.Sonny Barger is quite a writer, and this book is a well written look at an era in history of when the Hell's Angels ruled the biker world with an iron fist. You will not read another book like this, and you need not have an extensive education on the Hell's Angels to understand this book. While it's somewhat shocking, it has a lot of entertainment value and even some inspiration here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonny on a roll.....","review":"Sonny Barger continues to make it all about him, and how great he is, was. According to him, pretty much the sun setting is because of him. Ralph continues to show his absolute stupidity in speaking of the Angels as though they were the best thing since canned beer. These guys are straight up criminals, period. To glorify them and put them on a platform is wrong. I was a hang around for almost two years in Cali and Arizona. These are not nice guys, they are the kind who will hurt you if you look sideways at them. One thing Ralph got right in the book-the japs build a better bike than HD ever will. And I doubt that every turn of the wrench on his bike was proceeded by a \\"sniff of sweet cocaine.\\" All the wrenching needed to build a bike, would have led to even an elephant od'ing. You are not so cool, Ralph, point is you are almost gone. I tossed this piece of trash into my wood burning stove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"For some reason I purchased the book Angels of Death.I also just finished reading Hells Angels Life and Times of Sonny Barger.

The book pretty much just bragged up the Angels and his life. Nothing that I didn't know really.

Mr. Barger doesn't want to tell much or there isn't much to tell. Book is poorly organized and regularly jumps around 30 year spans of time without any connection. Mr. Barger is clearly a legend in his own mind. Basically a book about a bunch of kids who never grew up and never accomplished anything. Don't repeat my mistake by buying the book believing they were anything more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another perspective on the 60's","review":"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down until I finished. As a counter to the \\"flower power\\" 60's, this gives a biker's input into the acid fueled San Francisco scene. It is interesting that Barger really liked LSD and acted as a sort of counter to all the prissy aspects of 60's psychedelia. Without Hell there is no Heaven. And without Barger's Hell's Angels, the 60's would have been a lot less interesting. I highly recommend this book for it's honesty, integrity, and an insider's perspective into a little revealed alternative culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"The Hell's Angels are scary, often violent, guys and the author doesn't try to make you think they're just a bunch of Good Samaritans who like to go around fixing old ladies' flat tires.But do they do good things sometimes? Well, back in 1965 they beat up some anitwar (actually pro-Vietcong) demonstrators in Oakland. That was a good deed. When Barger found out that Yippie Jerry Rubin was wearing a ring fashioned from the body of an American fighter plane downed in Vietnam, Barger vowed to get that ring from Rubin if he had to cut the latter's finger off to do it. Barger didn't quite succeed, but it was a noble effort. Any time somebody says Sonny Barger is a bad guy, I take note of the above incident and say, \\"Well, he's not ALL bad.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating but deeply flawed book","review":"This is an extremely interesting book. However, be aware that this man's philosophy is that the one constant in the universe is man's inhumanity to man. What he calls freedom is his need to indulge this view of the world.The Hells Angels' desperate need for the fellowship of like-minded people follows from the deep feelings of loneliness and fear that they are unable to confront in this veritable hell of their own creation. Their desperate quest for freedom follows from the fact that they have none: in the hell of their own making it is impossible to act and think as an individual. They cling pathetically to each other for support, prepared to make absurd sacrifices for the club.Barger's book is fascinating because it is the product of a powerful and uncensored mind. It is flawed because he is a man who is utterly unable to see himself clearly or feel even his own misery. He needs, but knows he does not deserve, our sympathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about all the crime?","review":"Barger's book isnt bad but theres some glaring omissions.

It defines a genre. \\"I Do Because I Couldn't Care Less\\" is one of my favorite tunes of *any* genre and adds to the star power of this record.

For years, I've hoped P would give up the dialogue interludes and excessive sound effects, a la \\"Gold Experience\\" and \\"0-/->,\\" and just deal with his music fans in music. This one is more production than music. This album takes itself way too seriously, and more importantly, lacks musical substance. And that's coming from a lifelong Prince fan. (Sorry P)If you want musical spirituality that will uplift you, try Coltrane's \\"Love Supreme\\" or a million Classical or Gospel CDs. As for the best of Prince I think it is (in this order): \\"Hits/BSides,\\" \\"Sign O' The Times,\\" \\"Purple Rain,\\" \\"Emancipation\\" and \\"1999.\\" Good luck!If you still can't resist the urge to buy \\"The Rainbow Children,\\" at least borrow it before you buy. You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate","review":"I bought this album unheard because I was such a fan of Prince. Bad move. I agree with the last reviewer. I tried to like it.

Is it just to test the loyalty of their constituency? Take Prince's otherwise incredible jazz album \\"The Rainbow Children\\" for example - that stupid pitch-adjusted voice over talking at slow-motion 3 octaves too low simply ruins everything it intrudes upon. It is so disturbing to listen to that it's hard to simply not turn off the player to get through to the rest of the music.The material itself is really great - and shows Prince's great depth and versatility. Just get rid of the #&*$# voice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loyal fan getting fed up with His Royal Weirdness","review":"I'm a loyal Prince fan - I have every one of his albums; and I have to say he has sunk to a new low with this one. The music is ok - sort of jazzy and weird. However, the lyrics and the whole concept of this album just seem dumb. He should stay away from sweeping concept albums. I would easily rate this as his worst and a major dissapointment.

He's back with a message in a totally different direction from his previous works. That's a good thing. Good jazz incorperated rock fusion CD. Reminds me of early Santana, Miles in the early 70's with a few touches of the neo-soul movement. Two things should have been eliminated to push this to a five star review... The slowed down narration voice almost at every break between songs, and that silly \\"Wedding Feast\\" snippet about food.

I see in the reviews that a lot of people don't like the narrator or lyrics, but it's about the music, which is simply brilliant! This is classic Prince, who finally is trying not to be hip-hop or rap, but his true self. I am a die hard prince fan and I have all his material, and it's good to finally praise an album rather than bash them like I've done for the past 4 albums. Contrary to belief, true Prince fans are his worst critics, but that's because we know the brilliance he is capable of, and he captured it in this album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically Awesome","review":"The first thing you need to know about \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is that musically, it is one of the best albums available right now. I nice mixture of jazz and funk, sprinkled with some nice guitar work and romance, it covers just about every possible genre of music, and does so very nicely. Anyone who is a long time Prince fan knows that he has always had spritual and religious undertones to his music, so the fact that those undertones are fleshed out even more on this recording shouldn't really be a big deal. One of the best things, but also one downside, is that \\"The Rainbow Children\\" listened to as a whole tells a complete story, with music as it's narrative. The downside to this is that it makes it hard to take out one track and listen to it. However that doesn't mean there aren't standout tracks, those would be \\"The Work, pt. 1\\"; \\"1+1+1=3\\"; \\"She Loves Me 4 Me\\"; \\"Mellow\\" and \\"The Everlasting Now\\".

Sadly, I have to say that much of what was released after The Revolution broke up doesn't hit the mark (with the exception of a few jewels here and there). Yet I still purchase the albums praying that the magic will return.\\"The Rainbow Children\\" does not deliver, either. Yes, there are some bright spots - however as many other reviewers noted, the overbearing, over-used, and overtly-religious spoken 'voice' throughout the record kills it.I am likely to continue to hang on to my hopes and buy Prince records... but as the years and albums go by, my hopes dim more and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided convert","review":"Music and religion were never meant to be used as weapons. This is a terribly biased and narrow-minded example of religious propaganda. Women are degraded, European-Americans are dismissed and the Jewish religion is insulted, I was appalled. I have always enjoyed the undenialble musical talent of Prince, but I cannot tolerate the \\"sell,sell,sell\\" of a particular \\"religious\\" point of view. The word \\"accurate\\" is used more than once in relation to his religious \\"opinion\\". If you can get beyond the offensive messages, the music is wonderful ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do it!","review":"This album is bad. It's not even bad in a fun campy way. If you thought \\"Animal Kingdom\\" from Prince's \\"The Truth\\" album was preachy and condecending you haven't heard the start of it! The music is still interesting but the lyrics are so offensive in a over-the-top Jerry-Falwell kind of way that I reccomend that you buy everything up to \\"Crystal Ball\\" and forget that Prince ever did anything after it. I paid [money amount] for this album and it was too much at that.Addendum; I still hate this album and had declared Prince \\"dead to me\\" because of it.

He also has an unfortunate predilection for twisting knobs on the mixing board to speed up or slow down vocals, or add distracting textures or effects to songs that would sound much better without the extra flavors. Usually it is possible to ignore the decoration to get to the music. Not this time. Paradoxically, some of his best music in years is buried under and made unlistenable by lugubrious voice-overs,recording tricks,and his most tediously didactic sermon ever. In the immortal words of Father Zappa, \\"Shut up and play your guitar!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The clueless genius","review":"Prince has the chops and skills to put out great material. However, his extremely inconsistent material released since the last part of the nineties has turned away a majority of his fans and left him with nothing more than a hardcore following. This CD will ultimately receive little or no airplay and will only be bought by those fans. Prince has cleaned up his act and put out the most mature sounding CD of his career. However, the lack of commercial material and hooks that brought this man to fame are nowhere to be found. Prince's jazz experimentation and holy lyrics are interesting. However, the mass audience will not take this collection seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Genius","review":"Prince is one of the few true musical geniuses of our time. Yes...I think Prince gets a little caught up in his self at times but Rainbow Children happens to be one of the tightest cd's I've heard from Prince in a long time. Rainbow is musically great. Jazz & Funk - from prince such a beautiful mix. I was getting fed up with Prince like most people, but give this cd a try it's so worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince - The Rainbow Children","review":"An impressive return 2 form 4 one of the most influential artists of the past 20 years. Musically this is as good as it gets, gone are Princes experimentations with different modern forms of music & this is back 2 basics jazz/funk with undertones of very early Prince!Thoroughly recommended 2 any Prince admirer old or new, sit back, dim the lights & get lost in the music! 100%."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Sight & Sound","review":"As a long time (over 20 years) Prince fan. I could not wait until the latest Prince album was in stores. I'd run out and buy it. No more! The Rainbow Children is absolutely horrible. The free-spirited talent I once loved is no more. He has replaced his vitality and individuality for dogmatic religious babble. Some of the instrumentation is good, especially compared to the bland tracks that are out there now. However that is not enough to save this sinking ship. I was so thoroughly disappointed with this album after listening to it that I did not even bother to buy. The Rainbow Children and Chaos & Disorder are the only two Prince albums missing from my collection, and for good reason. They are both terrible excuses for music from someone who has the potential to produce something much greater. What a sad sad sight. Why do I here Billy from Purple Rain right now, in the scene where he told the kid that no one dug his music anymore but him? Is life truly imitating art?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Frank Zappa were alive...","review":"he would be proud of Prince , because if I did not know Prince , my first thought about this recording is that it came from Zappa's vaults .

There are enough people preaching to all of us on a daily basis from many different sources, it's not why I buy music. Really disappointed because I believe one could argue that Prince is perhaps THE most talented artist around. In fact, I can appreciated his talent musically on this release, however it is overshadowed by the lyrical content. And, this offering has no flow. It's like a bad Dead show when Jerry and Bobby used to fight for control of the set; one slow song, one fast one, etc. I tried twice to listen to this CD in one sitting, and couldn't get through it either time. I think true Prince fans will understand and appreciate the breadth of his talent, but when you're standing in front of your Prince collection, I seriously doubt that \\"Rainbow Children\\" is the one you'll reach for, in fact if it wasn't even a choice, you wouldn't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, preachy","review":"The last album that had any edge to it was half Of EMANCIPATION. That album is Sgt. Peppers compared to this. One good song is all I can find on this album. I think Prince is too far out in the Jesus atmosphere to ever come back down. I wish him luck, but his music stinks now. It sounds like he is falling asleep on every track. No invention or excitement. I hope MAYBE someday he will make an album on par with the quality of SIGN, god evn , THE GOLD EXPERIENCE. Yet, i dont think so. Oh, also, his new drummer is technically good, but give me Michael B. any day of the week. This new guy is too technical. Prince, MAKE ANOTHER ROCK ALBUM. Chaos and Disorder is 3000 times better than this.

Well, this time he has (IMHO) failed quite miserably. I was even able to find at least one song I liked on such clunkers like Lovesexy (I Wish U Heaven), The Black Album (Bob George) and Graffiti Bridge (Thieves In The Temple)...however...This was different.I found nothing even remotely interesting about this album! I felt as if I were being subjected to an audio televangilical broadcast half spoken by a mechanically enhanced voice.Confused? You're not half as confused as you will be after listening to Rainbow Children. But, I am not unhappy I bought it. Support his music, he'll get it right again...someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Children' of a Lesser God","review":"The tip-off should've been the \\"controversial new album\\" sticker on the cover. Instinctively, I equated controversial with problematic. But being a once devoted fan, I bought it anyway. I should've paid attention to my instincts. \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is Prince formerly known as artist's attempt at a smooth jazz and soul record. Problem is, it's long on slick, soulless production and religious claptrap and exceedingly short on interesting ideas and melodies. To employ one of Prince's own tired conceits, eye believe this 1 is 4 the dumper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to a Copy Before You Buy","review":"Or you'll regret it. He's dabbled with spirituality in his music for over twenty years, but this pseudo-enlightenment babble is dreadful. Banished Ones? Rise up, rainbow children? Sorry, no. The sound is a little more confused -- granted, it's certainly more original than the old work on the Vault and Crystal Ball -- but it's primarily enjoyed only if you're a wide-eyed postmodernist. I've been a fan forever (I even like Lovesexy, and loved the movie UTCM) . . . and dislike the pop trash we have now. You want funky? Go elsewhere. You loved Leonard Nimoy's folk album? Then you may appreciate the bizarre enough to like this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im not feel'n this Rainbow Children at ALL!","review":"Look, I been a Prince fan for a long long time. I have all the cd's. I stuck up for the man when everybody was saying he lost his R&B style. I go out and by this cd and im very very unhappy. Im not feel'n this cd at all!!! No way No how. I really feel he lost his thang after the Gold cd. It was all down hill from there. Prince if U read these reviews man. Please get back with it man. Bring the Revolution back or something. I cant even jam this in the car. Michael Jackson's new cd is 50 times better than this. And he comes out with a cd every 5 years. This Rainbow Children cd is straight garbage! Got to come better than this Prince.

It goes from mellow to dance to spritual a little something for everyone. This reminds me of the good old days when you bought a album and enjoyed it from front to back. Some particular favorites include Muse 2 the Pharaoh, 1+1+1=3, She loves me for me and Family Name. It's all good for faithful Prince fans I guarantee you won't be disapointed you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Old, Something New...","review":"A prince fan for 20 years, this album is a pleasant return for the artist back towards really exciting music. Prince's guitar is back, as is the voice of God (or the Wise One) from Temptation from Around the World. It harks of Quincy Jones. Prince is reveling in God again which he has a long history of, maybe his new found faith (he's a Witness now), is young, but building a song like \\"Willing to Do the Work\\" pay homage to God, James Brown and makes me want to go door to door, frankly. He seems to be regesturing at his roots of Jones, Brown, Gospel, Jazz and identifying strongly as Africa American. I always though Prince's music was best was he was riding a stint without a female figure. The performance, composition and production shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Prince I Grew Up to Love","review":"In the last decade, Prince has all but abandoned his darker, raunchier side. Every other album he released in the 1980s was a verified classic, but in the last 10 years, his output is hit-and-mostly-miss. \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is a tough album to sit through, and it will require patience from even the most rabid of Prince devotees. Though the disc has some moments (nice artwork, too), it has two or three good songs buried underneath heaps of filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rainbow Children - The Dawning of a New Age","review":"\\"Rainbow Children,\\" this CD is superb!!Prince, has done a masterful job of intertwining bits of history, both exoteric and otherwise, into a musical gem that will last for many decades to come. This is the Magic Flute of the New Generation.Not only will you learn a considerable amount by listening to his words and researching the terms expressed, but you will most assuredly experience the alchemical process of becoming.

I also had to use my own rope because the rope included was much too short (I'm guessing 10 feet). I don't imagine it will hold up for very long.

I was a little disappointed to find when I received it that the edges of the red paint were a little sloppy. I evened them up and hit some missed spots with a red permanent marker. I was also surprised to find that it came with a Ryan's Room person - I figured he was just for show in the picture. He's about the same size as the Plan dolls.My main disappointment is that there is no leg room for people in the back seat and it's not the easiest to get them adjusted in the front seat, but my daughter loves the car and fills it up with her Plan people and her new Ryan's Room guy.

Algebraic logic is slighted, even though Mendelson was an authority on Boolean algebra. Nor does he do justice to the model theoretic perspective, although the treatment of the Tarski semantics for first order logic in chpt. 2 is a bit of a classic. The treatment of recursion in chpts. 3 and 5 are thorough. The set theory of chpt. 4 is a bit unconventional (NBG rather than ZF) but is well exposited. My overall complaint is the crabbed notation, altho he's come a long way since the first edition. The book also cries out for a more graceful English style and page layout. Here Machover (1996) stands out.Mendelson's bibliography is wonderfully long and rich. Finally, this text contains perhaps the gentlest extant introduction to second order logic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Organization and Clear Style","review":"I was sufficiently fortunate to have taken Professor Emeritus Mendelson's famous logic course at Queens College, the City University of New York, just two semesters before his retirement. I was, and continue to be, astonished by Dr. Mendelson's precise yet easy style, and the beautifully efficient organization of the subjects. Everything from the expository prose to the system of notational conventions has been carefully thought through so as to make the book both very substantive and very readable. In my opinion, it's the best introduction to serious mathematical logic currently on the market, and thanks to the genius of its author, it is likely to remain so for a long time. The buyer will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"twisted pants unleashed on men","review":"This is one of the more popular introductory textbooks on mathematical logic, with Enderton's being its biggest competitor. I prefer Mendelson's for its breadth of material and the choice of proofs he uses, which are generally the most intuitive (e.g. Kalmar's for the completeness of the propositional calculus). This is not to say that they are always constructive, as they many of them are in the older texts (e.g. Kleene, Introduction to Metamathemaitcs).The exercises are thoughtfully chosen. There's a good range of difficulty and a good portion of the answers can be found in the back. Difficult questions are indicated to the reader.Out of all the mathematical logic texts I have (which are quite a few in number), this is the most oft-referred-to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"Even though I already knew the material, I found this book painfully slow to read. The author habitually writes in sentences that are runon, convoluted, repetitive, and indirect. I kept reading passages over and over to sort out what he was saying. That goes double for the proofs.There is just not a clear unfolding of ideas at the sentence, paragraph, or chapter levels. It is even uninviting to look at; the layout is cramped and the notation is unnecessarily elaborate. The only point I can say in its favor is that it covers more material than most texts, as it is designed for a one-year course."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big mistake","review":"Late in August, the text originally selected for my mathematical logic class became unavailable. On the basis of reviews only, I chose Mendelson's Introduction to Mathematical Logic as the replacement. A disasterous choice. There may be a page without a typo, but I don't expect to find it. The presentation is inconsistent in notation and focus. Concepts are confused and more difficult than they should be. Definitions are not wisely selected. This book reads like something that has been patched for four decades (since 1964). On the positive side it contains interesting supporting material and will be a valuable private source of ideas to the lecturer. Be sure to read sections from chapter 2 and 3 before selecting this as a text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best reference in first step math logic","review":"Mendelson reaches an optimal point between the concision of the expert reference, and the wideness requested to a introductory text.

However, I do not beleive that it will drastically help the development of a metal vocalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless for trained singers","review":"Most of this DVD is nothing but breathing techniques and warm-up exercises. If you already know how to sing, nothing new is covered here. The reason I bought this DVD was to learn how to scream and growl properly, which hardly isn't covered at all (2-3 minutes), and what's there is really poor. In addition there is far too much footage of Melissas students praising her, so that it almost seems like nothing but a commercial for her lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and helpful addition to other instruction","review":"The introduction part does come across like an ad, but once it gets going there is a lot of useful stuff. Instruction is interspersed with pieces of interviews with students of Melissa's, which is not instruction per se. But I think the interviews are very helpful in showing how it's put to use, as well as demonstrating the importance of vocal health. Most of the concepts Melissa reviews are things you'll encounter with a more traditional singing instructor, but she has her own way of describing them and explaining how they relate to screaming. She also has some unique exercises, tailored to heavy vocalizing. I think this DVD is most beneficial in conjunction with lessons/other instruction.The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it only scratches the surface, and it's only designed to scratch the surface. I think this is fine for what it is, but it isn't everything. That, and the first 20 minutes are self-indulgent."},{"rating":"2","title":"voice saver","review":"wanna sing like a madman (or madwoman) and not lose your voice? then buy this dvd. 3 hours of info on how to do the job right without tearing your voice up."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD=lessons, DVD=Infomercial","review":"This seems to be like any other vocal warm-up, exercise audio you can get.The DVD is an \\"Infomercial\\", it's like they were going to put it on late night tv and didn't, so thought, \\"what the hell, .. lets put it in the product to look like it's more than just a cd audio\\"..The product really is just the cd audio with do-re-mi like exercises. caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD = Infomercial; CD = standard do-rei-mei lessons","review":"I guess if you already produced an expensive infomercial that is basically paid testimony why not throw it into the package to create the illusion of, \\"...but wait, there's more!\\" product offering. The dvd is just an infomercial of metal musicians saying how good it is. But there is no teaching. No matter how many times you watch someone tell you how good something is will never make you good! LOL! I'm waiting for the melissa cross zen of nuclear physics with a bunch of lab coats on dvd telling me how good melissa is at nuclear physics and how i'm going to learn! Keep up the \\"Zen of ...\\" franchise.. Is the second dvd an updated infomercial with death and steampunk screaming? LOL! P.O.S. waste of money.. The cd has do-rei-me exercises for the vocally challenged.. with bonus pa-pa-pa's et al.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Save Yourself","review":"This is a great tool for protecting your voice. I've had tons of throat problems over the years and this DVD has really helped me be able to find my voice again - without pain! The only drawback is that as you watch the DVD over again to get the instruction you have to keep watching the other guys give their opinions and experiences on the method. I wish it were cut or tracked so that you could just skip to the next bit of information without wading thru the commentary.But otherwise it's a valuable tool. Thanks, Melissa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"www.myspace.com/pushtothenegative","review":"i am a solo artist trying to form my own band so i can start playing my songs live. i bought this dvd so i coud start preparing my voice for live shows, and thats exatly what its good for. some of the past reviews i've read mention that there's too much footage of bands mentioning how great melissa cross is. i will sadly agree, but still even with this problem, i learned things that will benefit me and keep my voice in good shape. keep in mind, if you dont know how to scream, and you want to learn, its something that takes time and practice. this dvd is mainly to help strengthen your singing before getting into the heavier stuff, which is what i'm sure she'll cover in her next dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Rip Off","review":"Not only is this DVD useless, Melissa Cross seems to drop every name she can in order to impress us. Impressed I was not. I learned NOTHING from this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a huge publicity stunt and is a waste of money.","review":"Well, first of all, I am the lead singer for my band. I am a very good singer, I've had many singing lessons and am in choir. I know how to sing from my diaphram and sing with the correct vowel sounds, have good vibrato, and falsetto. BUT!! I wanted to learn how to SCREAM. I have done a few shows with a hardcore band and screamed for them and just devestated my throat. I wanted to learn how to SCREAM correctly and this dvd will not teach you how to SCREAM. It may say it does, but it does not. Pretty much the first hour of stuff was stuff I already knew about singing. She mentions how to make your voice scratchy in about 3-4 sentences and THATS IT. I need further explanation. I am extremely extremely angry because I just wasted my money on a crappy factless infomertial for Melissa Cross. This dvd sucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"Very good tips for vocal warm-ups and how to protect your voice, but they dont even mention the word screaming until like an hour into the video...also, i felt like a lot of it was like advertising for melissa cross, rather than instruction (i.e. videos of band saying \\"oh melissa is the greatest!!\\"), but overall it was helpful and i would recommend it"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],R={key:0},H={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",R,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(D,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-9547a1d5"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/61.md","filePath":"quotes/61.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/61.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
