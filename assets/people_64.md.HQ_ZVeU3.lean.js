Great coffee, short life","review":"I just bought my fourth Cuisinart DCC-1200. Two previously for myself and one for my parents. I have had other pots including Mr. Coffee but nothing compares to Cuisinart. The first had a small leak problem almost immediately but I attributed that to the rough handling it received in the unpacking process. Eventually the leak grew and it was necessary to replace. The second Cuisinart lasted about 19 months and then just stopped working. My parents' is still working but they have only had for 18 months. The coffee maker seems to have an 18-20 month life span. I thought is was just me, until I read the other reviews and everyone seemed to have the same issue. So this time I bought it at Best Buy for about the same price and purchased their two year replacement plan for $14.95. So if this one follows the pattern, I will be able to replace it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee but short life","review":"I've had my Cuisinart DCC 1200 for about a year and a half and loved it until about two weeks ago. The coffee is great but there are numerous complaints on line that this machine has a short life. Mine now stops brewing half way through and shuts off. The good news is it shuts off...which makes me one of the lucky ones! I've written to Cuisinart and hopefully will receive a positive response. Meanwhile, I only use my coffeemaker an average of 5 times a week, so it's not like this has really performed. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 1.5 Years","review":"I strongly warn you off this machine. I purchased a year and a half ago to \\"upgrade\\" from a simple Braun I had had for about a dozen years. Worked yesterday. This morning, the red light came on for brewing and nothing happened. No noise, no heating up of the plate, nothing. Cuisinart CSR suggested filling with half vinegar/half water, unplugging for an hour and then trying to brew. Nothing. They are sending a replacement for $10 plus I have to pay for return shipping. I am getting the replacement, but feel very unhappy about it, especially reading the hundreds of 1-star reviews and how many are about the machine just dying. I am extremely irritated--this machine cost more than $70 and should last longer.

We have had it for 1 year and 1 month and today it scared me to death. It started smelling burnt, so we immediately unplugged it, but you could hear the burner sizzling under the pot, and then you could see the red glowing under the burner. It sounded like flames, but it could have been the noise from the burner about to explode before we put it under cold water. I will try to return this, but I doubt I will recieve anything since a year has just passed, but maybe they can look into the danger of this product and get it fixed, if I send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"The machine has worked perfectly for six years.

Until today my only complaint was that water drips down the back when the top is opened to clean it out.This morning during the brew cycle, it started to make popping sounds, stink of an electrical fire, and appeared to have shut off although it continued making noises. I unplugged it, dumped the coffee and got out the french press for my morning joe. Fortunately I was in the kitchen making breakfast when this happened. After returning from work I plugged it back in, and the clock displays and the light comes on when the switch flipped to On, but it no longer brews. Water just sits in the reservoir. I purchased it here on Amazon and read the reviews, but was skeptical about the complaints regarding this issue and bought it anyway. Now I've learned the hard way that there's really something to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Bought a refurbished and I would have never known that the product was a refurb.

After about a month the pause and serve function started to leak excessively if we removed the carafe. About 3 weeks ago, the coffee maker started making a very loud rumbling noise and taking almost a half hour to complete the brewing process; kind of a pain if the pause and serve function doesnt work either. Two weeks ago the clean light popped on and I proceeded to clean it as suggested in the manual, 5 times, and still the light goes off every time we brew, flashing over and over again. At least I have something to do, looking at this flashing red light, for 30 minutes while I wait for my coffee. Everyone, stay away from this coffee maker, at $100 or so, you will have one month of good coffee and then a long frustrating relationship with it thereafter.

It brews too quickly to utilize all of the grounds. (a great deal of the coffee grounds never even get used in the brewing process) Miraculously, if you add 10 cups of water, you will only get 8 cups of coffee. (same for smaller brewing amounts) If the grounds are even slightly close to the top, like an inch, they will be forced over the sides into the water reservoir, which means inevitable clogging and premature maintenance. The only reason this machine is getting one star is because i've no other choice, and some coffee is better than none, even it means consistent frustration with such a terrible piece of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!!FIRE HAZARD!!!!!","review":"ALERT! Please read Consumer Affairs on Cuisinart 1200 and all of the other Cuisinart coffee makers. Mine started burning up only after 6 months of use! Hundreds of other people have had the same issue.

I am very happy with this my choice of Cuisinart. The only draw back is that the water reservior is hard to read but I got around that by messuring the water before pouring it in.

When making a 4 \\"coffee maker\\" cup batch, the coffee maker fails to extract much flavor from the grinds. Instead you end up with a cup of hot water that vaguely tastes like coffee.I find that if a make a batch of 6 \\"coffee maker\\" sized cups or more, then it performs much better and I get a cup of decent tasting coffee.At $80, it should perform as advertised. I'd return it if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design.","review":"not a lot to like here. as others have pointed out, there's no level indicator, it's hard to even pour the water into the crevice provided. But the worst part is the carafe is too large for the hopper. if you follow the included instructions you can only brew 7.5 cups of good coffee. Even our 10-cup Krups had a larger hopper that wouldn't overflow. But this thing takes up more space has a larger carafe but makes less coffee? And yes, you open the lid and the condensation covers your counter.All of these seem bad this one very poorly designed, i researched these, and still i hate the shortcomeings of this one. Thought I could live with them, but this is just poor design, and i want to smash it everday. so look for better.

There was no problem in changing out the filter or any other maintenance. One day last week - without any warning - our coffeemaker decided it would not turn on again. Regardless of the many outlets we used, the coffeemaker will no longer power on. It hasn't even made it past the 3 year warranty deadline and customer service is also being a pain.

I have used it approximately 5 times/week since that time. Yesterday, during the brewing process, I heard unusual sounds (gurgling, cracking, hissing) coming from the machine. When I checked it, I found smoke coming from the hot plate. I lifted the carafe (the coffee was actually boiling) and found the front half of the hot plate bright red. I immediately unplugged the unit, while smoke began to pour out from the hot plate and there was a stong burning plastic smell. I called Cuisinart for a refund. They refused and wanted to send me a replacement. Obviously, I was not interested. This would have led to kitchen fire if I had not been in the kitchen at this time.

A lot of money for a coffee maker to break down after so short a time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same product","review":"I bought this coffee maker almost 3 years ago and really liked it. It brewed fast, was reasonably hot, and had the features I wanted. However, about 3 weeks ago, it started leaking profusely from the bottom of the machine while brewing. With each 8 cup brew, I would lose about a cup of water to the counter. Since I was reasonably satisfied with the old version, I went the easy way and ordered the same thing. Well I got it today and it is not the same thing. The old one was really stainless steal and pretty. The new one says it is stainless steal and black, but instead, it is cheap light silver plastic. Yuck. No thanks Cuisinart. You just lost a customer - this one is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee!","review":"Makes great coffee. Pouring water in the reservoir is a bit clumsy as the opening is a bit small. Additionally the height forces me to pull the unit out from under the cabinet quite far to pour the water.

Like some other reviews I've read, it took a leap of faith to spend 70 bucks on a coffee pot. However, it's proven to be a worthwhile investment since I was replacing less expensive models every 12-18 months. I estimate it probably brewed about 2500 pots of coffee, so I don't have any complaints about the reliability.Regarding quality of the coffee brewed, I don't think I'd be able to tell coffee brewed with one model versus another. I believe it has more to do with the coffee and water used. What I like is the coffee is very hot and remains that way without acquiring a burned or stale flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfaction","review":"Bonjour, je suis tr��s satisfait de mon achat,la cafeti��re r��pond �� mon attente, simple d'utilisation,le caf�� est tres chaud....point important.

I bought it to match some stainless that I had and because the pot itself did not feel flimsy. BUT!!! No matter what you do (add extra coffee, buy a more expensive brand, try an espresso grind) there is NOTHING you can do to improve the flavour. Another reviewer had stated that she thought that it was the pattern of the water as it flows over the coffee and I think she must be right. So if you like your brew tasting watery all the time, and you don't appreciate a rich full-bodies cup of java, then this Cuisinart is the brand for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cofffemaker has electrical control problem","review":"Have had the product just two years. It brews very good coffee. However, the unit constantly shuts off before completion and required toggling the on/off switch to get it restarted toward completion.

When I did pull it out and use it, it was great ... but quit working after 6 weeks of use. I used the cleaning feature over and over thinking that might be the problem, but no.

One thing that I would have liked is a transparent line in the coffeemaker itself with cup numbers, so I could see where I'm pouring to. But I've learned to rely on the decanter, and what a great one it is--no spills. I had loved my Krups for years, but couldn't stand the daily water-spills when I poured water from the pitcher into the Thang. This one also and most importantly makes GRRRREAT coffee.

However, the lid opens fully so you'll need to account for that when measuring counter space.I don't drink much coffee so this is probably overkill but there is a nice \\"1-4 cup\\" button if you're making smaller batches. What this essentially does is make the water hotter to compensate for the shorter brewing time.My gripe with other coffee makers is that they don't get hot enough to bring out the full flavor from the grounds. This unit doesn't have that problem and the water gets plenty hot. The coffee always comes out smooth and robust.If you use the paper filters, you will get ZERO grounds in the pot, no matter how fine the grind.The only thing I don't like is the filter basket doesn't stand up on its own so if you're using both hands trying to get every last bit from your grinder, this can be a chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"Pros are good looks and great coffee while it works.Cons are it just doesn't hold up to moderate use (2-3 pots a day).Our experience is similar to some other reviewers.

Every night I prep it and it is programmed to start up at 7:15 every morning. Today it perked as usual and I had my first cup of coffee and went to watch TV in another room. Some 10 minutes later I smelled smoke. Ran to the kitchen to see smoke pouring out from the coffeemaker and the coffee was bubbling to beat the band. After unplugging the unit and removing the carafe, I noticed that the hot plate was fire red. Rushed the darn thing outside. Came back to discover that the unit had scorched my laminate countertop. So much for Cuisinart coffeemakers!

First one lasted two weeks - hot plate stopped working. Second one ( on a roll now) lasted 6 weeks - same problem - wouldn't heat up. Now the grandaddy of them all - this one lasted 6 months. I would like to know why retailers keep selling these crappy coffeemakers at the expense of customers. Lot of poor production and perhaps they should make them here in the U.S. and let and engineer redesign the heating element instead of some poor crap made in some third world country. Amazon and other reatailers should be ashamed to sell such a poorly made product at the expense of customers.

I worked all day in a restaurant directly behind the coffee machine, so a good cup of coffee was always at my disposal. However at home, it was a completely different story. I had previously gone through 2 machines as well as a french press (dont get me wrong, it makes a great cup of coffee, i just dont have the time!) So when I changed jobs and I no longer had that perfect cup behind me, well it was time to do some research. After carefully reviewing Braun, Hamilton Beach and this Cuisinart machine, I decided to go with the Cuisinart (besides, can nearly 400 good reviewers be wrong?) The answer is no, they were not wrong. The auto brew and 1-4 cup select, gave me just want I wanted, a perfectly brewed HOT cup of coffee. The instruction manual left a lot to be desired (no real set up instructions) but this machine shines where it clearly should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coffee pot!","review":"This is an excellent coffee pot.

This machine should be advertised as an alarm clock. The ability to vary coffee strength is limited to whether you want a medium or weak cup of coffee. Takes ten minutes to clean if you can get the grinding element out of the machine. Buy only if you haven't the funds to purchase a real coffee pot with a stainless steel exterior. Thank goodness I bought it at a place that allows for returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satan's Coffeemaker","review":"In the mornings, when you need your caffiene the most, this coffeemaker is a sick joke. It makes sludge, not coffee, and I have tried every different brewing method with no success (water to grounds ratio, paper vs. metal filter, fine and coarse grind, grinding fresh beans) This coffeemaker has taken perfectly good coffee and turned it into bilge every time.

It is also easy to keep clean.However, pouring water into the reservoir is a bit of a pain. The top lifts open and there is a very small opening in the right-rear top to pour the water in; I'd recommend a plant watering pot, with a very long spout, to fill it without making a mess everywhere. Now for the truly asinine part. There is no way to tell from the outside how much water you've put in! There are internal gradations, reasonably well marked, so if you're about 6'6\\" or taller, you can tell immediately how much water you've put in. I'm 6' and I have to stand on my tiptoes; my wife can't tell at all.So if you can live with this nuisance, it is a great coffee maker; otherwise get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I received this coffee maker as a gift, and really wanted to love it. Unfortunately, it has not worked out well. The water tank is in an awkward place, and I seem to spill water every time I fill it. There is no way to see from the outside how much water is in the tank. These were minor annoyances, not big problems. However, after about 6 months the mechanism that stops the coffee from continuing to drip if you remove the carafe while it's still brewing stopped working. A real inconvenience for those of us who are not patient enough to wait for the pot to finish brewing before diving into our first cup of the day! Now, it makes a strange noise while brewing, and the coffee tastes terrible. I have no idea what's wrong with it, but I'm very disappointed. I had a Black and Decker for 8 years that never gave me any problems... this one is a dud after less than a year. I'm getting rid of it and buying another Black and Decker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"This coffee maker was easy to set up and use.

We have enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed & below average coffee","review":"We have had this coffee maker for four months. When getting coffee before the brewing cycle is complete, the flow of liquid is supposed to stop while the carafe is removed. I noticed that clear hot water keeps flowing onto the hot plate around the side of the valve that stops the coffee while the carafe is removed. It obviously is seeping between the brewing basket and the cavity it rests in. It appears this is due to the badly designed plumbing in the lid hinge. I estimate that about a third of the hot water never makes it through the grounds.In addition the water only reaches about 165 degrees, far below optimum brew temp. Cuisinart makes some good products but this is not one of them. Wish I had bought a Bunn."},{"rating":"2","title":"attractive, functional, long-lived, and well-priced","review":"I bought one of these for my mother almost 2 years ago, after using one while visiting a friend's house. And then my cousin told me she has one too. That was all I needed to hear, so I bought one for myself. This is an excellent coffeemaker. I particularly appreciate the ability to specify that you're making a smaller pot of coffee--it actually does make a difference when you use that setting. The variable temperature control is also a nice feature. Personally, I don't like brewing with the gold filter they include, and would recommend using paper filters (even though they're a bit wasteful, it's true). All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase, two times over, and am already thinking of who else I could buy one for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be recalled","review":"I have owned two of these machines, because I loved them for all the same reasons the positive reviewers do. The first just quit working after two years of use. Yesterday, the second machine started sputtering, sparking, and smoking. It was VERY HOT and dangerous. After looking in to it, this is a KNOWN problem with these machines-there are over 150 complaints on the US Government Consumer Safety website. Who knows how many more didn't complain. The company does not see this as a problem because \\"the fail safe worked and the machine shut itself down\\". I will not be replacing this machine with a third, because I'm convinced that had I not been in the immediate vicinity when the machine melted, my countertops would have melted, too. In my opinion, this won't be recalled until someone is gravely injured or killed in a fire that can be directly traced to this machine. Don't let that be you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life","review":"Have had this Cuisinart 1200 for about 1 year. Yesterday it just quit working. I called the company and they had me do the vinegar rinsing to remove impurities and also had me rinse it to remove any debris in the way. I also removed the charcoal filter since they indicated it should be changed often. Of course they just happen to sell these at an inflated price. I will do without the filter.I did not believe either issue was the problem and it still does not function. I had already done the Vinegar cleaning previously. I owned a Mr Coffee unit and never encountered any problem with the unit.I must say I was disappointed and now will be required to package the unit up and return to Cuisinart.

Why is it still on the market?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"two design flaws with this coffeemaker","review":"I've owned this coffeemaker for a year now and have discovered that while it makes a good cup of coffee it has two design flaws. The water intake chamber and the filter chamber are placed so close to where you pour the coffee into the cone that grounds tend to \\"spill\\" into those chambers unless you are very very careful. I can imagine that over time this could clog up the water system within. Here's a little test to see if it's happening to you. Fill the water chamber then pour it out into a clear pitcher.

It evencomes with a reusable gold tone filter basket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...not GREAT...but good....","review":"Bought the stainless steel+black version, mainly on the advice of Consumer Reports which rated this pot top. Looks great with our other stainless appliances. I would have to agree with other reviewers that the water-pouring area is a bit small - especially if you are bleary-eyed in the morning. The water-pouring area is only about an inch wide and maybe a couple inches long. Compared to my old Mr. Coffee, which was about 6 inches by 4 inches, at least. One feature that does not seem to be mentioned often is the \\"auto clean\\" feature, where the coffee maker must have some sensor that determines when the calcification buildup gets too thick. I have not had occasion to see it work yet, but it is a cool feature. I also like the \\"gold tone filter\\" - makes for filter conservation (not GOLD, just GOLD TONE - what is that all about?). All that said - this machine makes a decent cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"coffee machine broke all of a sudden","review":"I have had this Cuisinart coffee maker now for alomst 3 years. I agree with all the previous comments about water condensation, leaking water and temperature problems. My biggest complaints are with the controls.

Well i contacted Cuisinart and a very nice man phoned me back and said they were sending me a new machine...no questions asked !!!

Then again i've had the same results from a $9 Proctor Silex at the office. Not to mention i use premium Kona coffee from Hawaii.- Auto features are easy to use and program.- I concur with a previous review, in that the water resevoir has a small opening and is oddly placed. Pour carefully.- It comes with a water filter....cool.- Fork down an additional $10 for the replacement Gold Filter Basket (#4), it's worth it's weight in gold....pun intended.- My parents have been happy using the same machine over the past year."},{"rating":"2","title":"best coffee maker ever used","review":"This was to replace a Mr. Coffee...lasted about 6 months this time. First thing I noticed was I needed to use less coffee. The shape of the filter basket is different in that the non-porous area is about a 1/2 inch by 2 inch strip at the bottom with the rest a netting material which allows for the coffee to be more saturated with hot water. Also, it has a circular hot-water dispersal instead of the singular little hole the others use...again, superior coffee.The true test for me will be how long it lasts. we've had trouble getting a coffee maker to last over a year. This one comes with a 3 year warranty, so we're looking forward to a long relationship with it!

I was happy with the coffee maker, it has a self cleaning option and it looks good too. It does not seem to make the coffee scalding hot if that is how you like it. The worst thing about it is it just died on me after 18 months. The heater element seems to have burned out, the coffee maker light comes on but it does not process the water.

After much internet searching and a call to the customer service center, I have discovered that there is no way to fix the machine or have it repaired for a reasonable price. Of course, if the coffee maker weren't a gift and I had the receipt, I could've shipped the coffee maker to Cuisinart at my expense and had them fix it and they would've shipped it back at my expense. The customer service representative said that there was really nothing I could do to salvage the machine. She said just throw it away. So while the coffee maker is good otherwise, the absence of service options makes it a poor choice for a gift or for someone who wants a hassle-free experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"Repost -Decent coffee maker, but we've had ours for two years and it just caught on fire.

However, the machine has 2 design problems. First, the space for pouring in the water is narrow and close to the top hinge. It is difficult not to spill and using the carafe is awkward. Second, it's nearly impossible to check if you've added the right amount of water to brew a small pot like 2 or 4 cups. There is no external water level indicator.

The self-clean light was blinking, so I followed the procedure, but again it wouldn't brew properly. At that point, I was concerned about safety, so arranged for a refund.

I was so pleased with the first unit, when I needed to replace a unit at the second location this decision was a slam dunk. Excellent flavor, excellent appearance, excellent programability.The only downside is a design weakness that is shared with many other competitor units. After the coffe is brewed there is a fair amount of water condensation that remains in the fresh water heating area and on the lid and that is a ripe environment for mold/mildew (uch!).

Without doubt this model is terrible.It is labor intensive to clean, requiring q-tips to get most of the grinds out of the tight areas.Thre is always an oily residue on the coffee because you can't clean the basket.If you put more than 9 cups of water in, it spits and dribbles coffee and grinds all over the front of the machine and the counter.No matter how you measure, you can't get enough spoonfuls of coffee or beans into the well to make 12 cups anyway.I don't mind only being able to make 9 cups in a 12 cup machine, but the coffee is crummy. I had a 300 model before this one and it was wonderful, and made a great cup of coffee. This model just plain stinks ! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am liking this one...","review":"Took FOREVER to find a coffee maker I might be happy with. So far in the short run I like this one. It makes good HOT coffee and does what it says it will. I give four stars only because I really wanted a coffee maker with a removable water reservoir so it would be easier to fill. I had one (a different brand) prior to this but the machine didn't last 4 months. Really? What the heck happened to quality? Since Cuisinart has such a great warranty and this model had consistenly excellent reviews I was more comfortable putting out the bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good with one annoyance","review":"This coffeemaker makes very good coffee and it is quick and mostly easy. The parts that need to be cleaned can be put in the dishwasher. The one annoyance is that it is hard to see the water level as you are adding water. You have to pull it toward you so you can look straight down into it and have an overhead light on. To see anything below 8 cups or so you would need a flashlight. Obviously, you can avoid this by having a container (pitcher or whatever) with the correct level marked, but this is somewhat of an annoyance in itself. Overall, we're glad we got this coffeemaker and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent coffeemaker","review":"I love this coffee machine. It does all the things it says it does, i.e., makes great tasting hot coffee, is programmable and efficient, and looks good. I've never had a better coffee maker! My only complaint is that the spot where you pour the water into is too small and it's easy to spill water on the counter, if you're going to fast - but that's something you learn to live with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Love this coffee maker, especially the option for 2-4 cups that boosts the temperature. That is my usual brew amount and i always wondered why my coffee just wasn't hot enough. Also love the ability to set how long until the auto turn-off. Add to it the warranty compared to other brands and it sells itself. I checked around on prices and this was a great deal.The only disappointment is that it is hard to see how much water you have added. I have worked around that so it shouldn't be a deal breaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - Near perfect coffee maker","review":"I am more than pleased with my cuisinart coffee maker. The only strike against it I can think of is it doesn't get my mug and automatically pour my coffee for me. Otherwise it's pefect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Chrome isn't Chrome","review":"The default color selection is Black Chrome. The image looks like the best selling 'Chrome' coffee maker, the kind that would match stainless steel appliances. The image is not at all representative of the product. The front of the product is *black*, much closer to a variation of the 'black' version they sell than 'Chrome.'If you want a 'Chrome' / Stainless Steel coffee maker, you want 'Black / Brushed Metal' (currently the second color).I am buying this as a replacement for the exact same model that has worked well for us for nearly 10 years. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"burning and smoking after a year!","review":"I had the dcc 1220 for a little over a year. It's hard to fill do to having to fill it from the back. On the plus side the coffee stays nice and hot. On the negative side the coffee machine started smoking and burning. The hot plate was red hot. I checked out the safterproducts.gov website and found I wasn't the only person who had this problem. May be a recall on this machine in the near future. So I say beware of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until it clogs.","review":"Will not buy again. The coffee grounds eventually end up in water reservoir and clog the machine. No way to unclog it then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Barely lasted six months of weekend use before it died--water and coffee backed up through the machine, and after that, we could not get the machine to work at all. Who wants to mess with boxing up a coffee maker, taking time away from work to go to the post office, and paying to ship it back to the manufacturer? Next coffee maker will not be a Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire hazard","review":"I purchased the 1200 model over a year ago and had no complaints until yesterday. I smelled smoke and my coffeemaker was red hot after being turned off for two hours. I unplugged it and it remained hot and smoldering for some time. Had I not been home, it could have been a house fire. I was not aware of all the incidents of fire with this product until know. Just Google Cuisinart fire hazard and see for yourself. I wish I had known before I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I have had 2 of these units in the last 4 years, the first one died after 2 years and was replaced under warranty with a new unit. The second unit died after 1 1/2 years. I called Cuisinart and they told me that because the warranty on the original unit was expired they could not replace the second unit (even though the units are warrantied for 3 years). I was offered a 20% discount if I wanted to BUY a new unit. For the cost of this unit it is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 7 months","review":"This is a wonderful coffeemaker if it would just not die! I was hesitant to purchase when I read some of the review about the problems. Yet I was also impressed with the positive comments. Anyway after seven months the heating element just stopped working. I called customer support at Cuisinart and then did the troubleshooting as directed. That did not help however they assured me with there 3 year warranty I could send it in and they would repair or replace. I guess I'll spend another fifteen bucks to ship it back. Just a shame that an expensive great looking coffee maker would work like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally- consistant HOT coffee","review":"I have several tried several coffee makers. I couldn'd find one that made consistant hot coffee or one that didn't leak down the carafe when I poured it! I finally found a GOOD coffee maker, and one that will keep warm for up to 4 hours! (usually they all shut off after 2 hours, which didn't work for us, especially on weekends)This one is great, and I love the fact that it gives a low tone beeping when it is done brewing and when it is going to shut off.It's not too loud, but enough so I can hear it and I don't have to keep checking to see when it has completed its cycle! Thanks Cuisinart fro combining all the best features of a coffee maker into one fantastic product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffeemaker!","review":"Finally a great coffemaker. Brews fast, keeps coffee hot, nice features, easy to clean. We got ours in all black to avoid fingerprints on the stainless product. Looks great and is a solid, sturdy machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"great at first, but then...","review":"I loved my Cuisinart coffee maker so much that over the next year I bought 2 more for other locations. The second one had the self cleaning light start blinking after the first pot of coffee was made and nothing could make it stop-the coffee seemed fine though. Four months after the original was purchased, it started having difficulty finishing the brew cycle...it produced, alot of steam and gurgling and only about 3/4's of the water I began with actually made it through the grinds. I tried cleaning it and it went downhill from this point. I thought that this was peculiar to this machine only, but alas, the same thing happened to the third machine. I'm now looking for a more reliable coffee maker.I own numerous Cuisinart products, but will not be buying another coffee maker from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffeemaker!","review":"When I started researching coffeemakers it became very frustrating because everyone had something bad to say about all of them. This coffeemaker seemed to have the least bad reviews about it. I was still a little worried about buying it with the comments about the beeping when the coffee was done is too loud and spilling the water when pouring it in and water spilling all over the counter because the pot was not in just the right spot. Well, let me tell you, none of those things are a problem!The beep signal is very low compared to my stove and microwave. I thought that was laughable! And any of those other complaints are not any problem. I really like this coffeemaker. It makes the coffee fast, is plenty hot enough and tastes great. I'm glad I bought it and spent the extra money for this product than to buy a cheap model. It's worth it, especially if you drink coffee every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Brushed metal\\" and stainless are NOT the same","review":"I was not smart enough to know that \\"brushed metal\\" was NOT the same as the stainless one that I was replacing. The maker works fine, but the 'brushed metal' looks very silvery almost plain gray metal. I was trying to save money and avoid paying Macy's that extra 15 bucks for actual stainless steel. Next time I will be wiser. If you need it to match your other stainless appliances, then you need to buy the more expensive stainless version. I would have returned it, but the fault was my own and I did not want to argue over ad text with a seller who delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice coffee maker","review":"I bought this for my in-laws to replace their old and outdated coffee maker. They are still using it 4 years later and seem to enjoy it. It works fairly simply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice coffeemaker, when it works. NOT BUILT TO LAST","review":"If this machine would stop breaking I would give it 5 stars. The timer is nice and it looks sharp. I have dinged/dropped the kettle (glass) several times and it hasn't cracked.BUT, within a year it stopped working - couldn't move the water anymore.We contacted cuisinart as it was still under warranty, and got a new one shipped. A bit of an inconvenience, but fair.After another year, then new machine must have had a computer melt down. You hit brew, and it doesn't do anything. No sound, nothing.When we bought this machine we believed that we would get what we paid for vs. cheaper machines with similar features. Beware, in the age where everything is made in similar overseas factories with similar parts. This machine isn't built to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good cup of coffee","review":"This coffee maker looks pretty decent and I thought a cuisinart would do the trick. But, the actual coffee really lacks flavor. I don't know if the water doesn't get hot enough of the pressure is not enough or what but, it really just tastes like a cup of coffee that you would get out of any $25.00 machine.

It worked great for a year. This morning, we noticed the coffee in the carafe was BOILING!

But be prepared that this is not a model that will last for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the coffee, design and control features","review":"After 3 weeks of use, we are very happy. First of all, the coffee is delicious. Second, when pouring water or coffee, there are no side spills or dripping. I love the style. The controls are easy to manage. The only thing that bugs me are the beeps. Five, when coffee is done. Two, when it shuts off. (My Cuisinart toater oven beeps too.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart - Wonderful Coffeemaker!","review":"I bought this item and have been using it for a little over a week now, and I love it. It is very sleek and looks great on my counter. The carafe has a fantastic design and does not drip/spill when I pour a cup of coffee, or from pouring water into the machine!

LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not the best part of waking up","review":"We purchased our Cuisinart Brew Central last month and haven't had a decent cup of coffee yet. We have experimented with the water to coffee ratio, buy excellent beans,grind the moment before we brew and the coffee still has no rich coffee flavor. We have used the paper filters, the gold filter, both together thinking it might help and have used the 1-4 cup setting, which is for brewing smaller cups of coffee and provides 'double' heating' ( thinking that the water may not be getting hot enough) but none of these has altered the mediocrity of the finised pot. The coffee simply isn't flavorful. If we increase the amount of coffee, it simply becomes bitter.The carafe is difficult to remove from and replace onto the heating plate, but this is something we would consider insignificant if the coffee were excellent.It has been a disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT COFFEE","review":"Coffee is good and hot. I like the features; 1-4 cup setting, adjustable temperature control for the carafe and auto-off feature.Coffemaker is contemporary and fits well with kitchen decor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent pot, one drawback","review":"I bought this pot because it was rated #1 by the leading consumer testing organization. Very happy with it. Just wish it had an external fill level indicator as did my old Mr Coffee. With that addition it would be perfect. We fill ours with the sink sprayer, and its difficult to see into the fill tank to see level you're at.Update Aug 11, 2010 Coffeemaker died already. Will not brew and hotplate does not heat. 3 yr warranty, but what good is that if you have to pay shipping both ways and wait weeks for a replacement. Would not recommend due to poor quality/reliability.

Unfortunately today it nearly caught on fire. The hotplate become red hot and the coffee maker began to spark and smoke. Thankfully my wife was in the kitchen and was able to unplug it before it caught fire! I have since read other reviewers having the same issue. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad outcome","review":"I have had this model coffee maker for 5 years now. I have liked it, used it, cleaned it regularly, ...Last year, within the warranty period, it just quit working, no power. This is an apparent common issue as they had all kinds of \\"try this\\" hints before they would take it back. Finally, they replaced it, with me paying shipping etc. plus a $10 handling fee.I presume the unit they sent back was a refurbished one, and 1 year to the day it dies.And no, they will NOT honor the warranty of the replacement unit. So I will be replacing my coffee maker but I guarantee it will NOT be with a Cuisinart product of any kind, ever again.Any company that cannot honor the quality of their products, even replacement products, does not deserve my money. And I should know - I am a Quality manager!Never again for Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy - will return this","review":"This is the first review that I have written. This coffee maker has several faults. 1. the caraf lid is a terrible design 2. coffee leaks out on to the heat plate when removing the caraf partway through brewing (this is variable and I can't figure that out) 3. the controls are not user friendly.For the money I think this is not worth it.

I liked the first one so well that when it finally wore out I bought another. The quality level is definitely different with this more recent buy (about 6 months ago). Both units leaked from the reservoir. That hasn't changed. But unlike my first one, this one died after just 6 months. The heating element (that boils the water) just stopped working all of a sudden. The red light is on so there is power to it, but nothing happens. Very bummed. For this reason, I don't have a lot of loyalty any more to this brand. The quality is definitely not as good as in years past. I'm going with a different brand for my replacement. Maybe Krups this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Coffee Maker","review":"There were two things that drew me to this coffee maker. One is the brand name of Cuisinart.

However, after 3 months of cleaning out the machine and the puddles and grounds in our coffee, I give up! The grinds do not get completely ground. There is a problem with the grounds backing up back into the grinding container, creating a wet mess in there and generally clogging. The water seems to come out to fast for the coffee to brew and that backs into the grinder well also. The coffee itself has been weak, an sometimes has grounds in it.

Do not buy this product of you want a quiet appliance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tasting and hot coffee, but messy coffeemaker to deal with","review":"The pros for this coffeemaker are that programming is intuitive and simple, I never have to pull out the instructions to reset when we have power outages or fluctuations, and it makes good tasting and hot coffee. It is well made and durable. What I really do not like about it is that water and coffee drip everywhere. After brewing there is an accumulation of condensation on the underside of the lid on the top of the coffeemaker that runs down the outside of the back of the coffeemaker whenever you open the lid. The carafe drips coffee down the front under the spout so I always have to fill my coffee cup over the sink and then wipe down the side of the carafe before returning the carafe to the hotplate.

A final price of $23.00??A plain old brain stem could make that decision!I did note that one reviewer complained about being left handed (I do write with my left hand)and the fact that the water reservoir was on the right. Well I figured out a way to deal with that: I used my right hand to pour the water in.It reminded me of the day I went to the deli and asked for some potato salad that was near a side wall in the display. The clerk was having trouble spooning it out and looked up at me, sheepishly, saying she was right handed. I said to her \\"Put the spoon in your other hand\\"She did so, easily spooned out the order, and said \\"Wow.....I never thought to do that\\".<sigh>Anyway..........This is great coffee maker and would have been worth the $70.

The instruction manual states to flush it before using for the first time. So I brewed it without coffee. The problem is that only about half of carafe was filled. The rest of the water remained in the coffee maker. I emptied the coffee maker manually and did it again. This time I used the filter and coffee. I used water for 10 cups. Only about 1/3 of the water came out. The rest was inside the machine on top of the filter and in the reservoir.What am I doing wrong???Mike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I've always used the cheap Coffee Mate brewers in the past so this easily exceeded my expectations.

The brew it produces is pretty good (not as good as the Braun that burned out on me), but I'm not sure it was designed for use by humans.Let's see... we can make the lid lift up instead of a swing out basket design because nobody would ever place this unit under a cabinet. Ooh, and I bet we could make the water intake really, really small so that folks stumbling in wee hours can make a mess on the counter. And, how about the lid on the carafe, well.... couldn't we have a lid that snaps on super tight? .. we can really get under people's skin with that one.Making a pot of coffee shouldn't be a chore. The engineers at Cuisinart need to get a clue, not a bonus, for such a poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee but terrible design for filling water - Returned to Amazon","review":"I bought this as a replacement for a Braun 10 cup as the Cuisinart is larger with 12 cups. Makes good coffee, but the design is terrible for filling it with water. The opening for water is on top and shares the same opening as the coffee filter. The opening for the water reservoir is very small and it is hard to empty the carafe completely. Also you need two hands to remove the lid for the carafe. It isn't a hinged carafe lid like most others; it is securely snapped on and must be removed with your free hand to add water. So when we make coffee EVERYDAY it is a pain to open the carafe, then a tedious job to pour the water into the reservoir. Also, the design makes it too easy to spill water into the fresh grounds (not good if you make coffee the night before) because it is the same opening.

Other than that, I'm very happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good machine with a fatal design flaw","review":"I've had three of these in my b&b and they have worked fine producing 1-3 pots a day until they don't work. Each time, the machine has overflowed, sending grounds into the water reservoir and clogging the water intake tube. This happens if the filter basket is not seated JUST SO and thus the valve doesn't open. Employees who are not attuned to this idiosyncrasy eventually get it a millimeter off and the machine shuts down. Usually, the problem cannot be fixed. I've tried high pressure air and water with no luck in unclogging the line. At the moment, I have three dead coffee makers and am looking for a new brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"I love this coffeemaker!!!! I have had a lot of coffeemakers but never one like this!!! I smile every morning making coffee. Thanks Cuisinart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid...(If you want hot coffee)","review":"This coffee maker is average. I would even say it is slightly below average at that. The coffee it brews is lukewarm (even when I used the 1-4 cup setting which supposedly double heats the water). If you want hot coffee, I would advise you get the Bunn machines. I ended up getting a Bunn (which was cheaper) and it is so much better then this. The build quality is below average as well. I was kind of shocked that I had to return this item considering how many positive reviews it received. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step up from Mr. Coffee","review":"I bought this coffee pot a few weeks ago to replace an old Mr. Coffee machine that died on me. This machine is much sturdier and seems to just perform better than the last coffee maker. I like the temperature option for the pot. It keeps the coffee nice and hot. I also enjoy how I can pull the pot out in the middle of the brew cycle and the coffee doesn't drip all over the hot plate. This was a problem with my last coffee pot that just drove me nuts.The only down side I see with this machine is that the reservoir is hard to get to and to see how much water I'm pouring in. I've made a couple pots that were more than I intended because I couldn't see how much water I was putting in. Other than that, I do enjoy this coffee pot and look forward to using it for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"brewer","review":"Coffeemaker works rapidly and well.

Very disappointed and won't buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Coffee Maker...Caught fire","review":"We bought this coffeemaker after reading several reviews and a recommendation from a friend. A few months after we bought it, our friend emailed us to warn us that her coffeemaker had caught fire. One morning after it finishing brewing, the coffee maker made a loud popping sound. Luckily our friend had forewarned us about her experience and we were actually in the kitchen when the appliance started smoking. Already aware of what was happening, we quickly unplugged it and brought it outside. Clearly if we had not been in the kitchen at the time, we could have had extensive damage from a fire. The smell of burning plastic lingered for several hours.DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEEMAKER. After searching the internet, there were several reviewers that had the same experience. We can't understand why this coffeemaker has not been recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned up","review":"After only 9 months of use, my Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffee pot burned itself up. Walked into kitchen for my second cup of coffee and found it smoking from all around bottom and the smell of an electrical fire. Checked out Consumer reports website to find same complaints posted at least 10 times every month. Cuisinart will not respond to my phone calls and questions about the problem. I will never buy another Cuisinart product because of the customer service alone. Plus I do not want another fire hazard in my house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fire hazard!","review":"I got this coffee pot in May, 2010 so I have had it for less than 18 months. I had been using it almost every day without incident. On October 15, 2011, I set it up as usual to brew about 3 cups of coffee. About halfway through the brewing, it started making strange noises and smoking. I tried to turn it off with the switch, but it wouldn't turn off so I unplugged it. If I hadn't been in the kitchen to watch it, there probably would have been a fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 14 months","review":"Faulty product--save your $$$. Owned the DCC-1200 for 14 months, cleaned it regularly, and yesterday it simply stopped brewing. A short search on the web revealed that many other customers have had the same (or worse) problems. Stay Away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad investment","review":"I drink a lot of coffee and I've owned a lot of coffee makers over my 64 years. None has lasted as short a period of time as this one, about a year and 2 months.That was also my experience, unfortunately, with Cuisinart's entry into the single cup brewer market. That $200 investment lasted slightly less than a year.Both machines were, in my opinion, as attractive as any on the market. And while they worked, they worked well.But they are VERY short lived. I may someday buy another Cuisinart product, but that is not likely. And, if I ever do, it certainly will NOT be a coffee maker.This coffee maker died without warning this morning. Luckily I still had my old, not quite so good looking but very dependable Krups on hand. After its 14-month exile, it worked perfectly and without complaint when I put it back into service in place of the useless Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"great if you only need it for 6 months","review":"I bought this coffee maker six months ago, worked great made a good cup of coffee and fairly quick brew time. two days ago it just quit working will not brew or heat. I called customer support the first thing they said was \\" have you descaled it\\" it has an indicator light that never came on. anyway that was not the problem. I have two options mail it back to Arizona and pay shipping plus ten dollars to replace the machine which cost 80. or buy a 20 dollar mr coffee that will last 10 years. Which I would have to do while the broken one is out getting fixed.I now have an 80 dollar flower pot with buttons and its own water tank.I would not recommend buying this product what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great When It Works","review":"I love the design and functionality of this coffeemaker. However, I've had 3 of them and each one failed after less than 2 years. It's some flaw in the heating element. I do know that reliability seems to be a problem with many coffeemakers and problems are not exclusive to this one. But for the price, I'd rather go with cheap if I'm going to end up replacing it every 12-18 months anyway. I don't use the clock/timer function and there are other features on this machine that I don't use or need.If you don't mind spending $80+ and taking the chance, go ahead. You will love this one while it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to work even one year","review":"This sleek looking machine was such a temptation to purchase...so I did. However, after only a few months, it failed to draw water up the machine. It was a horrible dissappointment since we paid 70.00 for it at Costco. We even used bottled water.We then thought to purchase the even nicer looking Cuisinart product that stores the brewed coffee in it's sleek stainless tank not a pot - alas it was a piece of junk too! 4 months and it was doing the same thing as the other.It's back to the old Mr. Coffee for our home. It doesn't look so good - but it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this coffee pot!","review":"I've been doing lots of research on coffee pots and decided on this one. The price was good and it has all the features I like. My favorite feature is the warmth setting. It really keeps the coffee hot for a long time. Also, when there's a power outage the settings on the coffee pot are not lost. The clock is not messed up and if you have it set on the timer, everything is saved. It's also very attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot recommend this product","review":"Have had this coffee pot in my office for 5 months now, and I regret the purchase. First off, it has a few annoying features -- small area for pouring in water (requiring careful aim); no visible water measure on the side or front of the machine (only a \\"stepped\\" measure in the water reservoir itself that is difficult to read precisely); several non-removable parts around the coffee filter area that are difficult to clean. It also can handle only so much ground coffee in the filter -- to make a full pot at the strength I like means that I end up with a lot of grounds in the coffee. Then we started getted performance issues. It's supposed to stop dripping when you remove the carafe mid-brew, but that stopped working almost immediately. And now the brewing process has slowed down to the point where it takes 15 minutes to brew not even a full pot. I wish I had returned this early on when I had the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart 1200","review":"Arrived in a very timely manner and works just as I anticipated. It is very easy to use and is a very nice looking coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"It left dry coffee in the the filter!","review":"I based my purchase of this coffee maker on Consumer Reports' top rating. I had decent luck using the handy 1-4 cup setting for small batches. After a weak 12-cup batch, I decided to double the amount of ground coffee per cup, as per the coffee manufacturer's suggestion. I didn't use the 1-4 cup option since I was actually making six cups. The coffee again turned out weak. I was about to toss the grounds when I discovered that about 20-30% of them were untouched by water during the brewing process. No wonder it turned out weak. If results don't improve in the next few pots, this thing is going back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee taste but unreliable","review":"We used this coffeemaker satisfactorily for six months and it went dead.

The features make the couple of inconveniences bearable.I appreciate the beeps that alert me when the coffee is ready. The variable temperature settings are great. It lets me know when it is time to clean it. It also has the 1-4 cup button for a slower brew for lesser quantities.The setbacks include:The lid condensation spills off the back onto the countertop when opened. I try to open slowly to allow as much to slide back into the reservoir.The reservoir is smaller than other coffemakers and I need to take my time filling it. The measure marks are inside the unit and hard to see but I use the carafe to measure the water anyway.Regardless of these, I am very happy with this coffeemaker!P.S. My carafe does not drip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still loving it 1-year later","review":"I've owned this model 1-year and ready to give my 2 cents. LOVE IT and BUY IT! There are two flaws but here's how you work though it:1. It's true, the water level marker inside the tank is useless. It's really not a big deal to simply fill the carafe yourself and pour it in. I don't understand why reviewers are bothered by this. Primadonnas I guess.2. To avoid water dripping onto the coffee grounds when pre-loading for the next morning, just leave the carafe lid off when pouring water into the tank. This avoids the SLIGHT collision between the tank lid and carafe lid. Again, not a big deal since the lid is already off for filling.I purchased the all black model and glad I did. It still looks like it came out of the box. I will certainly re-purchase this product when the time comes, and I'm a pretty tough reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Sending it back for the 2nd time.

The price was a little higher than I had intended to pay but based on the reviews I purchased the coffee maker. I am pleased with the design and function. The carafe pours well (no spillage issues) and the coffee is hot and remains so after brewing. There is a temprature control so you can set how warm/hot you want the coffee. There is a programmable 'auto off' feature so you set the time you want the coffee maker to shut off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner","review":"After a month's use, we think this machine is terrific! The controls are accessible and easy to operate, programming is simple, and it's a snap to shift from program to brew mode when you're up early.

We are coffee snobs and wanted a machine that would brew coffee at a hot enough temperature to release the flavor of the beans, while not requiring me waking up early to get a pot brewing before I get ready in the morning (auto- brew is amazing). This machine meets every requirement and goes beyond. We have a separate burr grinder and it completes the set.

Be sure to register your purchase on line or use the card with the product....easy for them to check your model and when and where it was purchased!

For years I'd been baffled by the fact that, although I enjoyed coffee whenever I went out to eat, I never enjoyed it in my own home. I tried various brands of coffee and went through several low-end coffee makers before I finally decided to stop being cheap and just shell out for the excellently reviewed DCC-1200. I'm very glad I did. I've had it for just over a year now and it's been brewing phenomenal coffee since the day I plugged it in. I haven't even replaced the charcoal water filter (which I know I should have, and promise I'm about to!) and it's still brewing great coffee. I also own a french press, and while that device does outshine the DCC-1200 it doesn't win by much, and this coffee maker definitely wins the convenience battle.

Well fast forward 13 months and after approximately 200 brew cycles in that time, this one bit the dust. Very disappointed even though it has a 3 year warranty due to the catch of having to ship it to the manufacture on your dime and also include $10 for return shipping after it is repaired.

I like the control features and the clean functional design, the layout of the buttons. Three minor issues: I would prefer a hinged carafe lid that would pivot up with a thumb-press that would make filling the carafe with water easier; a water-level indicator on the outside. Like all the other brands that I am familiar with, a very small amount of condensed water on the inside surface of the lid trickles down to the countertop when the lid is tilted up to remove the used grounds. All coffeemakers need a small cupped area at the hinge to direct water back into the water reservoir.

Additionally, the warranty address in the manual was not even correct! I asked the customer service rep. to kindly email me the information as a sort of \\"repair ticket\\" as she said \\"we don't do that\\". Don't get sucked into the 3-year warranty because if you do return the item for warranty work, there is a possibility that the work will be not covered and you are out time, money and patience.

That time it was the power cord.I liked the taste of the coffee brewed with the machine so much that I decided the malfunction was a fluke and purchased another one about 8 months ago.This morning after brewing a second pot, there was smoke pouring out of the bottom of the unit! Thankfully I was in the room and immediatly pulled the plug and took it outside.I initiated a return/exchange with the company today which was very reasonable ($10 fee for shipping the new one) and I've since decided it's not worth the risk of a fire.Cusinart, you really need to fix this issue!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the first few months... would not purchase again","review":"Purchased this coffeemaker at the end of March and now in December it will not brew coffee.

Worked fine, until it didn't. Now conveniently (for Cuisinart) outside of the limited 3 year warranty, the coffee maker just plain stopped working two days ago. I called Cuisinart customer service and they gave me some troubleshooting options (run half water, half vinegar through, etc., etc.), none of which worked because the darn machine wouldn't even turn on. I called again today and basically got the brush-off. I'm outside the warranty-there's nothing they can do. I'll be taking my business to another, more reliable brand from now on. In my humble opinion, coffee makers should last more than 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHODDY, MADE-IN-CHINA COFFEEMAKER","review":"I starting using my Cusinart DC-1200 in March 2011.

I shouldn't have to turn a dial AND flick a switch in order to turn on an appliance.The carafe fits so snugly in the coffeemaker it's hard to take out and put back in. The lid on the carafe isn't hinged, which makes filling with water easy, but removable, and reattaching the lid to the carafe is very awkward.When you lift the square lid to load the coffee, condensation drips down the back of the coffeemaker. Condensation also forms in the filter area, requiring that you either dry it before installing the paper filter or suffer a moist filter. The interior construction, with a small side reservoir, makes it difficult to both fill with water and to see the water level.This is an appliance I fill every night and use every morning, which means that I will continue to be aggravated every day until I replace this highly imperfect Cuisinart misfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks Water","review":"I am extremely happy with the looks and the quality of coffee it makes.

Like many Cuisinart products, it's pretty badly underdesigned. The water load is very narrow and back right--tough for lefties and easy to spill over even for righties. The parts are expensive--especially that charcoal filter you have to replace every 2 months. Don't try brewing without it--even with the filter in place, ONE piece of coffee grounds in the heating plenum below the water tank and you might as well throw it all away. The assembly is done with rivets instead of screws so there is no way to get at the lower plenum to clean it properly--again, fairly typical Cuisinart planned obsolesence design. It's a French hunk of junk if you ask me. My $20 Mr Coffee brewed great coffee for almost 10 years before it died. I'll not buy Cuisinart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Purchased this product a year ago. It's now broken for the 2nd time. It easily gets clogged (even when cleaned) and it's a nightmare to unclog the minute grounds. Also, I agree with other reviewers regarding the ridiculous extra care needed when pouring in water.

It went dead suddenly and completely. All the lights work, but no heat. It was an ok unit for the time it worked. The clock is LCD which made it hard to read, LED would be a big improvement. All the lettering on the front is kind of small. The water fill was awkward and messy.

Useless except for the carafe.Last November, I buy another, thinking the first was a fluke--an outlier. For ten months I keep this thing in impeccable shape, cleaning it regularly for fear the last one was my fault. Nope! This week I realize the product simply cannot stand up to a reasonable amount of use. I get the same problem, the water you put in simply will not cycle through. Again, useless. Any attempt to take the thing apart at the in take results in breaking the plastic connections. $60 and now $80 is just way too much for this, what amounts to a very cheap product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best coffee pot I've ever had....","review":"I ordered 2 of these after my son had ordered one.

It is a great deal at half price and free super saver shipping. I have been using mine for 2 weeks now and continue to be impressed.

What else are you looking for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"CLOGS and LEAKS: terrible design","review":"I'm amazed at all the good reviews for this product. It looks great, and the settings are fun. But.Two really annoying design flaws:1) A lot of coffee grounds circulate throughout the mechanism after each brew, so after several uses it begins to clog and make coffee very slowly, finally clogging altogether. So every week or two you have to do a system clean with vinegar or you won't get your coffee brewed at all.2) It leaks water out the bottom of the mechanism as it brews. I kept wondering why my counter was wet every morning and finally realized water was welling under the thing every time it brewed and spreading over the counter.Unless you enjoy maintaining your stupid coffee maker on a regular basis and cleaning up puddles after every use, avoid the Cuisinart, it's a lemon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't wait on your coffee; have your coffee wait on you!","review":"Have your coffee waiting when you arrive in the kitchen, with just a little advanced planning on your part.Fill your machine with freshly ground coffee and water, then set the unit to auto brew, then plan on good hotcoffee when you emerge from your slumber.

What I like most, you can pour coffee as fast as you want and it will not leak down the side of the pot.

Two things I would change - you cannot tell how much water you are pouring in when you look into the coffeemaker...it is dark and the numbers are pretty much useless. You have to go by the carafe to measure water. I wish I could see the cup marks better on the coffee maker. Second, I wish you could turn off the beeps as an option for when coffee is done. Other than that I am very happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gosh I wish Braun still made a 12 cup!","review":"Lived w/ the Cuisinart for about 6 mos now and yes, it makes a good cup of coffee but the ergonomics could not be much worse.Basket is a bear to retrieve, unit has to be pulled out from the wall about 6 inches to access and make coffee. Water target is very small and carafe leaks all over the place if you try to pour too fast (cover on or off). Cover does not seat well on carafe. Tedious and frustrating every time I make coffee.We had a Braun 12 cup for about 6 years and it had none of these issues. I just love when companies un-invent what worked and what was Braun thinking when they discontinued the 12 cup? Not much to choose from here so for coffee quality, this one gets the two stars but everything else is about a zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker, Free shipping ....Long wait!","review":"I have friends who own this coffee maker so decided to buy one because I know that it has all the features I want and makes great coffee.

My only gripe is that the unit's \\"lid\\" is slightly flimsy and lacks the precision of $60-$80+ coffee makers.

This one is almost perfect... except that there is no outside clear water-fill gauge, the kind that is on almost every coffee maker. Without it I have to either precisely measure the water in the carafe (which I am not used to doing), or strain to look down into the thing to see the water level markers. Neither is convenient. But, the coffee tastes great and I especially like the 1-4 cup feature for when I am making coffee just for myself. I used to have to keep a small coffee maker around just for that purpose because making a small amount in a big pot usually doesn't come out right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best tasting coffee I have had","review":"I am completely satisfied with my purchase of this product. At first I had a problem with the filters rolling over in the basket, but once I learned how to fold them across the seams and carefully insert them I have had no problem.

I would recommend this coffee maker to anyone who enjoys a good cup of coffee at a reasonable cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best, forget the rest","review":"I purchased this to replace our 12 year old Krups Aromamaster.

I am searching online reviews to replace it. My 7 years old Krups Krystal Arome still seems to work better. Oh yeah, if you are brewing 4 cups or less, be sure to tamp down the grinds or it will not brew properly at all, kinda splatters the grinds around and coffee turns out weak (even using the small batch selector feature!!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, Average, Defective!","review":"I had my DC-1200BW for about 4 months before it stopped operating.

There isn't anything user servicable inside of the unit so I'm pretty much stuck with it.The coffee quality was alright. I was not blown away when it was working, and the carbon filter thing really didn't make any taste difference. My traditional french press definitely made superior coffee.

It brews quickly and has a large array of options from burner temperature, varied shut off times, and more. The one thing I wish was different, was the water reservoir - it is difficult to see down inside where the water level is on the \\"step\\" level.

I called Cuisinart and they told me that there is another model of the DCC-1200 with a button and that the toggle-switch model is only available through club stores, but the toggle-switch version is the model Amazon has on its web site.

The opening to add water is to small so you better have good aim or a paper towel in hand for the clean up. 3. The clock display is small and you must bend over to read it. 4.

It averages making 3 pots a day and has performed well. It has an on board filter system, for those who have less than perfect tap water, the filters are inexpensive and easy to get from Cuisinart. The timer feature is a plus, we are very early riser's and our coffee is ready to go when we get up. The \\"window\\" showing the time is very small and hard to read, but that is a minor point. Being able to vary it's auto shut off time is nice and it has a temp selector for how hot you want the coffee to be maintained.All in all very happy with this coffee maker, and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design, super brew","review":"I've had this one over 18 months and it's still going strong. All the electronics function, the capacity is great, the mechanicals are very sturdy. At least a pot a day is brewed in this stainless-clad baby, and it shows no sign of wearing down.Might be a bit awkward to fill the whole reservoir ( you need a nimble wrist to pour at the corect angle), but that's an acceptable price for such a great device. Go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Cuisinart DCC-1200","review":"I recently purchased this Coffee Maker to replace another major name brand German coffee maker system that I had been using for the last 10 years. I have been pleased with the performance so far. I find the coffee is brewed well and the machine is quiet in comparison to my previous machine. The quality of the components are excellent and I like the retro style and brushed stainless steel look. The printing on the face of the machine is small; however all I need is the simple switch and the on-off light anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable, easy to clean, maintain, and use. Great coffee too","review":"Couldn't be more happier with this machine. Ever since krups gave up on their functional design and started focusing on the look of the product instead of the workings, i've been looking for something to replace my trusted old krups machine. You need to make sure the pot is seated well on the warmer and under the coffee basket. This is easy to do as you can feel it click into place, but a sleepy user may not be paying close enough attention. I've had this Cuisinart for about a year and a half and it has worked flawlessly with the minor exception above. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After buying cheaper coffeemakers over the years that never lasted very long, I decided to try this one from Cuisinart. It worked great for a while but within a year it quit working. I was extremely disappointed because I really loved it. It brewed great coffee, you can set it to shut off at 2 or 4 hours, and set the temp of the plate that the carafe sets on. It's very attractive but didn't last any longer then the cheaper coffeemakers I've bought in the past. Now I'm searching for a new coffeemaker but won't buy another one like this. I really thought I had found a keeper but didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"This coffee maker lasted 10 mos. It died with no warning.

Stay away from the Cuisinart!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee, but a bit too hot","review":"I've had two of these units, and they really do make great coffee. Seeing the water level inside the reservoir is challenging, but aside from that, it's a great system.Except when it sets on fire.That may be a little dramatic. Rather, both units suffered an electrical malfunction, a release of smoke from the wires; in short, a short. Because I value my home, I won't give this otherwise very good coffee maker a third chance. I think I'll give Zojirushi a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart coffee maker","review":"We received this as a house warming present. I loved the stylish look and stainless steel.

I love the option of 1-4 cups. For my weeday mornings this is perfect for me. Clean up is easy to. I love the look of the black chrome. It does not leave finger prints. I seem to have more room with this coffee maker than others. It is a square base design where all my others have been rounded. The only complaint I have about this...when you open the top the condensation runs down the back of the coffee maker instead of into the water reserve. I don't think it's enough to do any damange but still, you have to wipe your counter off so you don't have a little pool of water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this model!","review":"We bought this model based on the Consumers Report recommendation. We have owned it for 12 months 11 days and have had 8 months of problems. It steams the water quickly but it never makes it to the grounds. It constantly says Calc or the Self-Clean light blinks... we follow the instructions to the letter and the lights go out, the Calc stops showing and it doesnt work well. Then out of the clear it will work for 1-3 weeks beofre it starts the cycle all over agian. Then it works again without us doing anything!We just bought a Mr. Coffee for 1/3 the price. If this one stops working, well we can buy 2 more before we hit the cost of the Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead at only 1.5 years","review":"When I bought this in 2010, I figured I would buy a quality machine we could have for the next 10 years or so. It made great coffee and had nice features, but obviously not made to the high quality the price would indicate.In the past few weeks, the machine has been shutting down well before the autoshutdown time should have been. This morning it started giving off that awful burnt electronics smell and it appears the machine is now dead. I don't think 1.5 years is an acceptable time frame for a machine of this cost.

This pot lasted about 2 years, which I thought was acceptable since we always have a pot of coffee going at our house. When it finally died, I bought another one, but after about 7 months, the hot plate burned out. I contacted Cuisinart Customer Service and they sent me a new pot under the warranty. Now after about 7 months again, the replacement pot is not working properly. It shuts itself off mysteriously anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours later. Sometimes it doesn't even finish the brew cycle before it shuts itself off.I contacted customer service but they said they can only do a warranty replacement one time. She suggested that I unplug the pot for 5 minutes to see if the timer would reset. I did this and now it's worse than ever. I'm now on a search for a more reliable coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited warmer time - not for all-day coffee drinkers","review":"This product may make great coffee but the auto shutoff feature limits the warmer to 4 hours of operation per brew, making it useless for all-day coffee drinkers.

It makes a great pot of coffee. My opinion it different than some other reviewers in some areas. Pouring water into the compartment in easy even in the morning. The timer is a piece of cake. I also like the ease of measuring for a partial pot. The coffee is plenty hot, even too hot to hold the ceramic mug I use. I have used just the gold filter and additional paper filters both ways work equally well. The only difference is the extra cleaning when not using the paper filter. One other thing in regards to other reviews, I have NO steam or anything coming from the lid or in front of the timer. I have no idea what these people are talking about. Lastly, my only complaint is the condensation buildup underneath the lid. It does drip behind the unit when the lid is opened. Not a big deal and certainly not a deterent from a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Has Gone Downhill!","review":"We've had 3 of these coffeemakers. The first one lasted 5-6 years.

So my review is not about it's performance. That we can contest to is tremendious! My concern is that the newest finish is not real brushed metal. It is plastic made to attempt the look of brushed metal. We have an older version of this and it was as it described. It is no longer the case. Beware of the finish.The \\"Black Crome\\" may be a better choice as it is not attempting to be what it is not. We had this unit prior to this one and I wish that I had purchased this one again. That assumes that finish has not changed for the favor of improved profits as I am certain was the motivation. Don't get me wrong, all in favor of profits! Just not misrepresentation.

I owned a similar Cuisinart coffeemaker before (a DCC-1150) that also failed after a year, or so, but I hoped it was an exception. In that case I did a postmortem and found that the circuit board was poorly designed and much more poorly constructed... the sort of soldering that might expect from middle-school students.

I decided to just get a neww coffee maker and buy a grinder(kitchen aide) which I am very happy with. The coffee pot is another story. I read the reviews and decided to get it even though there were some flaws. It is difficult to put water in without getting water all over the counter. When the lid is opened again water gets all over the counter. the coffee pot does not slide in evenly so care must be taken. Just alot of design flaws. I just visited Lowe's and looked at coffee pots. I was amazed at how well engineered some coffe pots are and priced about the same as the dcc-1200. Wish I would have waited and gone to Lowe's first.

The controls are nicely laid out, brews a consistently good pot of coffee and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. In the past I had gone with the thermal carafe but this time I went with the hot plate and what's nice is it has 3 temperature settings so if you can turn it to low to keep the pot hot if you know it's going to sit a while and not cook the coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I bought this coffee maker recently to replace an aging Cuissinart.

Don't recommend Cuisinart anymore. Also had two Cuisinart coffee grinders and they both malfunctioned and returned to the store.

Also a nice feature, which this is missing, is a water gauge on the outside of the coffeemaker. With this unit, you have to peer in over the top of the machine to look at an internal gauge to check the water level. But still would definitely recommend it and plan to keep it.

You must lift the large cover to add coffee and water so it has to be moved if under or close to a cabinet. Adding water is slightly cumbersome as it's a narrow opening in the rear of the unit.

The clock gets a little off when power fluxes (happened twice in 3 weeks). If the timer doesn't go off in the morning when that happens, my coffee maybe 2 minutes late since I've got to hit the switch manually, so no a big deal so I'm not sure why everyone is complaining and rating 1-2 stars for it (unless you want the full pot to put in thermis maybe right away, then I understand.)The biggest issue is the water hole is a little small and hard to hit sometime and so water sometimes go down into the bin and sometimes around the burner.

We have never been able to get one to last more than about a year. All of the great reviews for this product notwithstanding, this one too gave up the ghost in months.

The company sucks and was not helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing after all the hype","review":"After our Braun FlavorSelect, which is not made anymore, died -- sniff -- my husband and I searched for a new coffee maker. This Cuisinart had good reviews overall and was a good price. I could not, however, get the thing to make a good cup of coffee. I tried adjusting the amount of coffee and the fineness of the grind to no avail. The coffee simply had no flavor. It was like, as the French say, \\"sock water.\\" So we returned it and bought an expensive TechniVorm Moccamaster. It is handmade in Europe and man it makes a good cup. I think it is worth the price if you can stomach spending $300 on a machine. Perhaps the Cuisinart didn't have enough wattage to get the water hot enough; perhaps the brew cycle was too long. I don't know. I also found the machine to be rather unwieldy and not well-designed (water reservoir was hard to fill, no external level indicator, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable","review":"This coffee maker has all of the features of the rest but one thing stands out.

It stopped pumping and heating the water though the light will still turn on as if nothing is wrong. I tried using the self clean mechanism which also didn't work. My problem seems to reflect many others who also gave it 1 star. I expected more from this unit for the price. It is waste to have many of these units break after a couple of years - typical problem of American products made cheaply. This is makes two out of two cuisinart purchases break in short amount of time. The smartstick/food processor broke within a few uses, spent $10-20 to replace it only for it to break again. I will not be buying cuisinart products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm buying Another","review":"I have owned this model coffee maker for at least 8 years, and it has come along through several moves.

I need good coffee or I do not function properly. I can't wait! I hope something even better comes out of Cuisinart within that time, though, but I doubt coffee makers are like cell phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect but no battery!","review":"This coffee maker is the bomb! It does everything you could want out of a drip coffee maker. The filtering ensures great taste. The temperature settings allow you to ensure it is to ready right away. The programming and even the small pot settings ensure you have the most perfect cup of coffee when you need it. However, if you happen to have a power outage...well then you are waking up to a pot of coffee that did not get brewed. Why in the world did they not think to put a battery in this thing? You know like every alarm clock on the planet.

Cuisinart could have built this crappier but they didn't.It is very easy to use and clean and has all the features that you really need to make coffee at home on a daily basis.

While the coffeemaker makes good coffee, the design is significantly flawed. The coffee basket and the water tank are adjacent to each other with no separation. As water drips into the coffee basket, it splatters sending coffee grounds into the water. After a few weeks, the water tank has a coating coffee grounds as is the charcoal water filter. As a result every couple of weeks, I hold it upside down over the sink spraying it to rinse out the water tank. I use a bottle brush, too. This gets most of the mess, but not all.Another problem with the design is that LCD display is not lit, making it difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real workhorse!!","review":"we have this unit at our office and it is an extremely reliable unit Coffee is consistently good, requires minimal maintenance, and simply never breaks down. notnfancy, but it works all the time, every time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffeemaker lives up to all promises","review":"Good coffeemaker.

It has a filter that I never could find a replacement for, and I spent alot of time looking.Then came the disaster--it's been out of warranty approximately 1 month (go figure) and this morning, it caught on fire!

It is awkward to pour the water into it's tank, unless you are a tall person (over 6ft.) or using a stepping stool.3. If you don't have a steady hand, you are sure to spill the water all over the coffee grinds and the filter.4. The coffee maker's clock is hard to read. It is recessed and does not light up.

On February 8, 2010, the carafe leaked out its full brew of coffee. On examination I saw hairline cracks on the glass below the (I suppose) decorative metal band at the bottom of the glass carafe. I wrote Cuisinart customer service an email explaining the difficulty, but did not recieve a reply. This morning, February 12, I phoned and was told the warranty does not cover glass, so the carafe is not part of the warranty. It would not have occurred to me that any part of the product would be excluded from the warranty. Of course, I was told they would be happy to sell me a replacement. Imagine my gratitude! Cuisinart is now a brand I will avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoying the coffee","review":"We've had this about two months now. Cleaned it once. The coffee tastes great and it takes only a short time to brew. The only hitch is that the place to pur the water in is a bit small, it's in the back right of the unit, so care is needed when pouring in water to avoid a mess. That's a bit of a Catch-22 in that I haven't had my coffee yet when I'm first making the coffee. It's okay, I have a couple dish towels handy. So far I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a quality coffee maker. It came with a 3 yr warranty and that was also a factor in purchasing it. Only Bunn had a similar warranty period. I recently saw this very coffee maker very prominently displayed in the kitchen of the Police Commissioner's home in a Blue Bloods episode.

All of them have been disastrous: recalled, cracked or high maintenance, like this one, which has flooded the kitchen, ruined wooden furniture, and taken up more time than my family. This coffee pot needs cleaning more often than I make coffee; it blocks, floods and refuses to function, so the water evaporates in steam and the coffee is way too strong.

However, I'm taking this unit back to the store tomorrow for a refund because, as another reviewer has stated here, this coffee maker does not make the coffee quite hot enough. At first I noticed the 3-way warming switch was factory-set on \\"medium\\", so I thought no problem, I'll just switch it to \\"hot\\" setting and that'll take care of the less-than-restaurant-temperature hot. No, I couldn't tell much difference. So, then I tried using the 1-4 cup button that is supposed to make the water twice as hot- still not hot as it should be, if any hotter at all.

I looked at all these reviews, and after buying the product, I'm not sure where the negative ones are coming from. One stated that the machine was hard to fill. My wife is 5'6\\" and had absolutely no problem filling the machine with water. One complained of condensation on the inside of the machine and when opening the lid, the condensation would spill all over the counter. The machine I have has a \\"gutter\\" which allows the water to flow back into the water reservoir instead of the counter. All the functions work great. The coffee came out hot and delicious. The only complaint I can understand is that the clock is small and would be hard to read if your eyesight is \\"maturing\\", however I am able to read the display fine. I think the clock is meant to program the unit... not to be a clock for your kitchen.Personally, I am very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"a HUGE disappointment","review":"I really should have listened to those who were critical of this machine. I have had it less than a week and it is already broken. This morning my pot of coffee never made it. The cycle ran, a bit of coffee dribbled into the pot and the rest is sitting somewhere in the filter I suppose. I read this happened to others. If you are thinking of purchasing this, maybe you would be wise to take a look at some others. (It is also difficult to get a consistent quality of coffee, every day it was different). I'm going back to my \\"old, cheap\\" coffeemaker, at least I was guaranteed a cup in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffeemaker making great coffee","review":"I bought this coffeemaker for primarilly two reasons: we remodled our kitchen and wanted a nicer looking coffeemaker; and I love great coffee.

About 6 months ago it started leaking water out of the bottom of the coffee maker. My wife loves the way it looks. It makes excellent coffee. I especially like the adjustable temperature control on the burner. However, I would not recommend buying this machine because of the water leaking problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I purchased this coffee maker due to my other Cuisinart machine breaking after three years. (Leaking from bottom) Due to my own fault in missing a small detail, I did not notice that this machine did not automatically grind the beans like my last one. Luckily I had not rid of the grinder but ended up just using pre ground beans for convenience. This is a great machine for the money and if you are someone who complains that their coffee pot never keeps the coffee hot this one is for you. I liked the auto timer shut off. It was not noisy while brewing and easy to clean.Cuisinart did replace my older machine for its disrepair but to be honest with you I prefer this one. Sometimes the more expensive one is not always the best option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffe Pot","review":"We bought a Cuisinart DCC 1200 Brew Central Coffeemaker and it was worth every penny we paid.

This is a great fit for us and the coffee tastes amazing compared to our last machine! I like the height and slenderness which fits perfect under my cabinets but may not fit under all. It gives me more counterspace than our last one. Their are two disadvantages however. 1) you do have to take the lid off the pot to fill it. 2) there is no light on the clock which makes it hard to read and would be a pain if you want to program everyday. We do not use that feature so it is not a problem for us. Would highly recommend it just for the coffee taste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"I had used this coffee maker very little when the clock light went out.

I bought this largely from reviews (and yes, sleek look). When it works, it makes decent coffee. But its engineered very poorly. For one thing, the water level is nearly impossible to see, unless you bend around the side. But the huge problem is that it breaks, apparently because the tube bringing the water up from the back deteriorates and/or jams. Ours did this after just a few months. And there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it, since its not an easily part to replace or to remove and clean. After checking on the Web, it appears others have had this same problem and Cuisinart coud care less. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinat DCC-1200 Brew only lasted a year.","review":"I bought this coffee maker a year and two months ago. It was fine until last week when it suddenly stopped working.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for smoke.","review":"Looks very nice and worked perfectly for almost 5 months.

It is barely a year old and inexplicably just stopped working? Would have expected more based on name brand and pricing. Will not be buying a replacement like this...sticking with the cheaper brands from now on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous & Unsafe","review":"I bought this coffeepot in April, and was happy with it up until now. After brewing a pot and pouring a few cups on a lazy Sunday, I heard a bubbling sound coming from the kitchen about half and hour later. The coffeepot was BOILING and smoke was coming from the bottom of the warming unit. My husband often leaves for work before I get up, and leaves the warmer on for me. If this would have happened then, it could have burned the house down.After looking at a lot of the reviews here, it doesn't look like an isolated incident. Even if I decided to chance getting a replacement through the warranty, Cuisinart makes you pay for shipping to AND from their facility. Which means I'm out $25, and I have to spend money on Starbucks for at least a few weeks. I will not be buying another Cuisinart again--it's too expensive of a unit to have to be worrying about buying a new one every 9 months, or worrying about it catching fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in 18 months","review":"Yesterday morning there was a burning electrical smell and now it won't brew.

Looks attractive and blends in with my stainless steel appliances.

When programming, the digital numbers are a little difficult to read but otherwise a very good coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot coffee at last","review":"We had been searching for a programable coffee maker that makes hot coffee. This does that! I have tried it with paper filters and with the permanent one that comes with it. Does a good job either way. I am still adjusting my coffee amounts. It makes strong coffee. The height is slightly inconvenient but overall we are satisfied. I use it during the week for the small cup portion and on weekends we fill it up. Works well either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great maker great coffee","review":"Bought this Cuisinart after our Melitta Mill and Brew broke down after 1 year use. The Cuisinart works great. Not too loud when grinding, and makes great coffee. This has a 12 cup decanter instead of 10 like our old maker. More coffee the better. Also the shut off is longer. Our old maker would shut off after an hour, and we would have to keep turning back on. This Cuisinart is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker","review":"Terrific looks and performance in this coffee maker. Neat features like an indicator light to tell you when it needs cleaning. (Haven't had mine long enough to have that actually work yet.) My only complaint is the lid comes off to fill, etc. and doesn't always snap back on easily so it sometimes drips or I struggle with it. But we've never had the problem we did in our cheaper coffee makers where the filter bends over and you get grounds in your coffee. My sister has had the same model for several years and still really likes it, too. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very functional/works well","review":"I recently bought this coffee maker. It works very well and the temperature of the water going over the coffee grounds is in excess of 180 degrees F (which is better than most home coffee makers). The ideal temperature for water over your coffee grounds is 180-200F, so I am able to extract the most flavor/oils from my coffee. One negative: No backlit LCD. I knew this going into the purchase and blew-it off as no big thing, but in low light conditions it really is hard to see. Not that big of a deal-breaker, but buyer beware. Great coffee maker and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DCC1200 makes a great cup of coffee!","review":"I had the cuisinart grind and brew. Did not like it.

Product met my expectations. I did find that delivering hot coffee and keeping it hot is a very good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker - but minor criticisms","review":"I purchased this after some investigation. I had noted in other reviews it was awkward to add water. Frankly, I was not prepared by how inconvenient it really is to add water to the tank without positioning the coffee maker very carefully. There is a gauge inside the water tank so you know how much water to add. It is frankly nearly impossible (at best) to read without positioning the coffee maker in exactly the right light level. By the way, you are sure to spill a little water when filling the tank. Add coffee after filling or you will spill the water all over the fresh coffee grounds.The coffee maker does everything else perfectly. The best suggestion I have is to place your coffee maker on an open part of your counter. If you want to use it under your wall mounted cabinets you will have to move it around all the time.This is a great coffee maker with some poor ergonomics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"We purchased this coffee maker approx 1 month ago, make coffee 1 to 2 times a day, and have been extremely satisfied.

Finally I could not take that Kitchen-Aid one more day. After reading the reviews here I purchased the Cuisinart. I use the programmable timer frequently so having the glass carafe was a must. Stainless pots cool down coffee too quickly. It is simple and easy to operate and works well. It can brew the full 12 cups too, so it makes plenty. And the coffee is kept very hot, a feature I had been missing for too long. The area for pouring water is a bit tight but that is my only complaint. I finally found a keeper!I also purchased a year supply of water filters so I don't have to hunt them down anywhere else. The price on Amazon was fair. It did come with the gold tone filter but I use paper filters most often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker","review":"This is my second Cuisinart coffee maker, and it makes the very best coffee. I love the fact that it has a changeable water filter and a wire mesh instead of having to use coffee filters. The \\"clean needed\\" feature is also a plus and easy to put into a self clean mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brewing on ...","review":"We had an older model for years of enjoyment as we drink coffee frequently throughout the day. Operation is similar to the previous model so there was no learning curve. Only difference is that the older model had a water level indicator we could see from the outside but this doesn't -- need to look in from the top to see where the water is. We did that once and then started using a measuring cup to fill with the right amount of water and then dump into the cofee maker versus stretching our necks over the top. Otherwise -- great product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee - poor machine - poor customer service","review":"My machine lasted exactly 2.5 years & Cuisinart will not stand behind their warranty. They will send me a new machine but not until I ship back the old one along with a $10 check (so I can plan on around $30 to get a new machine that will probably crap out again in 2-3 years, based on other reviews). Additionally, the new machine will not have a warranty on it. My old Braun coffee maker lasted 10+ years and cost 1/2 of what this machine did. As long as you don't mind replacing the unit every 2-3 years, it makes great coffee. I do not recommend this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for the money","review":"This coffeemaker performs very well overall.

The special 1-4 Cup feature on this model is made just for that purpose. If you want a coffee maker with clean, modern lines and a nice stainless steel body, this coffee maker is for you.

But what most impressed me was the dependability of this coffee maker. From late 2007 to early 2010, this coffee maker sat at the coffee station of our unit HQ at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, supporting the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines of Operation Enduring Freedom. Man, did we made some coffee. I mean, 3 pots before noon, and at least 1, sometimes as many as 3 pots after lunch. For one six month rotation, it brewed the midnight shift as well.

Nope, this one is still under warranty and has done the same thing. Yes they will replace it, but it is very irritating when you can't have coffee in the morning. I will give the replacement to someone I am not fond of as a gift and buy a different brand for myself. They just don't last long enough for the money. We bought my daughter a $10.00 coffee maker for college and 6 years later it still works. I just want a coffee maker that makes super hot coffee and keeps it very hot.

My wife and I drink a lot of coffee in the mornings, and we have found that when we make a large (12 cup) pot with this machine, the grounds go everywhere. There are little nooks and crannies that fill up with grounds and are hard to get at, and at this point the machine is taking about 30 minutes to make a pot of coffee. The charcoal filter gets clogged up and is more of a hindrance than a help. If you're making a small pot, it's hard to see how much water you have put into the machine -- there is no side window on the water compartment. To add insult to injury, the warming pad does not keep the coffee hot -- after pouring myself a cup I have to put it into the microwave for 15 seconds to get it hot. All in all, I have found this to be a high-priced turkey, and at this point I'm considering tossing it and buying a simpler, less expensive coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud for too long","review":"Makes coffee fine and I want the grinder-in-one coffee maker feature, but can't it make a grinder that does'nt wake the entire neighborhood.

I thought by spending a little extra money, I would get a better coffeemaker. Well to our surprise, 3 days into using it, it spilled all over the place. Thinking it might be our fault, the next morning, we made sure all pieces were intact, the filter was securly in place and guess what happened! Same thing! So we returned it and got another. Guess what? SAME THING!There must be something wrong with this batch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out after 18 months","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker about 18 months ago. It was great while it lasted. Just today while brewing some coffee I smelt electrical burning. Sure enough the Cuisinart no longer works. It will cost at least $25 and take a couple of weeks to get it replaced by Cuisinart. I'm going to go for a Waring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Coffeemaker","review":"My parents bought this for me and my fianc��e as a housewarming gift two and a half years ago and it's never failed us. I love the auto program feature. I can set the coffee up the night before and not have to worry about wasting time in the morning, and because of the auto shutoff function, I don't have to worry about turning off the burner either. My only complaint is that the chrome version, which we have, makes it hard to clean off fingerprints. Other than that it's a fantastic machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different breed of cat","review":"Just brewed my 1st cup of coffee with the Brew Central DCC-1200.Before my purchase through Amazon I read all 58 reviews of this product and was concerned about the 50-50 division of opinion on the quality of the brew, whether it was hot enough (I need it hot), and the water mess on the counter when the cover was raised. I should add that I recently purchased and returned a Krups (great coffee but a clunker for endurance--froze up twice after a few months operation) and Capresso (dull, undrinkable coffee).My empiracle assessment of the DCC-1200 is that:1. The brew is superior;2. It is hot--can't see how it could be hotter;3. A plastic lip connected to the reservoir cover on the back of the machine catches any condensation runoff when the cover is raised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Coffee Maker","review":"Cuisinart Brew Central Coffee Maker DCC-1200C is a good ENTRY level machine. I wish the machine had a cord storage! The black cord is long and seems to get in our way when we put water in and when we move the machine out to take the filter to the bin the cord is in the way. Cuisinart is a well known brand however if you have specific coffee space in your kitchen beware that this machine has a LONG cord and the machine has no cord storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brews okay, but not for the coffee connossieur","review":"1) If you love coffee, don't buy a glass caraffe that will burn the bottom after the coffee sits for about 15 minutes; opt instead for a thermal insulated caraffe option.2) If you like to make a full pot, this coffee maker only holds enough coffee to brew 1Tbsp per cup. If you liked stronger coffee or brew with the method recommended by many gourmet brands, you will not be able to fit enough coffee in the machine to make a full pot to your desired strength.Cuisinart is a great brand, and I love most of their appliances;I even like the Burr Grinder that I own. They haven't taken on the coffee space as experts with this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another coffeemaker","review":"Buying this coffeemaker was a mistake. 1) poor design: there is no good way to know how much water is in the machine - you have to look inside where there are stairstep cup indications, and estimate how much water is in there if it's less than 10 cups because the lower stairsteps are out of sight! 2) the 'auto-timer' never worked because the clock couldn't be set. Broken from day one. We don't actually NEED an autotimer so we put up with that, and so now, a year or so after purchase: 3) overnight, with no warning, it doesn't make coffee anymore. Just up and quit. Monday - made pot of coffee. Tuesday - add grounds, add water, flip switch, \\"On\\" light goes on and nothing. I guess that means the heating coil has given out, or something like that. Overall, what a disappointment and waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a year and a few months","review":"I purchased this for my mom for a christmas present. That was december of 2010. Now it is February 2012 and it does not work anymore. I have gone through the manual and online reviews. It seems there is a big percentage of folks that have it crap out on them. You fill the water, fill the grounds, put the lid on the carafe, set it to brew and turn it on and nothing happens. I'm an engineer by trade, starting diagnosing, it appears some of the electronics inside burned out. Most likely they are putting cheap electronics from china / taiwan which will always have a pretty large failure rate on parts. So don't buy this, unless you want to gamble with your money that you won't be one of 20-30% that have a problem.That all being said, it does have a 3 year warranty, but I'm not going through the hassle of gambling for another one and wasting shipping (20 total for both ways) when I can just buy a cheapy from walmart that will last until I'm dead and buried."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed after 2 years","review":"the coffee maker leaked from the bottom since first day.

Coffee tasted strange. Tried to make more coffee and nothing happened. I went out and purchased a Cuisinart DCC1100. Could not afford the 1200 at store prices. Hope this one lasts longer.

I bought my first Cuisinart coffeemaker because it went well with all the stainless steel in my kitchen. They don't last. If you own one that works for two years consider yourself lucky. The toggle switch is arcane. All together these look great but aren't made very well. I am on my last one, when this one goes south maybe I'll try a Breville. Couldn't be worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee pot I've ever owned","review":"I purchased this coffee pot for one reason, the heating plate which allows you to select your coffee temperature. I do like this feature, however the rest of the coffee pot is too complicated for my taste. In over 44 years of marriage I have owned a lot of coffee pots and this was the most expensive and hardest to operate. The big complaint is that it is just plain messy!! If you grind you coffee too fine it swells up and gets all thru the coffee pot and was a real pain trying to get all of it out of the coffeemaker. We also have the black model which makes it hard to see the water level when pouring the water in. Next time I will buy a more simple brand and less expensive. A longer cord would be helpful. I do not notice any change in the taste of the coffee. Your money is best spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned, very poor warranty","review":"I give this coffee maker a 5 star rating for design, quality of materials, and function. I take away 3 stars for their poor idea of a warranty. This company not only requires that you pay for your own shipping under warranty, they also charge you a \\"shipping and handling\\" fee to repair and return. Compared to other high end products, see \\"Kitchen\\" for example, this is a really crappy deal. Most cover all shipping charges. I have never seen one from a reputable company that sticks you both ways.This is the last product I will get from these people.Added after a year of ownership:Almost all the features and quality are overcome by the constant spilling EVERY TIME I open the lid to make coffee. The amount of condensation that leaks out the back needs to be cleaned up constantly and, after a year, is a real pain. Be prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice controls, lousy coffee","review":"Maybe we just got a bad unit, but our brand-new Cuisinart DCC-1200 makes coffee that tastes muddy, flat, and dull. That's a pity, because the features and the design of the controls are excellent. For a six-cup pot of coffee, the brewing cycle takes 7 minutes. That seems overly long -- too much extract? Although the instructions recommend medium-fine grind, we switched to perk grind, the coarsest available. The results were definitely improved, but still third-rate. There could be a problem with the water temperature. Our other two coffeemakers make a brew with brightness and snap. We have a Krups electric drip, topped only slightly by the old-fashioned manual Melitta drip."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Coffee Maker","review":"The only way to open the carafe is to pry it open with a knife, and, based on how thin the plastic is, I imagine this will work for about a month before I'm simply hosed.

I'm not sure if it's the gold filter or the water filter that makes this coffee maker make such superior coffee, but I guess what's really important is that it does make great coffee. This coffee maker also looks great in my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine...for a while","review":"We purchased this coffeemaker for its sharp retro styling and because Cuisinart tends to be a reliable brand. It worked fine for several months, and then began having difficulty brewing. The heater simply burns off water into steam so 12 cups of water might slowly brew only 8 cups of very, very strong coffee. We tried cleaning it, brewing only 10 cups at a time, varying the grind size...nothing worked. A phone call to Cuisinart very impressively resulted in a no-hassle replacement with a new unit. However, the new unit soon presented the same problems as the previous one. We know how to read and carefully followed the instructions provided in the manual, but it makes no difference. We are now looking around for a less expensive Mr. Coffee or other brand. Not as sharp looking, but in the end, you can't pour a snazzy appearance into a mug and drink it."},{"rating":"2","title":"After having others, simply the best.","review":"I love robust black coffee, and use my coffeemaker at least twice a day. After burning through a Braun and a Krups a few years ago, I purchased this model three years ago after an exhaustive bit of research. It's the best ever, and so good that I have recommended it to friends and family, and just purchased one as a thank you gift for a couple who were getting by with an ancient, dribbling Mr. Coffee at their vacation home. A tip for those who like their brew extra strong - press the 1-4 cups button to allow for slower water flow, thereby producing a stronger result without having to add additional coffee. although it comes with the gold tone filter, I prefer the convenience of disposable paper filters ($1.60 for 100 at Trader Joe's). Also, I'm not sure why other reviewers have complanied about difficulty filling the water receptacle. Have never encountered any issues with this - simply use the carafe and pour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked perfectly right up until it didn't","review":"Overall one of the best ones I've used, but after just over 6 months one morning it just didn't work.Flipped the switch, power cycled it, etc, and no coffee.Too expensive not to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great choice","review":"This coffeemaker was purchased to replace a Mellita grind and brew. It is not even close. There are too many pieces to clean each time you make coffee. The grinder does not grind all the beans nor does it move all the ground coffee to the basket. The paper filter does not catch all the coffee in the basket as it is difficult to place it in the basket so that it does not obstruct the small opening where the coffee comes through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 1 year of service","review":"It made great coffee while it worked.

Indeed, the great attention to styling detail and high build quality of the machine are impressive relative to others I've used over the years.Unfortunately, the quality of coffee it produces is substandard and far below that of the $20 Mr. Coffee I've been using for years. As the only coffee drinker in our home, I usually brew a four cup pot. Even when selecting the 1-4 cup option, the coffee never approaches the desired temperature for an ideal cup. I brewed several pots, varying the grind and amount of coffee, with and without the charcoal filter, and I was never able to produce the robust cup of coffee I have been enjoying for years. With regret, I will be returning it for a refund later today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Nice But ...","review":"My wife and I run an Internet cafe, and we bought two Cuisinarts to back up our Bunn coffee maker.While the Cuisinarts look beautiful and make good coffee, it's never hot enough - not even to begin with, and a half hour later we may as well have unplugged it. Even on the hot setting, the Cuisinarts won't keep coffee hot.For that reason alone, I'd never buy another one and don't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK","review":"Shame on Cuisinart for putting on the market such a piece of junk. I'm trying to learn to be civil, so I can't use a more appropriate four-letter word than 'junk'.There's an obvious manufacturing flaw that ineffectuated both of the machines I got from Bed, Bath & Beyond. The funnel-shaped filter holder is spring-loaded at the bottom and requires pressure from above in order to drip. However, once the water had dripped just a tiny bit, not enough pressure was exerted and the coffee machine stopped dripping!I called Cuisinart, which had me on hold for twenty minutes before sending me to a very, very rude CSR who fully exuded her boredom, impatience and supercilliousness towards me. Then she simply said, \\"you gotta take it back to the store\\". So I did, only to be given another one with THE EXACT SAME DEFECT.Thanks Cuisinart... for nothing! I always thought you made aesthetically nice products BUT WHO CARES IF THEY DON'T WORK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known better than to buy this!","review":"We had the same Cuisinart DCC-1200 at my work and it lasted about one year before the heating element died. So much for that. I just bought this for my mother and it was a TOTAL WASTE of MONEY. Please LOOK ELSEWHERE as this has some SERIOUS FLAWS. First, if you like your coffee hot, forget it! Lukewarm is about all this machine can make. Going back for a second cup? Not unless you like your coffee ICE COLD! And that is after just 5 minutes! If you didn't have a microwave near by to reheat the coffee you would really suffer. The design is very bad. The water reservoir is small and hard to see into and very hard to pour water into. Overall, I wouldn't give this even one star. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CUISINART COFFEEMAKER. Very very bad. I should have known better. All my mother wanted was a decent cup of coffee and you would think that a machine at this price would deliver. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after 14 months","review":"I should have followed the advice of the one star reviewers. Shame on me.

It's a nice looking coffee maker, for what that's worth, and it makes a good cup of coffee, but not any better than any other coffee maker. As for my experience, we went through two of these in about 4 months. First one leaked and emptied all of the water in the tank onto the counter. I spent about $20 to return it to Cuisinart (Their warranty requires that you pay shipping BOTH ways.) The replacement went into \\"cleaning\\" mode after about a month and it wouldn't turn off.

No complaints there. My problem was with the design and layout of the clock. When the coffee was brewing, excessive steam would rise and completely disable the clock. The steam would get inside the mechanism which could only shorten the life of the timer I so desperately needed. It would take an hour to regain visibility and after a week, I returned it as defective. The second pot did exactly the same thing and I decided there must be better out there.

My old Mr. Coffee quit after 15+ years, so I started looking for a new one. Consumer Reports rated this machine #1 in their December '09 issue. Based on this, and the fact it looks really cool, I bought it.The first thing I didn't like was the position of the water reservoir opening, in the back corner of the machine....it's too small. When I used the carafe to fill it, I had to completely turn it upside down to empty it - another poor design. The worst was yet to come. After it finished brewing a very good cup of coffee, it made a terrible racket. It popped and crackled for at least half an hour, until I turned it off. The next day, I made another pot and the same thing happened. Very irritating. The following day it went back to Bealls.I now have a Mr. Coffee JWX27 from K Mart - half the price, no noise, and good coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never press the self clean","review":"Great coffee pot as long as you never use the self clean.

If you use more than a couple of tablespoons of coffee, the grounds rise up in the basket and stick to the basket lid. When you raise the main top lid of the coffee maker, the basket lid is attached and also rises so the coffee grounds stuck to the lid now fall into the water resevoir. You can either awkwardly rinse out the water resevoir after each brewing or leave old grounds to age for your next pot of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the rating suggests","review":"After reading several of the reviews for this maker, I thought \\"must be great\\". I bought it.The first pot, I used cold filtered water from the fridge. The pot took 9 minutes and 37 seconds to brew. (the optimum time is 4 min 30 sec)The next pot, I used warm water and knocked alomst two minutes off and the third, I used hot hot water in the maker. The pot brewed at just over seven minutes.I love the design, I love the toggle switch in the front for the on/off. I love the knobs (cheap though) the whole thing feels cheap except for the caraffe. I think it's an \\"inexpesive to build but make it expensive so people think they're getting an awesome coffee maker\\" type of situation.

This is a real PAIN IN THE BUTT when you need to leave for work.2. The water goes in where the coffee goes in and cleaning this is a problem. There needs to be some separation here as you end up with coffee grounds in your water... Now, they've put in a filter mechanism to filter your water, but it gets really gross really fast after some grounds get in there. Also, the water level markers are inside the water resevior and are very hard to see.Cuisinart makes wonderful food processors; leave the coffee up to Krups, Capresso, Bunn, the real coffee makers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great--till it died 2 1/2 months later","review":"I got this as a gift for a friend for Christmas.

The 4th time, I was told that it was out of warranty - but I argued that the coffeemaker was only 6 months old (that's how long ago it had been replaced for the 3rd time). I was told that the warranty is good from Purchase Date. So, in essence, I had a coffeemaker that was good for 6 to 8 months at a time - period. Then you had to return it to the mfr. and go without a coffeemaker for a month, while waiting for them to replace it! Biggest complaint, it leaked so many times on my counter, (I had it in the corner where it was seamed) that it actually warped my countertop!!!!!!!!!!!

No problems pouring water into the machine or with overflowing grounds (which our old maker did from day one). Auto brew and auto shutoff are easy to set. Noticed that settings were retained after unplugging the machine (which is good here in Florida where we get a lot of brief power interruptions).

It is not safe to have these in your home. Clearly there are issues with this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps getting clogged","review":"We have purchased this coffee maker three times now. The first time it clogged it was our fault because someone over filled the coffee with very fine grounds and the mess was just too big to clean up. The second time it clogged was just a few months after we had purchased our second machine. This time we returned it thinking there was a problem with the machine. We are now tossing out our third machine. This device does make a good cup of coffee, however, it's design seems flawed. We followed all cleaning/care instructions and were careful about not using fine grounds and the darn thing still clogged. This time, btw, it clogged after a recent clean. Worked fine, then I cleaned it and now it just makes lots of noise and steam. UGH! Wont be buying a forth machine.One more thing, all three never allowed us to take the pot out before the brewing process was complete...always dripped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have bought another","review":"This unit started having problems about a year ago and today it died.

They are a decent for the price, and I consider them mid-range. They are not super cheap and not super expensive either. It looks nice on the counter.

Would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My great, new Cuisinart Coffee Maker!","review":"I love the coffee maker! After the first few times that I emptied the coffee pot, I found grounds in the bottom of the carafe after I drank all of the coffee. I must have put some heaping teaspoons of the coffee into the gold mesh basket.Now I am using level teaspoons and I don't have any grounds in the bottom of the carafe. Yippee!My quest now is to find a really delicious tasting coffee. I was using a Market Basket Hazelnut variety which is a brand made my supermaket, Giant Eagle. I am now using Starbucks Columbian Coffee and I like it better than the Market Basket brand. I have to try a few different types of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it for a year","review":"We bought this coffee maker a year ago and really liked it.

I called Cuisinart Customer Support who informed me they would send a replacement unit if I agreed to pay ten dollar shipping cost. I agreed and two weeks later the replacement unit arrived. Five months passed now the replacement unit just died. Same as the first unit. Made coffee one morning, dead the next. What a lousy product. Cuisinart should be ashamed to put their name on it.

But as I started reading customer reviews on Amazon, I began to second guess their review.All I can say is: trust the numbers -- this machine has many more positive then negative reviews. The coffee tastes great and the complaints are just nitpicky. The one my wife and I laughed the most about is that \\"the water receptacle opening is small, so you should keep a towel handy when pouring water in the machine.\\" The opening is not large, but if you're missing that opening, maybe you should cut down on your coffee consumption.We've had ours for about 1 month and use one to two times every day (and haven't missed the hole once).

I have been too lazy to find another until recently. It used to be only occasionally that water/coffee would not enter the pot but would overflow onto the burner, counter and floor. Now it does it more often than not! Not only that but it now also overflows from the the top of the coffee basket. I have thoroughly cleaned all of this area and it still does it. Obviously, there is something wrong with the spring mechanism in that brewing cone. But it seems you can't just buy that. You have to get a whole new machine! Based on what others have told me about their experiences with Cuisinart stuff since Conair bought them, I think I want a whole new brand?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Cuisinart","review":"I ordered this based on recommendation in Consumer Reports but I am disappointed in both the quality and features. The only way to get the right amount of water is to measure it first in the carafe because you can't see the markings or water level inside the black unit where you fill it. The unit doesn't slide easily on the counter top and the piece that holds the coffee grounds is flimsy and fragile. Water drips down the back of the unit if you open the lid too high to remove the used coffee grounds and filter. This is not near the quality of my old Braun coffeemaker with it's visual gage for filling and easy to remove carafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Pot","review":"I used this one for three mos.

Additionally, the pouring spout on the carafe is poorly designed making it is difficult to pour coffee without dripping it.You would think that Cuisinart would redesign both the lid to the water reservoir and the spout of the carafe.I just abandoned two Cuisinart DCC-1200 machines for the new Waring Pro Coffee Maker. The Waring product seems much easier to operate and does not leave water or coffee on the counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the fritz after about 2 years","review":"We liked it while it worked. Nice appearance, good coffee. Pouring the water in was a little awkward and on some bleary eyed mornings, much ended up on the counter, rather than in the reservoir. But for $70, I wasn't going to chuck it for that. Adapt and overcome.The first thing to stop working was the auto brew function, followed several months later by the manual brew function. She'll perk about 6 cups and shut off completely. If the plate would stay hot, my husband and I would just make do with 3 cups each (Doc says my daily 4 are too much, anyway).If you want to spend $70 every 2 years for a coffee maker, this is a 5 star product. I'd prefer it lasted as long as my Grandmother's percolator...forever...without having to adapt to its eccentricities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Well built Machine\\"","review":"This coffee machine is solid and durable. Best brewed coffee we've had, looks great in the kitchen. Like the fact that you have two filtration options (paper or permanent) and a variety of temperature settings.

Being highly caffeine-dependent, I immediately started looking at coffee makers. I picked up a Bunn, brewed 2 pots and hated it so it went back to the store. I saw this one and liked the looks and the reviews so I ordered it. In true Amazon fashion, I had it 2 days later and set it up. Brewed the first pot and was thrilled. I've been very happy with it ever since, and I really love the retro-look. I was not at all disappointed, which is more than I can say for Krups and Bunn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I love this coffee maker! I have not had any problems with it.

Two main problems: very easy to crack the carafe (~$25 to replace). So easy that I have no idea how I did it. Twice. Second and more serious issue. As it was making coffee one day I heard a series of popping/crackling sounds, then smoke and electrical fire smell. Fortunately I happened to be right there and so pulled the plug. but what if it had happened on an auto-on cycle or when I wasn't home?! Never had a coffee machine do this before. In fact never even heard of one doing this, but a quick google search shows this is not an uncommon problem with the DCC series. Wish I'd known earlier, which is why I'm writing this review. If you buy this you are probably introducing a fire hazard into your home.On the plus side: it made good coffee prior to self-destructing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks after 1.5 years","review":"I started recently using the programmed start feature.

I followed some instructionsfrom several places on the internet from people having the same problem.I took off the bottom to check if the rubber tubes were brittle and cracked.They were not and I do not want to take it apart fully. I called Cuisinartand they said it has a 3 year warranty and they will replace it.Edit: Now it is leaking while brewing with the standard method. Clear waterstarts pouring out of the bottom of the machine while brewing. If I usethe warranty I will have to pay the shipping both ways and the $10 replacementfee for a total of about $50.

Now the lights come on but nothing happens. We'll see how good the 3 year warranty is.Update: The warranty service was great! I was required to pay shipping $10 for a new coffee maker w/ everything (pot, mesh filter, etc..) included. Was told to keep the existing carafe, filter, and basket. Also required to pay shipping ~$14.00 to ship faulty coffee maker. Not exactly a free warranty, but easy to accomplish.

It made great coffee, and I liked the programmable feature and automatic shutoff. It died (pump) in 2010. I replaced it with a Hamilton Beach unit, and the same thing happened..it died after about 11 months, and the coffee was okay, not great. So I went back to another Cuisinart, and it died about a month ago. Cuisinart makes great coffee, but the coffeemaker is unreliable. For the money I spent, I would think the coffeemaker would last longer. I'm making coffee the old fashioned way now; a melitta cone and filter. Yeah, I miss having the coffee already made when I get up, but I'm not going to buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the coffee...pot lasted less than 12 months :( Stopped Brewing","review":"I purchased this coffee maker from here 10 months ago.

The coffeemaker had been leaking for quite some time so, quite frankly, I'm glad to see it go. When the first unit failed (out of warranty) I called Cuisinart and learned that the coffemaker is not repairable. Within warranty they just replace it. There are no repair parts available for out-of-warranty repair. The units seem to work for just under four years. The warranty is for three years. Yes, the DCC-1200 makes good coffee but it appears they are designed to fail. Our usage was just one pot of coffee a day, not exactly heavy usage.

Just add more coffee( if you buy Folgers types, yea maybe I am not a extreme aficiando, but I do enjoy a great cup and this unit provides!!

This thing has a few design flaws.1- Water and coffee go in from the top -- which is okay since I'm over 6 feet tall -- but my shorter wife practically needs a step to prepare it for use (she's 5'6\\", hardly a midget). Baskets that swing out are much better. A coffee maker shouldn't require you to be tall.2- This basket always needs several nudges to get secured - also annoying. Again, the swing style is great.3- The ever-annoying spillage. Yes, I'm always mopping up coffee from the counter and floor. And when you remove the carfe, that annoying 'ppppppsssssssstttt' occurs from spillage on the hot plate, even though this shouldn't happen.For the money - these aren't acceptable flaws. I've had it for 2 months and am getting a Hamilton Beach. I'd sell the Cuisinart used - but wouldn't want anyone to get stuck with it.

When I told them I was done messing with it they told me I could pay $10 for them to ship me a new one (why would I want another one just like it?) AND pay whatever it cost to send the defective one back! I am pretty sure I will not ever buy another Cuisinart! I am far from the only person to have had this problem. They need to make it right.

Every time I make coffee there is a puddle of water under the machine. The caraf is not designed to pour coffee-it spills on the counter every time. And unless there's a spotlight shining down the water tank or you're making 8 cups or more, it's very difficult to know how much water you are adding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee, Great Machine","review":"I love this coffee pot. I bought it a month I looked at many before I decided to purchase this Cuisinart. It was pricey, but in the long-run it is worth the cost. I have made pot after pot of flavorful coffee. Clear with no sediments or oils like one can pick up through brewing in other pots. There has been no machine leakage or mess, no distortion of the machine lid from excessive steam escaping from the water heating unit. No burnt fingers for myself or my kids reaching across the counter to get a glass or bowl because the pot is a self contained unit and the pot fits inside its own cabinet and again there is no excess steam. Did I say it made great coffee. It makes great coffee! I definitely recommend the Cuisinart DCC1200 Brew Central."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee. Consistent Brew.","review":"I highly recommend this unit for its consistently good brew and useful features. I've had this coffeemaker for 3 months now and it is also very easy to use and program, which is important. The timer is simple and although I could live without the end of brew cycle beeping, it isn't loud enough to wake the late sleepers in my house. The small batch brew setting is great too. Also, the fact that you can set the auto shutoff for any time increment is great. My old coffeemaker would always turn off the warming element in 20 minutes, which was terrible for parties or when guests are over. You can set this one for as long as you want. Cleanup is also mercifully easy. Although the unit is so air tight, you will want to prop the lid open just a bit to prevent moisture staying in the top. (I use a spoon. overall, a great coffeemaker for the money. Well worth it over the cheapo 30-40 dollar machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns coffee","review":"I am buying my 2nd Cuisinart because the first one I had broke where the coffee dispensed out of and the metal carafe started to taste so stale that I had to get another one. From the advice of the store manager, he said that Cuisinart had improved their models. SO I bought another one. I have tried all kinds of good quality beans and for some reason I taste burnt coffee. The brewing process is burning the flavor of the beans. Other then that it's a great looking coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee - crappy dependability","review":"We owned 3 of these coffee makers over the last two years. They all made great tasting coffee. The first one lasted 1 year, the second 6 months and the third one, a week.I don't know if Cuisinart has sold out to the lowest bidder - but they are ruining their brand name by manufacturing small appliances that don't last. We are saddened that we can't replace our coffeemaker with one that lives up to its name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not brew more than 6 cups without overflowing the coffee grinds!","review":"ok...we have owned this over a year and it does make a good cup of coffee.The downside: The coffee make just can't handle over 6 cups of coffee without spilling the grinds everywhere. I should of listened to the reviews...to clean this thing with grinds everywhere is a disaster. It's likes a blow-out...for those that have little ones, you will know what I mean.The bottom line: The coffee make looks better than it functions. Going to look for another unit now. Later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Looks but Poor Coffee","review":"We have had all the same problems as other reviewers here. My biggest complaint is that the water never gets hot enough to extract any flavor from the coffee. Another problem is that I can actually see that not all the water gets dripped over the grounds but runs down the side of the basket instead. We use double the amount of freshly ground beans and filtered water and it still brews lukewarm, thin, bitter tasting coffee. It seems the unit relies on the hot plate to actually heat up the coffee after it brews. If you drink it as soon as it is brewed it is like very warm tap water temperature. This unit looks nice but has a bad heating element, unreliable pump, and is generally inconvenient to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I bought this same modle in white a year ago. It have been okay to make coffee but the clean up is horrible it will always look dirty! you can clean the water tank andd it get loaded with coffee grounds.I would not buy this again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"USED the warranty BIG TIME","review":"I bought this coffee maker 3 years ago, and it malfunctioned two times. The first time we returned it and received a new one from the company. This past time it just died one day, and when we returned it they said that it was now out of warranty, and that they had not received it yet. So, now I am looking to Consumer Reports for a new one. They rated this particular model VERY LOW. We enjoyed it when it worked, but will not buy it again due to reliability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too soon to tell","review":"I bought this coffeemaker to replace a Krups that still makes great coffee. It looks great, I love that the controls are in front, and that the carafe is sturdy and pours without spilling all over the counter. But, I have yet to make a 'great' cup of coffee - not even close to the taste we got out of the Krups. I may yet figure it out, but I'm withholding a better rating until I do.I do have two other minor complaints, that the water well is not the most convenient, and for $80 bucks you'd think they could backlight the clock. At least they put it all in front unlike the last two coffeemakers we purchased, which for some strange reason placed the controls on an angle as if they were only for one side of the kitchen.If I ever get a 'great' cup of coffee I'll let you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee - too bad about the fires.","review":"We loved this coffeemaker (other than a few minor design complaints) for almost exactly a year, at which point it ignited. Turns out we're not the only ones - originally had a link in here but it was removed by Amazon. Google \\"cuisinart coffee maker fire\\" and you'll see plenty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Coffee Maker","review":"It was more than I have ever paid for a coffee maker before, but my wife loves it. I like that it has a 1 - 4 cup setting, as we usually only make a couple cups at a time. The coffee is hot when it is done brewing and the warming pad keeps it at just the right temperature. I think it would be better if the clock display was a little larger, but not that big a deal, as there are other clock displays in our kitchen. I also think it would be more convenient if you could see how much water you were putting in the unit from the outside. Now I am left with ensuring I fill the carafe with just the correct amount of water, before pouring it into the reservoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves cu top rating","review":"I always check out Consumer reports. Initially, I bought the J C Penney item because it was rated a best buy. However, there was a smell from the plastic when i first used it so i returned it to J C Penney. I decided on the Cuisinart because it was top rated.The Cuisinart rating is well deserved. One tip: If you want great coffee, use whole beans and grind them just before brewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes great coffee, when it works.","review":"Our third one just died this morning. Our first one lasted about 18 months, then Cuisinart replaced it with a refurb unit. That one lasted about as long. So we bought a third, because it has great features, makes good coffee and doesn't spill much when you pour. But today number three died. Still under warranty, so I will call for replacement, but will go out in the snow today to buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"I was hesitant to buy another Cuisinart coffee maker after my negative experience with a DCC-2000 that required unplugging and plugging the power cord in several times a week to reset the controller. This occurred after about a year of use, and then finally after another year it just died. But after checking out several competing brands, I decided to give the DCC 1200 a try, and so far I'm glad I did.Quite simply, this coffee maker brews a hot, flavorful cup of coffee and looks good while doing it. It's not fancy, but it is well-built, the carafe pours without spilling, and its easy to keep clean. Time will tell if it will continue to work without the problems that I had with the DCC-2000, but for now I am pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life span - not worth it","review":"I purchased this product and within the warranty period had to get a replacement because it started leaking. Cuisinart did send me another coffee maker; however, I was responsible for paying for shipping. The second unit that was sent had problems within the warranty period again, this time it would not turn on at all. Cuisinart did not stand by their product and replace the second unit. I spoke to their representative at their 1-800 number and spoke to a manager named \\"clint\\", who refused to acknowledge that from a consumer standpoint having to replace a malfunctioning coffee pot repeatedly does not speak well to the durability of their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this coffee maker.","review":"Great coffee maker, coffer tastes great and it is easy to clean up. The place to pour water in is a little small so have to be careful when filling. This is my second Cuisinart. My first one had a grinder in the top, I liked it but it was not easy to clean up the grinder area between each potful, so now I prefer to grind in a separate grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great deal from Amazon","review":"This product was about half what I would have paid at a local military exchange. It was delivered promptly and for free with supersaver. The first item arrived with a broken lid and I was able to use the user friendly return option on-line to print a free shipping label and get it back to Amazon. My replacement item was in the mail before I shipped the original back. I love this coffee brewing system!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted less than 2 years","review":"Bought this product 1 1/2 yrs .ago with very high hopes. Ranked good too, with Consumer Reports magazine. But it just stopped brewing just like that. Our coffee maker was kept in good condition, always cleaned after each use. Not sure what the problem is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK and then it stopped working","review":"Bought the Cuisinart coffee maker 1-1.5 yrs ago to replace one that we had for 15ish years. Today the Cuisinart died - talk about planned obsolescence! The electronics had been slowly dying for a few months. First the beep starting sounding sick, then the clock would get screwy every 24 hours, then the heater would shut off after brewing, finally the electronics stopped working completely. ~1/2 a pot a day for 1-1.5 years - soooo dissapointed.The one thing that bugged me since we bought it is the \\"sweat\\" leaking. Every time you open the lid all the condensation runs down the lid and down the back of the machine, leaving a puddle on my counter. Someone couldn't have seen that as a problem when they were designing/testing this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 1 year","review":"I was happy enough with the coffee maker, then one morning nothing.I bought another one one Amazon and noticed it had only been 1 year.I am used to the machine and like the 12 cup carafe, this way I have as second carafe around.Still,the heating element should last more than one year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I received my Cuisinart DCC-1200 as a gift for Christmas, 2009. It died today, the day after Christmas, 2011.This morning the On/Off button does nothing. This unit lasted exactly two years of weekend only use - so about 200 pots.I will not be buying another of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after a year","review":"Worked ok, water does not poor nicely out of the pot if using it to fill the resevoir. The brew function quit working after about a year. It's not a switch problem it is in the elecronics. I can get it to work if I set the auto brew function and enter a time a minute in the future. Pain in the ass. Thought Cuisinart was a step up in quality, going back to Mr. Cofffe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee, bad design","review":"This coffee maker makes very good coffee quickly but has a major design flaw. In order to fill the coffee maker with water it is necessary to lean over the opened lid to measure the amount of water. Unlike other coffee makers this has no fill window to indicate the water level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - no longer stainless steel!","review":"Having just purchased my third DCC-1200 in 20 years, I was disappointed to find that the classy brushed stainless steel housing has been replaced by cheap silvery plastic. Yet all of the product descriptions, not just on Amazon, but even on Cuisinart's own website, still describe it is as \\"stainless.\\" A Cuisinart rep told me it was changed to plastic \\"some years ago,\\" although you may be able to still find a real stainless one in inventory somewhere. Also, the list price, as ordered direct from the manufacturer, is $79, not, as cited here, $145. The good news: it still makes good coffee, especially in smaller quantities, where other brewers fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Originally loved it ... until it caught fire.","review":"DEFECTIVE!I bought my coffemaker six months ago on Amazon. I was pleased with it until today when it started smoking and burning.I'm glad I was home at the time, otherwise I might have come home to a burning pile of rubble and a dead dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this one","review":"Smells of plastic.The coffee tastes of plastic.Even after running fresh water through the machine 10 times, it still tastes like plastic.The machine has some nice features (timer, heat controls, brew settings), but the quality of the brewed coffee is not acceptable...we had to pour out several pots because they were undrinkable.It's no better than a much less costly Black and Decker that also brews terrible plastic-tasting coffee!We are going back to the simple, old machine we were using before.Our advice is to skip this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Not Great","review":"This is a good product but not a great product. What's keeping it from greatness? The cord is too short, the carafe lid is a bit tricky to snap on and the carafe can inadvertantly be tilted when placed in the coffeemake causing overflow. What's the issue with a short cord? Well, keep in mind you have to open the lid to fill the water tank. If your outlet is below a cupboard you may have to pull the coffee maker out from under the cupboard to fill it. That's when the short cord becomes a problem. The tricky lid and easy tilt problems can be overcome by being careful but you may find that attentivness isn't easy early in the morning. If you slip up you'll have a mess to clean up. That said, it's hard to find a coffeemaker without flaws. Just read the reviews on Amazon. All facts considered this is a product worth buying provided you can live with it's flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"good coffee until unit caught fire in warm mode","review":"What else can I say, after 10 months of use, which was about one pot of coffee a day, the unit caught fire. Fortunately I was at home sitting nearby. I noticed that awful smell of plastic burning, then ran over and unplugged the unit that was smoking. If I was not in the room at the time I would have had a kitchen fire. The unit was not abused/misused. I cannot say if this represents just a rare defect, or an ongoing problem with quality control. My suggestion is that folks should always unplug the unit when not physically present in the room. The features on the unit are very nice. The quality of the coffee is good. Obviously I have to rate my unit a one star due to reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me","review":"It IS pretty. However, you cannot read the dials without a flash light, since they are black on a dark blue background. So I have my flashlight right next to my coffeemaker so that I can use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"after 18 months.....","review":"This coffeemaker lasted 18 months. I knew it was dying when it started getting noisier & we couldn't change the default for the number of hours the coffee maker stayed on. This AM nothing, no coffee, no power, just dead. 18 months and now nothing. After reading the reviews again (which I did before purchasing) & also reading the ongoing conversation,this is a common problem. Apparently the older coffeemakers last 5 years or more. Those were probably the last manufactured in this country. What a disgrace! I'm brewing my morning coffee in a 30 cup West Bend that my mother had for 30+ years. And it still works. I think we're going to opt for a Bunn commercial maker & stop this craziness. I'm not willing to spend at least $20. to get the cuisinart repaired.P.S. The cuisinart did make great coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffeemaker, but continually shuts off","review":"It looks good and has many features that make it a a five star unit. We failed to identify the shutoff problem until it was out of the warranty period. Would buy again, but closely monitor performance. Flushing with white wine is a marginal solution. Miss our Toshiba grind and brew coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee but why is it spilling itself over?","review":"Coffee tastes great - good price, and I think it does a good job. been serving me daily for 6 months.but when making coffee it appears to run over the sides of the pot, and runs down the sides of the pot, and burns on the bottom heater plate. I've tried jostling it around getting it into the right spot, but no dice it still does it.Anyone had luck fixing this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"quality and workmanship very poor","review":"I bought the Cuisinart based on the reviews on Amazon and the price. You get what you pay for. It brews a nice cup of coffee but the top is loose. You can push it down after loading the coffee and it works. I saw the same item at Kohl's for $30 more but at least theirs wasn't broken.Review part II. Coffee maker stopped working 22 months after purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A grab-bag of oldies but goodies.","review":"Most of the videos contained in this compilation are ones that never made it into heavy rotation on the major music networks, probably because much of it is abstract and a little lengthy.

After the civil rights movement of the 1960's many blacks(and their white syncophants)found it difficult to push their own race agenda. Thus,what better than to label all whites as racist(see white studies programs) and push the agenda that minorities do not have the capacity to be racist. Thus, only whites are deemed perpetrators of \\"hate crimes\\" and blacks who kill whites(which they do regularly) are presented in the court system as victims of white oppression.This is a society permeated by white people, their attitudes, culture and institutions-says one poster.

The situations are so far-fetched as to be unbelievable, and the characters are flat and one-dimensional. Additionally, the reader overacts the characters.However, the absolute last and fatal flaw for me was the unexpected Christian theme running throughout this book. I believe that if the book contains a Christian theme the cover or back cover should contain that information. To spring this on the reader without giving even a hint that there is a Christian theme is false advertising at best, and downright deliberate deception of the buying public at worst.Shame on you, Brilliance Audio! You should indicate to the prospective buyer if an audiobook contains a Christian, or Muslim, or Jewish, or any religious theme!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very capable and enjoyable intro","review":"A very capable and enjoyable intro to Christian missions in history, or at least through the 18th C. Especially delightful was his ability to discuss different kinds of missionaries and churches in a way that was not biased or prejudicial. Also, I liked his focus on Christianity in places like Central Asia and Arabia--and not just the standard, euro-centric material regarding the missions to Northern Europe which one will find emphasized so much in much similar writing.

Do you want to understand the difference between spirit and soul? Do you want to better understand the siginificance and the powerful reality of the cross? The main thoughts I would use to describe this book are: Sound. A classic. A true help for spiritual life and spiritual warfare.

It is as simple as that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed bag of 90's recordings","review":"Buyer beware. The title, \\"Albion Sunrise\\" is misleading. I bought it expecting an anthology of the Albion's entire career, from the mid-70's forward. I was very disappointed to find that this was not the case. It is, in fact, a collection of songs from the group's none too illustrious lineup from the 1990's. No Richard Thompson, no Cathy LeSurf, very little Simon Nichole, no Martin Carthy....what's the point, really? To hear Ashley play bass? Not very interesting IMHO.The album is not bad but it's not very good either. It has it's high points but it has a lot of mediocre spots as well, some bordering on the outright ludicrous. If you're looking for a collection of classic British folk/rock, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the shoe.... or title fits....","review":"The title in this one is extremely apropos, as the dialogue sparkles and flashes without getting cutesy or self-concious. A large number of sly little asides add to the humor; I frequently found myself laughing at a bit of dialogue, or at Temple's internal thought proccesses. Louie himself is an elegant Greek chorus of one, while behaving at all times like a real live cat. Matt and Max are superb foils for each other in all aspects, and the supporting characters (Fontana Inc, Danny Dove) are delightful while avoiding two-dimensionality. All of her books give a quick, in-depth sketch of life in the real world of various trades or professions...people wanting to become published authors could do worse than to read this particular one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am disappointed with this ironing board cover.

It transcends such concepts of genre and manages to become something quite different. This book should appeal to all, but especially the young as its themes of escape, rebellian and success deal explictly with the perils of growing up. It is interesting too how Disch paints such a division between American states in the future, but it is not done in usual future prediction style.

I also have other books written by John Hunt. His writing is as always clear, sharp and insightful. It shows through in this book too. Whereas some other bible books would need 1,000 pages, John can do with much fewer ones. And yet it can be much more far reaching.

Arvin has several unforgettably delightful stories in the collection. \\"Take Your Child To Work Day,\\" is hilarious and at the same time sad, the story of a marriage on the rocks and the strange daughter caught in the middle. Its about taking one's inner child to work, or putting ones real child to work, or...it's very smart. All a story should be.In The Electric Eden is an intriguing blend of history, authoritative ideas regarding engineering, and the finer details of emotional lives.As a child raised in Michigan myself--with all those trips to the former home of Henry Ford and the reconstructed Edison lab--I can't help but respond to this lovely mix of exploring the history of technology and the geography of human emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Debut","review":"Stewart O'Nan is right to compare Arvin's work to early TC Boyle. There is a searching intelligence behind these stories, a concern for where \\"progress\\" takes people. I especially enjoyed the title story and 'Commemorating.'

The 1st 2 solo albums of Frank Black, where phenominal, edgy, and full of wonder. But this album is straight rock, which has been done a 1000 times over. Sure the recording method is new, and unique (live and on a 2 track thingamabob) but it still can't find that spark his music used to carry.

Buy it now.There's not a bad, or even a mediocre song on here.

The fact that it was recorded live only makes it all the more amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard edge, great riffs","review":"Don't buy this CD expecting anything like the Pixies. There is not any randomly off-key guitar outbursts, but instead the raw power of a band recording live.It is reminiscent of The Beatles' \\"Let it Be\\" because of the fact that it was recorded with no overdubbing, just four guys rocking out.The guitar riffs rock and really give the listener a swift kick to the head reminding everyone how rock should be played...vocals, guitars, bass, and drums. No turntables, no drum machine, no crazy distortion, and no rap-like lyrics.Overall, a great buy if you're lookin' for a great Rock Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Francis has still got it.","review":"I think all Frank Black's solo albums are a little different. \\"Frank Black & The Catholics\\" is just as good. It is clearly more raw guitar than his previous albums, and includes homages to Green Acres,Larry Norman,Cain & Able,and his own loud persona. \\"Dog Gone\\" and \\"Steak 'n'Sabre\\" are my favorites. I also like the computer graphics of hunting people throughout the booklet, done nicely by Inertia. The only thing I can't understand is why he changed his band name to The Catholics. It would've sounded better with his original solo name with an original title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't you enter a title for my review?","review":"It took me quite a while to realize how extremely good this album was. I always liked it, when it came in the rotation for listening to FB, but then one day I just really paid attention to it and came to the conclusion it's just absolutely killer. From the opening green acres tease to frank just abruptly ending the man who was too loud - which by the way is a amazing song, it's straight on great. The songs are in alphabetical order too.

The DVD is grainy like a film, (you can actually see a hair(?) in part of an early shot) and was not really aligned properly with the frame. It is not in 8:5:1 format, so it shows like a television video.

He writes from lifelong knowledge--sometimes specifically about the Cats of Thistle Hill Farm. Caras' stories and observations are engaging, and even as someone who has lived with cats and known cats for a long time, I learned some new information. B&W photographs and drawings enhance the book and I love the chapter headings that each feature a line drawing of part of a cat's anatomy! Including an extensive index also was a smart move. This is the kind of book you might enjoy on a rainy afternoon or evening or carry to the beach for some pleasure reading. A Cat Is Watching definitely is worth finding at the book shop or yard sale, or borrowing from the library more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't learn much","review":"The author has just bought a new, large farm and I get the feeling he needed to write this book to pay down some of the mortgage. Every paragraph is chock full of \\"probably\\" \\"might\\" \\" perhaps\\" \\"someday the scientists will figure it out\\" etc. ad nauseum. The anecdotes of his own pets are cute and their stories well-told, but when he tries to link it all up to current research he can barely make a certain statement. He does give a lot of facts, but they are straws blowing in the wind. He admits he can't be sure of what his cats are watching. Go to any jungle at night and you'll see hundreds of eyes staring out of the wilds, not just the housecat or one of its larger cat relatives. For me, a frustrating read that didn't help me understand my own cats' thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Family Movie","review":"Everyone loves Princess Bride.

The focus leans, as one would expect from the title, toward a feminist viewpoint but whether writing about themselves, their homes, or the world these are all excellent essays. The contents are arranged chronologically by chapter and this gives another interesting insight into growing attitudes with time. Really a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Passionate and Sensual","review":"My two favorite Caterina Valente albums on one disc!

But still it deserved it 4 stars, if you are an Epitaph fan you'll love it, just like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"this punk rock is great, its like MxPx + Unwritten Law, with a little NOFX thrown in, very good cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hack is this?","review":"Just one of those things.

Cleaning the applicator after each use is a hassle and the wax doesn't flow very good. You can actually injure your skin just applying this product!(the wax sticks& pulls as you roll on).It seems as if to lessen the pain of application you must squeeze hard and apply slightly more wax, however then strips won't adhere! The wax works pretty well but since the applicator doesn't you won't get consistent results- meaning patches. This product is very messy- although surprisingly it will wash off the skin very easily! It seems the applicator is really the problem. I suppose it could be effective if you can try applying it with out the applicator in a very- very thin layer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible... Useless... Don't waste your money!","review":"This product was a waste of money! I let my hair grow well enough to do the wax, but it only removed the coarsest hairs. They don't even give you enough wax papers to finish both legs. After spending the time to wax half of my legs, I ran out of papers and still need to shave because the wax missed all the fine hairs and even some of the coarser hairs. VERY dissapointed. In my opinion, Nair Roll-On Wax is a total gimmick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not trust this book.","review":"I've read many Linux administration books, and consider myself a mid to senior level Linux administrator. This book has some serious problems. I'd be suprised if there weren't several other authors aside from the ones listed, because the book seems to be contradictory at times, and cobbled together.Most of the networking instructions are correct, and the file listings are generally all right, but the configuration instructions do not always lead to the results they're trying to achive, or do not match the output they show.I'd suggest a non RedHat specific book for Linux administration know how anyway - you'll get a more broad understanding of the issues without locking yourself into the way one particular distribution does things."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive Red Hat Linux book","review":"If you are using, or thinking about using Red Hat Linux, you should buy this book.

Hammer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two wonderful novellas and a so-so one","review":"I'd recommend the book for two of its three offerings and not worry about the third. The title story is one of the great sea stories of World War II and is worth the price of the book. Buy it for that alone. I also enjoyed \\"Heavy Rescue,\\" though it wasn't quite as compelling as the title story. \\"Leave Cancelled\\" was disappointing to me, though it may not be for you. I consider the title story as good as Montsarrat's classic novel \\"The Cruel Sea,\\" if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diverse trio of books.","review":"All three stories in wartime England: in the first you can almost taste the cold bully beef rations as the ship limps slowly to an unexpected landfall; in the second the honeymooners compress three weeks into one day; and in the third an old soldier finally finds himself useful again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"The author has a unique ability to put you in the characters shoes. The first story reveals the elements of true leadership under extreme circumstances. The second story is a tender story of a young couple's final night together before shipping out to combat and the hopes and fears of true lovers which were shared in thousands of different settings the world girded for war."},{"rating":"2","title":"realistic war story","review":"Written in the same vein as the \\"Cruel Sea\\" and C.S. Forester's \\" The Ship\\" the central chaacter is the vessel itself ; the personnel manning her are subordinate to her and are attached to the vessel as if it was a living thing.....one almost feels the strain of the exhausted crew as they nurse the damaged vessel through her ordeal...not as flamboyant as \\"H.M.S.

This guy is not big (5'8\\", 155lbs and is by no means an \\"animal\\" for strength). These 10-speed chains are super-weak. I have never had a Dura-Ace 9-speed break (nor have I ever ridden with anyone who has ever had a 9-speed chain break). Stay away from the 10-speed chains. My \\"new\\" bike has a KMC SL 10-sp on it and it is working well.

Five Stars *****","review":"This movie was very good. It's exiting combination of choreography and various fighting techniques made my palms sweat! I am a huge martial arts movie fan (Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li) and I would have to say that this was one of the best and most creative martial arts movies I have ever seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A confusing patchwork!","review":"A very confusing movie, which seems to have been hastily patched together. At times, it seems that the editors assembled footage from different films, with little attempts at continuity.The fight scenes are largely drab and unexciting, there's no character development to talk about. There is a plot, but given the muddled nature of the film, it's near impossible to follow - nor does it seem worth following.On a positive note, the transfer is pretty good: video and audio are fine, accurately reproducing a low budget, low quality HK film from the 70's.Supposedly, the star of this film was the king of Kung Fu films before Bruce Lee came along. This film, then, shows what a vital service Bruce did for the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"This was a quick, easy read with good ideas to supplement any classroom.

Been a Tricky fan since Massive and I will tell you straight out that this voyage into the \\"unknown\\" really sucks. Anyone who says this tripe is better than Maxinquaye has tried too hard to live a rock & roll lifestyle...thus ingesting too much cocaine and heroin. This cd was better left in the studio on adat where no one would EVER find it. Juxtapose owns this CD. WHAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"The latest step in Tricky's steady decline","review":"Since mesmerizing the world with Maxinquaye four years ago, Tricky's studio output has grown progressively worse. This album is damn near unlistenable. Simply put, it makes me feel bad, sort of in the way that The Cure's Pornography does. Now there may be a day when I feel like wallowing in my misery and want to put this CD on, but I'm not a teenager anymore so I can't foresee it.In fairness to Tricky, I saw his live show touring this record and the songs from Angels... sounded absolutely fantastic. But it does not translate at all on this record. Avoid it. Buy any of his other albums first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Martina?","review":"It is well known that Martina has always been the backbone of Tricky's songs. Her mysterious, alluring vocals show that she is a very talented singer and is able to convey emotion through the use of her purring soprano. But on this album she seems forced to serve as the cleanup crew to this scattershot emsemble of break beats and Tricky's ever so raspy lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Did tricky start using more drugs than he normally does?

Of all the songs on the Angst album I payed the least amount of attention to this song. Although about ten minutes into this disc I was hooked. I had already owned several cd singles so I knew what knid of manipulation Sasha and co. do to these songs. After the disc was done the only thing I could say was great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design is terrible, quality is pretty good.","review":"Quality is good. The construction and materials are pretty good. So why the 2-star review?Weak design. In the picture, the bag looks slim and smooth. In reality:- It's all bulky, bubbly and the center pocket looks like a huge pot-belly.- the material showed every single scratch and fingerprint.- The one middle pot-belly pocket was not designed with real life use in mind. What do you put in there? Everything you put in there all goes in one big bottomless pit.- The logo and strap are visually very annoying. They really wanted to be sure you saw their logo!So, in summary, don't spend too much money on this if you're going to buy it. There are so many options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must!","review":"Suzanne Vega Live At Montreax 2004 is a must if you like Suzanne Vega. She is in good form, looks healthy, tries to include the audience in her performance and the song selection is well chosen. She makes a brave attempt to cover The Who's \\"Behind Blue Eyes.\\" The only weakness seems to be her band (particularly the bassist) sometimes seem to over power her vocal. The best moments are are when Suzanne solos or plays with just one band member or when her guitar is the dominate insturment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD!!","review":"We've waited a long time for Suzanne to put out a concert video, and this one does not disappoint. I've seen her live 3 times, and she is a captivating performer. On this DVD, Suzanne seems a bit detached from the Montreaux audience, and I think the chemistry might have been better with a U.S. audience. But even so, the intimacy is there.The sound is very good (thanks DTS 5.1), but not great like the West 54th Sessions concert. I really wish they would put that entire performance on DVD (& every other Session @ West 54th for that matter). Suzanne's band has always been top notch. They're cool when they need to be, and they can rock when they need to. I'm especially enamored of bass player Mike Visceglia. He lays down some of the coolest bass lines i've ever heard.... and looks cool doing it!This concert DVD is a real treat. Suzanne looks and sounds wonderful, and delivers a great performance. Some things could have been done better, but I still give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigger is not better","review":"I bought this in order to save space in a move and paid the price. I completely filled it and found that most of my dvds are now scratched. I should've just bought a couple smaller case logics instead OR even just kept my collection in their respective cases. The pages are the poorest material I've ever seen used. Don't waste your money. You'll lose your dvds/cds if you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive - but too much crowd in the mix.","review":"Unlike some of the other reviews, I really enjoy hearing \\"A Pleasant Shade of Gray\\" preformed in its entirety on Disk 1. I think it demonstrates the band's technical skill to pull this off and the material comes off well.My biggest single complaint with this release is how the producer mixed in crowd noise. I guess he didn't want us to \\"forget\\" it's a live album because the crowd noise is way to prevelant. During the soft intro of APSOG a handful of fans continue to whistle and holler for almost two full minutes. Rather than adding excitement, it just becomes grating because these few fans whistling is almost louder than the music.Other than this issue, this is a great live release with excellent performances and production. You can hear each instrument (including the bass!) very clearly. I definitely recommend picking it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great production, but too much gray","review":"Out of the thousands of bands that have released live cds in late 1998, this one is the best. Great, crystal-clear sound and no phony audience over-dubs. My only problem with this set is that the only difference between disc 1 of this release and their previous release is the audience. In my opinion, they should have picked 5 or 6 selections from A Pleasant Shade Of Gray to play live so there would be room for more older greats like Life In Still Water, Fata Morgana, Orphan Gipsy, and perhaps an entire Prelude To Ruin. Even with the entire Gray cd being performed, this live set is a must for any Fates Warning fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Disc 1","review":"Just a minor problem. I ordered this CD before Christmas. I wanted APSOG and this seemed like a no brainer - a double live disc for the price of one. Turns out my CD had two discs 2 but no disc 1. I liked the second disc but can't rate the first. I'm wondering if anyone else had the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"It's a good book, its great for the listening and reading part. I also used the Princeton review.

He needed my help to open the bottle because the cool looking Spongebob top didn't seem to be secured to the cap inside of it, which made it difficult to unscrew. A few minutes after I left him I heard him screaming for me from the shower. When I got to him he was crying hysterically that soap got in his eyes and it stung. It took several minutes before I could wash the shampoo from his eyes, which were red and sore. I am amazed that this shampoo is marketed to young children and would definitely not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films I have seen","review":"This film was very well done in my opinion. It starts out as a family of three, a mother, father,and a girl, age 5, are traveling down the road, when the father mentions he needs to go back and use the pay phone. They go back, and he gets out to use it and notices a newspaper sticking out of the phone book. It read, Nana, age 5, dies in a car accident. He glances to his wife and child, and Nana mentions her seatbelt is stuck. The wife walks towards him and a car hits the car containing his child. It explodes and then she dies. The rest of the movie is about him seeing the newspaper repeatedly and trying to help others. I recommend this anyone who enjoys Japanese movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG BANG!","review":"This movie starts out with a bang and ends with a bang. It's the middle that tends to drag on. It has a few good scarry moments, but not many. I'm a huge fan of Asian horror and I'm not sure this movie belongs in that genre. The one thing that seems to be consistent in Asian cinema is that no matter what genre, horror, gangster, revenge, there always seems to be that underlying human element and the theme of redemption. And that's what I love about it. What intrigues me the most about this story is the father's intense love for his daughter and wife. This love is at the core of the movie and motivates the father to make the choice which sets him free.It's a good movie. You won't regret watching it even if it is a little slow at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similar to Butterfly Effect","review":"This movie is pretty good--with a fair amount of suspense-it also holds your attention to the conclusion. The ending is quite similar to Butterfly Effect--if you see both--you'll know what I mean--but I don't want to give the ending away! Basically, Hideki sees newspaper storys before they happen--though only on a few occasions-the first occurrence--he takes no action and the results are horrendous-for him and his wife.Later a young girl is involved--and as in \\"Running on Karma\\"--Hideki finds himself unable to change fate (Karma, destiny, kismet--take your pick) Nothing overly original-but still good entertainment and a better than average way to spend an hour and a half with the tv! To rent or to buy--hard to say--I bought it and have no regrets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this was filmed at the same time as juon...","review":"it reminded me of the ring only instead of a phone call you get a newspaper. original? not really. scary? nope. tense moments yes. should be enjoyed if you are into this horror asian movement going on right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie, that is the word.","review":"Japanese horror is giving a lesson to American horror. This movie with very little special effects and a great philosophical charge can have a great impact in audiences. Destiny is the main focus in \\"Premonition\\".Can we change it? what could happen if we do? In the end it is better to let things go the way they are supposed to go...and to the people who compare it with \\"the ring\\": the newspaper doesn't kill you like the video tape does, it just tells you when and how you are going to die. So it is an entirely different dynamic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully creepy","review":"I really love the Japanese horror movies of the last decade. This one, in particular, deftly renders the emotional agony that comes from the death of a child and the destruction of a family. The muted colors, the hushed voices (the sound editing is excellent) create a high degree of conceptual continuity around the struggle against hopelessness, inevitability, and despair.If I say much more, I will spoil the movie, but if you liked Ringu and Ju-On, I think you will like this movie as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money","review":"If you own MCE 2005, don't bother with this book.

He does this by laying out a series of easy to follow steps that quickly gets the reader on the road to making money. This inspirational book is simple to understand and apply.

This is a very natural way of organizing these principles.

A tea strainer is a tea strainer, and I find this style to be more convenient than a tea ball when I'm at work.

The sticker is very sticky, and although I've peeled off the paper, the glue simply won't come off. Nail polish remover only made it worse. Nothing I can do with soap, scrubbing it with a sponge, my nails, anything, can get this glue off. I don't want glue in my tea. So this perfectly good tea strainer is rendered useless by Bodum's lack of intelligent thought. They could've put the sticker on the bottom of the part that sits on the table, not the part that goes in your tea.

Double the price, on disc one show the film and on disc 2 have full versions of 2 hours of Artists. And I mean everyone from the 3 song electric Dylan to some Joan and all the biggies to the more obscure examples of our culture like the cloggers shouters etc. 2 things would then happen, I could watch the film without the constant feeling of coitus interuptus and see some killer acts from my very young life and our culture as a people.

Was the lure of selling books more important than protecting a woman's dignity and privacy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alzheimer's?","review":"I noted the other day that Mr. Breslin has just retired, and, as I read this book (or tried), I wondered, and I'm dead serious about this, if he's contracted Alzheimer's. Ill or not, he certainly doesn't have an editor; he can't have. There were at least three sentences per page that were simply indecipherable, this after repeated readings. It was similarly impossible to tell, in his description of events, when they occurred and, in some case, in what country! Whole chapters seemed pointless non sequiturs. The reading experience for me was so puzzling that I picked up another book to see if I would be similarly confused; perhaps I was the one with Alzheimer's. But I guess when you've won a Pulitzer you can get away with anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is Jimmy Breslin's editor?","review":"This book is filled with errors--dates, spelling, grammar, names, etc. How can a Pulitizer Prize winning author attach his name to such poor writing? Breslin had such an important topic to write about. He let the victims down in his attempt to bring down the Church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Falsities ans Mistruths abound in this book.","review":"This book is based solely on conjecture and unsubstantiated allegations of the supposed victims. Mr. Breslin gives a completely biased view of the truth and turns hearsay into rock hard facts. He doesn't care to know that there are two sides to every story, or simply wishes to ignore facts that would uncover the truth.As a native of an area referenced in the book, I can tell you that some of his geographic locations and certain assumptions are wrong, which makes you question his research and scholarship.Just remember that if you buy this book you are getting a weakly researched distorted view of the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeking authentic renewal","review":"It's one thing to be \\"mad\\" along with Breslin and many of us others, but it's quite another to be \\"mad\\" and have a grasp of the whole subject.If you're looking for an experiential, critical examination of this crisis, but one with a deeply thorough understanding of the Faith, - scripture, theology, history, look no further than \\"The Courage to be Catholic\\" by George Weigel - also available on Amazon.comUnfortunately, there's too much theological confusion among lay Catholics these days without adding another emotionally muddy tome. I would have expected better of Mr. Breslin.I recieved a promotional email from Amazon.com about this book, - but it's the farthest thing from a thorough approach to the Church I've seen in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizzare","review":"This book is one long run on sentence. It jumps from one idea to the next with out finishing much. Facts are wrong, places are wrong, if he can't get those correct, how likely is it that the rest of the facts got checked. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take your anger with you!","review":"How anyone of right mind could rate this book five stars! Jimmy Breslin is an angry, vindictive, and devisive has-been in literature. Sure many reviewers on Amazon jump on the bandwagon, going so far as accusing Bishop Murphy of Rockville Centre of being the antichrist, but have you ever read a word the man has written that is not in that literary rag Newsday? Sure we have a right to be disappointed in our church and it's leaders, but when will the fury end? If you cannot let go of the anger, and you want to live in the world of perpetual hate, buy this book.There are lots of options for places to worship God, if you are really that miserable under the leadership that exists, please, for the sake of we who stay, please leave, and take your anger with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritual Suicide","review":"St Francis de Sales, a very insightful & deeply spiritual writer, lived in a time of numerous scandals in the Catholic Church, somewhat similar to those of recent years. He equated, famously, the committing of such acts by priests to \\"spiritual murder\\" but also said that those, as Breslin has done, who would allow the scandal to drive them from the Church Christ founded on earth were committing \\"spiritual suicide\\". Jesus said it Himself: the gates of hell will not prevail against His Church. Mr Breslin would do well to return to God's word & remind himself what Christ has promised us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the South","review":"Scarface is undeniably the King of The South when it comes to rap, wheter he wants the title or not. I would urge rap fans to give Scarface a listen if they haven't yet. His voice is original and laid back and he spits great lyrics. For anybody looking to get into Scarface this is the CD to get. All great songs, nothin to skip on this one.1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Props to Scarface","review":"Without a doubt Scarface is one of My All-time Favorite MC's. He truly brings His Own Flavor & vision on these tracks from over the years.I dig His Story-telling & Presentation.He takes on so many different aspects of Life&just lets it all flow. This is a Solid Collection of His Career thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarface GREATEST HITS review!","review":"To anyone who knows their hip-hop, Scarface is the king of the Dirty South. Just as important to the Southern rap scene as Tupac Shakur was to the West Coast, Face has had quite a career. From member of the Geto Boyz to breakout solo act, Scarface has pretty much done it all. Now, Rap-A-Lot finally releases a \\"greatest hits\\" retrospective.If you consider yourself a rap know-it-all and you aren't familiar with Face's work then you are making a false claim and you need to pick up this record now. From collaborations with Tupac Shakur on \\"Smile\\" to long-forgotten gems like \\"Jesse James\\" to his latest banger, \\"Guess Who's Back\\" with Jay-Z & Beanie Siegel, this CD does an excellent job in collecting some of Mr. Scarface's most infectious offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUBBY VERY HAPPY............","review":"someone stole his CD of Scarface and he was pee-ode about it. so he was very happy when it came in the mail"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars cuz it's Face... 3 if you judge the selection.","review":"Umm.. Scarface is the man. That's why this gets 4 stars. If you look at the selection though of \\"greatest hits\\".. um.. no. These are not his greatest hits. Some good tracks on here, but definitely not his best. I hate it when people make these compilations because I know I could do them better. Every time. Someone hit me up and ask me to make their greatest hits CDs, because every time I make a mix tape of any artist it comes out tight. I choose the jams, not the \\"hits\\". Oh well. For a real Scarface experience, get \\"The Diary\\", or \\"Last of a Dying Breed\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for horse lovers!","review":"It is a good book. The book is about a horse named Sparten that was in an accident that killed Amy's mom. Amy is trying to cure Sparten, but he is scared of her. I did not like that they didn't talk much about how they cured the horses. If you like horses, it is a good series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read and a amazing series","review":"I love this book-Amy is getting over her mother's death when the horse they were trying to save is brought back to the farm and he hates Amy. She tries everything but can't reach the horse.Recommendation-I recommend this book to everyone that loves horses. I'm 13 and found it an easy read. But this book was nice to read while relaxing or for something that you could read after a test or between classes.This series-I have read this whole series and it is a great seies. Amy grows and learns a lot over during the seies. Lauren Brooke writes amazingly.True- At first I thought this book was made up and had nothing real in it at all. The fact is the things they use are actually real. I hacve another seies and they refer to Monty Roberts useing the join up that Amy uses in her training methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever","review":"This book is a wonderful book for all ages. In this book, Amy has to fix the behavior of yet another horse. But, there's only one difference. The rescuing of this horse was the cause of her mother's death. This book teaches its readers that hatred only exists because a trust was never formed. This book has cataclysm in it, but the alleviation is more heart-warming than anything. This book is part of my favorite series of books, and after you start reading them, I'm sure they'll be your favorite too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Udmrket!","review":"Myths From Medieval Iceland is the best slice of Nordic culture since Iceland's Bjrk Gudmundsdottir burst on the pop scene with her band Sugarcubes. Seriously, this recording of exerpts from the Edda are executed with as much passion as Sequentia ever put in to recording the entire works of Hildegard von Bingen. The universal appeal of this work was verified by one of my clarinet students when he took this and 5 other examples of Medieval music to give a presentation in an English class. The Icelandic offering was the clear favorite among TEENAGERS! It is heartbreaking that the world lost Sequentia's co-founder Barbara Thornton during the final editing phase of this recording. She had such a perfect balance between historically informed performance practices and delivering work with unbridled passion. What a loss. We are truly fortunate that she left behind such immaculate work as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for real women to learn exotic dancing @ home.","review":"This is a real instructional video, and for real women. I love it. This has been a great series. Using the chair and slow movements, it is much easier to start with. Even with my neck injury causing me to skip some moves, there are plenty of others to fill in with. So it is nice if you have health issues, check with your doctor and work around them. Good exercise and stretching to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Exotic Chair Dancing here","review":"I was very disappointed with this DVD. Hip rolls and eye contact was the main focus of their instruction. With the titles of \\"Master Instructors\\" I was anticipating a more moves, instructions and routines. This was more of an instruction video for someone never exposed to chair or exotic moves. I would not recommend this video to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No audio","review":"The TV has no audio. If you do not purchase the speakers, there will be no sound. I was extremely upset to have to connect external audio system.

So everyday I'll have a couple of handfuls of PLANTERS DRY ROASTED, LIGHTLY SALTED PEANUTS. And when you get the big 16-ounce jar that's a lot of handfuls.These goobers have 50% less sodium than the regular DRY ROASTED PEANUTS. As I (and most everyone else) need to cut back on my sodium intake, that's a big plus. Not only that, these oven-roasted nuts have zero cholesterol. So no wonder the medical people tell us snacks such as peanuts can be heart healthy; just don't overdo the snacking, as there are plenty of fat grams in a single serving. And the best thing about PLANTERS DRY ROASTED, LIGHTLY SALTED PEANUTS is the taste; they're a delcious snack (and your ticker will be thanking you).--D.

As Planter peanuts go they're OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"The illustrations are captivating!","review":"My 3 year-old and I fell in love with this book during a storytime session at our public library. We not only enjoyed the story but were captivated by the pop-out illustrations. This is a must have for our home library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been driving me mad!","review":"This gorgeous book would be great, if not for a glaring error in the first sentence. Penguins don't live in the Arctic! Therefore they would never come in contact with polar bears! The furtherest north they live is the Galapogas Islands, so we're not even talking about the same hemisphere let alone the same continent. I like showing this book to my 2 year old but everytime I read the first sentence it puts me off for the rest of the story. If the author ever checks these reviews, I hope he writes a revised edition, cos' apart from this it's a beautiful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhhhh... not what I expected","review":"If your reading this, its a 99% chance that you heard Juno Reactor uses Psychoslaphead as an alias. That is true. I say that because almost anyone who has heard this CD would hardly recommend it by word of mouth. I have tremendous respect for Juno Reactor, but this is not even in the same universe as other Juno songs.Basically this is a remix CD of 1 song. The first mix is my favorite \\"Hannibal the Cannibal\\", but its hard to differenciate between the others because they sound so much the same (even for a remix.)I gave this CD two stars only because I'm a huge fan of Juno. But don't kid yourself. IF you arn't a die-hard electronic music head, then stay far away from this CD. There are much, much better albums to be had."},{"rating":"1","title":"...um, yeah...","review":"i have to agree with \\"Mike\\" that is isn't a good album, though i picked it up only because i saw it was on the Wax Trax! label.

Not worth buying, not really even worth listening to for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I ordered this because my boyfriend and I make cappuccino every morning and can't get enough foam from our machine.

It doesn't look as nice, last as long or, more importantly, froth as well or as quickly. A false economy. Sorry, Bodum, you may be great in french presses but the sepcialist aerolatte company seems to do this sort of thing a lot, lot more effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the froth??","review":"I used to have a Bodum Aerius tall milk frother. I loved it. It was simple, didn't use batteries, and made great froth. A friend of mine loved it so much I gave it to her when she left for overseas. Unfortunately, it has been discontinued.I received this frother as a free bonus on Amazon. As the other reviewers have indicted, it doesn't have a manual. I did figure out how to put the batteries in, but after a few attempts I am REALLY disappointed in the froth. It went down immidiately after I removed the frother -- I had \\"frothed\\" it for a good 2 minutes. That was more than enough for my old hand opperated frother. As I indicated, I received this frother for free. If I had paid for it, I would certainly return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Thank goodness I got this so-called frother for free when I purchased my new Cuisinart coffee maker or else I'd be upset. This thing is like a child's toy. It's messy and worse yet: ineffective. Do not, repeat, NOT waste your money on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not froth","review":"This beats the milk into large bubbles which soon disappear. It does not froth into small bubbles that hold up. It is a waste. If it had the little wisk attachment of the Melitta handheld milk frother for around $..., it would be wonderful. The Melitta number is MEMf1BKIT, and the San Francisco Chronicle said it was wonderful, and it is. It used to be sold at Target, and I wish they would get more."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUMBED WITH BODUM","review":"I bought the Bodum Frother, White and received it around April 19, 2005. I used it for two cups of coffee every day for ONE WEEK. It did froth. Then it quit! I am returning it.

I do not appreciate Bodum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this trying to find a cheap way to froth milk. No matter what I tried (hot, cold, low-fat, half & half) it never made anything close to froth. I've had better luck just using a small shaker. If you use a shaker with a capacity about double the amount of milk you put in, and shake for about 30 seconds, you will get results as good as any manual or electric frother. I ordered a Hamilton Beach espresso maker based on good reviews and low price, and I am looking forward to real steam generated froth."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Mistake","review":"Every so often, one makes the mistake of believing an advertisement (editorial review) and bites!

They hang on for about 30 minutes and then they're gone. I'm not sure why these bandages are not made with the same glue that they used to but something needs to be changed. If you can't go very long without reapplying it, what's the point? You're almost better off looking conspicuous and applying gauze and tape. At least you'll know that it will be there an hour from the time of application. It's a great idea but they really haven't figured out how to make it stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Symphony should play these songs","review":"On our last day of a 2 week vacation in South Africa we were introduced to this album by a record shop owner in Johannesburg. We asked for advise for purchasing African music and he suggested this album. The music is \\"happy music\\" that picks you up and makes you want to dance. It is a great album to own or to give to someone you love. The first cut is a great rendition of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\". The strings meld elegantly with chants. The fifth cut, \\"Eureka\\", is another of my favorites. It is a cheerful violin piece that reminds me of a country fiddle. I hope that every symphony in the country listens to this album and plays songs from it along with the usual Mozart. Trust me -- buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted for Christmas.....","review":"....and I got it!

Teen-sounding voices say a word (twice) followed by it's translation (twice) all with keyboard music playing in the background. It's impossible to concentrate with all the repetition and music, AND the french words do not sound like they are spoken by native french speakers; they sound like a group of latino teens posing as students who have studied french for five minutes.

And when Milo beat Dories face up so horribly and ground a little kittens head to pulp under the heel of his boot, that finally did it for me,(that happened on page 187)and thats when the book made it into the garbage can.

So not only does the author share what he saw and heard, but he includes reports from other witnesses, also. His viewpoint would seem biased at times if it were not for the fact that not only did he obtain government reports, but he also went to great lengths to get some Confederate prisoners' first hand accounts.My favorite chapters are on the ones about the tunnel escape and Sergeant Benson's story. Also, emotionally touching to read was the chapter on the former slave responsible for buring the dead.Everthing from living conditions to the number of prisoners released is covered in this book.

Have also tried running it straight in to a recording device, and the result is always the same: a god-awful, horrible-sounding muddy tone that cannot be helped with all the EQ in the world. It is not good for metal, or any other genre for that matter. I realize it is probably not meant to record with, but i feel that anybody who is searching for a good studio guitar tone should certainly look elsewhere. If you have a combo amp, the distortion on it is probably way better than you will get with this pedal. BOSS makes some great products, but this is definitely not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pedal!","review":"I ordered this pedal on July 2nd and received it on July 11, one day earlier than the estimated arrival time. I saw no damages or anything wrong with the pedal when I received it. If you are looking for a pedal to gig with and really rock out on, this is your pedal! The gain has a wide range and it comes with four equalizer knobs. With this pedal, you can really sculpt your tone to fit your playing style. I play a lot of Metallica and this pedal just about mirrors Metallica's sound on such songs as, \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Seek and Destroy\\". (If you have your settings right) I have already gigged with this pedal and it worked really well. The bypass is really nice too. I would definitely recommend this pedal for a Heavy Metal player and I greatly recommend this for Metallica players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift to teenager","review":"My son loved this distortion pedal.

A chain of comical events occurs on 90th Street, where \\"Nothing ever happens.\\" Eva has to write something for school and has no ideas. But then, all of a sudden, things begin to happen. A pizza peddler is hit by a limo, the pizza man and a dancer fall in love, and a cat stuck in a tree. But there's more, some of it real, and some of it maybe imagined by Eva. The neighbors chime in with writing tips, like Mr. Morley, a mousse maker, who says, \\"Don't forget the poetry in your pudding.\\" The illustrator uses zany collages that are great!

The new title could be \\"No Really...Nothing ever happens on 90th Street...I Mean It!\\" Now the illustrations were great! I love the loose style of the artist.

Its really hard, especially while going down the road in a car (having a sadistic driver did not help). The graphics are poor but adequate for the game. the system is robust, more than one of use tried to rip it in half.

It was very disappointing to read through the book, because there are cute designs that I would like to make, however, I know in advance that the knitting and garment construction is going to be confusing and painful.

I play through an Egnater Rebel 30 and a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe. Although both of these amps sound great on their own, this pedal adds yet another dimension. I gave up playing in clubs years ago and now I play primarily for my enjoyment and I write and record my original tunes in my home studio. Whether I am using an axe with single coils or hum buckers, this pedal shines. I have always felt Boss makes the best pedals and I have many Boss products. I also have some EH, Dunlop and MXR pedals. I used a Tube Screamer for a short while and never understood the hype it gets. This pedal blows the Ibanez out of the studio and off the stage.

The person who doesn't believe in survival of death is constantly winning the discussion over the person who does, and the latter keeps switching views as each idea of his is \\"disproven,\\" often by a trivial objection.It poses as an introduction to the topic, but the overwhelming impression given--that there is no significant philosophical support for survival of death, and moreover that people who believe in it aren't very bright--makes it a terrible resource for a beginner, and not nearly comprehensive or convincing enough for the persuasive piece it actually is."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for being short ...","review":"... but one star is all it gets.

Most of the scholarship is hopelessly out of date (and much of it already was when he wrote it) and he is too uncritical of the grand theorising of Simson & Panofsky et al. If it is to be used, it should be read in conjunction with Paul Crossley's footnotes to Frankl.

Such is the case when reading this book. In its pages, Divine truths are taught by higher beings who speak in poetical metaphor. If you read slowly, letting each dialogue sink in, you will find a wealth of new insight and gain a clearer concept of your relationship to the Divine. If you are skeptical of the authenticity of the dialogues, consider the circumstances under which they were transcribed. Consider how three of the four individuals taught by the angels went to their deaths in the concentration camps with a dignity and calm that amazed and inspired those around them. Consider those that were saved by Gitta with the help of the angels. Consider that Gitta refused any royalites from the sale of any of the books.

I found one very inspiring, 5 stars, the other a one-star gumbo of New Age cliches. The real-life story of the four people, three of whom sacrifice themselves so their friend, the fourth, and a group of women and children can survive, is incredibly inspiring and moving. I cried for a long time after reading their stories. These four are simply remarkable people in every sense, and the book is well worth reading in order to learn the story of their lives. The angels' conversation with the four, however, was a letdown. Just New Age cliches, it seemed to me, not very specific or meaningful. The meaning in this book is to be found in the human lives, and the choices these remarkable people made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific young adult book!!!!","review":"If you enjoyed books like \\"Hatchet\\" --- then you'll truly enjoy \\"Between a Rock & a Hard Place.\\" I'm 31 years old & read it after my kids were done with it --- couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"The book between a rock and a hard place is the best book I've ever read.

As with other comments, the hole is large and it doesnt keep anything in. All the fluid runs out or shoots out leaving a very frustrated cook. The bulb attaches well but the ring does not. One suck and its laying in the oven.

From the moment I picked it up to the moment I finished it, the book didn't leave my side. I absolutely loved it. It opened my eyes to science fiction books.I recommend it for anyone wanting a good simple read that is totally enveloping. I great introduction to science fiction books."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's almost funny","review":"Words cannot express how bad this book is. It reads like a (poor) attempt at creative writing by a 12-year old.The characters are puerile and the dialogue reads like a group of pre-pubescent teenagers trying to impress one another.The plot makes no sense whatsoever, the writing is badly disjointed and the Kindle formatting is all over the place.I cannot believe that this was published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to learn, great reference for college biology","review":"I found this book to help me to clarify the concepts learned in my biology textbook. Cell biology, Evolution, Origin of Life and Animal Physiology were explained with simple language. It was actually more enjoyable to read then my textbook. What I really found outstanding was the following which I got on amazon--The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations (Volume 1 isbn;1933023007, Volume 2 isbn; 1933023015, Volume 3 isbn; 1933023023)These 3 study guides had similar questions to my college biology exams. Well worth the investment because it made my studying much more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"Certainly a summary, as advertised ... and for a senior who wants to revisit biology it's fine. However, the illustrations are not necessarily close to the descriptions, sometimes the text reads like bad translation (from ??), and each chapter badly needs an overview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncommon Sense should be REQUIRED reading for all Americans.","review":"Stated Simply, this book is the single best, easily comprehendable book on Americanism.The author doesn't woo you with complex legal citings, boggle your mind with twists in logical and fanciful leaps.In fact this book will help you indentify what kind of American you are, what kind of American you truely want to be, and how to recognize the difference between Real-Americans and those who claim or even think that they are being patriotic, but are are undermining the country we live in, mostly through confussion and inaction.I wish I could afford to buy a copy for every person alive, it should be required reading for all Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT FOR PROSTATE SUFFERERS AND SURVIVORS!!","review":"This book chronicles more than one man's struggle with this dreadful disease.

Walker has captured a very emotional experience in a concise and readable manner. He takes the reader on an unforgettable journey of anxiety; confusion; doubt; revelation; indecision and the whole gamut of emotional dysfunction that accompanies being diagnosed with cancer.As a layman, he has a knack for asking the right questions and taking technical terms and turning them into plain, everyday language.This book should be read by all men (and their families) who are confronted with a diagnosis or who are symptomatic of prostate cancer. It is sincerely hoped that Rev.

He's a real powerhouse on stage - and this CD does a nice job of showcasing his multiple talents. It's an easy listen; something for everyone. I really enjoy every cut on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a progression!","review":"My first exposure to Martin Sexton was back in 1990... he was performing in a red-line subway station in Boston, waiting for loose change to be thrown into his open guitar case. I bought one of his homemade cassettes and enjoyed it... his lyrical voice and overall rich talent are as memorable now as they were then! I'm glad to see he's recording on a major label and getting the recognition he deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Same But Worth It","review":"Martin Sexton makes me stop what I'm doing and just listen to his voice, usually with my eyes closed to get the full effect. He's amazing. But I was a little taken aback to hear how \\"produced\\" this new album is. Still, I found myself listening with my eyes closed -- so that's a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My friend had put the older version of \\"Glory Bound\\" on a mix she gave me. I fell in love with the song and was excited to find a new musician. I went and bought \\"The American.\\" I found none of the same raw, sparse guitar and vocals that I loved in \\"Glory Bound.\\" There are some good moments in the album, but there are too many catchy or hokey parts of it. In the title track there are back-up country singers. Every song begins with promise and then is ruined by some element of overproduction. Next time, Sexton, get better production advice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The American\\" pales in comparison to \\"Black Sheep\\"","review":"When Ravel rearranged Mussorgsky's piano piece \\"Scenes from an Exhibition\\" for full orchestra, it came alive in full 3-D color. When Martin Sexton rerecorded his signature song \\"Glory Bound\\", which was a perfect symbiosis of voice and guitar in its original form, into a quasi-rock song for a studio band, the result was a diffuse watered-down disappointment with no grip (similar to, but not quite as bad as Don McLean's live \\"American Pie\\" with the Tonight Show Orchestra). Like many others, I heard the first \\"Glory Bound\\" on public radio and almost instantly regarded it as one of my favorite folk ballads of all time. When I bought \\"Black Sheep\\" I became hugely impressed with Sexton's vocal agility, much moreso than his songwriting ability. I've heard that he is amazing in concert, but \\"The American\\" shows an innate lack of musicianship as well as a disconnection between Sexton and his own songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"music producer-west coast","review":"Martin Sexton. Wow. This guy has a voice that will knock you over. What a virtuoso. The lyrics are tender and real. Great guitar work. After many years on the east coast street scene he has developed a rock solid sound that is captivating. You gotta have one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with frequent listening","review":"My wife introduced me to Martin Sexton when we saw him live in Reno. Pretty good, I thought. The American also found its way to our cd rotation when we went to our first Strawberry Music Festival together. Certain songs stood out including 'Diggin Me' and 'Station Man'. But overall I thought the cd was nothing special. However, this cd is like a really cool box you find in your attic...the more you dig through it the more fun and interesting stuff you find. Many of the songs resonate with real power and Sexton's voice is simply amazing with the way it stays in flux: constantly changing and flipping around. Vocal gymnastics comes to mind. I think the more you listen to this cd the more you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preschoolers can READ!","review":"My son learned to read with this software at age 4! He loved using it & we were surprised at how fast he learned. He loved to play the games & was learning, too!

I would recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight wires both good and bad","review":"Pretty high quality. The tight wires work very well for whipping things like eggs and liquids.

I guess you achieve some new level of cool when you don't like things that alot of people DO like. But in that case, I would worry that only CRAP was credible. This is a good album with just as much obscurity as previous efforts from the X-man. Maybe it just seems more mainstream because breaks are becoming more high profile."},{"rating":"1","title":"No vale la pena","review":"El CD solo contiene 3 canciones nuevas, y para ser un disco de despedida creo que los fans se merecian mas que eso, pero les dos una estrella porque el arte y las fotografias son muy poco originales y feas, las dos paginas con fotografias de ellos cuando estaban mas chicos es lo unico bueno.Que desepcion para haber sido el ultimo disco, se merecia algo de mas calidad, y algo con mas imaginacion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down.","review":"Total Disappointment.To be their last CD. Is just bad, It does not even include new versions of the songs, except for three. They did not include any of the songs from their first CD.The only good song is \\"No me Voy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible genius","review":"This album has just about everything discerning lovers of indie guitar music could ever wish for - beauty, passion, complexity, originality, even humour - it's so good it makes me laugh. Every listen unearths different treasures as the songs effortlessly glide from complex angular dischordancy to the perfect pop hook. The guitars are so truly inventive they have to be heard to be believed, whilst the vocals are pure and heart-wrenching.

This system is the greatest you can use it on its own, but the lyrics are in black and white, and many cd's other than the mtv ones do not show the highlighted words well enough. However the problem can be easily solved by plugging it into a colored tv. The tracks take a couple of seconds to load, but who cares when your having this much fun.

That is, until about 15 minutes into playing with it when the onscreen monitor went black in the middle of the screen and you could no longer see the lyrics. It will have to be returned for another, which I hope doesn't have reliability problems. Fun machine, but seems to have a reliability question mark hovering above it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the other one!","review":"Buy the one that goes through your TV. This is a waste of time.

There are some lovely little messages sprinkled throughout the novel, but the sheer obviousness of the storyline is somewhat disappointing. There is nothing earth shattering here; so if you are looking for a feelgood read, this is it, those looking for high art will need to look elsewhere. 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated sap","review":"Have we bought into the consumer culture so deeply and removed ourselves so far from an awareness of self and others that a novel that reads like an extended high school composition--dressing up common sense as some sort of homespun wisdom--is able to touch us so profoundly? Contrived, predictable, sentimental, and poorly written (good writing suggests, it doesn't bludgeon), Tending Roses never once surprises, and with its stock characters, wooden dialogue, and lame family anecdotes that the Vongortler clan inexplicably find so humorous, it rings false from page two (starts with an enticing first paragraph) to end. For agrarian fiction that truly resonates, may I suggest Wendell Berry's The Memory of Old Jack, A Place on Earth, or Jayber Crow--fiction to be read slowly and savored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't buy into it","review":"Maybe I should have stuck with this book, but I just couldn't make myself.

It is a comfy, cozy read that reconciles past wounds and brokenness in a way that could only be the hand of God. It is a healing that all of us would desire. Written in a gentle and beautiful way. Love the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only read one book this year, READ THIS ONE!","review":"I COULD NOT put this book down. I stayed up all night reading, slept for three hours in the morning, then got up and started reading again. I bought a copy of this book through a Z-shop a few days ago, and since then I have been telling everyone they must read Tending Roses! I am buying copies for all of my daughters, sisters, and friends.This book has it all-- a wonderful story, charaters who are real and compelling, and beautiful family memories delivered by a grandmother to a granddaughter. When you read it, you will laugh often, and cry often, but you will be very touched by Kate and Grandma Rose. Both ornery, wise, and loving, Grandma Rose is a character I will never forget. I can not wait to see this author's next book. I love to read, but I have never, ever been affected like this by a book before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read and A Beautiful Book!!","review":"I can't remember being moved by a book like I was by this one. This was the first time I felt the need to write a review, and I have been telling every reader I know put this one at the top of his or her list. One cousin read my copy, then immediately bought one for herself and one for her mother. You will love Grandma Rose, and sympathize with her and with her family who face a difficult decision. If you have been faced with problems surrounding elderly parents and/or grandparents, you will identify with the characters, and will be moved to tears. I find it hard to believe this was a first novel. Lisa Wingate will have a hard time topping this one but I look forward to more. Please read this book. It deserves recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about family!","review":"Looking for a great book about faith and family? This is it. This book will have you crying and laughing. Grandma Rose is a lovable character who can produce so much emotion. Also, this lady possesses so much wisdom.

I had resisted, because she and I usually don'tlike the same books. I am generally a reader of mystery/suspense. BUT, I have to say that Tending Roses made a convert out of me. I am used to books that captivate me with action and mystery. This book captivated me with real characters, realistic questions about life, and a writing style that was just magical. From the first page to the last, I could not put it down. I read it in two days, laughed, cried, saved it for my bookshelf, and thanked my mother for telling me to read it. A quick, but truly emotional read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her first book made me a lifelong fan!","review":"Tending RosesI just LOVE this book! Made me a lifelong fan of ALL books by Lisa Wingate! I bought at least 6 copies of this first one, as gifts, and my own copy has been loaned to friends across the USA and even overseas.

It has a final resting place with my sis in VA, who promises to continue the sharing of it with her friends on limited budgets who cannot buy it.

Excellent author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The meaning behind this book is wonderful","review":"The meaning behind the story is absolutely wonderful.....put your family first, forgiveness, slow down and smell the roses, etc. The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 instead of a 4 is because I thought it started out much too slow, it didn't grip me for awhile. I wouldn't have kept with it without the support of such positive reviews from others who have read it. Even though it started out slow, it turned out to be a beautiful story. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book . . .","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It was heartwarming, touching, the setting was nice, and the characters were believeable. But I just could not care about their problems. There just seemed to be too many problems, and they seemed too ordinary. In the end, the writing style and the plot, while nice, could not generate in me enough interest to get me to want to keep reading. It's a nice book for somebody, but the pace was just too slow for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down the Fairway","review":"Purchased after a program on XM radio's golf station mentioned this book.

It was kind of what I expected; except better."},{"rating":"2","title":"pond maintenance","review":"The Columbia boot foot wader makes pond maintenance much more do-able.

It was the musical highlight of the movie, and also one of the best dance songs I've heard in a long time. It's a real pity that it wasn't part of their 'Second Toughest in the Infants' album, which is, in my opinion, one of the best electronica albums ever. But the two, this maxi-single and the album, do go hand in hand. You can't go wrong: get 'em both and enjoy the trance..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet","review":"While I don't own this, I've heard all of what's on here. And based on the single alone, the Born Slippy single is worth every penny. Basically this little CD contains Underworld's well known classic. Actually this little beauty was my first exposure into Underworld and what got me hooked. In truth, Born Slippy is a pretty simple song. A simple synth riff play wrapped around Karl Hyde's staccato delivery with his patanted stream of conciousness lyrics. Added later into the song is bass heavy beat that in of itself holds most of the song till its climax and ending. Born Slippy as whole shows Underworld's skill as producers and song writers, knowing how to hook a listener with something so simple but something so incredible. Essential for any techno and Underworld fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"funky soul! lives on .","review":"Funk and soul rule over rap. And this band still has big hit cds as they lay down sweet soul and funk with greatness. This one had the monster hit on it 'that lady' that has a cool guitar sound. One of the bros recently passed and it was one of the younger guys. But this music stands heads above what is done today from anyone. It has style and power. They even do a funky version of 'listen to the music' the doobie brothers classic. Back in the day even rockers could really relate to bands like this one who made real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"defects","review":"I had a sony clie and a Palm a while back and both didn't last me very long.

After around a month, his lost everything. It was sent to be fixed, but after another month, it lost its memory again! By this time, mine also was losing its files. Both PDAs were sent to be fixed only to still delete memory. The repair man said not to let their batteries run out all the way, but by this time, the life of one charge would only last a day if I was lucky and that was if it hadn't been on.

Today, I never use it anymore because it simply will not turn on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR NOVICES","review":"I am new to the PDA world, so when I received this as a Christmas gift last year, I was pretty excited about my new gadget. However, once I got into the meat of trying to use it, I found that it is not a user friendly system when it comes to the HotSync, etc functions. Additionally, as a novice, I'd expected the CDRom to provide more instruction for usage than it did. In fact, there was absolutely NO user instructions enclosed at all. Additionally, I recently lost every iota of data in the thing because there was never any instruction on how to save your information and prevent it from being lost. I wouldn't recommend this unit if you've never used one before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Mac! GRRRRRRRRR!","review":"The PEG-SJ22 is great itself, but the reason why I put only two stars is because - guess what? - there is no software included for the Macintosh! Personally, I am a Macintosh user and evangelist and believe that Microsoft is an evil software empire, and the fact that I had to go looking for drivers really annoys me. If Sony really wants this product to get the extra three stars, they should include some documentation on how to install the drivers on a Mac, or at least where to find them. And also put the documentation in a more obvious place on their CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading information","review":"The Sony Clie SJ22 will only sync with it's own software, not with Microsoft Outlook, unless you purchase Intellisync Litesoftware. It provided the Intellisync software for earlier models that advertised it did syn with Outlook. Now there is no reference to needing additional purchased software to allow it to syn with Outlook. It does not tell you that in the literature, and they do not supply an instruction manual, you only have the introductory basics on the cd rom, and if you want more information how it works, you must buy the \\"advanced instructions\\". When I called customer support, I was told to goto the website www.pumatech.com to purchase Intellisyc Lite.As a first time owner of a handheld PDA, I am very sorry I bought this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid, but not 100% perfect","review":"I have also lost data by allowing the unit to fully discharge (on vacation, away from an outlet). While the info is backed-up on my computer, not too helpful when you're hundreds of miles away! The graphics are excellent. Also, the interface is super easy to use. I was a Palm user before this and have been equally satisfied. The advantage to me was the memory stick expansion slot. Sony makes a solid product, it's just not 100% perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love mine!!","review":"I got this as a Christmas present and it is my first handheld so maybe I'm not as picky... I just love it,though. It has everything this mom needs and I put on some new programs for fun(like the addictive bejeweled game!) Yes, it doesn't sync up with my microsoft works bundle calender, etc., but it took under an hour to put it all into their Desktop program for transfer. I can transfer my mail and web pages to view while I'm waiting for the kids, so for me this is great.My only complaint (which maybe I just haven't found the right program yet) is that I can't play any MP3 files. I downloaded one program and the sound was horrible so I'm going to keep looking, but it might be my speakers (I don't know). I love having pictures of my family on it and I can watch video clips, too.

I got used to it real quick and was already downloading and intalling programs on it. It has an easy interface for those not interested in sophisticated models and enough sophistication to give the hardcore pda lovers enogh work on their hands. When my friends with pocket pc's saw it, they started thinking twice about their pocket pc because of the simple yet precise functionality of the PEG - SJ22. This is a prodcut that has it all, from entertainment, to serious business as well as made for students. You'll not regret buying it because its graphics, speed, functionality are all great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great colour screen; sleek little device","review":"A first time PDA user, I got this device as a gift. I like it very much. The screen colours are big, bright and crisp. Play decent movie clips too. The case is stylish and relatively light. Easy & fun to use. I am able to sync with Outlook XP's mail using the included software without any problems. For other features of Outlook (address book, to-do, etc), I use CompanionLink. The battery life could improve, but I can use the gadget for 4-5 hours between each re-charge. Would have liked it more if it comes with applications for viewing Word / Excel / PDF files, but for an entry-level device, I shouldn't ask for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the Cost","review":"I replaced my Palm VIIx witht eh SJ22 and could not be happier. It is very zippy and the screen is the best I have seen for the price. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that I can only go 2 work days between battery charges. But seeing that I charge it up every other night it is not a big deal. If I was traveling I would buy a second charging unit or the car charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"you have to buy the advanced guide","review":"I have been using a Palm for 5 years, figured it was time to upgrade.

The interview with Denny Laine is also of interest. Unfortunately, Guiliano is a self-promoting writer whose sketchy narrative is mostly quotations, and what little coherent prose there is of his is borrowed from his own other books.

Obviously the only people who would talk to the author had an ax to grind and a very inflated idea of themselves relative to Paul or the other Beatles. The book would have been funny if it weren't so stupid. Paul and Linda can't win for losing. For instance, their modest lifestyle is criticized as being hypocritical, given their vast wealth. But in other instances where they spend money in some noticeable way, they're criticized for flaunting the wealth. To top it all off, Giuliano is a bad writer of wooden prose--or does that cancel out to a \\"good\\" writer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy narrative is mostly quotations","review":"The author depends heavily on old interviews (that fans have probably read elsewhere) along with his own interviews with disguntled ex-Wings member Denny Laine and Laine's ex-girlfriend, both of whom obviously have an ax to grind. Their intense dislike of McCartney results in pettiness that is indeed laughable. If you deeply dislike Paul McCartney, you will be pleased with this book; if you are a fan or if you are looking for a factual, objective source of information you should definitely look elsewhere. The losers in McCartney's life get here an opportunity to have a go at him . Most of these were related to the awful Wings business. Furthermore he suggests that the writing partnership of McCartney and Denny Laine will be better appreciated in the future . Is this a joke? There are many other instances of the author crawling . He refers to several minor personalities as gifted , talented etc . This is irritating . Frankly, I believe this book it's a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research Schmesearch","review":"This book is frighteningly full of factual errors.

I like the premise and the measuring method. However, the design has one major flaw which makes the cup really irritating and undercuts its accuracy. That is the fact that it does not pour properly. Unless you are measuring into a large container and hold the cup over the container when pouring, it will spill quite a considerable amount. I think its because the white \\"ring\\" runs too close to the pour spout resulting in liquid flowing over a wider part of the rim. Last night daughter and I were measuring alcohol for liqueur-making and pouring the measured alcohol from the cup into wide rimmed canning jars. In every case, quite a lot of liquid spilled onto the table - there was no way to pour in a small stream from this cup.

What makes this cup better is that, in addition to the marks traditionally found on the outside of a cup, there are also marks INSIDE the cup!Until I started using this measuring cup, I didn't realize how much effort it took to measure liquids. I'd pour something into a cup, bend down to look at the marks on the side, add or remove liquid, then bend down again to check the measurement. Measuring is so much more convenient with this OXO cup since you are able to view the inside marks from overhead.Another reviewer mentions a problem with nesting. I have 2- and 4-cup OXO cups and haven't found this to be a problem: Just make sure the handle of the smaller cup is positioned adjacent to, not directly above, the handle of the larger cup.The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it's plastic, which limits the types of liquids that can be used in this cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate measuring?","review":"I had seen this item many times on my trips to my favorite houseware stores and thought this was really a great idea.

So i got out the cup and my old pyrex cup and my metal cups and did a little checking, after measuring many times back and forth between the cups, i found that the OXO cup is off by quite, over an 1/8 of a cup, nearly a quarter. 1 Cup of liquid in this cup, measured almost 1 and 1/4 cup in the Pyrex. This messed up my bread and really irritated me.I'm not one to normally write these type of reviews, but thought I should share this bit of information.

How practical, I thought - the non slip tactile grip, the inside measure of quantity - it looked well made, and I expected it would be long lasting. Unfortunately, having lasted several months, without warning it cracked and I had hot liquid running all over my kitchen bench. I think the product should state clearly somewhere that it is not suitable for hot liquids. At least then the user could use it accordingly.

It's only a year old and useless for liquids because of the leak but didn't use it so much for that anyway because of the extremely poor pouring qualities. Now it's only used for measuring dry items.

For years, many (e.g. Solti) insisted on a faster tempo for these pieces. Others maintained that the faster speeds marked by Beethoven were erroneous, the fault of a malfunctioning Glockenspiel, etc. The problem with those who still prefer Karajan is that we know from recent musicological discoveries that, in fact, the faster speeds are more along the lines of what Beethoven had in mind. Although it will take a while for these tempi to take hold, I think ultimately the lighter and faster playing of those such as Zinman will come to gain wider acceptance..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not a bargain","review":"This is definitely not my favorite interpretation of the Beethoven symphonies. The orchestra is hurrying along without much depth. The worst thing for me is that the Beethoven spirit got lost. Compared to interpretations by Masur, Wand, Gardiner, Karajan etc. these warm and passionate works remain cold under Zinman's baton. As background music it's OK but if you are a serious listener who is looking for emotional depth these interpretations are not for you. There are other \\"bargain\\" editions of these works. For example, I recently purchased the Masur/Leipzig Gewandhaus edition for 32 Dollars.

This version of Juke-Joint Jezebel is a 4 minute edit. Kraut is 5 minutes long and offers a completely different industrial beat, with a heavy guitar, a quick beat from a drum machine, a xylophone and a keyboard. This is not a very appealing song when compared to Juke-Joint Jezebel. With a review of two songs, its time to say, that there are only two songs! Which is why this single is selling new for around fifty cents. At least with that price, this makes it a worthwhile single to at least give a listen to.

However, fans looking for more tracks like dirty epic and cowgirl would be best advised to buy Beaucoup Fish. This album is all much mellower than the original tracks.

If I could have bought just the first disc in this collection I would have been content to do so. For Billie Holiday fans - she's never sounded better than alongside Lester. The two of them together are absolutely divine. It's a shame that Lester Young wasn't discovered earlier because it is in his earliest recordings that he sounds the best.

Listen for yourself. \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is staggeringly beautiful, and any accompaniment is subdued as it should be. Two Billy Joel songs is too much for me, but again, that's a personal preference. Billy Joel's songs just seem like fluff compared to other favorite pop and broadway songs. \\"Misty\\" is somehow not exactly as well-composed as it should be.

The reason I had to return it was that the hooks were too big for the holes in my utensils. There was no way to exchange the hooks for smaller ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oxo is a good brand","review":"This is a neat utensil rack.

The rack is very well made and the hooks can be moved to fit different sizes. The package the rack comes in doubles as a template for easy placement of wall screws to mount the rack. My only complaint is that to access the holes in the rack for mounting, you have to move both end-caps either right or left. Good luck! i managed to move one a little but the other is stuck. I am afraid to use vice-grips or another tool to move them due to my fear of breaking/bending/denting the metal. I am still working on this annoying glitch in an otherwise very nice looking kitchen essential and have not installed the rack yet. I am sure once I get it up on the wall, it will more than meet my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleek and pretty","review":"I bought two of these utensil racks to hang in my kitchen.

Looks like it came from an OEM. Great way to organize at a low price.Yes, the installation was a tiny bit of a struggle. Nothing over the top but you need to be a bit patient. The end caps do pop off without much force once you figure it out. Installed correctly, the end caps are there to stay.The six hooks normally slide along the length of the rod, but by bending them slightly they will maintain their position. This allowed me to position each hook for the spacing required for each utensil hung from it. This addition a year ago has been appreciated every time I grill. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good once it is mounted","review":"I got this rack to put in my kitchen for some of the stainless utensils I have bout here at Amazon.

But I must say that if you're waiting for something similar to \\"Duncan Sheik\\" you will be disapointed. \\"Humming\\" is a good album, and surpriselly, I hated \\"Bite Your Tongue\\" and you won't find any other song like that on the album. Actually, I really liked the first one and this one doesn't make it, but it's anyway a pretty good album, I think Duncan Sheik was just looking for a different kind of music... and he did it really fine. Anyway, I must say that if you're thinking to buy this record, you HAVE to buy it, but NOT BEFORE YOU BUY HIS FIRST ONE that is I believe, one of the best records I ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"No actual music. Very boring.","review":"I tried for about 30 minutes to listen to Nichiren and couldn't find any reason to torture myself any longer. I kept going back and forward trying to find a tune. There's a drone of a few syllables here and there, but no actual \\"song.\\" I finally gave up and tried some other songs, but it was all the same. So I listened to a few songs from other albums, including his version of Blasphemous Rumors and it was equally awful. He missed notes (unforgivable in something he's selling for patrons to listen to -- hasn't he ever heard of a retake?)!I have never heard Duncan Sheik before, and I can tell you, I won't listen to him again.I realize this guy is well-liked by many. Perhaps I just don't \\"get\\" his musical style. It sounds like a sedated, dozing hophead trying to tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"At it's best this reminds me of Crowded House","review":"There are four songs in this cd which i really liked : \\"In Between\\",\\"Bite your Tongue\\",\\"Alibi\\" and \\"Nothing Special\\".Even though none of them has what you would call a psychedelic hook or a sentimental storm,they all stand out for a calm beauty of their own.And,quitte frankly,they are expected to be that way if only you consider the low profile of Duncan Sheik.The problem with the rest of the tracklist is that the tunes don't stay in memory for more than an hour.I actually had to listen to some of them two or three times to be able to remember how they go.In addition to all that,Sheik's voice is simply too colourless to give the depth needed to melodies like \\"Nichiren\\".On the whole \\"Humming\\" is a decent offering from an artist who surely has the talent to write some elegant guitar-pop songs but seems to be unable to deliver anything more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow-up, but number one is hard to follow","review":"A great mix of soulful and fun songs makes this CD a good follow up. Personally, I loved the first one, and this one is a great follow on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I justified then, I may well justify forever..","review":"Brilliant. This is by far the most enchantingly beautiful CD that I've bought. Duncan has indeed done it again. His strong, yet gentle voice paired with the written word, and music arrangements fit for a king, make this, by far, the most enjoyable CD I own. There is nothing about it that I don't like. While listening to these 11 songs, I find it utterly impossible not to enter into a state of reflection. The music is so calming, but packs such a message, that one cannot go wrong with buying it. Although this CD is nothing like his first, self titled album, \\"Duncan Sheik,\\" it is a gem in its own right. Duncan stands alone in his sound, but, can aptly be compared with the late Jeff Buckley, who was tributed in the track, \\"A body goes down.\\" Truly worth the buy, this haunting CD will please you over and over again. Bravo Duncan, the world is indebted to you for giving us such a remarkable accomplishment. \\"You ARE something special!\\" Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real music, for those who appreciate artistry","review":"Mr. Sheik has a great mix of lyrics, poeticism, and instrumentals. Pick this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DUNCAN FALLS APART ON SOPHOMORE EFFORT.","review":"Sheik completely falls apart on his second effort \\"Humming\\". The first single \\"Bite Your Tongue\\" is obviously his labels doing trying to get him out in the main stream as a rock artist. The album has some tasteful tidbits like \\"Alibi\\" and \\"Nichren\\", otherwise this CD is the next best thing to falling asleep short of valium."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backwards","review":"The follow up to his wildly popular self-titled debut, \\"humming\\" has Duncan Sheik trying valiantly to reinvent himself. Alas, great songs are needed to make a great album, and while he occasionaly gets back up to the level he set in his debut, this album is found wanting. \\"Bite your tongue\\" is a painfully embarrassing song to listen to. I have a tough time believing that the same songwriter who crafted \\"little hands\\" and \\"Serena\\" could make [junk] like this. Ah well, I look anxiously forward to future albums. Once a fan..."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I must say Sheiks first CD was at his best. This CD is so drab I almost fell asleep listening to it.

Buy his first CD, forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is going down the drain","review":"Staples debut album is just terrible. It sounds like a mixture of System Of The Down & really REALLY bad KORN. I was excited to hear the cd, since I've been hearing such wonderful things about this band. I'm only glad the used store gave me $4 bucks for it. The guitars in the album are very weak and they need to have another guitar player in the band, to balance out the same drum beat over and over again. Stay away from this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillfull. Artistic. Professional.","review":"I think those three words sum it up pretty well. I found it difficult to believe that this was Staple's only album. The first time I heard this band was on the radio and I immediately had to hear more. This is one of those bands that debuts with such an impressive first album that you start looking around for their earlier work because you swear they couldn't be a new band. The music is both skillfully composed and played. Everything from the cover-art to the lyrics is boldly artistic. And the entire album as a whole is very professionally crafted. Five stars all the way; I haven't run across a band this impressive since Project86."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT Accommodate a wide range of jars, as claimed.!","review":"One Star because there is not an option of giving Zero (0) stars! Jar opener looks nice and is easy to hold but most jar lids will not fit in the teeth of jar opener and the opening is to small for larger jars. I tried opening a jar of salsa with a small average lid. Lid wouldn't stay in jar opener and teeth could not get a good grip on lid. The lid kept coming out. I've also tried to open a jar of Prego Spagetti sauce and the lid would barely go in the opening. NOT A VERY GOOD DESIGN FOR SUCH A GOOD COMPANY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but doesn't work well","review":"I used to have a jar opener like this, but it was mounted to the bottom of my kitchen cabinet. That worked wonderfully because I could use both hands to pull and turn the jar against it. This tool limits you to one hand pushing (with the jar opener) and one hand turning the jar. Unless you can really ram it against the lid, you'll only succeed in gouging the lid, not in actually turning it. If you haven't the hand strength to open the jar without this, chances are this won't help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow it down.","review":"This book pushes the student to learn all the alphabet, acents, and pronounciation in the first 6 page lesson.

My last camera (a Nikon) was very user friendly and the pictures came out beautiful with very little settings adjustment. With this camera I have to fiddle with the settings on a constant basis. The color is often off and the focus can be tricky. Having said all that I made the best of it but yesterday the docking station just stopped working and I cannot get power to the camera. I figured it would be easy to replace the docking station but HP does not sell it without the camera and I can't find any other outlet, not even on e-bay. Time does not allow for me to pull the battery out of the camera to put it in a recharger every time I need to shoot pictures which I do for a business a number of times each week. This problem makes the camera useless to me. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screen size, plus excellent quality photos","review":"Honestly, when buying this camera the huge selling point is the 3\\" screen size. I bought this as a gift, one for my dad and another for my mom. The main reason for the purchase was my mother constantly complaining with our old camera that she could never see the image on the little screens and so didnt know what she was shooting.Secondly, the resolution on the screen is just amazing. With a 2 gb SD card you can use this also as a digital photo album(although watch out for the battery life.Last, and most important, the 10 MP picture format is wonderful. We were previously using a Nikon, which I was more than happy with and that product is far overshadowed by the HP.Excellent product for most any user!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice features - but not the best camera for a family with small children!","review":"I love the features that the camera offers. They're a bit redundant as they're the same types of things I use with my photo program anyway, but it's nice to have them available on the camera itself.My biggest complaint is that with a 2 year old and a 1 year old - trying to capture moments quickly is beyond frustrating with this camera. The half-press focus (hoping that it focuses on the area you're asking it to) seems to take a lifetime when you're trying to follow action! I've tried to just point and shoot - but the photos are never in focus.I've also found that the \\"saving to memory\\" time is rather long, even when you decrease the Megapixels.This would probably be a great camera for someone else, but for a mother of two - I would NOT recommend it.

(which happened when I took it on vacation to Georgia. The battery died in one day.)My recommendation? DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. One of my family members works for HP and she recommends the same thing. I wish I would have known before I threw my money away on this item. I am now looking for a new digital camera and a friend has suggested Nikon.

He has two: one for the cameras and the curiosity-seekers and the one he reserves exclusively for Cuban people. Mr. Hunt has been dazzled by the charismatic image of an espresso drinking, cigar- smoking figure donning military fatigues babbling tiresome rhetoric of an out of vogue ideology. Instead, he failed to capture the truth: a paramilitary totalitarian guerrilla whose oppressive rule has destroyed a nation, separated families and friends merely to satisfy his sadist megalomanic delusions. I remain amazed at what reporters and tourists would never tolerate in this country considering romantic in Cuba! Well, there is nothing romantic about living without free elections, free speech and the right to travel freely without persecution.

Friends have asked me what Cuba is like. I always recommend \\"Waiting for Fidel.\\" Cuba is a complex world, socially and politically. The Revolution instituted good and bad. Hunt discovers this through his travels and conveys it well. I won't tell you how the book ends ( I love the ending ).Tomas Hernandez is a Television Producer in San Francisco.

The author seems to be floundering without purpose. Worse, he seems incapable of analyzing or understanding what he experienced or witnessed in Cuba, so that the reader comes away with only the flimsiest sense of 'the Cuban experience.' Where is the sensuality; the tension; the sense of Alice in Wonderland duality that makes Cuba so engaging? Hunt's drab writing style doesn't help. I struggled to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This CD is worth getting simply because of the new songs on it! \\"Love Will Always Win\\" has got to be one of the best songs I've ever heard and it leaves you with this inspirational feeling...I love it!

You can also find it on the \\"King of The Hill\\" Soundtrack but it would be better just to buy the import because of \\"Love Will Always Win\\" and the pop version of \\"Let Me Let Go\\" which is so much better than the original...I strongly recommend this to anybody who owns a Faith Hill CD!

This is in my opinion her best song shes ever recorded, and I dont understand why it wasnt available on the domestic version. Its a very inspirational song, that will touch your soul and make you believe that a perfect love is possible to acheive.

Though far from being a bad book, it just didn't draw me in. Verminaard's evilness seems to be inborne rather than reactionary, to the point that the supposed contributing factors - the unloving father, the loss of the beloved brother - seem more like asides and much less sympathetic. Likewise with his half-brother Aglaca, who is unfailingly upbeat and loyal for no apparent reason. I understand the story the Williamses were trying to tell, and it took a while to put my finger on what was wrong. Then I realized it was missing a vital element of all great drama: levity. The human experience is not serious all the time. Even in the grimmest tales there is laughter. The unrelenting depression of this book left me frankly unmoved."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"MIDNIGHT!!!!!\\"","review":"Before the mask is definitely recommended for those who would like to know why, actually, is Verminaard the way he is?

However, Micheal Williams has butchered every DL book he has ever written. He absolutely bores me to death.I couldn't wait to read this book because I loved Emperor Of Ansalon & Black Wing. I thought this was going to be another good villian based book. Even though I hadn't liked any of the other Williams books, I thought this was a can't miss.

Phil probably just wants to \\"cash in\\" on those past laurels, especially now that he and \\"Genesis\\" pals Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford have apparently parted ways! His new directions -- playing drums with the \\"Buddy Rich Orchestra,\\" and doing the sound-overs for a \\"Tarzan\\" animation -- could either be a genuinely new \\"talent trail\\" for Collins, OR a complete \\"boondoggle\\" for a performer whose best days are now behind him! Only time will tell, of course. Either way, Phil Collins' contributions to the Progressive Rock scene (via Genesis) and Pop music in general are now the stuff of music history!

However, Phil colins, for all his shortcomings, does possess an amazing rampart with the mentally retarded. It's beautiful that he can be the voice of millions of stupidity imbued people around the world. If only other recording artists of the 80's would find a cause to redeem there banal soul's before inevitably puting a 12 gauge shotgun in their mouth and splewing their meager brains out the back of their' thoughtless little heads. Phil Colins makes Britney Spears look like Nietzsche, and if you don't know who Nietzsche is, then his music has apparently already took hold and there's no hope for your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent buy","review":"i'm not a big phil collins fan, but this cd has all of his best. i got it primarily for the song 'groovy kind of love' but am enjoying the rest of the cd immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Countless replay even after I got sick of it.","review":"For starters, Phil Colins is for people growing up in the 1980's and as 'RICK' has demonstrated that he was not the intended listener. I had never owned a Phil Collins music title (that's including tape & LP), nor have I after. But the collection is excellent, as for someone that only listen to his songs on the radio. I for almost a year and a half since 1999 I palyed it countlessly and after I got sick of the sequence, I started using the 'random' track play on the CD player to compromise myself, mind you, I also have a huge collection of CD like, Sting, The Corrs, Mariah Carey, etc. But this seems to be the best collection I have owned, the next best is Bon Jovi - Crossroads, the worst is Dire Straits - Sultans of Swing. Hey! All 3 artist are big in the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate Phil Collins...NOT!","review":"Once upon a time, I bought this album years after I digged listening to his Serious Hits album. The songs featured on Serious Hits Live are performed to a great extent without faltering. Of course, I'm not a die-hard Phil Collins fanatic, but knowing that he can play a whole truckload of instruments forced me to get this album, since I already liked a number of the songs on here prior to purchase. As for those who hate Phil, they hardly know what they're talking about if they HAVE heard his music. Only flaw on this album is the too bouncy \\"Dance Into The Light.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An amotsphererical album","review":"Phil Collins's \\"Hits\\" is by far one of the best greatest hits albums of all time.

I am a big fan and hope to see mr. Collins release another album soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing a few things","review":"In my book a worthy compilation includes every worthwhile song. While this is a good buy, since a few songs on here were not on any of Phil's albums but rather movie soundtracks or the album of another artist he collaborated with, it is missing a few classics and all I can say is, this is not a \\"hits\\" disc that makes buying the other albums unnecessary. \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\", \\"Don't Lose My Number\\", and \\"Do You Remember\\" are sorely missing. If these three were only on there, it would have gotten 5 stars.

The reason I say almost, is because the cd leaves off a very important song that was essential to Collins 80's sucess. Yes you guessed it, \\"Don't Lose My Number\\". This is one of Phil's great catchy 80's tunes from the late summer of 1985 which is when in my opinion, he was at his pinnacle of success. You just don't leave that song off of the cd, and put on the song \\"True Colors\\" which was a far cry from the greatest version done in the winter of 87' by Cyndi Lauper. Besides that, this cd is a winner and has most of Phil's best solo work. My choice, buy this cd and also \\"No Jacket Required\\". It will give you the best of both worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"phil collins","review":"great album as with most greastest hits.I always enjoy \\"in the air tonight\\" i play that to get psych up before work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Phil?

This collection is very good. If you're a fan of all the big hits, they're all here. I can't really think of one major solo hit that's missing (maybe We Said Hello Goodbye?).Of course, there will be several songs that big fans will say are missing that were just album tracks that were popular with radio play (Inside Out, Find a Way to My Heart & I Don't Care Anymore come to mind quickly); to include everything would probably require 2 discs.While almost every song here is excellent, the ones that I don't like I so strongly dislike that unfortunately it brings down the rating for me.

I finally found out when my friend brought over her copy of the CD. She accidentally left it at my house. I listened to it under the covers of my bed, letting the music wash over me.

How about something new? I mean, \\"True Colors\\" is a nice song, but all I can think about when I hear it is that Whitney Houston AT&T commercial.

Instead of including these they made room for songs like \\"True Colors\\" (which was appopriate for Cyndi Lauper, not Phil Collins) and \\"Dance Into the Light\\" which was a minor 90s hit that does not merit a spot on this album.

If you're interested in Phil Collins, the singer, this is the CD for you. If you're interested in Phil Collins, the drummer, you may need some of his early recordings with Genesis. Most people knows about his 80's pop work solo and with Genesis, but back in the 70's, Phil was considered one of the best drummers in the progressive rock world. He's certainly a monster in the drums. Also with his jazz band Brand X, Phil demonstrated to be a versatile drummer.This set showcases just a stage of his career.

I believe every great artist always delivers their best stuff when they are in a rut. I know he wrote some of the songs on this album bases on his bad times/suffering with his ex wife. He did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and moment is captured very well. He is a great composer. Too bad most of his new songs...2006, times are different and so is his life, I do not enjoy them as much.

As it happened to other people, after two weeks of use random popping and static noises appear. I had to return it today and I got a Creative Nano Plus instead. The reviews here are great and all I have to say was already said. It's small, but bulk, impractical. The charge doesn't last long, I had to recharge it every other day or so. Radio is ok, not great. It was really cute and great conversational piece. Drag and drop feature was great. Playlist was poor, not really easy to find the songs you want. You need to create folders and make it the way it will be easier for you. Buttons are really small. When on the radio, it turns off after a short period of time. Once again, I was really happy while it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I purchased a Mobiblu DAH-1500i last Christmas for my daughter. It arrived promptly and looked great. We loaded on some MP3s that we had and bought a few more through the Walmart online music store. All seemed to go smoothly. However, a few weeks later, several songs that had been loaded would not play. We tried resetting and reloading loading everything and still could not get 100% working. I have repeatedly emailed the tech support, once in March, again in May and again over the summer. Never received a response. I have tried updating the firmware but for some reason, that has been unresponsive on my system. Also the headphones broke not long after we purchased it. I would not recommend buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"While the size and design are very innovative, the functionality is non-existant.

The subject matter was gripping -- women pirates and how they got to be pirates! I thought the characterizations were excellent and felt myself really caring about these people. I feel James Nelson did a masterful job telling this fascinating story, and it was so realistically done that I really felt I was there watching everything. I highly recommend it -- definitely different, eminently interesting! Kudos to James L. Nelson -- a wonderful story teller!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing I liked was the cover.","review":"The only thing I really liked about this book was the cover.

The description and the cover promise more than what is delivered in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I have only read 34 pages of \\"The Only Life That Mattered\\", but my life matters too much to me to read any more. How this author has ten books in print is beyond my comprehension; both he and his editor(s) should be strung up by their thumbs. It's not just bad writing, it's lazy writing. There are numerous sentence fragments. There are factual inaccuracies. Sentences, even paragraphs, are started with \\"And\\" and \\"But\\". I could go on and on, but it is not worth my time. I have made corrections and will send the book to the publisher; I do not wish to have it in my home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is definately one of the best things to help improve your handling.

Do both sides. Just remember not to torque them down until both sides are installed. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Expanding","review":"I read this book twice when it was first published. The deals described in this book anticipate many events, such as the political elevation of George H. Bush's sons (yes, I voted for George W. Bush)and the protection enjoyed by Clinton during his presidency. Terry Reed is an American hero with the guts to reveal the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely worth consideration","review":"The story this book tells seems to be believable, but, even though I'd like to, I've yet to find hard evidence on it's credibility. I say this because, by writing this, Reed must have violated a non-disclosure agreeement. I intend to re-read my copy of Under Fire, by Oliver North, in order to look for correllations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts matter more than ego","review":"Terry Reed was not an air force intelligence officer. He was an enlisted man, who got his pilot training subsequent to the service. Like many enlisted men, he seems to have envied greatly the air force pilots for the distinctions that flight training and combat earned them. Much of his life following the service seemed to be devoted to making up for that envy and feeding his own ego. That's what too much of this book is about. I'm absolutely sure that the CIA was involved in some significant shenanigans in Mena, Arkansas and that both George Herbert Walker Bush and Bill Clinton were plugged in at some level. If that was the main thrust of this work, it would have been more worthwhile. Instead, we get way too much information about Terry's need for ego gratification. The facts I was hoping to learn from this book are much better covered by authors such as Craig Roberts and Jim Maars. And with them, you don't have to deal with Terry's temper tantrums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Reed nails it between the uprights!","review":"I still have a cassette tape of Mr.Reed on Dr. Stan's fine Radio Libertyshow discussing how the alphabet souplettered agencies came at him withboth barrels blazing under the overusedguies of (get this!)

Part of the puzzle of crime that lead us to where we are today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so exciting","review":"This book had the most boring storyline I've seen in a long time. I didn't find the premise to be at all interesting, and certainly not thrilling. I forced myself to finish this book. The only time I became interested in reading the book was towards the end when the mystery was being unfolded. I was severely disappointed to find that much of the evidence used in the trial of the accused was totally ignored in the explanation of what really happened (i.e. fish scales and blood on the deceased woman, where the cigarettes/cigar/ashes that were dumped on her came from). It would make sense if the expected murderer was really guilty, but not when the true killer was revealed. Although I was surprised at who the murderer was, this was ruined by the fact that too many things were not explained. Basically, this book was slow and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody tell me if I'm missing something here.","review":"O.K. Then how did the first cigar end up at the scene of the crime?

There isn't a lot of tension in this novel, and I didn't feel a burning desire to turn the page. The trial in the second half of the novel is largely boring, where paper-thin characters rehash all the events that took place earlier in the book. This book is probably a hundred pages longer than it needs to be.There is a twist ending in THE ATTORNEY, but it's delivered in a way that is kind of abrupt and unsatisfying. I can't say more without giving it away.I like Martini's writing style, and really enjoyed his novel DOUBLE TAP, so I hope this book is an aberration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killer revealed early","review":"I love the Steve Martini novels. Normally I'm always guessing until the end. In this one it was obvious early on \\"who done it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"I'm not sure what possessed me to buy this book . Oh yes! The fact that the cover stated that \\"the suspense is excruciating\\" or on the back of the book stating that the story is \\"riveting.\\" I was very very disappointed to say the least. I was halfway through the book waiting for something exciting to happen. Plus the ending was a major letdown. I would NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a let down from past work...","review":"I hope Martini doesn't turn into one of those best selling novelists who begins to believe his own publicity and lets his storytelling slide.This book is not representative of the fine work that Martini has done in the past. It's almost like he had to slap a plot together but couldn't decide which way to go, so he ended up all over the map. And Mexico? What's up with that?I'm glad Madrini's moved south...the change seems to suit him. Maybe Martini will conjure up a better story the next time.This book isn't bad enough to keep me from reading more Martini...I'll just be a little less enthusiatic for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where oh where is an honest review these days?","review":"Chicago Tribune, said, \\"Plenty of zigs and zags in the plotting make this another strong outing for Martini.\\" Their purpose is to sell. Remember that. I will always read Steve Martini's riveting tales, but this one, The Attorney, was ho-hum. Predictable, forced action. No surprizes. Same thing is happening to Grisham. I can barely get through Grisham's latest and I haven't found a hero yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment!","review":"I have adored Steve Martini's books, and have read all of them. Until now. I waited with eager anticipation for this newest book. I was bored to tears with it. I couldn't even finish it. I read about three quarters of it and gave up. What happened to him?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Had a Clue!","review":"The Attorney is a story that will keep you interested from page 1 until \\"the end\\". The characters are interesting and diversified. The dialogue is crisp and realistic. And the author constantly keeps the reader wondering whether the defendant could really be guilty. The way in which Steve Martini weaves the tale and carries us along his path to the final \\"shocking\\" conclusion makes for very entertaining reading. I was gripped all along and while I sometimes enjoy reading a book only to be disappointed at the end...in The Attorney I was totally satisfied to the very last word.

His earlier stuff was good to very good, but, here, I get the feeling that he was writing just to fulfill a publishing contract or something. This is not his best work, and I had the feeling that he just, to use that overworked phrase, 'phoned it in.' He has great potential, but he just does not live up to it here. Take no offense, sir. I quit reading John Grisham for the same reason. All 'pop,' no 'culture.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tossed the book away after only a few pages","review":"The sensible thing to do was grab the child and move to another state!

I couldn't finish it.","review":"I have always loved Martini's books - and his character, Madriani - so I was eagerly awaiting this new one. Have I been missing something? In the hiatus between Martini's published works I've been reading Elizabeth George, Michael Connelly, Scott Turow, Ruth Rendell, Elizabeth Peters . . . and wow, does Martini come off as shallow and gender-biased by comparison (well, not with Peters, but thats all tongue-in-cheek anyway!) Why does every woman of worth have to be perfectly cotoured, tall, slender, muscle-bound,...? Why does the hero have to be SO very stereotypical? I felt like I was reading the script for a B-grade TV movie!

Despite many interesting visual flairs, such as the inventive set designs and the use of offbeat framing techniques, I couldn't see it as anything more than a very slight, silly story that went on far longer than it needed to.

On one page Cannell says it is 8:30am and a bright crisp day and on the next page it is pitch black with dark clouds covering the moon. Later the evil folk outrun a train, on foot, and through mountains.So, if you can get past the moving and timing then the story is passable. Not award winning, but with some character changes it could have been an A-Team episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never even finished this book","review":"I have always accociated Stephen J Cannell with great story telling on TV in series like The Rockford Files and was therefore pleased to see him start to write novels.I have read all his novels which I enjoyed except for one thing, the gratuitous amount of foul language in them. It is not necessary on TV to tell a good story for characters to swear every other word so why must it be so in these books.I kept hoping with each successive novel that if enough people complained that he would tone it down. I am not saying that you can't have any but is it really necessary for almost every other word to be a swear word? Some people may talk like that but I certainly don't want to be subjected to it.I am afraid that with The Devil's Workshop after about getting half way through I decided that enough was enough. Mr Cannell has lost a fan and I am afraid I won't be buying any more of his books. This is a shame because he can be a great story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DEVILS WORKSHOP-","review":"THE BOOK GRABS THE READER FROM THE FIRST PAGE, AND YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED THE ENTIRE THING!STEPHEN J CANNELL WILL BE SORELY MISSED! MAY HE REST IN PEACE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably similar to \\"World Order\\"","review":"Devil's workshop is not only your typical government conspiracy novel, it is remarkably similar to \\"World Order\\" by Andrew Goliszek, a 1998 novel about all things: bioweaponry, ethnic cleansing, a scientist whose husband presumably committed suicide, a secret government project, an attempt to rid the world of certain ethnic groups! Did Cannell read Goliszek's book or is it all coincidence?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic Book Cliche","review":"Sophomoric writing, passive voice that an English 101 student would thrive on (Cannell was was-wasing to death). Implausible characters doing implausible things at implausible times. I counted three occasions wherein Cannell had written himself into a dead-end impossiiity and skipped over the literary deadlock by the use of the word \\"miraculously.\\" How cheap. The characters have the depth of a highly evaporated foot-rinse bucket, drawn in broad strokes. It's simply amazing that the military can vanquish Vanishing Lake without this little thing called radar picking up what's going on. The transparent attack on the history of bio weapons and nuclear weapons is time-worn, adding nothing, and over-simplified. Is there anyone who didn't know the ending with two-hundred pages to spare? The genre for Devil's Workshop is called comic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced and entertaining","review":"When I see Stephen J. Cannell's name on a TV show or on the cover of a book, I know what I'm going to get. I know there'll be a tough hero who is some kind of outsider. I know there'll be a plucky, feisty, attractive heroine. And I know there'll be a storyline that may skirt the edges of plausibility, but will never fail to keep me entertained. I love watching Cannell play with that basic formula. It's like watching a master write haiku: the format is the same; it's the variety within the formula that keeps me coming back for more. The Devil's Workshop is classic Cannell. Many have tried, but nobody tells those sorts of stories as entertainingly or as well as him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging,original,inspiring and astounding","review":"What is so engaging about this book is the title. What is so original is the choice of characters: a female scientist,an ex-marine and a movie director. What is so inspiring about it, is that it makes me feel that even I can write a novel. But what is most astounding, is that it got published. Colorful language has never been one of my favorite traits in a novel, and it makes me wince when it comes from a \\"feisty\\" lady biologist. It seems to me that profanity is used in this novel as an attempt to keep the reader interested. I could very well just buy one of Jerry Springer uncensored tapes and have twice the fun for half the price. Again,it astounded me that this one book got published. Makes me want to write one myself"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga in Chairs - Beginner","review":"I can't recommend this video as there are so many good ones on the market.While I feel these exercises have merit, to me, the title is misleading.The exercises are extremely mild with very slooow progression. I would say that this series would be better for people who are rehabilitating or partially disabled or quite elderly. You might argue that the phrase \\"in Chairs\\" would be enough explanation, but there are plenty of other yoga practices done in chairs that are entirely different.Unfortunately, the quality of the recording is poor. There is an echo to the words as though the room in which it was being recorded may have been large with high ceilings.The leader is dressed sloppily with little regard to the picture she presents to the viewer. At first not knowing anything about the yoga practitioner or his/her program, the viewer will receive his/her impressions (healthy, caring, happy) by what they see. The indication here is a haphazard, home-grown program."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of the clasp","review":"the necklace itself is great. The clasp that it comes with is another story.

All my Cake fan friends couldn't believe this one. BAD JOB GUYS! TRY HARDER NEXT TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not extending the magic very far.","review":"While this album does contain all of the requisite Cake elements--horns, deadpan lyrics, really random references--it lacks the punch of previous efforts, most notably Fashion Nugget.

This band will always be special to me because I am a former co-worker and still friend of Trumphet player Vince di Fiore. I just got a Post Card from Rio where the band just closed their tour. Althought I am somewhat biased, I love this bands sound. I have watched/followed CAKE play in small local clubs in Sacramento, to MTV, The David Letterman Show, Conan O'Brian and a recent World Tour. I love this CD because it's not cut from the typical mold. It's different, that's why I like it! \\"Walk On By\\" has a special place in my heart, but my favorite song by far is \\"Satan Is My Motor.\\" This song is just named \\"MOTOR\\" on some CD's. I find this song has a hidden meaning that has nothing at all to do with Satan. Listen to it! By the way! Alpha Beta was a chain of grocery stores that used to be here in the Sacramento area. If you ever get a chance to hear this band live, DO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific!!","review":"This is one of those bands that need the self-refection enough to realize they SUCK at slow songs! The rest of the album is nothing like the radio release of 'never there.' Cake really needs to stick to funk beat groove, and avoid trying to do slow songs that just end up lame and actually annoying to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"have your cake and hear it too","review":"This album is fun. If you like cake or if you've never heard them before - give this one a shot, you'll enjoy it. Especially if you like the use of instruments other than just guitar and drums - the horns are fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I finally gave Cake a chance...","review":"I bought the CD \\"Fashion Nugget\\" a long time ago after hearing \\"The Distance\\" and \\"I Will Survive\\" but it's not the kind of music I typically go for so unfortunately I did not give the rest of the album much of a chance. Then recently I took it off the shelf again and gave it a good listen to and became an instant fan. So when I heard \\"Never There\\" on the radio recently, I had to have it and bought \\"Prolonging the Magic.\\" I now play the CD nonstop and somehow it's getting better and better the more I listen. My favorites include, of course, Never There, You Turn the Screws (definately!!), When You Sleep, Satan Is My Motor & Mexico. The more I listen, the more I love the other tracks just as much! I'm glad to be a semi-new Cake fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake does it again- catchy tunes, and lyrical too","review":"John McCrea again puts forth a well-functionaing array of groovy beats, acoustic harmonies, adn his familiar monotone singing. Good job once again, cake. This is one of those that you can listen to all the way through, many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're BAAAACK","review":"Having been slightly disappointed with the monotony of Fashion Nugget, I wasn't going to buy this one -- until a friend with admirable taste told me that PTM even blows Motorcade of Generosity out of the water. I now cannot help but agree. Cake has matured lyrically, and at the same time recaptured the groovy ear that made MOG the most-played CD in my collection. This is one of the few groups in the world whose albums I feel comfortable playing from beginning to end at parties -- a sheer pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake's new and best CD","review":"Cake has finally followed up to the great Fashion Nugget Album with a new and better one. With guitar riffs like the one's from Modercade of Generrosity and louder sounds like from Fashion Nugget. If you are a cake fan, you must buy this CD, it is there best. And don't let their hit \\"Never There\\" throw you off, it is still the same old Cake band, but this time, their better."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SOUND BUT DUMB LYRICS","review":"I love the sounds, but some of the lyrics are sort of stupid such as, \\"In your sleep where does your hand go?\\" and \\"Sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep the Cake coming.","review":"Wow, another good album. The odd-numbered tracks are really good, and \\"Guitar\\" rocks. Wow, good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third great album","review":"More of what you love from Cake. I am surprised though, to hear several people in these reviews say that John McCrea is singing more instead of his \\"usual\\" spoken-word style.

So there. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"sheep","review":"i just find it funny that the people that Cake make fun of in their songs end up being the same people that rush to the store to buy their album. radio kills."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAKE who doesn't like Cake","review":"If you want something different then you have to try CAKE 'Prolonging The Magic'Witty, off beat with great music.This CAKE is unique and will leave you longing for more.Try some you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"Who would think that a fan of 80's pop and alternative, once called \\"New Wave\\" and now \\"Retro,\\" would like Cake? I was hooked by \\"Never There\\" and out of curiosity searched youtube to find out who did this song--\\"Cake.\\" I learned more about the band and their music, and decided to purchase my first CAKE CD-PROLONGING THE MAGIC. I now have 3 of their CDs, and while I like them all, my favorite is this one. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumb lyrics? No! Dumb listeners? Perhaps....","review":"I'm dismayed by the number of reviewers who seem baffled by the lyric's in this CD (and the other Cake CD's too.) Many songs take lines directly from the Bible, believe it or not! On this album, \\"Sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell\\" is something Jesus said to his disciples. Throughout Cake's music, there is evidence that at least one of their writers is familiar with other scriptures. (\\"You part the waters\\".... and *I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment* also come to mind.)As for the lyrics being dumb, anyone who has studied Surrealism (Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte) know that two seemingly unrelated ideas juxtaposed often result in a deeper truth... and humour. That's why I listen all the time to Cake's three albums. They have holding power because they are deep as well as funky. They're my favorite group.Incidentally, I'm a high school teacher in her 50's. My son who lives in CA. gave me my first Cake CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The band should change their name from Cake to Crap","review":"Bought this album on the the strength of Never There but I was totally disappointed. The rest of the album ranges from mediocre background muzak to abysmal inane rantings.

They either have never heard any other CD's or are gullible fools easily swayed by marketing hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I picked this one up because i heard Never there, Hem of your Garment and Sheep go to Heaven.

This album can't hold a candle to Fashion Nugget yet somehow there are numerous reviews proclaming how wonderful this album is. It's awful.Don't fall for the machine. All these reviews are written my Amazon marketing staff."},{"rating":"2","title":"a REAL music fan","review":"You close minded fool. To simply brush aside two of the band's own compositions with such a dismissive, sweeping motion is both ignorant and arrogant. Perhaps next time Cake will take perseonal orders as to each individual person's unique preferences? Until that day, you just may have to live with what the band itself considered worthy of recording material. A critic is nothing but an artist with no talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol' same ol'","review":"It's often hard to tell each track from another, every track is unremarkable, and uniquely Cake. If you like Cake, get this cd, because it sounds like everything else they've done. If you don't like Cake, congratulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent alternative music for any mood you're in!","review":"Cake is the coolest alternative group. They have great music for whatever mood you're in, from hyper to mellow, angry to in love. I love them, they're so cool! Their lyrics are so unusual, as well. Some songs are either extremely metaphorical or really random, I can't tell which. But I deffinately reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the evolution of Cake","review":"This CD has just been released and is off to a slow start with alot of fans. Neverthere is receiving heavy primetime radio play in the Minneapolis/St.Paul area. This track is bubbly and moves along quickly with that classic horn floating through the riffs, several breaks make ya wonder if you can still walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. Another strong track is Sheep Go to Heaven, classic quirky Cake with a heavy rythym, this song alone is worth the purchase of the whole CD...other strong tracks include Mexico, Guitar, Walk On By and Cool Blue Reason. In summary, If you liked Fashion Nugget, you will like Prolonging the Magic... Jaggie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake shows its softer side","review":"This Cd is filled with heartbreaking loves songs that will take time for you to get used to, but when you do you will love them. I was a big fan of there second CD Fashion Nugget. While I don't think this CD is as good it is not a dissapointment. They may have made there songs softer but they are still great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting evolutionary step...","review":"I've been listening to and enjoying Cake since \\"Motorcade of Generosity\\", and when I saw \\"Prolonging the Magic\\" at the store I picked it right up. When I popped it in, however, I was a tad disppointed by the first two tracks, which seemed a tad on the sappy side IMHO. After that, though, things got going and the rest of the album doesn't disppoint.Cake's sound has definitely matured over the last year or so, and this album reflects it. A good solid release from a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little more mellow than fashion nugget","review":"i love cake! this cd is definitely a little slower paced, but still that great cake style. just saw them at celebrity theatre, phx, az. great show and great band. make them your favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prolonging the Magic does just that for Cake.","review":"Cake prolongs their magic with yet another hit recording. The group just continues to get better with each new recording they put out. The CD contains mega-radio hit \\"Never There,\\" but also features such infectious songs as \\"Satan Is My Motor,\\" \\"Alpha Beta Parking Lot,\\" and \\"Cool Blue Reason.\\" I find myself singing all these songs out loud at work every single day. They're just songs that easily stick in your head. A few years from now, Cake may be considered the best band to come out of the 1990's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Cd I've bought in a long time","review":"Proloning the magic is one of my favorit CD's.

Most of the songs aren't as abrasive as mainstream hit \\"The Distance.\\" After listening to a couple songs, I noticed the changes. But Cake still demonstrates the same qualities that make them a great band. There's the same sarcastic humor and feel that Cake fans have come to know and love. After more listening, I can't think of anything else. It truly grows on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAKE: Continues to Rise","review":"\\"Prolonging the Magic\\", Cake's latest album, brings some more great songs that should satisfy current fans, and invite more to listen to their distinctive style of music.

It has querky lyrics and snazzy beats. Its a wonderful compilation of differant sounds. \\"Never there,\\" the radio hit, is deffinately not the best on this album. You've got to hear \\"You turn the Screws,\\" an ironic song about business and politics; \\"Satan is my Motor;\\" \\"Guitar\\" and \\"Let me go,\\" which are both interesting looks at relationships; and my personal favorite \\"Hem of your Garment.\\" This album is ABSOULTELY WONDERFUL! I highly reccomend buying it right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best cds ever","review":"this cd changed music forever. cake's moving lyrics and awesome overall sound make them the best band to listen to, whether you like punk, rock, or (ewwwwww) pop or rap. buy this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I thought \\"Fashion Nugget\\" kicked butt, but this CD was a disappointment.

What kind of idiot actually buys this trash? They have some of the dumbest lyrics I have ever heard in my life! Sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell? Ummm... alright. I wish they weren't from Sacramento, how embarrassing. They don't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard this 15 years ago","review":"This groups song \\"Never there\\" evokes memories of the 80's group \\"Naked Eyes.\\" Both groups have a musical style that is congruent with my taste. In fact I almost bought the album for myself. Some of the song titles really turn me off though. Can't groups be more creative these days? A real spiritual dud, this CD gets one star from me only because there was'nt a way to select no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cake's lowest point","review":"I bought Prolonging the Magic years ago with high expectations. The first four tracks are good, and are worth the low price. Satan Is My Motor was of the quality I expected from Cake, coming in solidly with John McCrea's solid vocal and a tight groove from the band. The melancholy Mexico follows, another solid song, not quite as good as the first track. Never There, the single, is a departure from everything else on the album to make a single in the style of The Distance, but after awhile the catchy hook grows thin, as the song lacks much substance. Guitar is a nice song too. The rest of the album is listenable, mostly, but is all filler except Sheep Go To Heaven. From a musician's point of view, the rest of the album is plain, boring chord progressions, lyrics that appear to have meaning but are actually quite empty.Prolonging The Magic is a bland album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly disappointing.","review":"I loved \\"Never There\\" and usually when I like one or two songs by a band, I like the rest of them as well. Not the case this time. I was so disgusted by this cd, I am almost tempted to pawn it at the used CD store except for the fact that I paid 15 bucks for it and will only get 5 back...tops! So for now its collecting dust on my cd rack. Take it from me and skip buying it, or find the single."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAKE - LAYERS YET TO BE DISCOVERED","review":"I don't know if cake knows what it's capable of, but a few more years of living will reveal the complex layers. The talent is immense. To me there's more words being spoken in the music than the actual lyrics.Their use of trumpets and (the mandolin?) are the answer to the stale guitar/drum rhythms that plague the norm... brings and international mediterranean \\"ska\\" flavor.Every song that means anything to me has a story attached. \\"Where would I be\\" brings the desolation of being an American broke in Poland (stolen purse).Cake is no where near filling it's hard drive capabilities. Just a matter of letting \\"The Cure\\"-like experimentations go and committing to quality lyrics worthy of it's kick-@#5 music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I think this CD is awesome! I've had it for almost a year and I still listen to it all the time - it never seems to get old to me. The songs sound really cool with the great bass, drum, and horn parts. The lyrics are great too. I like just about every song on the disc. If you love and appreciate good music then you've gotta get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY FASHION NUGGET OR MOTORCADE INSTEAD","review":"This CD is not that great. A few decent songs, that is all. Fashion Nugget was a creative masterpiece, and the peak of their musical career. They experiment more into country music with this one (don't get me wrong, some country is good), but they just don't handle it that well. I suggest listening to several of its songs before purchasing. If you like it, that's fantastic. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and mine is that this CD isn't worth 13 or 14 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one Cake that doesn't rise to the occasion.","review":"Was \\"Fashion Nugget\\" a fluke? This formulaic, food-processed followup sure makes it seem that way. What's more irritating than the mind-numbing repetitiveness of standard Cake ingredients (that thundering bass, that echoey voice, those edgy staccato guitar riffs--all of which worked so well on past albums) are the obnoxious \\"Oh-Nos!\\" and \\"He'yahs!\\" that punctuate the trumpet solos on each song except for the third. It's like sticking Twinkies in the middle of a Ho-Ho: redundant and tasteless. This album is Cake extruded into a Dixie Cup, to make a mock cupCake. What recipe were they following? How many cavities will they cause? At least one--in my wallet. I wish I'd read my review before I bought the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fashion Nugget is too good to top. But Cake is still tasty!!","review":"Fashion Nugget was such a good CD it would have been difficult to top. But this Cake album is still delicious! As strong or stronger than their first album, Cake has such a distinctive sound, they truly are a fresh alternative to the\\"alternative\\" crap on the radio. The album has fun hip hop beats mixed with Beatlesque melodies and an interesting arrangement of vocals and instruments. Track 3. NEVER THERE, is obviously the hit off the album but there are several other strong offerings. Track 1. SATAN IS MY MOTOR 2. MEXICO 7. SHEEP GO TO HEAVEN. If you liked the first two Cake CDs you'll find Prolonging The Magic, well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheep Go To Heven !!! Come on !!!","review":"This is a great CD, not a rough as \\"Motorcade...\\" and a little bit (just a little bit) softer then \\"Fashion Nugget\\".

As far as ive played the album, it still seems to have that universal appeal (my whole family, from age 10-48 love it) Mexico is generally our, and my personal favorite, it soothes me, and the main guitar riff and the trumpet solos just suck you in(pretty much all of theyre traks have some fine lip numbing trumpeting) The thing about this album is, that I actually don't like one of the songs, \\"Satan is my motor\\". One may think its the satanic lyrics, but it just doest strike me like the other cuts, seems musically dull, the lyrics turn me off secondly, (sorry guys) you cant please everybody all of the time, but honestly, to me, cake is getting pretty darn close."},{"rating":"2","title":"This c.d. is great!","review":"i recently purchased prolonging the magic i love it!A few of the songs are pretty strange but its ,overall,a great addition to my c.d. collection.Oh,and Never There is the BEST SONG in the world!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs editing","review":"This novel was all over the place and in sorely need of editing.

Elliott Lewis looks at multiple facets of the lives of mixed-race persons in America, and the book will be an eye-opener especially for readers who have little exposure to the subject. This is no dry sociology text: the style is lively and loaded with anecdotes and interviews that bring the topic to life. Lewis' observations on the formation of racial identities in children - and the unique challenges for multiracial kids who find themselves forced to \\"choose\\" - are of particular interest.

Complications ensue: There's another suspicious death, and numerous impostor tabby cats enter the picture. Like all of Marian Babson's cat mysteries, \\"The Company of Cats\\" is a light, witty, amusing story that feline fanciers who like cozy mysteries will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Company Of Cats","review":"Marian Babson's The Company Of Cats turns a gossip column informant into an interior decorator for an eccentric multimillionaire. The subsequent murders and line up of suspects lacks the usual flair of Miss Babson's best work. The ingredients for a good light-hearted read are all there, but somehow the unexpected will, thoroughly unpleasant suspects, hidden money stash, missing cat and the subsequent parade of impostors just didn't jell. The only memorable characters were the three cats- Sally, Salvatore and Sassy. Unfortunately, this mystery just wasn't the \\"cat's meow.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun. Solid cozy plot.","review":"THE COMPANY OF CATS is just the right length for a very enjoyable quick-reading cozy. Her style reminds me of Lydia Adamson's. So, if you like this one, check out Adamson's \\"cat\\" books. This one is all plot -- it has almost no sense of place. In fact, a couple of times I lost track of where everybody was. And the many characters were rather cartoonish and not too deeply drawn. But that's O.K. It was still a lot of fun. Babson's books are NOT a series -- each stands alone, so you can start with any one of them. I'm really enjoying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing but forgettable","review":"This is a light entertaining story good for reading when you don't want to think a whole lot and just want something to occupy your thoughts. Its nice and short which is good because if the book had been much longer it would have become tiresome. As it is the book is amusing while you're reading it but there's nothing remarkable enough about it to make you remember it once you've put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The company of cats","review":"It's difficult to go wrong with Marian Babson books. Her favorite theme revolves around cats involved in mysteries. Why not? Cats are mysterious creatures themselves at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BeCATching Story","review":"I read this book in one day--held my interest from cover to cover--the first one of hers I have read. It's an intriguing and quick read compared to Carole Nelson Douglas or Lillian Braunn whose books are more complex and harder to solve. I'm headed to the bookstore to find the others for a nice break between non-fiction books. Get it and read it--it's a beCATching story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreasonable price","review":"This is a really great book, but you can get it new for $64 from most speech and language catalogs (Fall 2012).

It is hard plastic that has rough edges, so when you're talking on the phone the rough edges scrap against your face and get's caught on your hair.

I give the case 1 star, and the company 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak plastic","review":"The plastic began to crack within two days... there is a thin strip of plastic above the usb/charger plugin that cracked in half almost immediately - and the thin piece above the camera also cracked and broke off.The seller told me (after the fact, of course) that by design clear plastic material is very weak.There are five very noticeable cracks after only a month of having the case - and I imagine it won't be too long until the completely crumbles.Not even worth the $.01 I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An icon of the unobtainable desires of our hearts","review":"Poor old Prowlpuss. A sweetheart at the core, yet driven by hormones, he can't help himself. He indulges himself in his passions with abandon: alley fights and prowling, yowling for the love of a distant desire. The world conspires to keep him where he is, in the beloved company of his old Nellie Smith. Prowlpuss is an icon in our home, a beloved imaginary part of the childhood of our two girls, ages 6 and 5. We have read this book in the evenings on the big bed for several years now, and can nearly recite it from cover to cover. For us, hearing the words \\"Prowlpuss is cunning and wily and sly, a king size cat with one ear and one eye,\\" evokes images of our family snuggled up together. Highly recommended for its look at forlorn resignation in the face of unquenched desire, and its quiet acceptance of all the good things we already have. Children with big ol' boy cats at home will especially enjoy a visit to this tom's world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author sued and restricted","review":"Since Renee Fredrickson lost a lawsuit of over 175K, and has had her therapy restricted by the Minnesota Board of Psychology, one should NOT accept her suggestions or ideas.She was charged, among other things with \\"Minn.

I can't help wondering if \\"Sarah,\\" mentioned at the opening of the book, really has emerged 'more serene than she thought possible' from her journey of discovery of the 'abuse that shaped her adult life.' Supposedly she was happy at the time she started to have flashbacks. So how did horrifying abuse shape her adult life of happiness?On another note, people who believe they have recovered lost memories of abuse need to be honest with themselves. How much were these 'memories' influenced by what a therapist has suggested or by what you saw in a movie, TV show or news report? I haven't been able to find one case where a 'recovered' memory of abuse has had outside corroboration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book based on a fallacie,","review":"This book and others like are based on unproven myths and fallacies that were popular in the nineties. Just like this other lie called facilitation. The truth is that traumatic memories are remembered, not forgotten or repressed. If it happens it is extremely rare.Trouble is, once you start believing something happened, it stays with you like a real memory.Please, do not believe the assumption these books are based on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv it","review":"Luv it, Virginia Henly's ability to create un-forgetable characters is amazing. With this book you'll find yourself sharing the emotions, and forgetting to sleep.Married by proxy, and abandoned, Sara Bishop is determined to wreak revenge.As flame-haired, emerald eyed Sabre Wilde, she would scandalize Queen Elizabeth's court as she sets out to seduce her unknown husband, become his mistress and make him her slave. But will her plan backfire and leave her hopelessly in love with him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had such promise","review":"At the begining of this book I thought,this is going to be good! I liked the plot and I thought the heroine had spunk! I was in for a big disappointment. Both charcters were not very likeable. I did not feel the love between them. The dialouge and language was not 16th century. Too much time was spent on Queen Elizabeth. I skipped pages and rolled my eyes so many times. One good thing, it got me to read up on Queen Elizabeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Henley's Better Books","review":"I liked this almost as well as The Marriage Prize. One thing about many of Henley's women -- they are usually spoiled selfish brats. It is hard to like them, but in this book, it was easier to take. I liked it -- I could not put it down. I just wish her women were a little nicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read This Book!","review":"This was awful! A complete waste of time and money. The characters were selfish and self absorbed. I do not know who is worse--Ms. Henley for actually thinking up these characters or me for actually wasting my time and reading about them. I think in parts of the book Ms. Henley tried to make it like Whitney, My Love. Not even close! Back to the drawing board, Ms. Henley!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawk and the Dove - read only if desperate and snowed in!","review":"After reading 'Henley's 'Pirate and the Pagan, Raven and the Rose, and the Falcon and the Flower', I found that 'Hawk and Dove' scored the same as 'Dragon and Jewel' on my 'read again only if on a remote island and there are no natives to talk to'. Virginia Henley is one of my favorite authors! I loved all the characters in the three novels mentioned above, however, as I stated in reviewing 'Dragon and Jewel', I was disappointed by 'Henley', but alas, I own 'Pirate and Pagan (disapproved of the adultery plot), Raven and Rose, and Falcon and Flower', and they are my cherished 'dime store purchases'. Maybe I disliked this novel because at the time I was reading 'Hawk and the Dove', I kept thinking, if that was my husband cheating on me with me, I would slip poison in his wine goblet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a good book","review":"I was disgusted when I read this book. Most of it would have been okay if the \\"Sea God\\" hadn't raped Sabre. It was completely unforgivable, but of course she ends up in love with him. Sabre is not the kind of woman who would let a man get away with that or fall in love with him after raping her. She is too proud and self-respecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"This book was highly recommended on several sites so I was really looking forward to reading it. I was very disappointed. The book rambled. It lost my interest quickly. I did not finish it. Too many great books out there to waste my time on one I had to work to make myself pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I tried Virginia Henley's A Year and a Day first and loved it so I decided to try this after reading some of the reviews. BIG MISTAKE. Was this the same author? This book had terrible, shallow characters and an uninteresting plot. The so-called hero was a violently jealous uncaring tyrant and the heroine was just plain stupid and unbelievable. A Year and a Day was much better but after reading this trash I don't know if I'll ever try another Henley book."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I agree with one of the reviewers. Only read this if you have nothing else to do. The heroine was a tremendous turn off. In my opinion, the whole book was about her being selfish and mnipulative.

It's the best thing ever! The music made by this Bogota-based band is out of this world. It's a supreme combination of everything that it's awesome, exciting and bold about latin and rock music a wonderfully performed blending of real music made by real musicians that will blow your senses away and grow roots in your gut. You cannot miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Fusion of Cumbia and Rock en Espanol","review":"I was pleased to discover this band when my own group (Babaloo) was booked to open for them. They manage to take the energy of rocknroll and dispense with the cliched rock rhythms that caused me to first explore Latin music. The vocals are terrific and ensemble work is amazing, creating atmospheric space one moment, a powerful thundering the next, and an wonderful interweaving of parts on their salsa outings. Note that they have the courage to doo all of these in the same song. A special treat is their beautiful reinterpretation of the Peregoyo Y Su Combo Vacana classic, \\"La Pluma,\\" that paying tribute to their predecessors on the Columbian music scene all while presenting their own unique vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT JOB BILLY","review":"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF BILLY GILMAN FROM THE START!!!!!!

The lyrics of the songs are amazing, even if they weren't written by a kid who hasn't even reached his teen years yet.

I first discovered Billy's music a couple of years ago, when his single 'One Voice' was released in the UK. I've always enjoyed listening to the pure tones of a good boy singer, be it choral music or pop and country. Billy Gilman surpasses most young male recordings that I have heard or bought. He sings from the heart, always in tune and with that extra 'something' that is undefinable merely in words, but you know what it is when you hear it.His voice on this latest CD album 'Music Through Heartsongs'has more or less broken, but no less a delight to play and dare I admit it? Sing along with!He's developed a pleasing timbre of a more adult tone, with just as much sincerity and melody as his earlier child, but always 'mature delivery' recordings. ..what more can I say...Billy Gilman will continue to delight his fans as he gets older, and find some new one's along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartsongs-- GREAT ALBUM","review":"I got a copy of \\"Music Through Heartsongs\\"! It's great and I really enjoyed getting a copy of it. I love \\"For Our World\\" and \\"I Could...If They Would\\". Those both songs are really brining everything out that they needed to say. Every other song is very good and I really enjoy those as well. BUY BILLY's new album today. You will be very happy if you do. It's better then \\"Dare to Dream\\" his last album."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 for 4","review":"Billy Gilman is one of the most talented young men in the musical industry today. His feel for the music makes it that much more enjoyable for the listener. I own all four of Mr. Gilman's CDs, and I've been extremely impressed by each one. This CD is filled with, not only, beautyful melodies and inspiring lyrics, but it shows that Billy Gilman is not ONLY a child prodogy...his career is just begining. Billy is growing from a telented boy to a talented man. I give this CD five stars because it represents everything that is good and right in the world! Instead of holding rap artists like Eminem as heros, I think children of today should look to someone who really looks to make a difference. 3 Cheers for Billy Gilman!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BILLIH!","review":"Me and Verdra love Billih, so of course we love this!

The poems are bad enough by themselves; they completely lack the rhythm and depth of good poetry. Try, then, taking words without any discernable rhythm and forcing yourself to keep true to them, and write a song for them. What you get is lousy.Kudos to Billy for a fine job singing poetry. Kudos to his songwriters for doing a good job putting it to music. Unfortunately, a 100% great job on a terrible source is still 100% terrible. It's all in the math.I'm a huge Billy fan, but I can't recommend this CD to anybody in good conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two negatives didn't make a positive","review":"I wish I could have rated it minus 5 stars. Is it bad for a couple 12 year olds? no. That being said- This CD is pathetic. I aquired this cd from the used cd bin. Whichever adults put this product out as a real cd, should receive the music-industry equivalent of being defrocked. I laughed at how shmaltzy this was, then I just got really offended at how easily some music producers think some people are to amuse. If you're a guest at my house and I made you a doghair and vaseline sandwhich and expected you to like it you'd be offended too, right?Having a goodie two-shoes purveyor of already established truths set to music by a goodie two-shoes singer of sappy ballads written by 45 year old saps, but who tries to pass them off as his own is just an ugly idea.

Happy listening.-tim (not from the heartland)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Because there's no zero","review":"Billy Gilman is an extremely talented person, and his voice is amazing. But with talent like that, you'd think he could have better things to do than sing Mattie's poetry. Mattie Stepanek was a very courageous person, but that doesn't mean he was a writer. I'm amazed at the people that call him a \\"best-selling\\" poet. His poetry is absolutely ridiculous, and the only reason it sells is because people feel sorry for poor kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilman's voice continues to thrive, but material gets old","review":"On his 4th studio LP, Gilman continues to produce vocals that would intimidate most adults, but the material gets slighty redundant. Although no longer possessed of the crystalline soprano that propelled him to stardom with 2000's \\"One Voice\\", Gilman's voice remains relatively high pitched, but has gained a lower, richer texture. \\"It Happened Anyway\\" shows that despite his changing voice, Gilman remains an amazing stylist and can still belt better than most twice his age. The theme throughout this album is life despite adversity, which is poignant at times (I Could, If They Would and For Our World) but gets slightly repetitive by the disk's end. All in all, I predict a bright future for Gilman. He has the kind of talent that should transcend his boy wonder image and provide him with a successful long-term career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Through Heartsongs","review":"WOW!! i liked this cd since listening to the first track!! i told some billyheads that as long as Pizza has CHEESE i would be reviewing this cd on here!! the songs that stand out for me are: For our world, i am/shades of life, about things that matter, songs of the wind, possession, gift of color and about watches!! i like fast songs so thats a given that i like about things that matter, about watches and gift of color!! but i like the hawaiian ukelele strumming in songs of the wind, makes it seem like almost love from dare to dream!! BUT being that the songs are poems without rhymes sounds a little strange, i don't know if i could sing along with them that easy!! the reason why i give it 4 stars is because some songs are kinda lacking in true power like the songs there's a hero, my time on earth and God's Alive and Well!! looking forward to the next cd with more rhyming words in the songs and more twang in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you have an extended warranty from the dealer...","review":"I have been recommending this camera up until three weeks ago, precisely the week the warranty expired, when my camera malfunctioned.

My guess is that the culprit in the Sony camera is the lens -- all the electronics seemed to work OK.Update, May 17Since writing the above I have purchased a Canon A70, which is comparable in size and price to this Sony...with the same number of megapixels.The Canon gives the photographer a lot more potential control, including, if one wishes, the ability to set f stops and shutter speeds manually. Most important, the lens is much better than the Sony's, and my pictures are much sharper, with excellent definition and contrast. So in my opinion the Canon A70 is a much better value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnot Stream","review":"Disappointed when I cannot use this digital camera as web cam.

I have a Sony camcorder so the memory stick is interchangable with both camcorder and camera. The battery was charged only once (initial charge) and so far I've gone through a 125mb stick (using the highest clarity mode) and more. 3.2 megapix is sufficient for my use, although I would like to eventually upgrade to a 5.0 when their prices fall. I read somewhere that if you do a lot of cropping, a 3 megapix will start to lose its clarity. Nonetheless, this is a remarkable point and shoot camera, easy to operate and the rechargable AA batteries are the best. In a pinch, if your rechargable batteries die, you just need to pop in fresh AA's from energizer or duracell, without having to worry about recharging the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera - Vivid outdoor pics","review":"Did alot of research before buying - had the camera 2+ years and it takes awesome and vivid outdoor pics but indoor tends to be a little \\"warm\\" (read orange/reddish) in auto mode.

I have been to Hawaii 4 times but the main island only once (20yrs ago). It was nice to see those shots again on the main island. The only thing I am not crazy about is the music. The first song was hawaiian which was great but then the other songs were not hawaiian and not so great but the beat was a good exercise tempo.

Unfortunately, this oven thermometer is the exception to OXO quality and design. The thermometer is fairly accurate in its temperature reading, and the temperature numbers on the dial are easy to read when backlit by the oven lightbulb (if you have one). What makes the product totally flawed and worse than useless is the ridiculously idiotic mounting mechanism -- two metal clips on each side of the device, which are so short, they won't even lock onto my oven rack, and keep making the thermometer fall off the rack. It's the essence of stupid design, just plain stupid. Also, when the thermometer is in place (assuming that you can actually get it to stay in place), it takes up several inches of space on the rack, preventing you from sliding an oven pan all the way towards the back of the oven.Go with a hanging thermometer instead and save yourself a lot of frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"Off by at least 100 degrees f.

Boy was I wrong! When the oven beeped to say that it had reached its temperature, the thermometer didn't read anywhere near what it should read. It took about 20 minutes for the thermometer to finally read what the oven temp was set at. Then, to make things worse, the OXO thermometer started registering at least 100 degrees above what we set the oven for. I have since bought a cheaper but reliable thermometer name which is registering just fine. In the meantime, I've had to recalibrate my oven several times to make up for the drastic readings the OXO gave me. Sorry I ever bought it to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"It's accurate and clips nicely to the rack, but it's very difficult to read -- even when I placed it with the oven light behind ...

I was therefore excited to see that Oxo has an oven thermometer, since I do a lot of baking and needed to check the accuracy of the oven temperature. I am sad to say that this item does not live up to the Oxo name.The thermometer appears to measure the temperature properly. However, the clip-on apparatus is poorly designed. If the rack to which the thermometer is attached is bumped even gently, the thermometer pops off and falls onto the oven floor. Having retrieved and reattached the thermometer numerous times, I give up. I will be returning this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a stand up item","review":"I believe this oven thermometer is accurate. It does, however, have other problems. After about two uses the screen clouded up so much that I have to take it out of the oven to read it.

Also,no matter how I put it in the oven (hanging or standing on the shelf) it falls over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oxo Good Grips Oven Thermometer","review":"My gas oven (new to me) wasn't getting to the proper temperature so baking was not satisfactory.

Which the oven might have been, but I couldn't be sure. The time after that it appeared to be stuck again. I tapped it and it jumped up some degrees. I tapped it again and it jumped again. It just isn't reliable and is therefore useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this thermometer!","review":"This thermometer is junk. Yes it is easy to read because of the clear dial, however, it does not register the temperature for at least 30 minutes!

The girls are insecure in who they are and of course like most high school girls they are ready to stab each other in the back whenever possible because three's a crowd. One girl is over sexualized while the others aren't. Another reviewer said it well when they said this was a good movie for 17 year old boys who might want some insight into the minds of high school girls (FYI, this isn't what it''s really like guys). The things that the girls have happen to them are things that they bring on themselves and for one of them it is the stuff of demented fantasies that she probably wishes would happen.You want a good movie? Go watch House of 9 or Thirst. Don't waste your time here and don't give 3 teenage girls a gun when they have no idea how to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor acting, predictable story, disappointing ending","review":"This movie started with obvious sexual frustration, predictable nudity, and poor acting. I knew from the first 15 minutes I was going to regret watching this movie. It had the ability to be so much more but the it did not live up to the \\"thriller\\" claim. I became physically frustrated watching this movie due to the weak story line and the thriller movie cliches that involve girls in these types of movies. This is by all means NOT a slasher film. I would have liked to see either a twist or surprise to give the movie a little more power but it just never came.This won't stop me from discovering the hidden gems of the big screen, it's just too bad I can't label this as a \\"hidden gem\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining is how I would describe this movie!","review":"This movie begins really crazy, it's loud and there is lots of yelling and slapstick comedy, but as it progresses it is much more melodramatic. As in many Bollywood films, just when you think things can't get much worse, it does, the plot has more twists and turns than a mountain road!It is great to see these wonderful actors together in one movie, they are all terrific. If you like Bollywood movies, this is a must see, but I won't spoil it by telling you the ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldnt get into this","review":"I see 3 other reviewers really enthused with this one. I didn't have that experience. I like the actors but the extended comedy wasnt to my taste. It was doing the 'wacky', hammy angle Indian Bollywood comedy lovers love. I like more subtlety in my humour.It is aging too (it looks older than 1997). Now I can live with this if the plot redeems it (and I have liked other Aamir Khan offerings of this period) but I found myself all too aware of the dodgy movie colour and the echoing in the audio track.My 28 year old co-enthusiast of Bollywoods abandoned it earlier than me. I resolutely held in there because of the cast but this one didn't do it for me.A quick Net surf shows it is often rated about 5-7 out of 10 elsewhere.

The warranty period is only a year, of course, and I have had no success in finding a reasonably priced repair option. This unit has never been moved or handled roughly and there were no casualties of nearby appliances which could be explained by a power surge.

Some reviewers have called this dance music, but I wouldn't physically dance to this, nor expect to hear it in a dance club.

Get to know about his marriage to Gala and, of course, marvel at his masterful but disturbing paintings. Observe how his works gradually transformed from still lives to surreal reinterpretations of Renaissance art throughout the course of his life. And see how he tried to tackle his own insecurities and doubts in his art.My only real gripe is Swinglehurst's overly critical selection of works he chose to display. Granted, Dali's overall collection would span several books, but I feel some noteworthy pieces were left out.Great stuff, and a fine introduction to the life and art of Dali."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoable recording.","review":"I purchased the CD mainly for the Rodrigo Concierto de Anarjuez, but I am extremely happy with all the pieces on the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up","review":"If you're looking for a well written, informative, insightful book on Buffy then keep looking.

Not when doing something far more gruesome would produce the same results far more cheaply.And oddly- in the scene when she retrieved the dog from the bushes to go bury it, that was either an unconscious dog or a dead dog, not a replica. No way.I call animal abuse.I would love to be proven wrong as it haunts me.And yes, I understand worrying about one injured then dead dog while speaking of the horrors of war exposes me an an animal nut.So be it.But the actors were acting while the dog was not- I am certain of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Super Nova picture in the French Cinema Universe!","review":"This film is a landmark in the story of the world cinema .

In her attempt to counter the lack of female heroines she creates another imbalance. Women, just like men, are flawed and even the best and greatest can make mistakes. Also, her comments at the end of each story are unnecessary. She should let the readers glean for themselves what is most meaningful. Also, I'm assuming she re-wrote some of these stories.

I couldn't help but feel that I had been taken by Columbia Records with this one. Neither of the leaders are ever close to bringing this session to life. They sound like, well, very old men. To make matters worse the piano and bass player must have fallen asleep in the studio. They are not very supportive on most and nonexistant on other tracks. It seems that the only tracks that held any sort of interest for the players were when max was using brushes. That only accounts for 2 or 3 tracks though.

It does more than confirm Weingarten's reputation as a terrific slide player. It showcases some of his best compositions from the past 15 years; many are absolutely stunning. By placing them in a new context, it emphasizes how much each has to say.Some of the tracks--especially those from \\"Redwood Melodies\\"--are pretty and have engaging hooks. But Weingarten's greatest tunes (in my humble opinion) seem like expressions of important life moments or conversations. The perceptive observations of the compositions are borne out by his touch--alternately tender and searing--on dobro and slide guitar. They are eloquent moods that draw you in with tasty leads and ornamentations; it's all timed so perfectly, yet it doesn't sound like anyone else's music. (Ry Cooder's film music is the probably the closest thing.)I keep playing this album.

First of all, the subject Harvey Glatman is not terribly interesting either as a personality or as a murderer. Second, the book was overly long for the volume of information contained; the second 1/3 - 1/2 is pretty much a rehash of the first part, with no new information coming forth. Best about the book: Glatman, as a true-crime genre subject, is a bit refreshing and even oddly likable insofar as he's not into sadism, and such murders as he committed were (to him) an unpleasant necessity for avoiding punishment in his misguided search for pretty much straight sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hats Off To Michael Newton","review":"My hat's off to Michael Newton -- not for writing this book but for finding a publisher of such trash.

After reading a review saying this chair even worked well for petite females in the office I decided to to go ahead with my decision and order this chair. I'm 5'6\\" and not overly petite but this chair is far too large for me, my feet do not touch the ground and I have to sit on the edge of the chair.

It also needs to be tightened seemingly every 30 days. And today i came out and the arm rest is already split after only 6 months, and no ill treatment.

I've had mine for a couple of weeks now and only wish I had purchased it sooner. Assembly was not difficult and the chair is very comfortable for long days at the desk. If you truly have a bad back and need some special ergonomic chair this is probably not going to cut it, but the lumbar support is quite good for the average person, and I'd never, ever go back to my previous chair. Only time will tell how it will hold up but, all in all, it seems like a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty construction and simple assembly","review":"I am very pleased and impressed with all aspects of this chair.

I had a Good Chef safety can opener and loved it. I had that one for years before it wore out. This one, it's acting like I had it as long as my old one.

In fact the one I bought just because I was at wits end, at the Dollar Tree, lasted longer then many high priced can openers, including this one. I saw this and saw $20 for a can opener? But then I thought I am so over it, I am going to splurge for top of the line. I was very excited about ending the nightmare. About 2-3 weeks later, just stopped working, you could fight with it sometimes and manage to finish opening the can you have partially open, but most the time I had to pull the Dollar Tree one out and struggle through that to get my can open.

Would not be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek 'n Easy","review":"Not only does this can opener look cool, its fairly easy to use. Actually, its so easy, it seems complicated! When I first opened it, I wasn't sure how to use it. Since the packaging actually had a can lid attached to it the can opener (clever!), I was able to figure it out quite quickly and you don't even think you're cutting through anything, but bam! its done with no sharp edges. I remember reading another's review and saw the tiny little pinchers on the left side of the opener and sure enough, that little feature is quite nice as it lifts the lid off easier than grabbing it with clumsy fingers!We'll see how long this lasts...I see other reviewers had problems with this opener down the road. I may add to this if I come across any issues, then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definatley worth it!","review":"I love this can opener! It is smooth and very easy!After using this can opener for awhile I have found some problems. Some cans are put together with too much glue and then the lids are hard to get off and you find your trying to pry a lid that isn't suppose to be attached off of the can. This can be irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse!","review":"I brought this can opener because my mother highly recomended it. I have owned it for two years now and have decided this is the worse can opener I have ever owned. Most of the time I have to go around twice to get the can opened. Some cans it doesn't open at all. I own many Oxo products and am very satisfied with them but this one you can keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can opener is awful!","review":"This company has done the unprecedented. They took an established technology, the $1.99 can opener, made it hugely expensive and so unreliable at actually opening cans that one can only call it a major breakthrough. More than 50% of the time that I attempt to open a can with this product, it fails to cut all the way though, leading to a lengthy wrestling match between me and the can, a match I often lose. They attempt to compensate with a clip to latch onto the edge in order to pull the lid off...needless to say this too is a fruitless endeavor. DO NOT BUY THIS CAN OPENER UNLESS YOU LIKE A CHALLENGE DOING SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE CIRCA 1950 DID WITH NO TROUBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works about half the time","review":"I got this can opener when I got married about 2 years ago, thinking it would be a high-quality, long-lasting item. Actually, it works MAYBE half the time. I'm not an idiot...I know I'm using it properly, but I really don't think it is cutting all the way through the metal. Often, after two or three times around the can, I still can't pry the lid off and have had to resort to throwing the can first at the kitchen wall (out of frustration) and then in the trash because there was no way of getting the food out of the can. And then I threw the can opener in the trash as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR PERFORMER","review":"I purchased my OXO about a year ago and have nothing but problems with it. When it works it works well. The lids come off with no rough edges. However, the opener is difficult to seat correctly on the can; even my wife couldn't figure out the proper way to use it. Most of time, I either can't get a grip on the can with the OXO opener and/or after one or two turns on the handle, the opener loses its grip on the can and then I can't re-establish it. Since I got rid of my old can opener, I have had to resort to using my old c-rations can opener(even that works better). Overall disappointing.....because I love all of my other OXO products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"I bought one of these while looking for a side cutting can opener. It works great for the standard soup can size. However, the handle is mounted on the side which means that when you try to open larger diameter cans with it, the handle bumps into the can and doesn't turn! What's the point of having a replacable lid on your food if the only cans you can do it to are the tiny sizes? Whomever designed this thing should be homeless.Next to useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can opener","review":"They are correct when they say it will not leave sharp edges. That is because it has never opened a can for me. It goes round and round and nothing happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Thought for twenty bucks you'd get something really great, dissapointed. It opens cans OK, but no better than the old fashioned openers. I liked the idea of not having the dirty can top in the food. The smooth edge is nice, but it uncovers some new crud that is withing the top can seem. You now have to be carefull this scum doesn't fall in the food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy can opener to use","review":"I have had this can opener since February 22, 2006 which is almost 4 1/2 years. It has finally given up opening any cans. I looked at all the other brands that are a smooth edge opener and after reading the reviews on them of how the handle broke or it only lasted 2 years I decided to purchase the same one I have used and liked. 1. It is very sturdy. 2. Once you learn how to use it it works great. 3. It does leave a smooth edge, no splinters, doesn't touch any food product. The only problem I have with this can opener is I thought it would last forever. In 4 1/2 years when this new one wears out if there isn't one that is better then I will order another Oxo Good Grips Smooth Edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"can opener","review":"The smooth edge concept is notable but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The operation of this can opener is awkward and difficult. To lock down the can so the opener can pierce the lid, one has to push the can against a stationary object. Plus the operation of the handles is contrary to standard models and is confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a can opener that works.","review":"I have been very frustrated over the years with various can openers that would work for a year or so and then be worn out.

It does a great job and I believe it will last for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last","review":"Purchased this can opener and it broke in less than one month.

The price was reasonable, arrived undamaged.I had little difficulty learning how to operate this device. Unlike my old opener, this does not leave any sharp edges any where. The pincher device for removing the severed lid is an improvement over fishing the lid from the can as happened with the old opener. It works great on rectangular cans also.An added advantage that I have discovered is that the can opened with the OXO makes a very good substitute biscuit cutter for the one I misplaced yesterday. I will now probably wind up with misplaced empty cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"Oxo did well with this can opener. It does everything they say it does, and does it well. We have a similar kind that uses a ratcheting lever, and it doesn't work nearly as well. Not only is the ratcheting motion foreign and tiring to our hands, the opener doesn't actually open some cans unless you run it round the rim 2 or 3 times. This, by contrast, works 'first time, every time!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use if you pay attention.","review":"I would recommend this opener to anyone who can understand instructions....saw several people trying to use it like a traditional can-opener and getting frustated. When used properly it is easy, relaxing and efficient. Great product, rugged too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really easy to use","review":"I'm a fan of Oxo products. They're all well built and just work. The nice thing about this is you don't have to squeeze hard for it to work. Wifey likes this - she's got small hands and isn't the strongest person around.

I had all the same problems expressed in other 1-Star reviews after just a few months. I tried to see if the cutter part could be sharpened or replaced but no luck.

However, the old one was hard to turn, especially with my tendonitis. This one is so easy to turn and does a great job cutting smoothly.

As a matter of fact I threw out my ELECTRIC can opener!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not open cans","review":"I cannot open cans with this can opener!! Do not buy.

I'm throwing this away!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great... except for draining tuna cans.","review":"This can opener works great and I love the smooth edges on the can and lid when you're done. My only complaint is that I like to press the lid in on my can of tuna to drain the juices -- this can opener does not cut the lid on the inside of the can, so you can't press it into the can contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!!","review":"I hate this can opener. In all fairness, I've decided I don't like any side open(safety)can openers. I can't quickly drain the can contents because the lid won't fit inside the can, so I constantly have to dirty the colander. This is the most frustrating can opener due mainly to the fact that it won't stay on the can edge and the gears are constantly slipping. I have to repeatedly go around the can to completely remove the top and that's not very easy with this opener. Maybe I got a dud, but it's been this way since I got it. So today, after 2 years of putting up with this thing, I am replacing it with the WMF Profi Plus can opener. I can't wait for it to arrive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much easier on the hands","review":"Prior to purchasing this can opener, I was using one of the traditional lid-cutting openers which require you to squeeze the handles really hard to keep piercing the lid as you turn the handle. I have big hands, and the handle on my old opener was quite narrow, so it was always uncomfortable. This can opener, by comparison, requires much less pressure on its handle, and the handle is also much larger and padded.The one disadvantage is that it seems to open cans more slowly than my old can opener- as in, you need to rotate the handle a couple more times to get all the way around the lid. However, I'll take the added comfort over that 2-second difference any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conked Out","review":"I got this about a year ago from Amazon. Worked well in the beginning.

It works so well. But after a while it no longer opens a can. Takes many turns around the can to open... and then leaves areas not open so you have to pry open the can. I would expect a product of such apparently quality (and price) to last longer. After buying this, we threw away all our other can openers because this one is so much better. Now we regret that. Unless they figure out how to make it more durable, this product will die. I have contacted OXO to see what they will do. Their web site says 100% Customer Satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable -- doesn't work well on very small cans like tomato paste.","review":"Am I asking for too much? I love the safe edge concept and was happy for a while. Bought it a couple of years ago -- If I pay $20 or so for a can opener I expect it to last until I don't remember buying it. Like my microplane graters which are going strong after 10 years... On this one, the cutting blade fell off, and for the last six months or so, the opener had been skipping or not cutting through without two passes. Will try the zyliss version this time for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little metal slivers","review":"True this can opener is easy to turn but I have found that it often doesn't work on the first time around the can. It also leaves little metal slivers (that I have had to pull out of my fingers)if you try to take the top of the can off with your hands. I may just have a defective version but I contacted customer service and never heard back. My sister hates hers for the same reason. Also when I drain tuna or something I like to do that by using the lid and pushing in to get the juices out and you can't do that with the way this one opens cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"18 months later...still going strong","review":"I try to hold off on my reviews for kitchen products because I really want to make sure the durability is there. Back in February 2007, when I bought this can opener, I was very skeptical of the product's claims to room lids and leave behind smooth edges.Now, 18 months later, I can give this can opener a 5-star review.Here's my quick thoughts:1. The can opener requires some practice to get the hang of it.2. You'll likely spill a little of the can's contents at first.3. It is easy to hold and even easier to clean.4. It is a little bulky, so it doesn't fit in our silverware drawer.5. The can opener works as good today as the first day it arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need to be coordinated","review":"I decided to get rid of my electric can opener to reduce my carbon footprint and bought this product. I have never been accused of being good with my hands or particulartly coordinated, but this product has been much harder to use than I thought. You have to get just the right angle. I usually have to try several times to get it started. Once it does get going it opens the can really easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal shards, always fun!","review":"This was a major can-opening fail.I bought this can opener to replace an old one that stopped working. Surely, I thought, I'd be able to open my darn cans again! But no. This can opener worked well for a very, very brief period - maybe a month? Once it went downhill, it went there fast. First, it stopped cutting through the can and the glue around the can, meaning I had to go around and around to get the can open. Then, it started leaving a few little shards of metal sticking up from the can once the can was open. The day I finally threw it away, it left a large number of shards and bits of metal all over the top of the can, the opener, and the counter.This can opener is really pretty expensive, which means I'm extra cranky that it worked so poorly. I will grant that it is in fact quite comfortable to hold and the handle is easy to grip! But that's not worth much when it doesn't actually open cans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when new. Awful later on.","review":"As other reviews have said, when it's first purchased it works great. I loved it.But after about 3-6 months, it didn't work anymore.

I do not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great for a while","review":"This product worked very well for a little while. The handle was easy for my arthritic fingers to operate and I loved the fact that nothing was sharp when I finished. However, now I have to go around the can sometimes two or even three times to get the lid off. Even then I sometimes have to pry the the lid off. It seems to be worse with smaller diameter cans. I'm tossing it in the trash. I expected better from OXO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away. Do Not Buy Unless You Have Strong Fingernails","review":"Don't buy this product unless you have fingernails made of high carbon steel. This can opener twists easily, spinning around the can with minimal effort. What you're left with when the opener has done its duty, however, is a smooth top that's still stuck to the can. I suppose it's not the can openers fault directly, because what keeps the lids attached is actually the glue used by the food producer. Nevertheless, you're left to pry the top off with your fingernails, a butter knife, the sad metal pincers attached to the ca opener, or something else in the kitchen. It requires two separate processes to open most cans. Bad design. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"can opener","review":"easy to use, I can not see where it cuts the top of a can all I do is the little pinchers on the opener an pinch the edge of the can an it lifts right off. I would give it 5 stars but it is slow opening"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems better than others ....","review":"My wife really likes this style of can opener as it leaves no sharp edges. This is one of the type that cuts through the bead at the top of the can rather than cutting below the bead. The advantage is it leaves a ridge around the top of the can that lets you use one of the snap on plastic storage covers if you don't use the whole contents of the can. The disadvantage means that since it cuts through the bead rather than the can sidewall, the cutter wears out faster.We have had several of these type openers from other manufacturers, and the cutting wheel seems to wear out in a year or so. This one looks much more robust, so maybe it will last longer. Time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible but amazing","review":"I came here to start the return process as we could not get this thing to work; to us it just seemed to mark the side of the cans (we tried several). Upon very close inspection I noticed one section seemed to have a deeper cut and I put my nail in the cut; POOF! The lid popped right up! It is cut internally, you really do have to use the side pinchers to remove the lid but the lid pops back on resealing your unused portion! After almost 40 years of the same can opener it took my Mom a few tries to get the feel but once you do... this is really great, especially for people with weak hands!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more dangerous sharp edges","review":"Can lids cut with a conventional can opener can be dangerously sharp. I know someone who sliced open her hand on a can lid in the trash - it was a deep cut requiring stitches. The Oxo smooth edge can opener eliminates those sharp edges. I've had mine for several years now and it still works great. I've never encountered any problems with any cans I've opened, and I've opened lots of cans - tomatoes, beans, fruit, condensed milk - you name it.PROS: ergonomic, smooth to hold, large knob makes it easier to turn, remains clean after cutting the can open, bonus feature of metal \\"pincers\\" on the side to grab & lift up the can lid after cuttingCON: bulky, takes up a lot of space in the drawer (but I can live with that!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work.","review":"Bought this is Bed Bath & Beyond because I needed a can opener ASAP...splurged for the expensive OXO can opener and what a disaster.

It works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid unless all your cans are round","review":"This opener is beautiful. You can grab this opener anywhere and won't get hurt, unlike some other less bulky openers with exposed blades. However, instead of opening the can right below the rim of the can, this thing cuts right on the rim. The rim is multiple times thicker than the body of the can, cutting on the rim only wears out the opener faster. Not to mention how hard it is to pull the top out (even with the built in pincer). While it opens well when new, I don't expect this opener to last very long. Will update when this thing dies.--- Updated 2012 9/4 ----This opener won't open anything with a elongated shape. The can will get into the turning knob's way and you can't turn it.Do not buy unless all your cans are round.

I very much like the way it leaves the can smooth & easy to empty out especially if needing a spatula to do so; and taking the lid off is a SNAP with the special attachment on the opener. I've had trouble getting other can openers attached to the can--not so with this Can Opener.OXO Good Grips Smooth Edge Can OpenerVery happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"When one pass is not enough, be prepared to go around the can indefinitely... This product should not be sold as it truly does not work as described. We had this for over a year and today after several failed attempts on a tuna can it finally went into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This is a good one recommended for people with kids. When I first opened it up I was not sure how to use it. But After bout 5 minutes of playing around with it, it makes sense. The best thing about this opener is that the edges are not sharp and the top does not fall in the food.Well designed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated","review":"There may be people who find this easy to use or who think it's worth the effort to get the kind of edge this produces. For me, it was as the British say \\"too clever by half\\"--you have to hold it exactly right to make it work and keep it going. I got a cheaper one that works a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !!","review":"This is the best can opener I've ever used! With arthritis in my hands and wrists I've always struggled with can openers. (The electric ones take up valuable counter space and tend to spill the liquid contents.) The Oxo is easy to grip, easy to turn the knob and I appreciate the little jaw-grippy thingy on the side to help seperate the can and lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great tool","review":"I bought this to replace my Pampered Chef can opener because the plastic handle broke, leaving only the metal frame. I'm used to the 'vertical' type can openers and have tried the 'horizontal' variety like this Oxo before, but to my dissappointment. I found them difficult to use. I bought the Oxo because I like the brand in general and read some good reviews about this product. It works great. My only problem, and perhaps it will resolve itself, is that I find it difficult to intially place the canopener on the can, and also I don't know when I'm done cutting - there's no change in feeling or no noise when you go all the way around the can. I'm still reccommending it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Tricky to rock around!!!","review":"I have had this for a year and I have never found a better can opener. It's morre effective then most electric opners, unless you want to go comercial. It took a couple of tries to get the hang of it but I've never had a problem since then.With all the praise said, I did get one for my parents and they can't figure it out at all. If the standard mechanics of how a can opener works are too ingrained in your genetics then you might want to skip this one. Otherwise you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT DISHWASHER SAFE","review":"Despite what the product description says, the OXO Smooth Edge Can Opener is NOT dishwasher safe. I had to find that out the hard way when, after receiving and opening the product, I noticed that there was no care instruction in the instruction manual or on the product packaging. Going directly to the OXO website ([...]), the truth is revealed - hand wash only. That's a deal breaker for us as we needed an easy-to-use, dishwasher-safe can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea with too short a life","review":"When we received this opener, we loved it. It worked great, and was easy on the hands. We were sick of the \\"rechargeable\\" batteries in the battery-operated openers lasting only so long, which is why we changed to this human-powered model. We also liked the no-sharp-edges result. It lasted exactly one year, then it began skipping as it wound around the can until it was no longer usable. The warranty isn't as great as it sounds since because of the cost to ship this item back to Oxo; we'll put the money towards a new (and different) opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"This can opener worked great for a few months. Then it started slipping. I decided to take it apart to see what was wrong and found plastic gears with very thin teeth, some of which had snapped off. It worked well but wore out fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Worked well for a short while and then the gears began to strip and now I must go around the can 2 or 3 times before I can get the lid to come off. Also, large cans require me to \\"walk around the can\\" because they are too heavy for the Oxo to spin them around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly Dead After Just a Year","review":"I was very pleased with this can opener when I got it, but after just a year, its performance has become hit or miss, sometimes not opening the can at all. Fortunately, I still have my good old traditional can opener, which has worked perfectly fine for at least 25 years--the exact same one--and still works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless - unable to open many cans","review":"I bought this because I saw a friend using one and thought it was cool. \\"no more sharp edges - why would you NOT want one?\\"Unfortunately many, many can lids are sealed with glue. After you cut through the can lid, which often requires 2 full passes, the lid does not easily pull off. Instead you must use the \\"beak\\" attachment to pry the lid off. This can be physically difficult (which means I'm called into the kitchen to pull the sword out of the stone). About 5% of cans I encounter are still impossible to open this way, and I have to pull out my ugly, rusty, falling apart \\"traditional\\" opener to complete the task.10 minutes to open a can? Memorizing which brands use glue? No way! I will donate this gizmo to some unlucky person, and will buy the \\"traditional\\" OXO can opener. Do yourself a favor and follow suit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manual Can Opener","review":"Great looking product - great feel in your hand - worked good for a short while then I had to continue on and on trying to open the same can. All-n-all not too pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this opener","review":"We first bought one about four years ago and it worked great. Slowly it started to skip and you had to go around the can twice, then three times, then four and finally it stopped working. The grip just does not close enough to make a clean cut. To Oxo's credit, they replaced that one without question. The second one is now only three months old and is failing. We keep an old fashion opener around, which is thirty years old and has never failed. We like the idea of the lid remover over the can opener, but are not sure what to do next. There are several other openers of this type that have generally mixed reviews. Cooks like one that is $38, that is a lot for one to fail after a year. I suspect that we will continue to use the replacement Oxo until it completely fails, then return it under their life time warranty. We will always keep out trusty can opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kitchen MUST-HAVE!!!!","review":"Stop what you are doing and buy this can opener! Now! It is the best can opener on the planet for many reasons. 1) It's hand operated (energy & money saving). 2) It's so easy to use, my 7-year-old can do it. 3) It's good for emergencies, but also for everyday use. 4) It's SAFE! Removes the whole lid without leaving sharp edges. 5) It's sanitary! The little bird beak-like clip picks the lid up so you never have to touch the uncooked food. Buy buy buy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOW, I am VERY disappointed in this can opener","review":"We have owned this can opener for 3 years, and it USED to work like a charm. We specifically purchased it because we did not want any metal contaminates from the can in our food, particularly because we have a toddler. The issue is that for the past 4 months it has just gone bad. It's extremely hard to open can goods. It takes about 15 turns for it to semi open the can, and then it has to be pried open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Pampered Chef version","review":"I got these as a Christmas gift and I had previously owned the Pampered chef Smooth Edge can opener. I wanted a replacement that would take the lids off smoothly, but then also leave that smooth rim so you could also reuse the can top as a lid to reseal the can. This OXO and the P.C. brand do the exact same thing in the exact same way, EXCEPT the OXO brand feels so much better in your hand while using them. The next test will be to see if it LASTS longer. The life expectancy for the Pampered Chef can opener is 3 years approximately- I made mine last 5, but it was hit or miss at opening cans by that point. I haven't had this OXO one long enough to see if it will stand the test of time. As far as storage goes, it is slightly bulkier than the Pampered Chef opener, but I'll happily make room."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST!","review":"This is the most amazing can opener EVER! You never have to worry about anyone getting cut, or it cutting through your garbage bag. In our town we can only recycle the can, not the lid. And the feature of taking the lid off without using your fingers is just amazing at keeping your hands clean.I can't say enough about this wonderful tool. I have given it to several people as a gift. If you are one of the people that think electric can openers are for wimps, then this is the hand can opener to get. Don't even think of any other!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Can Opener","review":"The Opener was a great buy, it works well..so well that sometimes I don't know if its working. But it works great, the edges are so smooth you never have to worry about nicking yourself or a child cutting themselves. Excellent buy, the only thing is I wish the packaging came with better directions on how to operate the opener. Its a bit tricky at first, but after a few times you'll be comfortable with the device and how it functions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative E-Z way to open cans in an instant","review":"It's true - fixes on the top of the can, turns very very gently and easily, then the entire lid of the can is off. (It doesn't hang on). So you don't have that classic (and ragged and sharp) swinging lid to fold down to save half the can in the fridge. But, it's amazingly light and fast to do its job. Neither the lid nor the can rim is sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Incredible opener. I previously had an early model (from a TV only purchase). It worked, but this is heads above that one. It is easy to attach, runs smoothly and it's easy to tell when the edge is cut. The lid remover is fantastic, no more fighting with lined can lids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"This is a great can opener. No more sharp edges. I especially like the fact that I can empty the cans of soup without leaving half of the contents under the Campbell's ring. I complained to them about their pull-off lid but to no avail. I didn't mind spending the money as this is a very good opener. Read the directions and you will find it's a breeze to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best can opener ever!","review":"I am so impressed with this can opener. It is so easy to use and truly leaves both the lid and the can with smooth edges. It has easily opened every can so far. It feels good in your hands and is easy to turn. Someone with severe arthritis may have trouble using it. Maybe they could come up with an electric version for those who have trouble using a manual can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible tool","review":"what a piecr of junk. tough to use and you have to circle the can a few times. expensive and DEFINATLY not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.O.S.","review":"This can opener is the biggest P.O.S. I have ever used. Heaven forbid if you are older, my grandmother struggles with this thing all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, til it died","review":"We like this type of can opener in our home since it does not produce sharp edged lids... This one proved its worth for about 6 months, then it died... stopped working well. It is in our trash can and I am relying on reviews like this one to point me to my next \\"disposable\\" can opener. Can't anyone make something good that lasts any longer?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work on some cans","review":"My husband (a 14 year chef) and I both hate this can opener! It is awkward to use and friends helping me cook always have a hard time with it. Worst of all there are some cans we run across on a regular basis that it just does not work on! Looks pretty and sturdy, that's about all it has going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wore Out in Less than a Year","review":"Although I think that its method of opening a can is much better than that of conventional can openers, the product has a serious deficiency in that it wears out much too quickly. My opener wore out in only eight months. It is now virtually unusable since the gears are stripped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it.","review":"After suffering an old, regular-style can opener for the last two years I finally broke down and bought this one. Now I wish I would hav bought it two years ago!Solid construction and it works like a charm. I've never been so enamored with a can opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth as silk","review":"I like the OXO brand and thought I would give the \\"smooth edge can opener\\" a try. The first time I used it, it was so smooth and easy I had no idea I had opened the can! It continues to perform in the same way - purchased it in early March 2011. It works a little differently than a standard hand held opener, but it is very easy and easy to adjust to. Only time will tell how long it will last, but with the OXO brand name I am hoping for a while! So far it is everything that it promised to be, and yes, the edges are completely smooth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Opener I've ever owned","review":"I've only had this opener for about a month, but it's easily the best I've ever owned. I disagree completely with the reviewer that says it has a hard time opening small cans. I open almost exclusively very small cans of tomato paste with this thing without any problems. It's just so easy to use and nice on the grip I actually look forward to opening cans now.If it's true that this opener doesn't last more than a year like others are saying then I'm ok with that as long as Oxo sends me a new one when it dies. But I'm a single household so I find that my kitchen products last alot longer than most people's anyway just because most people cook for more than just themselves. But this opener is so great in my opinion its worth the trouble of replacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product!","review":"Worked like a charm - for a month. After that, it stopped opening most cans, even when making two or three (or more!) passes around the can. This thing is going straight into the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on all cans","review":"This device fails to open a significant percentage of the cans we try it on. For example, tonight, it failed to open a small (4 oz) can of jalepenos.At first, I thought my wife wasn't using it correctly, but she was. Since we've had it a while and discarded the packaging after a few successful uses, I'm afraid we've wasted our money. At least we still have our conventional openers.Avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Most of the time this side cutting can opener works well but there are certain cans where it doesn't cut all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last","review":"I agree with other reviewers of this product. It works wonderfully for a time, maybe a year, maybe more or less depending on how many cans you open. Then it will begin to only open cans partially. Then it will barely open any part of the can. We are at that point now.We just bought an old fashioned can opener that I know will work forever. Bummer. I liked the lids with no sharp edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"I bought this from amazon. It worked great for about three months and I was happy with it. (Mind you our family eats canned veggies every evening)Then....after three months the can opener started to miss the can and would slip off (not work), the steel started to shred into the food in the can, the last step it was not functioning. I went back to the old can opener where the lid drops in. Works better for the tuna can. Don't buy this POS!!! Save your money and stick with what you have now or get the Oxo regular can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"I rarely use a can opener. This thing broke after very few uses... no longer works. Even tho I have had it a while only used such a few times that for a family who uses it daily... won't last."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to turn","review":"I realize I'm in the minority here, but I do not find this can opener comfortable to use. The crank does have a \\"good grip\\", but I'm not trying to grip it, I'm trying to turn it. I do this by putting my right thumb under the near end and pushing up, with my index finger on the far end pushing down. The knob's shape (relatively short, fat in the middle and tapering to rounded ends) makes this cumbersome and tiring. It does open cans cleanly most of the time, but If i'm opening a large can or several cans, I reach for my old basic Swingaway (which sells, incidentally, for less than half the price of this OXO)."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Love the smooth edge concept, but actually removing lids from the cans is work. Doesn't work on all cans, as others have mentioned. Overall, it's triple the effort to open up a can. No one in the house cut themselves before we had this, so I'm going back to conventional or scoping out a better made execution. Usually I'm very fond of Good Grips products. Not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last","review":"The folks who gave the 5-star reviews have not had their can openers very long. It does a great job at first but eventually fails after 12-18 months. Read the other reviews-- it's a sure thing it will fail. Steer clear of this Oxo gadget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Open Cans!","review":"I bought this to do one thing - open cans. It mostly doesn't do that one thing, even after going all the way around several time."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"not a good product, spend a couple of extra bucks and get the pampered chef opener as I will need to do. The real test for me came when I took it camping and tried opening a larger than normal can of chili and it could not do its job. I have to use my old pampered chef opener that I have had for several years until I can get a new one.To sum it up for me is the old saying \\"you get what you pay for\\" and trying to save a couple of dollars did not pay off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"My wife and I bought this can opener because we like the idea of not having a sharp edge on the opened can. The problem with this one is that it will not open most cans. It has a sort of \\"pliers\\" built in, so you can twist and rip the lid off after you have tried opening it with the cutter. Paid $20 and do not use, after trying it several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXO Can Opener","review":"Nice looking but not as easy to use as one would seem. It appears to open the can, but it won't open. Most times you have to use the opener 2 to three times for it to actually remove the lid. It's not real easy to get the opener on the lid to even use it. You have to look under the opener as you are putting it on the lid to make sure it's on right."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst can opener I've ever owned","review":"It is difficult to get the can opener into the correct position on the can. You cannot tell when the cutting circle has been completed. The lid must be pryed off with a knife or now-non-existent fingernails. The $2.00 can openers are better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and easy","review":"Smooth and easy to use. No unusual pressure needed. So good to use.

This one should not have been it. Hard to turn. Everyone who picks it up needs instruction in how it works (and they invariably ask why we bought it). We wanted the safe edge aspect for the grandkids... but we'll look elsewhere. Watch for this baby on Woot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persistence pays","review":"This can opener was a gift, but at first a frustrating one - I was unable to open any can with it!!! I was ready to pitch it, but instead sat down and read some of these reviews. A few reviewers said it worked so effortlessly they thought it wasn't working at all. SO I tried again. Lo and behold the lid came right off with those great little pliers! I'm really glad I waited until after the holiday rush and tried again. It was also helpful to learn that the can itself is not sharp - I had assumed it would be. SO FAR I like it. I'll amend this review (or write another) if it gives out in less than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst can opener I have ever owned","review":"At first it was good, but the blade got dull quick!

It's a fair trade, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior quality","review":"This replaced the OXO Good Grips Smooth Edge Can Opener that I'd had for many years. That one worked beautifully, and when it finally wore out I never hesitated to replace it with the same model. Only it's not the same. This one never worked well. It never opened a can on just one go-round, like the first one did. I had to spin it around at least four or five times before the lid was detached fully, and while I got used to it, it got to the point where I was the only one in the household talented (or patient) enough to open cans. Life is too short for this. I replaced it with a Zyliss lock-n-lift, which opens cans quite efficiently. I can live with the danger, living on the edge as it were, manipulating sharp edges. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not sure if I would buy another one.","review":"Haven't used it but a couple of times. Each time the lid would not come off easily.

Maybe I need more time to get used to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product from a usually reliable company","review":"I purchased this can opener to replace my older smooth edge can opener made by a different company, one that had always worked really well but simply gotten old and needed replacing. I expected to really like this Good Grips opner, as I have of their other kitchen tools, so I was really surprised at the at the poor design and problems with this opener. First, one complete revolution of the can NEVER is enough to completely open it. You have to do it two or even three times. Even then, it is very difficult to remove the lid with either the \\"beak\\" on the opener itself or with your fingers, leading to spillage. I've had it a month, and I'm about to go out and buy a similar smooth edge opener from a different manufacturer. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - needs to install proprietary drivers!","review":"Amazon doesn't provide compatibility information on this product,so here it is:- it works only with Windows (98 and up)- if you don't install Addonics proprietary drivers, only CF slot will work (even Addonics tech support wasn't sure about that!)- basically, you have to install their drivers if you want to be able to use it- NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LINUX or MACAddonics had a good idea with interoperable memory card readers but failed to make it compatible with standard USB mass storage driver. The need for additional drivers makes it unusable anywhere else but in Windows and it's a common knowledge stability of Windows greatly reduces with additional installed drivers and sw.Due to lack of compatibility and flexibility I don't recommend this product.

Three needle bind-off. Cons: require three needles...

So I tried a new \\"tubular\\" cast-on technique offered by Wiseman as the \\"most professional, beautiful, elegant\\" cast-on possible. The only drawbacks she identifies for it are that it takes more yarn and more time. Well, I'm all about taking more yarn and more time to get it right. So I closely, carefully followed the instructions, did everything right (which I knew because the \\"discard\\" piece of contrast-color yarn I started with pulled cleanly out of the tube) and I ended up with a RUFFLED edge that flares out away from the hips. And not in a good way. Gah. Why didn't I just stick with the old dependable long-tail cast-on I've used for 20 years?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to Know","review":"The book contains great information that we all probably know but don't remember right off hand.

I keep finding it on the table next to my knitting spot, instead of on the bookshelf where it belongs! I pull it out to decide which increase or decrease to use, to remember which bind-off will look best on the thing I'm knitting, or to figure out what the edging will do before I put it on the sweater.It's a very simple book, with clear diagrams of basic techniques, including the pros and cons of each one. Many other books contain the same information. This one is easy to refer to over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have book.","review":"I have been knitting for 43 years and was surprised by how much I still had to learn when I read Wiseman's book. This book is a must have book for every knitter's library. Well written, every technique explained in the book is easy to execute. In many cases several different methods for doing a particular technique are given with recommendations for when each one should be used. With this book in your knitting basket you will never be afraid to try a new and challenging pattern again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet","review":"I agree with all of the reviews in that the basics are largely covered and the photographs are excellent. The only thing that I wish to point out is that if you have a basic knitting reference on your shelf, you will find that this book does not cover anything new. What it provides is a quick reference to the basics that knitters use frequently in a package that you might be willing to lug around in your knitting bag. It isn't small by any means but it is a heck of a lot smaller and lighter than Vogue.If you have been knitting for a while and don't need a reference for basic techniques, I'd pass on this book.

But I found that in most cases, this book contains the exact same information as Vogue Knitting, but with diagrams that are harder to follow. In some cases, Vogue Knitting actually contains more information.For example, this book describes a Kitchener Stitch bind off that you can use for 1x1 ribbing that is very elastic and good for areas like the neck where you need a lot of elasticity. Among the \\"cons\\" the book mentions is the fact that you can only use this bind off for 1x1 ribbing. While that statement is, strictly speaking, true (you can't use this exact bind off for 2x2 ribbing), Vogue Knitting features a modified version for 2x2 ribbing that this book does not have!Bottom line: Go withVogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Bookfor better diagrams and more info!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Must have\\" book for knitters","review":"Besides the clear instructions, photos, and illustrations, this book has so much info that you never find in pattern instructions.

With that said, this part collapsed in about 12-15 months of average \\"soccer mom\\" driving. While the price is great, I would pay 50% more for a part that would last over 2 years.I agree with the other reviewer that the part did not fit correctly. The chassis hole mounts were spaced too far apart. I had to dremel about 1/16\\" to fit without stripping bolt threads."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are junk pure and simple","review":"Bottom line this product is a cheaply made Chinese knock off. Anchor makes their video and waxes about the product like it's the best thing since sliced bread. Don't believe it. It is NOT a good buy.

Videos and forums described how easy (and much cheaper) to replace.After installation, the engine has a vibration that was not there with the old part. ASAP I plan on replacing the old part to see if the vibration is in fact from the new mount."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Angst, Nihil, and Xtort, you will hate MDFMK","review":"MDFDMK shows the softer side of KMFDM, and frankly I don't like it. The usual sounds of KMFDM's jamming guitars are nowhere to be found on this album. In Anarchy and it's mixes, MDFMK just plain doesn't sound like good old KMFDM."},{"rating":"2","title":"If not for it all, get it for the Anarchy Mixes!","review":"This CD was pretty amazing, but I mainly enjoyed the Anarchy mixes. Perhaps it was because that was my favorite song at the time. The Fusako and the God And The State mixes both have a very nice instrumental-type solo within them, and it's nice to listen to over and over, because of their enhanced melody. The megalomaniac mixes focus more upon the beat, and DJ Talla makes it a sort of dance club mix. It's decent. Unfit wasn't a favorite of mine either, but it grows on you. The Unfit mix is well done, Gunter Schulz does a good job, and makes it just as good as the original, if not better. Overall, it's worth the cost. It's something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Idol tried and failed, KMFDM blows it out of the water","review":"\\"This is Counter-culture, From the underground, Eternal Revolution, This is our sound.

This single, MDFMK, was my first purchase from the stockpile of KMFDM merchandise, and it is my most favorite. The remixes are of some of KMFDM's best songs, but from a whole different aspect, showing the creativity that came behind these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not enough from the master himself","review":"Very interesting to analyse the signature recipes of the master, but the bulk of the book contains recipes of Robuchon proteges -- of the 48 recipes in total, only 8 are by Robuchon, which was rather disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, sumptuous cooking from a French master using loads of truffles, caviar and foie gras. First class all the way.","review":"This is an extraordinary cookbook and, at least in the French edition, a book printed on paper so luxurious as to make the volume weigh twice as much as you might think it would. But, to the cooking: these are sumptuous and wonderful recipes and preparations by one of the great contemporary French chefs. The outlook on food and eating does assume that you have ready and easy access to both truffles and caviar. There are extensive photos and text about the Joel Robuchon restaurant, and also about the purveyors and sources of many of the food types. A lovely book in every way, but not a Julia Child hand holder for the beginner or for those unprepared to spend what it takes to use the ingredients called for in the recipes.

I have tried it several times and it does not live up to its description. It falls off after I shower (thus not waterproof), and with in a hour after putting on dry skin it is falling off.

I got this boxed set (which costs just as much or more as buying the individual cds), then I got all of the albums that didn't make the cut, like The Final Cut, Obscured by Clouds, Atom Heart Mother, More, and Piper at the Gates of Dawn. While the book is interesting, it doesn't say anything that can't be learned on the internet. All in all, this set ISN'T all in all. It leaves out 2 of their best 4 albums, and only because Dave Gilmour didn't like them. Guess what, Dave: The Division Bell is a real letdown!

Alternatively, if you do know something about King John, and just want a different view on him, read this. I belong in the latter category I think, and I really loved this romp through one of England's most underrated kings. Ashley puts up a staunch defence of John (he wasn't all bad you know) and should be recommended reading for everyone, just so that the demons about him being an overly tyrannical useless king can be expurged forever.It sometimes goes a bit OTT though - Ashley just asserts, doubtfully, that Richard the Lionheart was a homosexual without much explanation.

I essentially picked up the collection for only one song, the old Brewer & Shipley anthem, \\"One Toke Over The Line\\", but on repeated listenings, I have found both discs to be quite enjoyable, and I have gained more respect for the art form. I hope that this album will be reissued again soon, as I believe it is out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, informative read","review":"This book was quite interesting. Told from the perspective of an Englishman who was living in Korea at the time the Japanese invaded and began their \\"colonization\\" of Korea. It can get a little bogged down in names as people come in and out of what's happening and there are many different names thrown at you, but the information was very enlightening. The author's final caution and call for action in the Asian theater is frighteningly prophetic when we look at the time this book was published and the series of events that would lead to WWII in the Pacific.

It has been a how-to Japanese gardening classic for many years, and is a fine place to start. Long on good photography, not wordy, but gets right to the design philosophy behind the gardens. Especially well geared for those without a lot of space to work with. I only wish it were bigger!

Definitely not to decorate a coffee table, but to practically show one options (various bridges, paths, fencing, ponds, etc) that one can incorporate into their garden for a japanese feel.

My local school district offers free SEE Sign classes so I decided to give it a whirl. Well...bravo! I came home and taught my son what I had learned and he actually learned the SEE alphabet in 2 days. It's like our own secret language. He is also very verbal, but this is another method of communication and it is fantastic. He actually asks me what the sign is for different words and I get my SEE Sign book out and we look it up together and learn the sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"great resource!","review":"Get the pocket edition of this book and carry it with you! I mistakenly ordered the small size and was surprised when such a tiny book arrived, but now I'm thrilled.My middle child was speech delayed due to a transient hearing loss. I had heard often of parents using baby signs but had never really considered it myself. Now I wish I would have, because my daughter *loves* to use sign. I chose a \\"real\\" sign language instead of creating signs, as some parents choose to do, because I wanted consistancy, uniformity and the chance that their signing might come in handy with a signing person. After all, why re-invent the wheel?The full size version of this book is much easier to read, but the convenience of the small size makes the slight difficulties in interpreting the signs worth the while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR ALL NEW AND CURRENT DM FAN!","review":"This is my original review when i was under a different screen name(jugoso25) October 24, 1998This is a great cd!

Maybe I'm just an idiot and didn't realize that this was not one of their singles. Nonetheless, it is an important part of their image that is totally absent from this compilation.

This CD is powerful. It only falters on the last couple of songs. 'Fruit Trader' is an excellent opener. Angry and rockin'. 'Your life is now' is a great sing-along. 'It all comes true' is my personal favorite. This may sound silly, but Mellencamp has just a simplicity in his lyrics that I can relate to. No need to read between the lines.

On this album it seems that Mellencamp is trying to start fresh and the self title is sort of evidence of that. The music have more of a modern approach but I don't think it work at all. It's very hard to find any song that immediately catches your attention, and \\"Your life is now\\" is the closest Mellencamp get in that department. Even straight after listening to this album, from the beginning to the end, it's hard to remember any of the songs, since they are at best mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The beginning of Mellencamp's Old Man rock phase - complete let down from his \\"Mr. Happy Go Lucky\\" album - Although I did like \\"Fruit Trader\\" and \\"I'm Not Running Anymore\\" 2 good songs out of 12 does not make it worth buying - I have not listened to this album in years"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mellancamps latest is truly dissapointing.","review":"From the heartless starting track of Fruit trader all the way to the goofy name of \\"Chance Meeting of the Tarantula\\", JM strikes out.

This EDT projects like a mad-man and lasts and lasts and lasts...Definitely a strip club or night club cologne that will eat up anyone's Paco Rabanne 1 Million scent, and have room left over for a 2000 calorie dessert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Who would ever think to get excited over a funnel? Well I didn't think I would but I did. When it arrived I needed to use it straight away to get my drink into a plastic water bottle to take with me. I loved how it felt in my hand. It was light, with a nice grip...it was just right! The design of it is just great, every little detail matters. The non-slip grip stips on the sides of the funnel along with the tab for easy holding make this a joy to use. I love the fact that the two funnels come with a strainer that goes into the end from the outside. I don't know when I'll ever use that but if I need to, it's there! I was not disappointed with this purchase. I had been using 2 Liter coke bottle cut in half as a funnel for a long time. It was time for an upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"What can you say about a funnel? I like the fact that the strainer stores by snapping into the bottom of the funnel (no digging in a drawer to find the smaller part). It could be a little more generous in depth but the semi/translucent funnel makes it easy to see the progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent kitchen untensil","review":"This funnel set was more than I expected. Great high-temp plastic can with-stand high heat w/o melting. The strainer 'clips' into the larger funnel so that it doesnt get sloshed around by your liquid and fail to do its job. The strainer also snaps into the tip of the smaller funnel so it doesnt get lost while being stored. The rubber 'accenst' are actually desigend and placed for 'gripping' the vessel you are filling so that you dont have to worry about the funnel falling out. Nice wide 'mouth' on each funnel for fewer spills. I only wish that all 3 pieces would 'snap' togehter for storing the whole system together. Otherwise, this is the perfect funnel set."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a funnel...","review":"What can you really say? It's a good quality funnel set and I do like the little rubber \\"grips\\" but I'm not sure how much good they really do. Regardless, this is a necessary addition to any kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love OXO products. This funnel set is sturdy and having two sizes is convenient. When I can I always buy OXO. The little strainer is an added bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent funnels","review":"Some of the other reviewers seem overly enthused about this pair of funnels; there's nothing innovative about them. All around, I have no complaints about them, save one: I would've preferred that the smaller funnel have a smaller tip, so that I could use it to fill some spice dispensers that I have with small holes. Both of the funnels have tips that are about 1/2\\" in diameter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Strainer!","review":"Well as with all of my OXO products its attractive, easy to use, grippy, and durable. What I didn't realize was that it had a little built in strainer that allows you to use the two funnels together to strain your liquids; how fabulous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for any normal uses in the kitchen.","review":"I bought this set as a kitchen tool, but it did not work as I expected. I would read the product dimensions carefully and consider what you need. There were two main issues:1. The diameter of the outflow is very narrow. So far, I have used it twice and it did not work for:- a pureed carrot soup with no major chunks- refilling my pepper mill with whole peppercorns - they clogged the funnel.2. The diameter of the bowl is not big enough. You can't pour say, a large pyrex bowl, cleanly into it. We have a storage container with a 6\\" diameter and that is too big to easily use this as well.I would use this for freely flowing liquids only - no soups, no whole spices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Funnels","review":"*****These are nice funnels. I, like other reviewers, am not a big fan of the strainer, because it does seem to pop out, but I just ignore it and use the funnels for everything. They stay in place really well because of the rubber lines running up and down the funnel, so kitchen tasks are much easier than with a regular funnel. OXO tends to have easy-to-use designs of much better quality than average, and these funnels are no exception.They are easy to store because the small one fits inside the larger one, and they hang very nicely in my pantry.*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't handle super hot temps but it can't rust","review":"My hand me down metal funnel has rust along the seam where the blacksmith smelted the metal sheet together to form the cone. I find that the funnels adjust to a tight fit - making a *boot* noise but they stick right in there. Metal wouldn't be so flexible. A funnel is just something that is good to have in one's home. I don't use scissors or staplers all the time but I have to have those too. I've used this to transfer body lotion and maple syrup and in cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable addition to my kitchen accessories","review":"I was surprised at how versatile this product is -- the built in, self-attaching filter is a great plus. The small size funnel just about fits flush with my 2oz tincture bottles, so be wary, these aren't for precision delivery to extra-small bottles. Other than that, I give this product an A."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product","review":"Oxo makes great products and these funnels are no exception. They come two to a set with a small strainer that helps filter solids. The funnels have a rubberized \\"thumb spot\\" that allows you to hold the funnel with ease. This is handy when dealing with oils. The best feature is the series of rubberized stripes that run down the outside of the funnel to hold it securely in the vessel and prevent it from tipping. As a person who has knocked over funnels before, I really appreciate this feature. If you need a funnel, this is the set you should buy. Clean up is easy, just throw them in the diswasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"Was very impressed with the funnels-when put in container to pour liquid you don't need to worry about it tipping and you can use both hands for whatever you are pouring instead of having to worry about holding the funnel in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The item was described as ordered, and I am satisfied with it, that is about all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little funnels!","review":"There are two and they snap together for easy storage, the larger one has a removable plastic strainer that is very useful.

It was an old book when I first read it. Some of the ideas in the book would be frowned upon or even illegal in todays world of hunting. There are still many ideas shared in the book that may help todays hunter either make better use of materials or modify the idea into more modern hunting techniques. My two sons now go hunting each fall with me and I have purchased each of them a copy of this book. More for a fun read and somewhat of a tradition between my sons and myself.

However, the CD production was incredibly sloppy. Some of the stories are split between CDs which I suppose is minor if you are listening from a physical CD, but if you are ripping them into iTunes it makes it impossible to rip each story as an individual file.Above that, they have ***mis-labled many of the files***. I had to go through the entire thing and repair the file names so that they would plan in iTunes in order. It will cause you an extra few hours annoyance to re-label the files.Do not buy this CD.

There new album iz a awesome collection of new songs and old songs played only how Reel Big Fish can play them; with that different blend of ska meeting different aspects of music to make Reel Big Fish who they are. Reel Big Fish has definately earned there mark in the stars and in hip hop words, \\"keeping it reel\\". Hmmm. Maybe thats a new title to a Reel Big Fish song or album. Much love to all y'all skankin' fishes in the band and i'm here if ya need a collaberation on a song.

It had very little ska, and overall, it didn't sound like Less than Jake, more like an over-produced imitation.The horns were probably the worst part.

What there was, was extremely repetetive and boring.Some songs, like \\"Five State Drive\\", and \\"Scott Farcas takes it on the chin\\", sounded vaguely like classic LTJ, but overall, this CD is probably their worst so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not the LTJ i know","review":"this album has good lyrics. the band has matured but their sound has gone down hill. it sounds like it was recorded in some big studio with a bunch of company bigwigs who wanted to make money off a younger generation. a true LTJ fan would not find this album pleasing"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING-Might as well be Goldfinger","review":"Face it, if you are a real LTJ fan then you have to realize that this album is horrible.

Scott Farcas Takes It On The Chin is the best on the Cd. Also: Check out Losing Streak also by LTJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Their Best","review":"This CD is amazing. Right off the bat Last One Out of Liberty City gets you going with the amazing bass line. Then songs like Scott Farcas Takes it on the Chin have super catchy horns that just make you jump up and dance. All My Best Friends Are Metalheads is also an amazing song. This album starts a trend that was seen in all the albums after this one as well, that is Roger, the bass player, sings lead more than he usually has before. This adds some different flavor to songs and sounds really good. Chris does amazing vocals as well, but the change just spices it up. Cool album, i say buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Band!","review":"This is the first LTJ CD I have ever got and I'm glad I did. I could tell from the first song that this CD was awesome.

But otherwise get this one, in terms musically, this is one of their best"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best!","review":"I've been listening to these guys for years, and unlike the rest of these people I think this CD is superior to Losing Streak.

It has a different flavor than \\"Losing Streak,\\" sounding awesome in a new way that only Less Than Jake could accomplish. A must have for any LTJ fan, EVERYTHING about this CD rules.

This is also my favorite, just edging out Losing Streak. My favorite tracks are All My Best Friends Are Metalheads, History of a Boring Town, Great American Sharpshooter and Big Crash. These are also some of their best songs period IMO. I would recommend all LTJ albums, but Hello Rockview, Lozing Streak and Borders & Boundaries first. Although short, the quality make the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, totally rad","review":"For all of those people out there who said this is their best album, you're all looking at the quality of recording. By you guys saying that, you're saying that all the rest of their stuff was not as good. Their new stuff is just as rad as their old stuff with the awesome hooks they always provide. They play their new stuff live with just as much life as they do their old stuff. The sound is due to more experienced recording and recording equipment. They're talent has always been rad. They can play, and they can sing with rad harmonization. That's hard to get in ska-punk music. For Less Than Jake, it's just breathing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Awesome!","review":"Less Than Jake's CD \\"Hello Rockview\\" is one of my favorite CDs in my collection! Even though some of their songs are a little... well, to say the least- weird, the majority of them have GREAT lyrics, and meanings which relate to me a lot, and ALL of the songs are great. Being a teenager, one of my favorite songs is \\"All My Friends Are Metalheads\\" but all the others are great too! I think it's awesome that there's finally a good band out there that actually has REAL instruments in the band, but can still hold up their popularity! I LOVE LESS THAN JAKE! And if you're looking for some other good Ska-Punk CD's, Suicide Machines \\"Battle Hymns\\" is a great one, along with Rage Against The Machine \\"The Battle of Los Angelas\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"This is not the Less Than Jake I thought I knew. Sure some of the songs are melodic and the singing is still great, but it is too mainstream. It ALMOST sounds like Less Than Jake without the horns, but the guitars just suck. The ska is completly killed on this album. There are no ska riffs on the guitar, and only one little horn solo on the beginning of Nervous In the Alley, which isn't even fast. I guess if you like crap-rock, this is a must!PS If any of you have Losers,Kings... please email me.

The commentary for this and RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND were terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defense of Madacy DVD","review":"I'm not sure about the other DVDs in their catalog, but I was pretty happy with the Madacy transfer of THE SHOOTING. It's the first time I've found it letterboxed (although it looks like it might by 1:76 rather than 1:85, barely noticable by how closely cropped the credits are) but otherwise the color and picture is brighter and sharper than I've ever seen. There is some slight distortion from time to time (from what looks to be degeneration of a video master) but this is rather slight and probably only noticeable to those who are picky about such things. Sure, I'd love to see Criterion release this (along with Hellman's CHINA 9 LIBERTY 27) but for a bargain DVD the Madacy disc left me more than satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just waiting...","review":"... for this movie to be released by a real studio.

It arrived broken.

It was almost comical at how hard you try care about whatever it they are building here (not suspense) . . . and at how hard it tried to keep you on your toes and guessing. And then you feel let down so badly that it seemed like a waste of your time . . . and of a movie. However, I will say that I can't remember a movie that showed NY in this light . . . clean, upper class without the trashy side, etc. It was as if this wasn't set in NYC at all. I think we take the NYC of the 90s and today for granted. It wasn't always like this. And it is easy to forget how pretty Meryl Streep looked back in those slim days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still of the Night","review":"DVD skips and unable to see beginning scenes.

It is a bit flimsy, and, yes, the ball they provide does NOT fit through the net (the hoop, yes, the net, no). Nonetheless, if she loves it, we love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, ball doesn't fit through hoop?","review":"Apart from the fact that this comes with literally no instructions on how to hang the hoop (not that they're really needed) the major flaw is that the ball doesn't fit through the hoop! Now, I may not be a pro at basketball, but I'm pretty sure that's one of the basics. The whole ball going through the hoop part. Also, the net hangs down about 4 inches from the rim. More than anything, it's just bizarre. Not at all as pictured. We can use it with other balls, it's just plain confusing why they would include a ball that doesn't fit through the hoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very helpfull book","review":"I find this book very well written and very helpfull.

At first I thought it was a piece of junk because after a month or so, it kept shutting off and then wouldnt play anything. But I realized that you have to plug it into your computer every so often and do the MP3 update (if you click the right option, it wont erase all of your songs). If you do that, it functions perfectly! The sound is good too.It comes with a neat set of headphones that you can wear around your neck, and its light enough to just hang there.The downfall: I personally dont like the way it looks hanging around my neck (or chest/stomach actually, it dangles down pretty far), but the square design makes it to awkward to put in your pocket or even under your shirt. If you wear it out though, you will get attention...people will be pretty suprised that its an MP3 player. Overall, I really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best Two Weeks You'll Ever Have","review":"This mp3 gets 5 stars for innovation, feature quality and sound but when it comes to reliability and quality it gets a Zero. Over the past 3 months I've bought and returned four of the 1 gig cubes. Each cube lasted exactly 2 weeks before the flash drive froze-up, the cube unable to boot past the logo screen. The last mobiblu I bought went directly from its box to my counter where it charged and then sat unused, and untouched. After two weeks of isolation I noticed the cube had turned on by itself and the logo screen had fozen-up yet again. Spooky but true. I tried resetting the cube but to no avail, it wouldn't boot. I truly liked this player and wanted to give it a fair chance to redeem itself, hence the 4 rebuys. But for all the pampering I gave it the mobiblu just wasn't made for the long haul. Once you get past the unique cuteness factor it revels itself to be just a $130 piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT! NADA, ZIP, ZILCH!","review":"It's little. It's cute.

Somebody obviously heard Duck Rock and thought \\"I can do that!\\" Perhaps, but they didn't have Trevor Horn producing, did they? You'd be hard-pressed to listen to more than 2 of these songs in a row but the jaw-dropping \\"John Wayne Is Big Leggy\\" is the rare example of a song so bad, its good! Though I'd rather have a gun in my mouth than hear the extended version of that song ever again in my life, the short version is perversely compelling listening. Once heard, it will never be forgotten, I assure you. It just doesn't sound like anything a sane person would imagine existing. I'll admit, I own the 7\\" single of it. But considering someone having to listen to the previous 8 tracks before they are \\"rewarded\\" with that song is just a step above Guantanamo treatment.

No longer having my old collection of vinyl, I decided to take a chance on this CD. Disappointing. His style has obviously changed in the intervening years...and personally, I find this album unlistenable. I can only describe the contents as jazz-fusion muzak, fitting for a fancy sushi restaurant in downtown Tokyo.

Yesterday, today and probably tomorrow too. Yes, I know about Jimi and Stevie Ray, B.B. and Duane. I don't know, I've just never heard anything quite like Allan. Why isn't he better known? It seems like it's just other guitarists who know him and they're frustrated because they try to reproduce the same sounds and can't. I'm sure being regarded as a \\"jazz fusion\\" player doesn't help either. Maybe if we called it \\"instrumental rock\\", it would draw a bigger crowd? Probably not. Allan may be doomed to be revered by other musicians and guitarheads like me while the rest of the world gets it's fill of the teenaged sensation of the week or the flavor of the month rap star.

This band is the side project for Vader's drummer Doc and Mauser, Vader's guitar player, and sure enough, the album sounds a lot like the famous polish death metal band, both in sound and song writing. A few things help differentiate the two, the vocalist is a little more straight forward, the solos are a little more composed and less whammy dive bombing, overall many of the songs are more dominated by the phrygian dominant scale (think yngwie) and some of the riffs can be a bit more melodic, however, especially with Doc drumming, you can expect the fastest blasts in the business, so don't expect this to be a slow album by any means. Hell, Vader is a great band, under any name, and there's plenty of great songs on this album, so I'd say pick it up.

It is an inspiring book and a warning to stand and fight for what you know is truth. Among the first people executed by the Nazis in Poland were not the Jews but the teachers and the professors and the educated. The Nazis wanted to destroy a culture and their evil knew no bounds. This is a well written, knowledgeable book on the Polish Resistance from the very beginning of WWII and it causes one to wonder as one character asks, \\" how is it that some people are so courageous?\\". It inspires the reader to courage and vigilance. It continues to carry important messages to its reader today. Excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews instead - the book's not much longer","review":"Having looked forward to reading this book, I was rather disappointed. There's not much more to Spurling's brief story than what you'll gather from reading the editorial and/or customer reviews. In my opinion, it could all have been covered in her Matisse book, if not in a footnote, then in a two or three page appendix. If you continue to be curious, I'd recommend trying the public library before spending your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and disappointing","review":"The book doesn't take long to read, but I found it inadequate to tell what is an intriguing story. Its chronolgy leaves something to be desired, and I at least would have appreciated more footnotes, more explanation of the importance of the historical figures who are involved in the swindle, and a more documentary-like account. In my (1958) edition of the Encyclopedia American there is a one-paragraph account of The Humbert Swindle, but in my (1940) edition of the Brittanica I find no mention of the affair. Is this because it involved people who were Dreyfusards rather than anti-Dresfusards? I really think this swindle deserves a better book, tho I suppose Hilary Spurling will say that she has told us all she could find on it. But in view of the extensive press coverage I find that hard to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Short Fast Very Interesting Read","review":"The story of a lady living far beyond her traditional means but with the extraordinary capacity to persuade people to give her money.

Although the pattern of the decorative 'onyx' is attractive, the actual holding mechanism for your hair is not nearly sturdy enough or made well enough to warrant the price. I could not get all my hair into the barrette at the same time to create a nice, low pony tail. In a nutshell, to all out there with truly THICK hair, this barrette is not worth the money and good luck getting it to do what you want it to. As a side note, I also purchased an inexpensive Goody hair product along with this order. The Goody is certainly not as fancy as the France Luxe but it holds all my hair without any problems and it was less than $7."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was a bit smaller and not quite as sturdy of a clasp","review":"I purchased this because I was looking for a large barrette that would hold thick hair. I had purchased less expensive barrettes in beauty supply stores, but the clasp was usually glued to an \\"anchor\\" which was then glued to the decorative piece. Because my hair is so thick, I would usually break the barrettes in the struggle of getting all of my hair in it. The clasp of this barrette appeared to be connected to the decorative piece (rather than an \\"anchor\\"), so, I thought it would work better. At $30, I expected the clasp to be of higher quality than the less expensive barrettes. It was not. The clasp on this $30 barrette was exactly the same, poor quality as those on my $5 barrettes.

She conquers many things, such as her parent's divorce, her brothers decline from genius to FoodStar Employee, her best friend's unplanned pregnancy and her mother's untimely death. But, surprise surprise, she comes through it with flying colors and attains everything she had wanted with just a few setbacks. So if you are looking for a nice quaint book, check into this one.

If only the writing had been better, there would've been something to hang on to, but it basically blew as well. Very disappointed.

The short story format within the novel was interesting, and at least progressed in a linear fashion, and Ms. Hoffman definitely writes beautiful, lyric prose. However, the characters just were amazingly depressing, especially because you could see how impaired they were but no one did anything to reach out and help. It's really hard to care about the characters who do nothing to help themselves, or each other... How can a young man accepted at Harvard turn into a grocery clerk cum drug addict in this day and age without anyone at least attempting some type of intervention? Why is it okay for Jill's husband to passionately kiss our heroine while we are reading that the marriage is working pretty well? This book is about wasted lives, and their is little redemption for anyone. Is that the point?

While the stories connected and showed the life of Gretel who grows up throughout the book, I just didn't feel that there was enough development of the entire story or the characters.The story is about conquering life..the will to live despite the hard circumstances that exist and I wanted to know more about what motivated the characters, especially Gretel's brother Jason. I realize that with this sort of writing formula you must infer a lot of what goes on but I just needed more depth to the characters.I preferred Here on Earth to this one. I will seek out more novels by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"familiar","review":"Hoffman writes so well, so wonderfully, you can't help but read page after page, being swept along by her marvelous craft, by her magical realism. In that sense I wasn't disappointed in this slim novel that actually reads as a collection of short stories revolving around the central characters.But much of this is ground that Hoffman has covered elsewhere. I've already read about the amazing flowers in Practical Magic. I've read about the dangerously seductive boyfriends. And I had trouble with the age of the main character. It seemed awfully fluid from chapter to chapter.Despite all that, this is still a good Hoffman read. It might not have moved me as much as her previous books nor necessarily covered new territory but it was entertaining and highly readable all the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoffman keeps putting brillant books on the table!","review":"I have read Practical Magic, Here on Earth and Property Of, but by far this one captures the essence of an emerging and growing youth beyond what even we can describe it to be for ourselves!

Maybe it was because there were other, better books awaiting me, but the book just wasn't very great. There were a few good, even captivating parts. but, mostly it was full of sections that were much too short (although they felt very long) and did not fully describe the atmosphere of the place where the main character lives.

How I was closeteed, not because I wanted to be, but becuase I had no one to tell. Bars were gone, victim to women's need to pair up and domesticate, soon to fall vicitm to the \\"gay virus.\\" The Internet did not yet exist. I knew *of* Lesbian Pulp Novels, becuase I was capable of doing research, I read so many books looking for myself among them. But I was not there. I am not Lon, or Violet or John or Mary. Now, I look back at these novels and realize I was never in them, but I'm gld to have read them...and glad to let young women know they exist.

If you are looking for something natural and not plastic maybe you can figure out a way to keep these together. The wood is the only positive thing I can think of about them, although I believe they are made of pine which seems weird because we are not supposed to use pine or cedar bedding for our rats so why pine homes? I know a rat breeder who loves these and that's why I got them, but I was not happy with them at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chin Hut Hideout","review":"The pieces of this hut do not stay together. I would not purchase it again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not adequate","review":"Bought these for my two adult chins. The male is tiny, but he was somewhat cramped in it and only used this until I added a fleece house - now he only uses this for a platform. It's also not heavy or stable enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. Additionally, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually I had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.The female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it. She too abandoned it, and I didn't even give her an alternate nest box.I know the price is attractive, but now I have two houses that I'm going to pull out and replace with more substantial, large boxes. I definitely don't recommend this house type at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"My Apollo is a little bit bigger than many chinchillas, but I would still say that this hut is pretty small for a chin to sleep in. I also have concerns about the safety of this product, but my chin hasn't really chewed on it. He enjoys sitting on it and somehow squeezing in through the door. I typically use it as a place to put his hay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent buy","review":"Thank goodness I only have one chinchilla. This hide-out is much too small to fit more than one chinchilla unless they're babies. My chin loves to chew on it. It's barely staying together at this point (only 1 month after I bought it) because my chin chewed down the support sections. I would recommend a larger hut if you house more than one chin. For the price, this hut isn't too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable","review":"The Flamenco touch to jazz piano pioneered? delightfully by Chano Dominguez (and aside I'm a fan of the great Spanish pianist Tete Montoliu for decades), combined with the lyrical playing of Paquito makes this a slightly unusual and very classy DVD. The music is superb, the musicians (percussion included) are first class, the audio and video production is excellent (not to talk of the elegant theatrical background of the stage). You do feel that you've gone out for the evening! Paquito may be in his twilight years but his mellowness does not negate in anyway his exuberance, and the laid back enjoyment of this DVD. Really one to play again and again. Full marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Lord, no more please...","review":"LFO...This band suck like no other. Drab tune.

It is about one person and it is not an \`I' book, meaning it is not written in first person. Rufus M. is special because he has many odd friends including a cardboard boy, a soldier named Al and a flying horse named Jimmy. Only Al is real (meaning alive). Rufus M. is part of the Moffat family. I have read about the Moffat family previously in another book called The Moffat Museum. In this book, they have already moved from their original little yellow house to Cranberry. Rufus M. tried to be a ventriloquist and a wizard. I think it is very funny when he tried to perform a knife trick by using a rubber knife to plunge into himself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rufus M.","review":"I liked \\"Rufus M.\\" a lot it was probably the most adventurous books I have ever read. In a way that Eleanor Estes compares this book to her \\"The Moffats\\" book you can tell that Rufus Moffat is a completely different 7-year-old boy you would've thought he would be compared to athis book all about him and \\"The Moffats\\" which introduces our lively and fascinating family to begin with. I thought this book really made me so buried into it's pages because of the way the writer took the time to create more and more adventurous tale for Rufus to live through and be a part of. It really made this book something special. But I'd have to say his adventures would take you through some times that you would just not believe! One thing for sure, you would say his characteristics drive him into the pit of emotions and feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great after all these years!!!","review":"My earliest recollections of reading are when I got my first library card in grade school many, many, did I say many?, years ago. The books that stand out as my first are The Moffat series by Eleanor Estes. To this day I can remember reading about the Moffat family, especially young Rufus. Perhaps I identified with him. I love the drawings in the book and the stories. They are full of family fun and values. I just bought these for my new step-children (getting married Mar 30/10) for them to get the enjoyment that I remember. An excellent value and free shipping if you purchase all 4. I actually received one free because I purchased 4. Worked for me. Enjoy!!!

For the true beautiful agony and despair of his talent search for the Stress record tapes. In particular, \\"The What of Whom\\" tape/album will make your heart implode. These tapes are usually just Johnston playing piano or guitar, raw and uncontained by a band. Do yourself a favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard listen rewards big time","review":"Daniel Johnston is a hero to anyone who had all these ideas but couldn't put it out in a nifty format for the every person to swallow easily.

Of the countless editions available, this is one may be the best quality edition out there, which shouldn't be surprising since they cribbed it from Bob Furmanek's laserdic restoration. And thanks to some crafty digital editing, the copyright notice during the opening credits has been excised.

It also contains a few profound thoughts--namely the four disciplines:1) Build and Maintain a Cohesive Leadership Team2) Create Organizational Clarity3) Over-Communicate Organization Clarity4) Reinforce Organizational Clarity Through Human Systems.The fable does a great job illustrating the meaning and application of these four disciplines. Unfortunately it stops at that. There is no appendix referencing facts, studies or collaborative evidence proving that these four obsessions really work as illustrated. (Other research based material I've read does back it up) Not including a \\"hardcore\\" chapter in this volume definitely lowers the quality of the book. But, overall I still found it an excellent book, well worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"High impact read","review":"This book is a very quick read that still manages to hit you between the eyes with a one-two punch of horror (oh my gosh, we do that all the time!) and hope. I don't know how he does it, but Mr. Lencioni has a knack for storytelling that makes it look he's been bugging your hallways, staff meetings and off-sites.The good news is that he articulates a straight forward (and not touchy-feely) prescription for a better-functioning organization. Like other great business books, the points seem obvious only in retrospect... few companies, I submit, actually engage in these key practices and waste a lot of time because of their failure to do so.The day after reading it, I went through it again, writing a (long) list of actions that we're now taking in order to become a healthy -- as opposed to merely smart -- organization. If we had adopted it earlier, I think we would have blown away our goals, improved our retention, and kept everyone a lot happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story! Sound management advice. What's next?","review":"This book was a pleasure to read! The four management disciplines are so basic, and so often missed in many companies. The story is easy and enjoyable to read and helps illustrate exactly how each of the four points can be implemented. It is a more enjoyable read than most dry business books and not as \\"cheesy\\" as others."},{"rating":"2","title":"But How Do You Get Your CEO To Read It ?","review":"Well written, enjoyable with a real message. Just about everyone I know has done Myers-Briggs or some form of self-analysis and not one of them has an understanding of anyone else's profile within their immediate work team. If the only good thing to come out of this book was cross sharing to help internal communication that would be enough but Leoncioni gives lots more. The character of Jamie is a bit scary and perhaps the reader is meant to identify with him (in part) in the early stages of the book and then drift away later. In a nutshell, my problem is that any form of cultural change starts from the very top of the tree and your CEO will need to both read the book and commit to actually applying it and not just give lip service to a great concept.Maybe a Christmas gift idea for the man who runs the company ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"This author's style of writing makes the subject matter easy to understand.

Where the book falls down is in the contrived story that two leaders take to illustrate the concepts. The story is somewhat believable except for the consistent good leader bad leader contrast. The story creates a situation where a potential candidate happens to meet the good leader at the bad leaders office during an interview.The book has some good concepts, the author just needs to find another vehicle to communicate the message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ralph is the WORST","review":"My son got this along with the other three for his birthday that is all he asked for he is a huge ninja turtle fan.

Now whether his lyrics lack the mastery to achieve such a title -well, there's more to him. If musically he lacks the mastery to achieve such a title, well there's more to him. His gift lies in the marriage between those two aspects - and through that, you get a glimpse into an intuitive and radiant soul. If you own any album by this enigma of an artist, you will see \\"Arise Therefore\\" as a departure from his usual approach. This is his most complete work. It should not be individually broken down by song. The highlights are unmistakeably moving. The low points are completely heartwrenching...I wish I had been there at the \\"All tomorrow's Parties\\" festival where he played this album out beginning to end.

I certainly didn't have any problems with Joey or Kathie Molland sharing their knowledge of the band's history, although it is funny to see Kathie speaking as if SHE had signed the bad contract with their new record deal--Suddenly she's a member of Badfinger (A little too close, I know).

I liked that there's no voice-over narrative telling you the story of the band. Instead, the story is told through interviews with the surviving members (Joey Molland, Mike Gibbins) and a few select others.

It offers a rare chance to see Badfinger performing all of their hit songs, and tells the story of their rise to fame and tragic demise at the hands of the unscrupulous record industry. Interviews with surviving members Joey Molland and Mike Gibbons are interesting, although a bit too plentiful. On the downside, Pete Ham and Tommy Evans were the main contributors to the band, and it would have been nice to see some interview footage of them. Joey Molland seems to want to rewrite the band's history to increase his importance, and his wife's comments served no purpose at all and should have been left on the editing room floor.

Anyone above that is going to be bored as the routines are nothing new (knee lift repeaters, anyone?). While I normally like Kathy, in this workout she's very annoying--lots of whoops and screams. She seems almost crazily cheerful, in a very off putting way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I enjoy Kathy Smith's aerobic workouts, however this one was a big disappointment.1. It's titled \\"ageless\\" which to me indicated older individuals would benefit. I'm over 60 and exercise regularly. Kathy's Baby Boomer workout and Cardio-fit workout are favorites; but, this one is VERY HARD ON KNEES!2. The aerobics interspersed with weights is too truncated; you get neither a good aerobic or weight-training workout.One positive were the balance exercises--but that was only one, short segment.I don't like giving bad reviews, but for $14.99 I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work out","review":"I have not been very motivated to workout. I needed something that was going to be quick and be able to work out my entire body. It is not very difficult and you can choose from three different twenty-minute workouts. It is geared towards those over 40, but anyone can use the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"I've done Kathy Smith's workouts for years, and this one doesn't disappoint. I like the three different workouts - each at 20 minutes. Shorter workouts make exercising less daunting, and I find once I get going, I usually want to do more anyway. I like the variety in the three segments - gives you a lot for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"The first time I did this all the way through I was exhausted. It is a good workout but not as intense as Jillian Michael's dvds.It takes a few times through to be able to follow along. It isn't a difficult dvd but the vocal directions could be better. It would be nice if she said, switch to the right leg instead of 'other side' because by the time you get to the other side you aren't always sure which side you did.One part of the dvd stalls and then picks up again.You can't just go from one workout to the other without pausing the dvd. You need to stop to take off your shoes, gather a chair and weights when you turn it back on be ready to star immediately.This was furnished by the publisher for review. That did not affect how I feel about the dvd. I would buy it. Her voice is not irritating and once I figured out to 'be ready' it's a good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Avid Exerciser","review":"I am in my late 20's and work out five days a week I enjoy getting my heart rate going quickly as I do not have a lot of free time to exercise. Short and efficient workouts are my preference. I like to add variety to my exercise regimen, so this seemed like a good one as it included three different segments. However, I had a hard time feeling like I got a true workout using this video. I also did not enjoy Kathy Smith as the instructor. She was hard for me to watch and feel motivated to work out hard.The three different segments include:Total Circuit which is supposed to be the cardio,Total Balance which is aimed to be the strength portion, andTotal Energy which is mostly a yoga sectionEach segment is about 20 mins long which is a great length, however it just did not feel like enough of a challenge. I would label it has a beginner workout, with the potential to be almost an intermediate."},{"rating":"1","title":"HMMM think twice before you buy","review":"This is suppose to be a greatest hits cd and you get too many live tracks which are not all that great. Twisted Sister were a great band and its upsets me to see that so many songs were left out off the cd. Were Not Gonna Take It and Shot Em Down are great songs and if they were to missed from the cd I would have written to the record Label myself. Only for die hard fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good collection","review":"Twisted Sister what else is there to say ? Half of the songs are done in studio and the other half are done live. Great live sound. Some bands don't have that. Greatest Hits CD's like this one are okay but some songs that aren't included in these collections you might prefer to listen so, so overall I generally don't buy best of CD's. But TS is a great band. I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG ones","review":"As a great Twisted Sister fan I'd say the album is good as anything the band has produced, but the thing is that many superb songs are not included here. There are some tracks like \\"Be Chrool to Your Scuel\\" that could well be replaced by \\"Wake Up the Sleeping Giant\\" or \\"Come Out and Play\\" for example. Still, there are fantastic pieces and one that I really like (maybe cause it's not included in other TS albums) is \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\"! Rock on! Twisted Sister forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way (but still a twisted fan)","review":"Two stars, count them 2. It's not even worth that much,I'm being generous.Too many live cuts,if you want live music then buy a live album.What I wanted was a greatest hits cd and I didn't get one.I can think of better songs that could have been put on this disk.Two stars... one for each good song on this so called \\"GREATEST HITS\\" cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff. Great band. Ahhh, the 80's......","review":"I guess TS is a guilty pleasure. I've been around metal since about 1980 so I was there when they broke it big. Therefore I like the older stuff on this disc a lot more than the newer stuff. Recommended are: 'We're Not Gonna Take It', 'I Wanna Rock', 'You Can't Stop Rock and Roll', 'Shoot 'em Down' and especially 'Under The Blade'. TS was never a \\"total\\" metal band, not like Venom or Mercyful Fate or even Sabbath or Priest, they just happened to be rockin' at the right place and right time. But when they got fully wound up they could blast it out \\"fast and loud\\" with the best of them. There's a few missing cuts on this disc; like 'SMF', a few stinkers, and the live stuff is not really eye-opening. But this is a good buy for those who need a dose of a heavy metal, New York City, in-your-friggin'-face attitude. Crack a cold beer, hop in the car and crank it high! Unless you're a corpse you're gonna be groovin'. And that, after all, is the whole idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT!!!!!","review":"Two decent songs doesn't qualify for a greatest hits cd, does it???

I won't comment on that because NO ONE expects there to be any reasonably-believable story or plot, and so you won't be disappointed there.This is NOT so bad that it has any \\"cult movie\\" potential, so all it is is a total waste of life's precious time.

If not a return of the series (would Bruce Greenwood even do it? his star is now on the rise), then how about a one-shot theatrical film? It could be a compressed version of the series, with the \\"secret revelation\\" (i.e., the season-ending cliffhanger) as the denouement. Well, a guy can dream, can't he?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST TV shows ever!!!","review":"Unfortunately Nowhere Man, one of the best shows ever on TV, was cancelled secondary to network politics and not the quality of the show.

I highly suggest that you check this series out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, but beware!","review":"NowhereMan was a fantastic show!

Beware before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sets a precedent like no other - my own #1 fav!","review":"Nowhere Man was so far ahead of its time, it makes me wonder how today's mystery thriller shows would have turned out without it. It struck to the heart of our fears of identity theft, paranoia about government conspiracy and mystery in a way that no other show could have, and long before anyone had even thought about it. It catapulted Bruce Greenwood to the top of my favourite actor list, at the very least!!! I am so thrilled it's coming out on DVD at last, a worthwhile one to own and show everyone who hasn't seen it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nowhere Man is brilliant","review":"Compulsive viewing. Be prepared to watch all the episodes at once as you will be dying to find out who the enemy is. Bruce Greenwood is excellent and manages to gain your empathy throughout the series.

If you love conspiracy theories this is the show for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoning","review":"With a show of this age why not release it un-zoned. I am a huge fan and it has not been released anywhere else, I can't play this at home. I am against down-loading and ripping off those who earnt there money but, it seems it would be forced upon us.

It's great that so many old, cancelled classics are finally coming to DVD, but what about STRANGE LUCK?Strange Luck was, in my humble opinion, an even better show than Nowhere Man, but no one has released the complete series of Strange Luck on DVD.Thanks for giving me Nowhere Man, but give me Strange Luck already!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't watch it then, and I didn't watch much now","review":"a journalist takes a photo of soldiers illegally executing civilians.

Behrens was in great voice in 1980 and perfectly captures the conflicting emotions of Isolde. Her Liebestod is one of the most emotional on disc (and I have about 7 Tristans so far...), the voice in gleaming form, quite effortless on high. Hofmann strains some in Act III, but who doesn't? His voice has a nice ring to it and he is definitely \\"into\\" the character of Tristan - an impressive performance overall. Yvonne Minton is an effective Brangane, if slightly light-voiced for the role. The live recording is from a concert reading, so the early digital sound is excellent with virtually no audience or stage noise. Bernstein's measured, agonized interpretation is the real star here though, with the opera's final chords sounding as no one else ever has, a timeless coming together, the four notes seeming to somehow play themselves... Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Indulgent and under-cast","review":"This really can't be a first choice for the opera. In fact, it's one of the worst. Bernstein is so indulgent such that he misses almost everything the music has in offer. Hofmann is past his best as Tristan and Behrens comes to grief often as Isolde. Both simply has not the vocal means to tackle the title roles. A grave disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most complete greatest hits collection by the Byrds","review":"The Byrds have always been one of the most popular American Bands of the 60's.They have covered several songs by Bob Dylan and others.

For many Christians, The Simpsons were declared off limits by the end of the first season.

There are not many real or new insights made in this book, about half of this book is episode summaries and much of the other half is filled with only the most obvious insights and other peoples' original ideas. I was very disappointed. I was not surprised to read at the end of the book that the author had not even seen all the episodes.Particualarly terrible was the chapter on the Catholic Church. He seem obsessed with the overhyped \\"controversy\\" between the show and a small Catholic watchdog group while avoiding any real discussion on how the show offers poignant insight on the relationship between the Church and other Christian denominations as well society in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Being a fan of The Simpsons, I was excited to read this book. The purpose of the book is to examine the spiritual aspect of the show.The book starts out interestingly enough, by evaluating some of the characters and their spirituality. However, toward the end of the book, the author seems to spend most of the chapters giving the story line of several episodes without actually analyzing or thoroughly evaluating the spiritual side of the show.The worst part of the book was the concluding chapter. It seemed to be just a bunch on quotes from other people with no real point.Whether you enjoy or hate The Simpsons television series, this is one book you can skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those that need validation","review":"This book is for those Christians that have secretly watched the Simpsons but were to afraid to admit it during Sunday service. It is a decent book, but points out the EXTREME obvious. The author claims most people who watch The Simpsons, even longtime fans, do not understand the meaning behind the actions. I think its plainly obvious to those with a brain.If you need a respected Christian to say something is OK before you partake in it, then this book is for you. If this book is capable of opening your mind then GOD BLESS THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Simpsons are NOT spiritual","review":"Anyone thinking that the The Simpsons are spiritual are not watching closely. Some things that Homer has said:\\"I wish God was alive to see this\\", \\"I bet Jesus is spinning is His grave\\", and something to the effect that \\"I proved that God does not exsist\\", to which Ned Flanders agreed with.

Sad, actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Way to Look at a Great Show","review":"Entertaining, educational and funny, the main flaw in this book is its brevity. I found myself wanting more.Pinsky offers insights into a show I've always enjoyed and gives me a new way to appreciate it. It also proves to be a good counterargument to so-called \\"family values\\" people who denigrate the show because they either don't watch it or don't understand.

The best of Monteilh is yet to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older woman younger man","review":"May December was a very interesting and enlighting story ofof an older woman and a yonger man relationship. It also dealt with a no win or going no were relationship.I appauld Mariah for ending the relationship with Kadeem she had gone on to long with it.I enjoyed the story but I felt that Malik was much to young for Mariah.I know older woman and younger men romances are on the rise but the age difference was just a bit to much for me to be comfortable with.I can understand 3 to 5years without a problem.Malik was more closer to Mariah daughter age and she his closer to his father's age.This story also felt real, perhaps maybe like a story about the author?Just a guess for a story so well written that was belivable .I would recommend it to other readers ."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little boy loves his football","review":"I bought this for my boy on his first birthday.

Amazon was having a half-off special on these though, so since I had a few other pairs of Allen Edmonds, and they all came in at the same size after careful fittings, I decided to go with the order in \\"my size\\".They arrived the other day and I wore them to work the next day.

And in between one gets information on anthrax as well. Reading this book raises the hairs on the back of your neck: it is so easy to make a supervirus and it was so stupid not to destroy the remaining stocks of virus when they were kept in refrigerators in only 2 laboratories (one is the USA and 1 in the USSR) in the seventies. An extremely important story told in a roller coaster fashion that grabs you and does not let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great, but decent","review":"Demon in the Freezer is an interesting book about the history of smallpox and other ills of mankind. It does a good job of describing current biocontainment technology and other designs for biological weapons and the history of the U.S. - U.S.S.R. conflict that brought some of these weapons into being. Demon in the Freezer does fall a bit short in having a lot of characters (I began to lose track of them) and also tries unsuccessfully to be a \\"doomsday\\" kind of book. I finished reading this pleased with the amount that I had learned about smallpox, biocontainment, etc., but don't especially worry more about a smallpox epidemic than before. Demon in the Freezer paints of picture of a smallpox outbreak being so random and uncontrollable it is like worrying about being hit by an asteroid. There would be nothing that you could do so why worry? Other than that flaw, Demon in the Freezer is a good interesting factual book and I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful!","review":"I was so excited to find this book after reading Richard Preston's other novel, The Hot Zone. I found this book to be written extremely inconsistently. While reading this book it seems as though Preston is changing from writing to a mature, educated audience to writing for an audience of five year-olds. He takes the time out to describe each new character in a bland way. His descriptions of these people consist solely of their hair and eye colors, stature, and way of speaking. WE DON'T CARE! I wish he had spent more time on the actual story instead of digressing. He also added random sections including one accusing Iraq of harboring weapons grade smallpox without proof. I was thoroughly disappointed in this novel! The only reason why I finished it was because I was too far into it to stop when I realized how much I truly hated it! If you liked The Hot Zone, don't read this, it's awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought, paid for and sold out hack","review":"If this book is anything like \\"Hot Zone\\" discard it immediately! This guy claims to write non-fiction....right, and I'm Will Shakespeare. Don't believe the hype about small pox, it is not true, search for the answers yourself, you'll see. Do you want to take your chances with a very dangerous vaccine? Is that the only recourse? No, of course not! But don't expect sell outs like Preston to tell you, he's bank rolled by the pharmaceutical giants who will cash in big if we indulge in our fears. Ask yourself always, \\"who benefits\\"? Who can make a lot of money off of this hyped up scare (Pfizer,Merck et. al.) and who can gain a considerable amount of power when we give up freedom for \\"security\\" (government). These tactics are old hat (read Machiavelli for starters). Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of the world may be a virus, not a bomb","review":"Smallpox -- another piece of the highly complex 21st century puzzle that must be understood and put into place. In this highly readable account, Preston explains that smallpox is a particularly deadly killer that HAS NOT been eradicated, HAS been experimented with as a biowarfare agent, and MAY HAVE GREATER POTENTIAL TO WIPE OUT MANKIND than any atom-based bomb yet invented. This book is a highly palatable and enjoyable way to get the facts along with several surprises on the topic that will keep you thinking after you have turned the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary.","review":"Just like in \\"the hot zone\\", Richard Preston creates a fascinating narration that mixes anthrax, smallpox, terrorism and the end of the word as we know it.He raises interesting points, such as saying that without virus we would be overwhelmed by insects, and the narration of how smallpox was eradicated from nature but kept frozen by governments and individuals for various reasons is surprising.Eradicators wanted variola destroyed for good, researchers and military want to keep it. There was even a discussion on whether it would be ethical for mankind to willingly make a virus extinct, even if that virus is a mindless killer.Engrossing read. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallpox, Big Issue","review":"Few writers have the talent to parlay a non-fiction work about viruses into a mass-market paperback, but Richard Preston has done it twice. \\"The Demon in the Freezer\\" focuses on many scary aspects of smallpox, and delights in the details of our demise should we encounter our old foe. For us today, reading about the skin completely separating from the body due to a halo of pus is both repulsive and fascinating; but the world once had an everyday vocabulary for these symptoms. With little natural immunity left around the globe and the smallpox shot the most dangerous immunization you can take, \\"The Demon in the Freezer\\" points to a nasty vulnerability.Preston talks with Ken Alibek, mastermind of the Russian bio-warfare program, and author of another excellent work \\"Biohazard.\\" Also covered in detail are the anthrax attacks and the investigation of scientist Steven Hatfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Fiction","review":"Scary stuff! I loved the detail, the politics and the overall story. I couldn't put it down. You will pay attention to those little CDC outbreak sidelines just a bit closer once you have finished this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a novel","review":"This is an excellent, though frightening, account of the history and future of the smallpox virus. It reads like a bio-terror novel, but is all the more frightening because it is non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demon in the Freezer is a great book","review":"A friend told me about this book, and I read it and ranked it 9 out of 10 (10 being a perfect book). I ranked it so high because the character descriptions by the author, Richard Preston, are great, and because the subject matter is fascinating and of great importance. There is some information pertinent to the Iraq War in the book. Demon, although about anthrax and smallpox, is as good as any recent novel I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another MUST READ from this author!","review":"This book is a bold statement about the state of our world. Smallpox and anthrax are the new weapons of choice for anyone who wants to infect large populations around the world.It's a great book and everyone should read it just to know what's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"This book was recommended to me by a fellow scientist. Normally I wouldn't go for this kind of reading but in this case I did, and I didn't regret it.If you're interested in virology, mixed in with a little biochemistry and some thriller scenes, then this book is for you. No boring science here...The time line in the book is a little bit jumpy, location wise the same thing. But once you get the hang of it, this book reads so smoothly.The science mentioned in the book is sound and the information mentioned well researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoyed \\"the hot zone\\" this is the book for you!","review":"Richard Preston has done it again! The demon in the freezer is a fantastic account of the small pox virus. I could not put the book down, and finished it in days.This book gives the reader an in depth account on smallpox, and the ramifications of this virus on humanity.I recommend it to anyone interested in hot viruses, or anyone who wants to prepare itself for what may lie ahead for mankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Read","review":"I'm a bit of a science nerd, so of course a bit biased, but I would have to say that this is a book that I loved and read multiple times. Written with vivid descriptions and done in a way that even those who aren't spending all their time in a microbiology lab will understand easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demon...","review":"Another good read by Richard Preston. It follows a similar story line as the rest of his books but he makes sure to change each book enough to keep you very interested in his writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I decided to read this book because I read The Hot Zone. This book definitely does not disappoint.

The style is wholly unique and interesting and while you can hear distant influences, they have not wasted a split second in developing their own identity. They are as heavy as they come when they want to be but they can be quirky and catchy alongside in the same song. They leave nothing behind and let their amazing songwriting speak volumes for how excellent rock music can be with their subtleties that overpower the senses. A true rock band, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"If you were to ask me what the best QOTSA cd was, I would have to say it would be their debut.

We love it.Note though that 17\\" is BIG for a skillet. We have a gas cooktop with a grate across the entire top -- and that is what is needed for this product to be used on a home range. It takes two burners to heat up. We also have an outdoor burner (we use a disco/wok, but it's also the burner used to deep fry turkeys) that works well with this skillet.What do you need a 17\\" skillet for? Anything that takes some good black iron to \\"stir fry\\" with lots of room. And, it looks really cool too.Recommend as an addition to anyone who already loves black iron!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Skillet with Minor Flaws","review":"Excellent skillet that cames seasoned out of the box with good directions on initial cleaning, use, and maintenance.

I am planning on using it for paella this week. So far, all the results have been excellent. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the skillet arrived with several small pits on the cooking service, which surprised me a little as I've never had that problem with Lodge products in the past. So far, though, they haven't seemed to affect performance or made the skillet more difficult to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was awful!","review":"I picked this up at the airport on my way to Denver thinking it would be an interesting read about my favorite city in the world but it was probably one of the worst books I have ever read!Incredibly repetitive, very mysoginistic (sp?) and a clumsy read in both English and Spanish. I thought maybe this was a bad translation but I read part of the original and it was actually worse.It got to the point where I was expecting to read the same paragraph about \\"Venice sinking into the sea and becoming a graveyard for ghosts\\" or some inane comment about a woman's meaty thighs rubbing together under a too tight skirt or the protagonist violating his celibacy as they seemed to appear at least once in each chapter.If you're looking for a book set in Venice, skip this one and read Acqua Alta (I don't remember the author) which was wonderful and much better written.I would have given this no stars but it wasn't an option and I feel that 1 star was being very kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, AWESOME, FANTASTIC SONG","review":"this song is absolutely addicting!

I'm not ready to try that one either.Like so many things we buy these days, I can only hope it does what it says it will. Maybe I should visit the junk yard and try it out on something there.

It is exactly what I felt I wanted in the line of safety products in my car. I agree with all of the other sellers the mounting system is nonexistant. I purchased the sticky back velcro and mounted it on the side of the console so that it would be easily accessible by both driver and passenger. However, due to the design on the back of the case it does no sit firmly, or flush even against the velcro. If you need to remove the hammer you take the case and all in your hand. But that is okay, it will or cannot fall off as long as the velcro is used but its just not rock solid mounting as we might want. I would strongly urge everyone to use the velcro system rather than trying to tether it by a string or something. I am confident that I will access it easily should I ever need to.

I got him the Combat viewers companion book to go with it (found on ebay) along with an autographed picture of 5 of the stars of combat (also from ebay). I personally don't like army shows or movies, but my husband said this is a great portrail of actual events of the war.

After the first 3 songs, it picks up to the big band and jazz sound of the 30's and 40's, which makes up well over half of the CD. It will become one of those family classics.

The mounts arrived as advertised in a timely manner from Amazon. Installation was easy into both the speaker and the room wall--I used a stud finder to ensure a solid connection. Solidly built, they maintain the designated alignment--very pleased overall. Would recommend to friends/family/clients.

They are big heavy speakers, so that's impressive.My only gripe is that, as mentioned in other reviews, the swivel motion is somewhat limited and does not allow a ton of motion. This was a non-issue in my case, since I was mounting in the corner and aiming them in towards the room. I had no issues getting them aimed exactly where I wanted them.I am purchasing two additional mounts to mount my other two S-2 surrounds in another room for music.

My speakers weigh less, and yet the mounts cannot hold up the speaker, so it droops against the wall rather than stands upright. On the plus side, the design is interesting, there is plenty of hardware to mount the speaker side of the bracket to the speaker, and the wall side of the mount is well made, simple and easy to mount. The problem is the weak link between the two sides (speaker side and wall side).I'd look for something else, but the best and cheapest solution would be a strong screw in the wall, and a hanger of some type mounted to the back of the speaker. That will easily hold 20 pounds close to the wall, and therefore, more upright."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"This DVD was not at all what I was expecting.

Second, the author states that the foundation of teamwork is trust. \\"Trust\\" is defined as being comfortable enough with your fellow team members to be vulnerable with them. The fictitious characters in the book begin to establish trust at an offsite when they reveal events from their childhoods.

Lencioni does a superb job at making tangible the sometimes-elusive art of management and leadership. Having a finance / accounting background and now working in general management I always find the \\"soft stuff\\" (HR, organizational development, management, leadership) is really the \\"hard stuff\\" (as opposed to finance, engineering, programming, etc.).Lencioni's success is based in the fact that he unequivocally understands, as he states, \\"The ultimate test of a great team is results\\".While many authors and management tacticians obfuscate the skill of management through complex theory and practices Lencioni brings clarity.Very similar to Jim Collin's \\"Good to Great\\", the beauty of this book can be summed up in its third to last line:\\"Success is not a matter of mastering subtle, sophisticated theory, but rather of embracing common sense with uncommon level of discipline and persistence.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for team leaders","review":"This book is very valuable to anyone who works on--or must build--teams.

I've found little to support these simplistic approaches, popular as they may be with people looking for a magic bullet. This book confirms my belief that building teams is hard work, done over a period of time, and is based on trust.

A quick read on the surface, there are some golden nuggets of ideas to help leaders rescue their teams from the morass of dysfuction:1. Absence of Trust.

Teams avoid conflict and are unwilling to discuss and resolve issues to produce the best possible solution in the shortest period of time.3. Lack of Commitment. Teams are unable to make clear and timely decisions and move forward with complete buy-in from every member of the team, even those who voted against the decision.4. Avoidance of Accountability. Unwillingness of team membes to call their peers on performance or behaviors that might hurt the team.5. Inattention to Results.

I found to really comprehend all the dynamics of a team, and apply it to your own - read it twice. The first time, I overlooked areas that I thought initially didn't apply to my own team.

What makes this book stand out is the identification of some simple core messages (note: simple, not easy).The most important single message in this book, for me, was the reminder that we each belong to a number of different teams simultaneously and that managers are first and foremost part of the management team. This can be a tough lesson for new managers who often need to make a transition from subject matter specialists to people managers with little effective preparation.This book does not provide the answers. What it does provide is a number of the issues that need to be considered, and a recognition that team building and people management are important tools.Highly recommended - both to experienced and new managers.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teamwork Personified in Fable Fashion","review":"Lively writing of a corporation plagued with dysfunction bigtime.

Unfortunately, this method does not allow for the necessary critical analysis. The major resource available to historians studying these events is a journal of the proceedings written by one of the judges in the case, and he wrote his journal for the explicit purpose of defending the proceedings against criticism. While Davis shows some skepticism in his handling of the sources, making the history into a narrative forced Davis to take his biased source a little too much at its word. Nonetheless, it is a fascinating subject and well worth exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 4","review":"Features the best post Jon Oliva (Vocal wise) tune ever in \\"Handful of Rain\\". Absolutely one of the most beautiful songs ever. The first track \\"Taunting Cobras\\" is really good as well. First 'tage cd without Criss Oliva. Alex Skolnick fits well, but Criss Olivas solos are missed a bit. They dont go for the theme oriented cd here, so its a bit looser with contrasting song structures. A bit too operatic at times (for my taste). Very clear vocals as well. Singer makes it easy to understand each word.As i have been a 'tage fan for a long time,I still like the older \\"Dungeons are Calling\\" type stuff better, but this is a very well produced, enjoyable listen. The singer adds well to the style. Solid 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Savatage album","review":"This was my first Savatage album. When I first heard it, it blew me away. I think this is a terrific album to get you into Savatage, but then you MUST go get ALL of the rest. especially Wake Of Magellan and Dead Winter Dead.For me the best song on here is Alone You Breathe. Wish I could say why. Next would definitely be Chance. At first glance, Chance was the best song I ever heard, the layered vocal harmonies simply blew me away. After listening to Dead Winter Dead and Wake Of Magellan, and hearing the vocal harmonies and those.. I realized that Chance was great, but the others were maybe even better.Overall, if you aren't listening to Savatage, yer a fool.

The speaker could be any relative of the victims. Where he is singing \\"You threw it all away. . . \\" I figured that could be the relative yelling at the terrorists.

Not much, other than the angry, creepy elf-face on the cover. If angry, creepy elf-faces are your thing, then this is probably the CD for you.

A high water mark for JJ, although Perverse (1993) and Already (1997) had many good moments as well and are worth checking out if you like JJ's sound. People often cite the strange name but it's taken from the first Alien movie, where Ripley gets startled by her cat, named Jones. Doesn't have any religious implications that I know of, although it is a nice play on words, implying a state of fixation on his teachings, perhaps. I'm pretty sure the band name clue was slipped into their 1989 album Liquidizer where they included a sample of Ripley swearing, \\"Jesus, Jones!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workout CD!","review":"I absolutely love this CD for working out ...

Each track is without titles for a reason, Jaco is jamming and he never really displays more than a glimmer that lies within his vast repetior. He glides anywhere from Bach to Hendrix to his very own Continuum and Portrait of Tracy without any hesitation. Also, something that I thought was exciting was his use of the newfangled loop track. He constructs these bizarre and intriguing loops to solo and groove over that are almost dreamlike. In 1986, he had all of the freedom in the world and it's truly evident on this hard to find classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as great can be.","review":"I am a Jaco fan big time. I have almost all his stuff. What can I say that people don't already know? Jaco has true emotions of ALL kinds in his music -violence to love and beyond.

The detailed descriptions of both Norway and the Plains area of the western United States are intriguing.

When I realized Knight's Castle was the only book I had access to that I hadn't read, I went to get it and it was gone! I guess someone borrowed the book and lost it! I felt all was lost when, lo and behold, I found it at my new school's library! I was overjoyed! Although I have to admit Knight's Castle wasn't as good as Half Magic, Eager's best-known book, this one's probably my second-favorite book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story; awful writing","review":"It is incredible that this ever got published.

Chapters blend personal case histories with theory to examine how racism affects all aspects of American law and culture, and draws some intriguing conclusion from Arab-American conflicts.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"rating":"2","title":"anti-Arab racism is political not cultural factor","review":"It is easy to say that racism is political matter rather than cultural one, but it is difficult to prove this statement or to have empirical evidence one it. This book argues that racism is rooted in the United States as a concept of political hegemony. The author examines the anti-Arab rhetoric in American politics and American media and how that effects politics as an outcome of neoliberal hegemony. And how such demonizing groups, and created other enemy will legitimize war against other such as the war on terrorism.Great book to read, easy and straightforward. It is also a good text-book for undergraduate students in the field of sociology, culture, international politics and journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Handel wannabe?","review":"I recall a trip to Key West to see the home of Hemingway.

It's Georg Friedrich Handel...in the late 20th century. Sometimes it even drifts into Telemann... or a bit-o-Bach. It sure as hell isn't original.What does composition in this era bring to music? To the art and the Philosphy of music? Sure it sounds ok... but it is imitative. I'd far rather have bet on something John Adams just hatched...or something asian.

Food seems to taste better and washup is so much easier than Pyrex. Washes easily by hand or in the dishwasher.

But as a Sicilian, and as a professional editor for 5 years, I have to say that I wouldn't look to this book for any definitive answer to anything.There are typos everywhere you look, not to mention layout and formatting issues. Was an editor or proofreader -- or ANYONE -- ever employed to read this before it went to press? I'd be mortified as the author to see a book of mine published with such a disregard for content and style -- particularly since it's an educational book, and a language book to boot.You may get some benefit from this book, simply because I have never seen another book on Sicilian out there, but that's where my recommendation stops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the traveler","review":"This book is an excellent overview of the Sicilian language/dialect, but it is NOT designed as a \\"traveler's guide\\" to the language. The lessons are set up in an \\"immersion approach\\", providing the Sicilian dialog and THEN following with an English translation; so, it is a little hard to get started. But, once begun, the progress flows quickly and an elemental grasp of the language soon follows. It is not full of \\"traveler phrases\\", but the understanding the reader gains from study of the book should provide ample capability regardless of their original intent."},{"rating":"1","title":"???","review":"I can't say definitely because I am just a student, but this book wont get you far, it is full of Italianism (which may be current in Sicily, but so is Standard Italian) or maybe I began with an archaic dialect and that makes such impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best \\"Self-Help\\" Book Ever!","review":"When you've had enough and you're really ready to make a change for the better in your life; this is the book to help you do it!

There is not a single verse in the Bible that says the Rapture will be before the Tribulation. In fact Jesus told us the very opposite (read Matthew 24:29-31 very carefully). Revelation 20:4,5 tells us that the saints martyred in the Tribulation will be in the First Resurrection. The First Resurrection is the RAPTURE! The Rapture is obviously after the Tribulation!

As they are finding their groove, some of the skits are slow but the focus of what would develop is there. I loved seeing Andy Kaufman's early work. The movies of Albert Brooks are kinda tough to watch as they are a little long and self serving, but he became one of my favorite film makers after he got through that era. The music is stellar, what a mix of artists. Getting to watch this again reminded me how much fun we would have meeting over at a friend's house to watch this great show enhanced with a few bowls of choice herbs and excellent snacks as we laughed ourselves silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative and Stimulating","review":"In watching the first year I am reminded why Saturday Night Live was so much fun to watch. The musical guests actually performed live, the comedians did stand up and the political satires were funny without being overdone. If you enjoy SNL and were not there when the show first broke new ground, you owe it to yourself to pick up the first season. If you were there you will enjoy going back again. The first season is just as good 30 years later as it was in 1975 when it debuted. Do you remember Jim Henson's Muppets on SNL? How about the Bees?

We're introduced to Chevy Chase's falling down, Barbara Wawa, the Samurai, the bees, etc. and that's all great, but most of it is odd and experimental; like they don't have the timing and the style quite down yet. I'm waiting for Season 2 or 3. Also, the transfer is less than perfect. There is a slight amount of what looks like artifacting or repeated frames. Not recommended unless you are interested in the early development of the show rather than the classic, familiar work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The depths of 1975","review":"If you want to remember--or learn about--how utterly rotten 1975 was, exhibit A is the first season of Saturday Night Live. The comedy is not up to the high school level; one after another of the sketches falls completely flat. And there should be a contest about who was the worst host. Rob Reiner was pathetic. Lily Tomlin was excruciatingly bad. And as for Louise Lasser.....Then there was the bad music. And the garrish clothes. And the stiflingly uniform political correctness (even before the term was invented), made to seem oh-so-daring. (It takes a lot of courage and smarts to make fun of Gerald Ford.) In short, drugs help make these programs funnier than they were. Which is surely one of the problems haunting the performers and the writers who concocted some of the lamest excuses for comedy to be seen anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore me","review":"This 1st season is real boring. Mostly music, and the live music bands will send shivers up your spine. (not from delight). Most of it is repeated sketches from the last show and I did fast forward a lot. It was not funny, maybe one part was with the killer shark knocking at the door, but that's about it. It's lame, I wouldn't waste my bucks on it. I only give it a 1 star, I pushed the wrong star."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT - The Complete First Season","review":"This is false advertising. This DVD set is missing many pieces.

Not a coincidence that the W Hotel put \\"Love is All Around\\" on one edition of their in-house CDs a few years ago, which was how I learned about Adriana Evans. Do agree with other reviewers that she has been unjustly overlooked. Anyway, at some point I had thought that this CD marked the end of her career, but she just released a new CD in August 2004, which you can obtain straight from her web site, http://www.adrianaevans.com/ I just ordered my copy and am eagerly anticipating it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The goriest, nauseating, most disgusting and bloodiest movie of all time!","review":"I caught this on TV at 9:00 PM last night-I thought it was interesting-yet, I found it stomach turnign!

What a difficult road one must travel without the love and guidance from ones parents. The stories shared by Mr. Besker ranged from humorous to very sad. I found it hard to put the book down because I wanted to know what life would hand this young man next. Through hard work and a very obvious determination he found success.

It's that kind of book and no more. Your mind can wander and pick up the thread in no time. Talese is an interesting, shrewd, charming, moderately wise and becomingly modest man in his early seventies. I doubt that Nan Talese--his tough-minded editorial wife--approved the needless repetitions and the loose organization. Yet the reader comes to appreciate how Talese was able to approach and ultimately master the more disciplined works of his earlier years about the New York Times, where he once was a reporter, or the Mafia. Anyone considering free-lance journalism as a profession should read this book. Talese is no genius, but he has proven over time that he has what it takes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy elsewhere for much less","review":"Google around; I got mine for <1/3 of this price at eTrailer - looked here first because I have A-Prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bloom\\" maintains its quality from start to end","review":"Billy Pilgrim's \\"Bloom\\" makes my 'short list' of albums I can pop in and let run without need to skip past poor tracks.

I can't compare the sound to any bigger-name artists because this album's sound is far simpler than most but still has a unique quality.

I continued to use it, hoping it would get better or I would catch on to some secret trick.

Dennnis' voice has never sounded better. People have complained about him changing this and that about the songs. Who cares, that's what its all about, your idea on someone else's song. And what he does is fantastic. Someone to Watch Over Me, Memory, On The Street Where You Live, Bring Him Home, and It's in Every One of Us, are some of the greatest songs I've ever heard.

The best songs are the ones not actually on the album - go to YouTube and search for \\"Tell Me On a Sunday\\" and \\"Pinball Wizard\\". Much better selections.

You will love this thrilling achievement. Now, about Dennis coming out. Huh? He's married and his daughter is his publicist. I could care less if he is gay or sad for that matter, but where did this piece of news come from? I've never heard Dennis breathe a syllable on this subject. Someone needs to spank amazon for including it in the reviews anyway; it has nothing to do with the music. And, to repeat, the music is truly exceptional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"I have purchased these in the past at a local retailer, so I assumed that these would be of the same quality.

The cases that are reviewed do not go in to much detail about how the insect evidence was actually analyzed but seems to diverge into how everyone else contributed to the cases. It was a lot of moralizing and not much content. After reading Dead Reckoning, which does deliver some content this book is a true disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book by it's cover...","review":"The title seemed promising enough. And sure, the beginning was a bit slow...forensic books can be that way sometimes, since there's a lot of technical information to convey. But, Dr. Zak's pompous biography never became even mildly interesting. The language was impossibly thick and the Sherlock Holmes references grew tiresome very quickly. Furthermore, Dr. Zak outlined cases in brief and cryptic passages, faling to inform (I believe I only learned the names of ten or so insects, unlike M. Lee Goff's book, where I found myself bombarded with fascinating information). Dr. Zak is highly subjective, melodramatic and conceited - even outlining cases in which he had absolutely no involvement - and seems like a petty novel compared to M. Lee Goff's \\"A Fly For the Prosecution\\".My advice? If you're truly interested in the field, read \\"A Fly...\\" and leave \\"Maggots\\" to those who seek boredom, not information."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reference work","review":"When I started out in TESL, I found Ellis' seemingly endless accounts of inconclusive studies somewhat discouraging with regard to the integrity of the discipline. Years later, though, it's still the first book I turn to for information on landmark research or researchers in this emerging field. I'd highly recommend it for those interested in research in SLA but for few others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careless editing","review":"This book contains errors in simple editing that caused frustration when reading the assigned chapters. The authors seem more concerned with gaining citation credit than with providing a clear and concise textbook for a Graduate level university class. I would not recommend this book as a text nor would I recommend it for anything other than providing a cursory overview of theories of second language acquisition. Explanations are unclear, the authors verbose, and it provided nothing more than an essay in texbook production for profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Day's Read","review":"Aside from the obvious inaccuracies (such as Stu Suttcliffe and John starting the Quarrymen and Stu introducing Paul to John), this book is a hurried and poorly told story of the Beatles. The premise that Paul died in a automobile accident and his twin brother Billy (separated at birth in the Biltz)may have been an interesting plot line, however the story is told so rushed and fragmented that the reader either wants to put the book down or just skip to the end. In fact, the writing style in the book could truly be called helter skelter. There are plenty of decent books about the Beatles without enduring this disaster. Carry that weight wasn't worth the price or the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to prepare for Christmas","review":"This was truly a great way to stay spiritually connected to the real reason for Christmas.

It is one of my favorites. It just goes to show life doesn't designate happy endings all the time, and how horses can sometimes grieve over the loss of their owner so much they are driven to die themselves.

This book is exquisitely fascinating and absolutely beautiful; it's BREATHTAKING and will leave you completely speechless. From an informative history of black beauty and fashion and how it has been perceived throughout the years by the media to wonderful images of black icons like Mohammed Ali, Wesley Snipes, Lauryn Hill and Josephine Baker. It features not only the prominent faces of today but the icons of yesteryear who were our fore fathers and mothers in the shaping of what black beauty is today. This is a must have for every coffee table in every proud household; a must have for any lover of photography and the beauty of fashion and media icons. To say that this book is captivating is a complete understatement. Every time I look through the pages of this beautiful book, I'm proud and grateful that finally, the world is coming to see that WE ARE A BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Beauty? I Don't Think So!!!!","review":"I bought this book and was severely disappointed. The author seems to take shots at African American's that don't fit his version of \\"ethnic appropriateness\\". Particularly, he takes really harsh shots at Diana Ross, The Supremes, Donna Summer and anyone else who has had the courage to just be themselves and shine without paying attention to his particular point of view of how we (African Americans) should look, act or behave. I found it to be a total waste of money, and definitely does not represent all of \\"Black Beauty\\", just his tainted point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Beauty","review":"Black Beauty is one of my favorites coffee table books.

Very disapointing!Dave Thomas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Really Irritating","review":"I have never 'read' this author before and my initiation was via an audio book downloaded from my local library service. All I can say is that I am glad I did not pay for the experience. I lasted a total of 9 minutes before the 'he said' 'she said' drove me up the wall. I dare say the writer has never pretended to be a literary giant and perhaps the style of writing is kinder in print but for the listening public it is a kind of 'first reader' retro purgatory. I have read a few of the other reviews and am satisfied that I made the right choice in pipping this one not so much at the post but in the trainers stable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesse Stone in Paradise","review":"This is the last book I will ever purchase by Mr. Parker, after a lifetime of buying his hardcovers. The reason? His ridiculous and unreal mooning over a really unlikeable, unbelievable ex-wife which serves only to detract from the real character of Jesse Stone.We like to think of Jesse Stone as a solver of problems: he is doing just that now in Paradise, MA...it is unreal to believe that, five books later he has come no further than the juvenile pining portrayed by Mr. Parker in this book. It seems to be getting worse, rather than better which only serves to make us feel Jesse is going backwards....and we do not want to believe that for a moment.Hopefully, Mr. Parker will find a really good shrink and clear his head of this unproductive mess. Then, we can concentrate and the terrific plot and story lines he brings us and not be sidetracked by the dumbdown of an unbelievable side story. Too many pages on too little reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Parker spends way too much time on the ridiculous relationship between Stone and Jenn, and nowhere near enough time on what's supposed to be the actual plot of the book--the murder. Is this a Danielle Steele romance or a murder mystery? It's hard to tell, and the Jenn subplot is ludicrous. And I'm just so sick of Parker's \\"grown up\\" ways the characters all seem to be so willing to just accept everyone's faults. And why Stone couldn't have just arrested the guy at the end is beyond me. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Laborious task to Read","review":"In this novel, High Profile, I thought that Mr. Parker had lost his abilities to create a decent story. In the past I considered him an excellent writer and read many of his books, but this novel was such a laborious task for me to finish that I couldn't believe I was reading a story by Mr. Parker.The plot itself was loose, but interesting enough to maintain my interest, but I kept waiting for the story to pull me into it, however that never happened. The characters were weak and not fully developed, although I found Sunny to be an interesting character. I'm glad the novel was given to me my neighbor. If you are a real Parker fan I would guess that you would enjoy this novel, however I was disappointed in it and I expected more from Mr. Parker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good","review":"I have read a lot Robert B Parker novels and enjoy both the Jesse Stone and Spenser novels. I especially like reading them because they are an easy read and the characters on the whole are quite likeable. However, High Profile gives too much space to the ex (Jenn) who does not appear to have much in the way of personality. It is preferable (for me) where her presence is limited to telephone calls and leaves the way open to more interesting, likeable people. All in all it seemed a bit flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack","review":"Thirty-five years ago Mr. Parker started a series about a guy who thought and and acted differently, and the books were fresh and clever. The thing about the books was the way the charaters thought about things, and that was expressed through dialog. By now, we all know very well how RBP's chraacters think, so there's really nothing new to say, unless we start having the characters say things that no person on earth would say. If you can sit through this without wishing that most of the protagonists would be stabbed or beaten, God bless you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile & Boring","review":"This is my first and last Robert Parker novel. I found the writing very juvenile, the storyline dull and unfocused and the character development very thin. There are much better authors to spend your time and money on.

Very flimsy characters, except the wise cracking, Scotch drinking Stone,and just left me glad that I can now go to another book. Please, Mr. Parker, give us a bit more the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loser of a book","review":"What a disappointment. I have long enjoyed the Spenser books, as well as the spin-offs, although I don't fully understand why the characters all have to interact.This book is a stinker. (Blue Screen too, though a little less so.) It is not possible to sympathize with alcoholic Jesse Stone as he remains obsessed with his abusive wife Jenn. Jenn is horribly narcissistic and manipulative--I venture to say that the character is not realistic in the least--at least I hope not. So we lose interest in Jesse as he worries about his wife who sleeps with whoever comes along, and apparently we are supposed to care about these characters. I don't think so.Meanwhile, Sunny is hung up on her ex (not to mention her dog), and we have long put up with Spenser and his ups and downs with his inamorata Susan.Perhaps Robert Parker should deal with his relationship issues outside his writing and return to amusing plots without the masochism.--A disappointed reader"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just love ole Jesse!","review":"Another adventure in Paradise!

I'm a big Parker fan, both of his Spenser series and his Westerns.I read a few early Jesse Stone books and wasn't too impressed, but whnn I saw this at a discount store,I thought I'd give it a try.Not worth it. A salient feature of most good books is that you like or least can empathize with the character. Some character, anyway. But Jesse Stone is just a sucker, a total dope who is admittedly a decent cop. The minimalist dialogue seems draggy because you really don't like Stone the sucker much. Feel sorry for him, yes. Like him, no. Or anyone else in this slow and stupid book. OK, maybe Sonny Randall's dog. But that's not enough.A poor book. Even at a discount.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped after 4 chapters","review":"This might be a good book but I'll never know. I stopped reading/listening after four chapters because every single sentence of dialogue ended with \\"she/he said.\\" Even when the sentence was a question. He could have broken it up with he/she inquired, stated, asked, wondered, etc. Where was the editor?

Now, I've read quite a few of Parker's other offerings because they usually are quick reads and don't take much concentration to keep on point. But LISTENING to this book was painful. All the dialogue is finished or started with \\"he said\\" or \\"she said.\\" I don't think I realized it when READING his work, mainly because the eye will skip over those things easily. When I was LISTENING to this, it was like nails scraping on a blackboard. It was so completely annoying that I just couldn't get into the story at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Profiling","review":"This is really good novel with a suspenseful plot. It starts out with the murder of Walton Weeks who's body is hung by a tree. and a murder of a another individual. With a long list of suspects as long as your arm. Then Jesse Stone's wife is raped.

Is Susan the only positive woman that he can have in his books. Well, Sunny Randall is a stronger character, as well.I was really disappointed with this book and very glad that my father in law shared it--it was checked out from the library.I miss the old RBP--with the better, witty writing.

This is the last of Jesse Stone books I'll read. I am sick of his obsession with his ex-wife and failure to move on from his drinking issues and the inability to select a better woman from the plethora of beautiful, intelligent, loving women he comes across. Also, it really detracts from listening to the audio book when every time someone speaks it's: he said, she said, Jesse said, Suit said... even when someone is asking a question.

In fact much of the pipe manufacturing information in the book appears to be where Hacker got much of the info in his book The Ultimate Pipe Book. The little 1954 book is a great one and a quick read, will teach you thing you didn't know, and I would recommend it for those interested in pipe smoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing...a waste of time","review":"Reading the book was like being forced to live in the minds of two definitive losers...one more boring and insecure than the last.In the end, it depressed me so much, I couldn't even get through the last 100 pages. That's right, I read about 250 pages of this self-indulgent nonsense without discovering so much as one character arc...flat, uninspired drivel.Don't be swayed by the premise...If I had read the reviews, I wouldn't have wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writer, but reading this book was like torture","review":"This book was so depressing and the main characters were so frustrating (one is an egomaniac, the other becomes a self-destructive idiot). With both of the main characters headed for disaster, I could barely bring myself to read a chapter or two a week, and often wondered if I should even bother finishing the book. If I had read the reviews here, I would have known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Doubleday forgotten what a novel is? A Story?","review":"This novel resembles the scribbled journal entries of a famed novelist with a good book under her belt, in search of a plot for the next, ironically, exactly what the book is. The only difference is Margret, the would be novelist, is an undiscovered wanna-be with little talent, delusions of grandure and an annoying facility of expressing banality. The first clue not to buy the book might have been the back cover, which praises only Schwarz's Drowning Ruth, but if one orders on-line, one is never offered such an opportunity to save themselves $. This book proves that Doubleday is so emersed in their authors and New York, that they forgot why the public is interested in buying a novel--to read a story, not a process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"I loved Drowning Ruth and was very excited to read this book; however, I was horribly disappointed. The main character is pretentious and boring. The first 300 pages were a struggle to get through, uneventful and dragged on. The only thing this book was good for was to make me feel good about the measly credit card debt I have racked up."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHEER BOREDOM!","review":"I was convinced that I couldn't go wrong with a second Christina Schwarz book since I enjoyed \\"Drowning Ruth\\" so much. How wrong I was! What could Schwarz have been thinking of to crank out this astonishingly boring tale made up of endless letters from Letty to her best friend? Two-thirds of the way through the book, I just lost all interest and began to skim; then stopped reading altogether. What a waste of time!I'm glad I read \\"Drowning Ruth\\" first; otherwise, I would never have read it, and that would have been a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Followed me everyhere","review":"Into the tub, in the car. I found the characters compelling and the themes disturbingly familiar. If you've ever once compared yourself to others at cocktail parties, wondering how you measure up, you'll enjoy this read. The novel addresses the the worm of envy and competiveness that lives within us all. I was surprised to see some many critical reviews because I was hooked to this book like an I.V. The first two hundred pages addresses the struggles of someone trying to be a writer and if you don't identify with that process I suppose you'd become bored, but I was fascinated. I relished every page and was sorry to see it end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations, terrific disappointment","review":"When I saw Christina Schwarz's second novel displayed inside the door of a local bookstore, I snatched it up, assuming (you know what they say about ASSUMING) that I was in for another great read on the order of *Drowning Ruth.* No such luck. Protagonist Margaret Snyder's foibles fail to make her sympathetic, but succeed in irritating (and boring) the reader--at least this one. Nor was I able to accept the premise that Margaret's friend Letty--wife, mother of four, and purportedly a heretofore responsible and conscious adult--would suddenly lapse into complete financial idiocy. I'll continue to read Schwarz, because *Drowning Ruth* demonstrates a great storytelling talent. As for *All Is Vanity*--well, as an old friend used to say, \\"Everyone's got to swallow a squid once in a while.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"wickedly witty","review":"The dialogue is witty, the characters are engaging, and the premise is important--How many of us DO get caught up in the giant race to have more more more more bigger bigger better? Perhaps that is why some had such a negative to such excellent writing, because it hit too close to home? The rhythm and tempo of the writing was lyrical, especially when speaking in Lettie's voice. Watching her perspective change through the span of the book is enlightening. Very clever book with beautifil dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"All is Vanity","review":"This is the first book I read by Christina Schwarz and it will probably be my last. I thought it started out great but then went downhill to a very disturbing ending. Normally I can't put a book down and am disappointed to finish it but not in this case. It took me several weeks to make myself finish it and now that I have I wished I hadn't. Christina Scwarz is a great writer and I would have enjoyed a much lighter piece of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning in Vanity","review":"As Margaret, our narrator, ruins several lives in her efforts to get her novel published, it becomes quite clear that All is Vanity would never have earned publication without the success of Drowning Ruth. While Ruth is suspenseful, I had difficulty even getting through Vanity. The characters are annoying and nearly impossible to empathize with, and become more and more despicable with each passing page. Wholly unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth and exciting","review":"This novel is WONDERFUL. It's very well-written. I couldn't put it down. The way both Margaret and Letty descend into more and more trouble is very realistic. I was so frightened by Letty's final actions that I was afraid the cops were coming for ME. The way in which Margaret's character is revealed is smooth, layered and very recognizable. The reader never gets to know Letty's character as well as he gets to know Margaret's, but then Margaret herself doesn't care about Letty's character as much as her actions. This is a smooth, exciting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"the actual story doesn't begin until about halfway through. the first half of this novel is a never-ending description of the main character's writer's block. three examples would have done fine; 300 is excruciatingly dull. there is nothing likable about the main character and the story she steals from her friend's emails isn't much more compelling. ho-hum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sly and clever novel","review":"This very funny and extremely well-written novel tells the story of two women who just can't get anything--marriage, motherhood, or their chosen careers--to work out right. Christina Schwarz has a great eye for detail, and her observations are consistently sharp and fresh. Every single page of this novel is a delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugly, Horrifying, and Real","review":"If you've seen the movieThe Fighter, you owe it to yourself to see this documentary. Here, you will see the real story of Dickie and his crack addiction, the Ward/Eckhard family dynamics and what is happening in Lowell, Massachusetts. The Fighter may be based on this documentary, but if it isn't, this is definitely a companion piece to it. The footage is real, nothing is staged. It is raw, dissolute, frightening and horrifying. Nothing is made pretty. Crack addiction is ugly and the people addicted to crack lead ugly lives. What is most terrifying is that there are three things you can do once addicted to crack: go straight, go to jail, or die. That's it. Three choices and nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I waited so long","review":"Heard some of this in a friend's collection and realized I did not own this masterpiece.

Mic g is a very talented lyricist and while his lyrics are not always the best his flow is great and his words are the truth. the beats are dope although sometimes the cheese factor creeps in to the CD but this is forgivable actually most of the album works very well considering that almost all of it was done with a sequencer type device there are a few vinyl samples here and there but for the most part these are electronic sounds not like techno or anything like that but it still works. if you enjoy modern underground Hiphop with a few gangsta touches you will probaly enjoy this also check out Mic G THE NATURAL it is a better album than this 4 MICS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"Mic Geronimo did an excellent job with this album. Unfortunately, due to the lack of promotion and marketing, this album didn't sold very well. The best songs on the album are \\"Usual Suspects\\", \\"Unstoppable\\", and \\"Street Life\\". Overall, this is a true gem and it always seems that the truly talented get push aside while the untalented ones (Such as Nelly, Lloyd Banks, and Jermaine Dupri) get all the fame and fortune. In conclusion, if you love East Coast Rap, you need get a copy of this, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destiny - a super read!","review":"Destiny is a fun book. I found myself really looking forward to picking it up each night before bed. It's both reflective and adventurous, philosophical and practical. I particularly enjoyed the focus on surfing and the (sometimes poetical) proverbs distilled at the end of each chapter. Saying that, the book is relevant to business, relationships and many other life issues. I found the theme of \\"authenticity\\" quite inspiring too. Very glad I read it!!!(WARNING: It'll make you long for the waves)"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Destiny - the reflections of a surfing professor'","review":"A great read for everyone that likes sport / life in general and is looking for a deeper meaning behind it...I really liked the book and just couldn't put it down.

It keeps the fan favs, class clown Jeff & his friend Lucas, plus Cassie and Mandy. And, the Book Universe Michelle is as great as ever. Michelle writes for her 3rd grade class paper that the whole school will read. And, she investigates a \\"ghost\\" in this girl's supposedly haunted house. Bit spookier than most FH books, but still good for little kids, like the \\"Further Adventures\\" ones. (This may be the reason, to attract the mystery readers to \\"Full House.) Michelle's 1st person POV is a plus. We learn Cassie's afraid of lots of stuff, so kids who are afraid of more stuff won't feel alone. And, we learn the real \\"fhost\\" is actually...something you'll have to see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I think this CD is boring and all of the songs lack luster.

I wished that I had not purchased the CD(2) and I even sent it as a gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRITICO TO HAVE","review":"It is no mistake that this recording of Il Tritico was praised by Gramophone magazine. It nearly captured the award from best opera but was beated out by a few votes. This set captures the drama of Tabaro, the quiet tragedy of Suor Angelica and the humor of Gianni Schicchi. The singers are excellent and well-chosen. Mr. Papano backs everyone up with a superbly. I was fortunate enough to attend a performance of Il Tritico a few years ago, and these performances brought back remarkable experience that it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underperformed for a reason","review":"The principals do a fine job of performing their parts in this set which is underperformed perhaps because, aside from a few notably exceptional arias beautifully done by all of the artists in the casts, there is little of gripping musical merit in any of the three good stories. There are many good collections of performances available for much less expense, presenting these fine people singing really great arias without having to endure music and recititavo of little merit, questionably conducted, interspersed between the sparkling good stuff such as Gheorghiu's Babbino. Like all composers, not every note produced by Verdi is worth owning unless you are a true collector of Verdiana. I gave my copy away after two labored listenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Purchase used cd's","review":"I purchased this item used---BIG MISTAKE.

Their editors have amassed a chronicle of key inventions and discoveries, spanning the history of human civilisation. Some 400 inventions are explained. Albeit briefly, because of space considerations.The book tries to put these into a context of ever onward and upward. Though in the historical periods (especially antiquity), these inventions must have been repeatedly invented and forgotten.As an item of terminology - the \\"inventions\\" also include things which are arguably discoveries. Like the positron. It certainly existed in nature before physicists were aware of it. Though algebra might indeed be an invention, to some who would regard it as a pure construct of the mind.

Setup was a breeze, picture quality is great, and it's very user friendly!The only gripe I have is the Tv Guide feature. The guide actually worked right away. It worked like a charm for a good two months. It started to lose listings or only pick up partial listings and eventually it just stopped picking up the listings all together. I don't know if I can blame Panasonic for this issue as I have heard from a few people that it may be Comcast Cable. While it is defintely more convenient I don't mind using the manual feature to record programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Album","review":"Great voice, music that moves you.

Perhaps the most useful are the articles on providing learner support, but these are offset by some severely out-of-date technology issues. The technology recommendations are museum relics (enjoy screenshots from Windows 3.1), and the reality of technology in education is a bit different than is described here. To add to the irritation, you have to read pre-tech-bubble type articles in which the coming \\"information superhighway\\" will solve most of the problems in distance education. That sort of pollyannaism has proven to be a little overly-optimistic.

The U. S. wanted to put 2 men on the moon and after numerous tries and a few fatalities the U. S. Space Program succeeded. Apollo 11 was the first rocket to land on the moon. I found this book very exciting. I learned much about how the space program worked and what it took to get to the moon and back again safely. I encourage other young readers to read Moonwalk.

There are some really stand-out songs that showcase a ton of emotion in the singer's voice. The lyrics are excellent for the most part, and the music crosses the gambit from mind-blowing to mundane.

Even though the book is short and rather expensive, don't miss out on reading this. If only Mr. Brown had lived to hear our comments and know his writing was published.

He's relaxed, he's enjoying himself and that's what comes across on this \\"live\\" performance. In the absence of some stronger material, \\"In My Dreams\\" could have become his signature tune. This is a beautiful rendition of a classic song. \\"Hero\\" lacks the substance and backing of the version which he recorded with Phil Collins but it's still very good, as are \\"Till It Shines on You\\" and \\"Thousand Roads\\". \\"Cowboy Movie\\" stolen from \\"If Only I Could Remember My Name\\" is played with real feeling - it's almost a 10 minute track with Crosby's unmistakable vocals to the fore. After that he revives three of the first CS&N releases - \\"Long Time Gone\\", \\"Deja Vu\\" and what is I think one of his best, \\"Wooden Ships\\". If you like it live and you like it good then this is an excellent purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would've been better had it not come back to him at all","review":"The title of this CD should have been \\"David Crosby meets Big Mama Thornton\\".The \\"gruff\\" vocal techinque (for lack of a better term) that David Crosby employs in this recording completely ruins what could have been some fine live interpretations of some of his greatest music.For those of you who love the sweetness and subtlety of David Crosby's voice, you're not going to find it here. I was deeply disappointed upon listening to this recording.Crosby's work on his 1971 masterpiece \\"If I Could Only Remember My Name\\" will forever remain the pinnacle of his solo output, much like Ian McDonald & Michael Giles' \\"McDonald & Giles\\" and Chris Squire's \\"Fish Out Of Water\\".It is very difficult, if not impossible, to surpass perfection. And \\"If I Could Only Remember My Name\\" was exactly that - perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums","review":"Very simply, this is one of my favorite albums. Despite the 1-star review below complaining about Crosby's \\"gruffness\\", I feel his singing here is easily as good as it ever was; and that is perfection. The old tunes are different enough from the original recordings to be enjoyed all over again, and new track \\"Rusty and Blue\\" is great. Crosby is a unique pop artist, and there is an authenticity and intelligence about his work that I feel myself particularly drawn to, never more than here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Mancini","review":"Now this is the kind of Mancini I like.

She knows how to rock that guitar, and her lyrics are thoughtful and moving. There are a lot of songs on here that hit you (\\"Wooden Man\\", \\"Dimestore Life\\"), and they left me wishing for more.

My last throne was a pretty standard Tama throne and every day I sit on this throne I miss my old Tama. This throne spins for height adjustment, which at first you think isn't that bad but after time goes on you realize that it is more of a pain then what it is worth. To get it to the right height you have to sit over it and spin it like a retard. You're better off just buying something else...THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS IS:I was playing my drums one day and I leaned over to pick something up and the mounts underneath the seat that is connected to the hardware snapped like a twig. This was way beyond repair. I am by no means a small guy (230 lbs) but my old Tama throne took a beating 10X worse then this seat and never even flinched.

While Marianne Faithfull's autobiography is written almost as a novel, Bill writes as if just outlining the facts. All he talks about is how mean Mick and Keith were to him and how many women he slept with at the time (and bragging that that number was more than Mick and Keith combined). Poor Bill. Maybe if he had stood up for himself instead of sleeping with all those women, he might have gotten a say in the music once in a while! If you want riveting information about the Stones, read Marianne's book \\"Faithfull\\", if you want a cure for your insomnia, read \\"Stone Alone\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - TILL","review":"Like the other esteemed reviewer noted, \\"Stone Alone\\" ends with the debacle at Altamont (with the exception of a couple of pages' \\"memoirs\\" about the Stones' \\"comeback\\" 1989 tour.) Great anecdotes (sp?) about all the other Stones, too, but although I myself have ripped every single bass guiltar lick I have ever played off Bill, it ain't really interesting listening to him rant about how he'd 'made it' more than any of the other 4 Stones. Still, said it before and I'll say it again: The Stones SHOULD have stopped after Mick Taylor left, 12/13/74, but Bill's desertion was to the Stones what Elvis' death was/has been to Rock and Roll: THE END."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Stone Alone","review":"This is an account of the Stones, from each's day of birth to the death of Brian Jones.After a while it gets repetitive with all the places they played, all the girls he's been with and all his bank statements. Although it does give some inside info about the Stones such as the divisions inside the group there really isn't anything new a fan wouldn't already know. One thing I found interesting is why Ian Stewart was never included in pictures on covers. Other than that, a pretty uninteresting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent account of The Rolling Stones in the 60's","review":"I read this book for the second time last summer. Bill Wyman gives a true insiders view to the lifestyles, beliefs, and antics of the Stones from before they were a band , up to the devastating scenes at Altamont. His memory and detail are uncanny. He describes many events in such detail that you really almost feel like you were part of the whole stones circle. He also credits the stones success to the vision and talent of Brian Jones. His relationships with the other band members are also talked about, however, he pays perticular attention to Brian Jones and the blues roots, that the stones lived by in the early years. He describes in detail the many events that the stones went through during the 60's . If you want to know what the Stones were all about. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good - but dryly written, almost like a diary","review":"As other reviews stated, the book is very thorough and gives extremely good insight to the early stones. It especially describes the many contributions of Brian Jones which are not usually talked about or even known by many. The early history is quite fascinating. Although I do recommend the book I have a few problems with the book that greatly dimish its reading pleasure 1) It only covers from 1963 to 1969 (so we don't know what happened in the 70s and 80s) 2) Wyman constantly discusses the woman he has \\"had\\", this gets old pretty quickly 3) It is at times very dry reading, often it is just a bunch of facts listed in chronological order from his diary But overall this book is chuck-full of information that only an insider would know and can describe. This is really the basis that I recommend the book. I did read it quickly (in a few sittings) which is very rare for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant book about the Stones and the life in the 60s!","review":"This book is definitely the best book available about the Stones, and an indispensable source of information for the Rolling Stones fan. Wyman have collected memories and diaries from the very beginning of the 'Stones career, which finally, in the early nineties, got together in this wonderful book. It all begins at the moment when Bill was born in 1936, and it spans from his childhood all the way to the Hyde Park-concert given to the memory of Brian Jones, in 1969. It has a lot of details and interesting, deep, true stories about the 'Stones life and the sixties. Read about the club-gigs in the early years, the life on Edith Groove in London, the great tours in the mid-60's, the US-visits, the drug-busts in 1967, the truth about Brian, and much, much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor job","review":"Bill Wyman chose the wrong writer.

The two really bad things about this game are: (1), The computer players cheat A LOT! (2), A couple of the mini games are very bad for your controller, and can give you a burn in your palm, because they involve moving your controller around in circles (and you have to do it vigourosly or otherwise you'll lose).

The maps tend to be really simple, with very little variety between them.B. The rotating stick minigames. Oh my goodness.Some people would counter the first by pointing out that this is the first game in a series of 9 games, with one offshoot.And they'd be right.The second however, shows a bit of lack of foresight on nintendo's part, as the game clearly was a bit dangerous, as most player's common sense will often be overridden by the impulse to win, which resulted in a class action lawsuit which Nintendo ended up losing.This game is still awesome, even with the blisters you'll probably end up forming.

These are doty, sentimental poems that give no hint of the considerable talent she displayed later. There are some interesting images here, but nothing that readers wouldn't see from the average poet. I think Willard writes best when she does take-offs on other poets--then her talent springs into being.

I bought this book based on the title as we deal with a lot of behavior and learning issues and I home school him. I was expecting to get some advise and explainations for the problems we deal with but it's just a bunch of research and much of it is repeated from chapter to chapter. I'm very disappointed in this book as it deals very little with learning and behavior. It's just a compilation of many different research papers. I've read plenty of those. I regret buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little over my head","review":"I bought this book along with several others at the same time. I just glanced though this book.

The detail gets lost as the cookie bakes and spreads out (even though my recipe spreads very little) so a lot of extra work is required when decorating to put the detail back in. Still if you enjoy doing elaborate designs with writing icing (use thinned royal icing with a small tip and a tiny hole), then the larger and less detailed cutters in this pack might work well for you. Even though they were a lot of work and I couldn't use 2 of the cutters the end result was beautiful. I used white icing then dusted with light blue glitter flakes (made from sugar) and then piped on the detailed design. I then added sugar pearls at the points and 1 in the middle and they were stunning in the finished cookie tins that I give as gifts every christmas. To me this was too much work though and I won't use them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Sizes!","review":"I used these cookie cutters for my winter wonderland theme wedding...the size was perfect for my home made cookie favors :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, a \\"must buy\\" from Marian","review":"Let's see...

Accompanied by former Dave Brubeck drummer (and member of McPartland's famous Hickory House trio) Joe Morello and bassist par excellence Rufus Reid. In the company of these two old friends McPartland gives a relaxed and amiable performance that is much like the woman herself--forthright, pleasant, easy going yet energetic and sure.\\"All we can say is, WOW. Recorded in 2002, when Marian was 84, it has a thoroughly enjoyable and listenable quality yet still provokes musical thought.

Jennifer is certainly not a good singer on her debut album, and this music is so preteen 90210 (the third track \\"The Difference Between Us\\" is the only good one, and probably \\"Stand In The Way\\"; everything else, however, is just bad). Even Britney Spears threw her copy of this album in the trash when she heard it.

That \\"Let's Go Bang\\" cut screams remnants of Janet Jackson's \\"Rhythm Nation\\" for starters...the rest of that record, is not worth discussing because overall, the production has done her minimal justice if any at all.She's definitely a pretty good singer, but \\"Bless Her Heart\\" she really needed to fire her manager after that and employed some much better producers. And that ladies and gentlemen is My 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...it's Jennifer Love Hewitt...","review":"It's okay for what it is. Hewitt can carry a tune. Not the greatest singer to ever open her yapper, but far from the worst. The songs are mostly bland pop-filler, with lyrics that appear to have been 'researched' in a Hallmark greeting card aisle.

Merlin is a very patient cat and was posed and photographed by Mr. Weigal wearing a costume that illustrates the aspect of cat history or lore that is the subject of each essay.The costumes were hand-made for Merlin and many of them are very elaborate.

He criticizes modern far-fetched theories too much while many of his own theories are far-fetched themselves. Also, he makes assumptions, such as giving credit to Khufu as the builder of the Great Pyramid. This was proven wrong by Zecharia Sitchin in The Wars of Gods and Men. He gives credible issues a bad name. For example, he throws out the theory of ancient astronauts by only looking at the mistakes made by one researcher. If he would just open his mind and examine works such as those of Zecharia Sitchin, he may think differently. If you're interested in the other side of such issues as Noah's Ark and Atlantis, check out this book, but if you want something that doesn't just touch on the subject, find something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fireworks By George Plimpton","review":"I first read this book while sitting in the office of our fireworks shop in NJ.

Hell, he used to come down and shoot with us - he loves fireworks'. Unfortunately he had passed on before I read the book, it would have been interesting to shoot a show with him.

I do however have to comment on the Don Henley remake \\"Boys of Summer\\" That song .......! For one thing it was very slow and boring.

But this... it's just lacking of effort it seems. In my opinion he should've just dropped the idea of Drive and saved the interesting material on this CD to work into Let it Ripp. That really would've saved Let it Ripp, in my opinion (not to say it's a bad CD, but it had potential to be so much better). Cool in the Shade, Guitarland, and Drive are the only songs that really caught me, and those are all simply awesome songs. The rest to me just seems very lackluster and without much effort. He came out with two somewhat bland CDs less than one year apart when he could've just taken his time and made one great CD, but maybe I'm being overly critical.

Why not Russ Freeman? This CD showcases his solo efforts and you won't be disappointed! At least I wasn't. With or without the backing of his original group, Russ Freeman still has the goods! I know a lot of loyal followers will probably say, \\"This CD doesn't even come close to any of the Rippingtons recordings.\\" Hey, what can I say? Things change, and in this case, change has never sounded so sweet. Personally, I like this CD. Yes, it's a different sound than what I'm use to hearing, but I'm enjoying it! Electric or Acoustic, Russ can hold his own with the likes of Peter White, Norman Brown, Jeff Golub, Chuck Loeb, and Lee Ritenour and he proves it on this CD! If you don't believe me, just listen to a couple of samples. Got cash? Get the CD.:P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Listening","review":"I have to admit I like this album despite two obvious flaws - \\"Boys of Summer\\" and drum loops. Why include a remake of the Don Henley classic when the original was far superior and why all the drum loops, which are so boring and repetitive.

I am actually surprised that this song did not do better in the charts, because it is good pop with good energy and great chorus (the vocals are actually impressive when it comes to harmonies...)The two B-sides are not as good as the title track, very popish, but they are okay. The interview is also cool, but it would be good to know which of the girls are speaking, since we do not know who is who.It is sad that Girl Thing stopped after so little success, but with over 30 girl bands released that same year, they did not stand much of a chance...

Those who deem themselves more affluent should take note that they also have a lack, be it financial, social, spiritual or physical. When we examine our own lifestyle, we should find that there is enough in our life to share with others, making them no longer lesser individuals.Why do we not see more and more people bringing home those in need and mentoring them toward success?

Dunnery has created a masterpiece that he will probably never equal or at least surpass. This is at the same time soulfull, poetic, and edgy. A comparison with Dylan is appropriate, although I feel that Dunnery's music here is more approachable and perhaps more honest. He has an expressive voice and the songs are unusual and smart, without being over contrived. Most of them slide down into the brain effortlessly. His guitar playing is fine too. His \\"Father & Son\\" is actually better than Cat Stevens'. \\"Too Much Saturn\\" is one of my favorite songs ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beat is happening","review":"I own the box set, and would encourage everyone that is interested to make the investment.

Why does his action films (Bourne, etc) paint the CIA, FBI, Conservatives, and patriotic Americans as the enemies? The Iranians, North Koreans, Russian Rouges, Chinese Communists and other real enemies of America seem to be completely ignored in Damon's films. We, as Americans, are always the bad guys. Does anyone remember the news footage showing a caravan of more that 200 trucks leaving Iraq headed for Iran just before the US led invasion? I guess Matt Damon and Michael Moore believe those trucks contained flowers for Iranian people.

Well-written dialogue, talented actors, and a realistic depiction of the early mistakes in the aftermath of the Iraq War (not enough troops to provide security, failure to provide food and water to the population, etc.). However, the production should have done more research into the search for WMDs. If they had, this would have been a much different movie.Especially if this film had been made after the release of the Wikileak documents which give further evidence as to the existence of WMDs and provide documentation as to WMD caches which have never been reported before in the media.Sometimes timing is everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I had read reviews (pro and con) re this films political bent before watching the film. I knew the film had an anti-WMD tint, but didn't think twice about it -- until I watched the film. It was way over the top (politically) to the point where it detracted from the movie. I felt like this movie was directed by Michael Moorer and produced by Keith Obermann. I'm sensitive when films place our troops as mindless drones and the white house as greedy criminals and present it in a way to make us think that is all factual.

A few good chase scenes but that's about it. An ok rental, I wouldn't buy it though.

I understand that some people may not like this movie because it approaches the War on Terrorism from a more liberal agenda, but if you watch it with an understanding that is just an entertaining movie, you'll probably like the fast-paced, thrilling action and twisting plot surprises that fill the script through the very last scene.If you are looking for a gritty movie with a bite, give The Green Zone a try. You'll be fully engaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent iraq War movie","review":"I was a little unsure after reading these reviews if I should rent this movie.It totally exceeded my expectations as I found it thrilling, provocative and informative.I think a lot of the negative reviews come from people not wanting to get this movie as it reveals the underbelly of our industrial war complex and our unquenchable thirst for petroleum.Rent it if you want to be entertained on a more cerebral level.Don't rent it you're looking for the usual America tears 'em a new one story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% Political Propaganda","review":"What a disappointment!

The National Government may have thought there were chemical weapons, but so what; most militarized countries have some sort of chemical weapons. Saddam even used them in the Iraq Iran war and against the Kurds and we did nothing except help Iraq; so why was a war justified this time.The movie was enjoyable but it hit too hard on the non-existent WMD. There was even a hit on the Wall Street Journal for its reporting on the WMD situation before the war. Imagine that, news organizations not telling the truth about the government's story line.Like a lot of moves like this, they are so packed that the second or third viewing is better than the first.

I was only asleep for fifteen minutes or so and I woke up to see the ending and realized I could have stayed asleep. The very annoying shaky camera effects are back in play for this movie, and to me the plot for this movie wasn't all that interesting.

He looked like a mountain man wrestling with a bear.If the liberals want to make a point, do it without me wasting $4.99. I'm still waiting for Hollywood to make a movie out of that glorious Jimmy Carter rescue or Clinton's attack on a small place to divert attention from his affairs and possible impeachment. So glad I didn't buy this video (btw, the grainy texture was terrible).WMDs? Not finding does mean non-existent. I've never seen a polar bear with my own two eyes, but I'm sure they're there nonetheless. We took out a dictator, and now the people in Iraq have a say over their own lives.

Matt Damon, one of the most over-rated actors, whose range is A to B, prances about pretending to be a warrior.The film is racked full of liberal cliches and had they worked into it, some \\"proof\\" that Bush had planted bombs in the WTC to justify the war, I wouldn't have been shocked.This film will please those people who don't mind politics dressed up as a movie and by those who are hoping the last couple of year's progress in Iraq somehow unravels.It will be popular in places like Iran, Turkey, and other nations where pork isn't on the menu.Deservingly, the film flopped. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of action - full of crap","review":"I knew this movie had a liberal slant, but I was in a mood for an action movie. This movie had a lot of great action, but little else. It's only interesting if you believe the liberal tagline of a manufactured war. Although I'm a huge fan of the Bourne Trilogy (which is directed by the same man), I was really dissappointed by this propagandist piece of dung. I think it does a disservice to our troops who are fighting overseas. I would never see it again and I suggest you don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematography stinks. Too much moving around!!!","review":"I truly loved the first of the Bourne movies, but there was so much in movies #2 and #3 I wished I didn't waste the money. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but knowing the history of the Bourne movies I waited to see what others wrote. I am so glad that I did. As much as I like Matt Damon's movies I WILL NEVER SEE ANOTHER MOVIE WHERE THEY MOVE THE CAMERA AROUND LIKE THEY DID IN THIS MOVIE!!! For the record I didn't see this movie. I made that decision after seeing Bourne movie #3 and I'm glad I saved the money. I hope they fire the guy who thinks that shaking the camera equates into an action scene. They should shake him as much as he shakes the camera and see if he likes."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANTI-AMERICAN! LEFT WING BS!","review":"Don't waste your time. Another attack on our country and another attack on the Bush administration! If Iraq was about oil, where is it? You dopes are so hell bent on weapons of mass destruction which leading Democrats (Kennedy, Kerry and Clinton) said were there as well! Matt Damon is a left wing nut job moron who repulses me! What makes me laugh is that Biden is claiming Iraq to be the greatest achievement of the Obama administration???? Really? The guy who said the surge wouldn't work! ENOUGH ANTI-AMERICAN WAR MOVIES!!! WE ARE THE HEROES!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MOVIE.","review":"\\"Green Zone\\" has a point in mind - that the U.S. government made up evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to invade the country and impose an America-friendly democracy in the Middle East - and the perfect liberal, All-American actor to carry out the mission is Matt Damon.\\" Only the frist couple of minutes was mildly entertaining. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CRAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tense,exciting","review":"i had high hopes for this this political thriller directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Mattt Damon.i wasn't disappointed.there were some very tense and exciting moments and the film does get high marks for authenticity and realism.the hand held camera and the so called shakiness than people complain about doesn't bother me at all.that just adds to the realism as does the graininess in certain scenes.the chaos of war is also captured very well here too.as for the acting,Matt Damon was convincing,but not a standout Brendan Gleeson and Greg Kinear were both very good,but for me,Jason Isaacs and the under-appreciated Amy Ryan were brilliant.Ryan really impressed with her character,even though it wasn't a huge role.for me,Green Zone is a 4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising modern war movie.","review":"If you liked The Kingdom you will like this movie. Damon does a stellar job. Plenty of action and great story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motion Sickness Pills Required","review":"Bring your motion sickness pills. You've got the same dumb-ass jittery, gyrating camera techniques used in the Borne movies, numbers 2 & 3. Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!It's also a very overdone action film. Boring, and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONFUSING AT TIMES","review":"Confusing at times. I think the best character was the Iraqi driver and Matt Damon was pretty flat. I get the general idea of the movie and all but it needed to be edited more before release. MY GRADE: C minus to C."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Zone a loser for a usually winning team","review":"Green Zone is about the search for non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq after the fall of the Hussein regime. Director Greengrass and Damon make the pace as frenetic as it was in Bourne three. They succeed with the pace, but the story just isn't there. The best thing about Green Zone is that maybe Damon will realize he should have gone ahead with Bourne Four. I bought the Blu-Ray version with the digital copy. I like the idea of the digital copy so I can watch movies on my computer while other family members use the T-V set and/or its DVD player. This is not the worst film ever made, not even the worst Damon film, but it's not in his top ten either. Only for real Damon or Iraq war filmGreen Zonefans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memories of Bush","review":"Watching the movie made me realize why I disliked George Bush. Matt Damon is excellent andplays his role superbly. The movie is too dark to enjoy much and the memories of the Bush administration make things even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you dont want a headache, dont buy this...","review":"Paul Greengrass. I say no more. This guy should be locked up, put away, and throw the key away. He ruined, no, I say destroyed the Jason Bourne series by directing the second and third movie. What is with this guy, shaking the camera all over the place, until your head starts spinning around? I love Matt Damon, and think he is a great actor. Even the story plot for this movie was good, but the camera and photography, were an absolute shambles. Dont buy this movie. Borrow it from a friend instead, if you feel a need to get shook up and spun around. Better yet, go pay for a roller coaster ride instead. The director destroyed this movie, hands down, and after that, nothing else matters. I dont care how good that actors are, or how good the story line is, or the plot, but if you can't watch the movie with out feeling like you are sitting in an earthquake, nothing matters anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infomercial for a onesided political agenda","review":"Blatant mindless political diatribe wrapped in a weak story with paper thin charecters and phoned in by the actors"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting, too bad it's fiction presented as fact.","review":"What's next the real story of George Washington! I was in the military for 24 years and soldiers don't make policy. They follow orders. The movie was so silly. Maybe Mat Damon can find the truth about ozone, global warming and Al Gores women!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dramamine Anyone?","review":"What movie editor believes people enjoy film scenes [clips] that bounce around like this film does. If your prone to epileptic seizures and or easily get motion sickness, this film is not for you. Action movie I get, but could they not afford a tripod? I would gladly let them use mine.Uhhhgaag... uuuhaag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal balderdash","review":"Once again, Matt Damon is sucking on the teat of liberalism. The whole movie centers on Bush bashing vs. the faults of American intelligence. Sure did well in the theaters - not! Come on Matt - step out of your pampered millionaire lifestyle and see how real America lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggggghhhh...liberal, liberal, liberal \\"I hate George Bush so let's make a movie about how there were no WMD's\\" blah, blah, blah","review":"Don't waste your time with this liberal propaganda movie...unless, of course, you are in deed a liberal! If that is the case, I would highly recommend you watching this film and then throwing yourself into on-coming traffic. I had a feeling this movie was going to have a slant to it before I watched it...turns out I was correct! For the film itself, I found it hard to believe that Matt Damon (Chief Miller) could totally blow off direct orders (throughout the whole movie) from his superiors without any repercussions whatsoever ...and then be offered a job by the CIA, despite his unruly behavior during combat missions...just a bunch of Hollywood-anti-capitalist-lib-tards still mad about the Iraq war."},{"rating":"1","title":"If convolution were constipation...","review":"Just bought this through Amazon. It had Matt Damon and was made from his usual team of \\"thrils and chills\\" people. And, of course, we will always have people making political statements however incidiously they are presented, so...my copy of this exquisitely naive, and incredibly biased garbage was taken out of the Blu-ray player (and to those who are trying to turn our young people into govenment hating...no matter what persuasion...cretins...you're doing a great job) and put it up for sale from whence it came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killed It Halfway Through","review":"Reminded me of the Bourne movies, which I don't like.

Very political in it's message but not possible. Other countries had our same intel. Saddam would not let the United Nation inspectors in so it seemed he was hiding something. He and his people had plenty of warnings. It was almost a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does bashing our country and militarty ever get old for Damon?","review":"Thankfully I didn't invest any of my own money in this movie, but I did waste a couple hours of life. I won't waste much more going into the numerous reasons this was a horrible movie. I know our country has it's faults, but I'm trying to think of the last movie Damon made that cast America in a good light. He picks these \\"aren't the U.S. and capitalism horrible\\" movies over and over again. Ironically, his love for creating a hate for this country is only outdone by his love of the profits it brings to him personally. I'm sure he jups at the chance to be in any movie that casts OTHER countries or thier leaders in a good light (Invictus). I guess I shouldn't expect much from a guy who idolizes Howard Zinn though.Don't buy this CD.
