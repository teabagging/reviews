Sadly, I found all the characters extremely annoying...especially the bland too-goody-goody-trying-to-be-tough heroine, which was a shame as I thought the book's setting in the world of television an interesting subject. The stalker was too blatantly obvious and the whole book seemed to go on F-O-R-E-V-E-R. Also, like another reviewer stated, the narrator (Julie Finneran) was herself annoying which didn't help my overall experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Proof Is In The Pudding","review":"I enjoyed this book. If you are close minded and don't want to research about the origins of Jesus or the New Testament, then skip this. If you care about your faith enough to make sure it holds water, then this is a good start. It's simple and direct. The author covers all the bases, but it's up to the reader to take this information and explore it further when the book is completed. I was a Christian for 30 years and it was books like this that helped me realize that, though there may be a God, the Christian faith doesn't hold the keys to understanding that God. If you want to find, you have to look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing","review":"I find the dogmatic way that people hold on to their myths to be mildly amusing until this dogma begins to corrupt the \\"real\\" world as we are seeing in 2012. This book should be read by every teen in the world before they are completly infected by the disease of Christianity. If people would read the Gospels and understand that there are actually three different Jesus characters, one full of angst, one almost Zen like, and John's rather bullish Jesus. The synoptic gospels are all simply re-writes of a central incorrect history/novel of the central character of Jesus. John's author takes the story on a wildly different path over a completely different time line. READ AND THINK PEOPLE instead of relying on others to feed you what they would have you believe. Faith is truly the culmination of things unseen or perhaps of things unwilling to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assumption is Not Proof","review":"I was very disappointed because the author presents a thought-provoking theory but offers no proof.

I always believed that when you die you went to heaven to join those loved ones who went before you and to await those who would come later. This is not supported by the bible. Why hasn't anyone made this clear. Probably not a day goes by when preachers console survivors by telling them that their loved one is now \\"in a better place.\\" Why would they say taht when the bible says that is not true.

It seems that the motor gets too hot and it can't handle the temperature. (I did learn that the 1875 is a number for heat, not power ) Even if you have it on medium, it still does it.

I think that Stewart gets far more caught up in technical descriptions of military machinery and weapons, than in developing his characters and their relationships,--to the point of being down right wordy with technical jargon.

This is not the band that would later record \\"Germs(GI)\\"; this is four kids screwing around, having fun. There are hints of talent in songs like 'Forming' and 'Let's Pretend', but most of the set is a mess. Still, the importance of the moment that \\"Germicide\\" documents--the infancy of America's most influential punk scene--cannot be diminished. For a frightening contrast(and I'm not using \\"frightening\\" in a hyperbolic way), listen to this CD and then watch the documentary \\"The Decline of Western Civilization\\" in which the late-period Germs appear. It will give you an idea of the dark depths plumbed on the L.A. punk scene in the space of two and a half years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Germs - 'Germicide: Live At The Whiskey, 1977' (Bomp)","review":"This is only the second Germs release I've ever heard. How many 'actual' albums did they put out? Was very impressed with the sincerity of the Germs. They're a true-to-the-roots all out American punk band. They're dirty, rude, mean, offensive and have a totally violent additude. Perfect! Tracks I found myself looking forward to on this CD were \\"Sex Boy\\", \\"Sweet Dream\\", the slamming \\"Suicide Machine\\" and \\"Teenage Clone\\". Line-up: Darby Crash (R.I.P.)-vocals, Pat Smear-guitar, Lorna Doom-bass and Belinda Carlisle (Go-Go's) believe or not on drums. Should draw in old school followers of Dead Kennedys, Social Distortion, Black Flag and Circle Jerks to name just a few.

I give it a four because I bought it, ignored it on my iPod for almost a year, and have listened to it three times all the way through in the last 24 hours.It is loud, sloppy, bratty and at times great. It is the definition of the whole DIY punk thing, like The Mekons first album (different for sure but with the same attitude). You can hear bits of pieces of trashy metal, Bowie, etc. Suicide Machine is my favorite track, but the insults, hurled bottles and trash are all there as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listener Beware!","review":"You've gotta be kidding me! From a historical standpoint, this recording is interesting because it captures The Germs in their infancy. From a musical standpoint, however, it blows. If you are curious about The Germs, avoid this CD like the plague and instead seek out the GI LP or MIA CD. Only then will you be rewarded with some of the finest punk rock ever recorded. The Germs actually learned how play their instruments and the addition of Don Boles on drums was, in my opinion, what really made them great."},{"rating":"1","title":"has anyone HEARD this cd????","review":"you know, i enjoy punk as much as the next guy, and its neat to hear early recordings of \\"legendary artists\\", but a) the germs are only legendary because darby crash killed himself, and b) musically, sound quality, lyrically, whatever you want, this is not good. worth hearing for darby's baiting the crowd (although his vocabulary consists of about 4 words at this point), and the song victim, most notably for its ending, acheived when darby finishes yelling the lyrics (out of sync with the music of course) and implores the band \\"stop.....STOP!!!!\\" then immediately asks \\"whats next?\\" this is funny enough, but not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"TYLER -THANK YOU FOR BEING \\"ONE OF US\\"","review":"This soundtrack is heartfelt.

Unfortunately, Marcus's INVISIBLE REPUBLIC is mandarin gibberish, the work of an enormously overrated writer engaged in the kind of pseudo-intellectual wanking that's actually embarrassing to read. Marcus's problem is that he thinks he's Wittgenstein on acid when he's really just a journalistic Elmer Fudd hyped up on double latte--a boring narcissist with a penchant for turgid prose. Don't subsidize this guy; he doesn't deserve it. There's good criticism on Dylan out there; don't waste your time reading this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"a struggle","review":"\\"The Basement Tapes\\" is one of my favorite albums of all time. I love Dylan and the Band --- at least most of their stuff --- and also am interested in history. But this book bored me to tears. I found it a real struggle to even stay awake and finish it. Perhaps my intellectual ability lacks the capacity to absorb what Marcus is trying to convey within these pages. But his whole premise of linking the themes on this album to a period of American history strikes me as both far-fetched and futile. I love some of the other negative reviews here and would have to agree with those comments. Gibberish? Well, it's closer to gobbleygook. Unless you are familiar with the turgid writing style of Mr. Marcus --- and happen to be impressed by it --- beware of this sleep-enducing tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Mystery Train","review":"Marcus has written a BOOK, and entire BOOK for heavens sake, on a collection of songs. He goes on for pages and pages, dissecting songs that Dylan probably wrote in minutes. Searching for the meaning of life in a song like 'Lo and Behold' is fruitless, I can assure you.Read Mystery Train again if you need a dose of Marcus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terminal","review":"Some book, The Inbvisible Rebublic.

And though, as a Brit, I don't have a personal Yankee context, I was pre-disposed to be favourable. However....I found this book both pompous and, even worse, pretentious. The links were tenuous, the prose was a thesaurus exercise without meaning. But with too much ambition. I bought the Basement Tapes when they first came out. Hell, I bought them on vinyl just off Carnaby Street, as the Little White Wonder. Some time ago, when Pat Garret and Billy The Kid was showing. Marcus attempts to place the sessions on a large social mural - spanning over a century. I don't think, in fact, I'm sure, that Bob and the Band were thinking that way.Just a thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid Flapdoodle","review":"Too darn high on his own fumes, a once intelligent writer turns an arrogant essay of sorts into an insulting something or other that smells like hubris gone stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marcus is a boob.","review":"Mr. Marcus is a sort of post-modern groupie.

This is a classic case of an author\`s ego winning out to common sense .It\`s hard enough to read a book , if you\`ve lost all faith in the author\`s integrity , thanks to the laughably tenuous links that he uses to back up his theory , but when you have to wade through reams of portentious , almost unreadable prose , to reach the same conclusion , it\`s almost torture .

With the very notable exception of \\"When October Goes,\\" the Manilow penned melodies simply aren't memorable. The arrangements, even on classic tunes like \\"Skylark\\" tend to be sleepy and in the case of \\"On the Atcheson, Topeka, and the Sante Fe,\\" almost unlistenable.The one gem on this album is \\"When October Goes,\\" which earns it an extra star. This song deserves to be a standard, with a terrific melody and a wistful Mercer lyric which includes two of his standard themes - that of a yearning for a more innocent past and his matching of the passing of the calendar with aging and sadness.Save your money and buy Ella Fitzgerald's Johnny Mercer songbook album instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monica Mancini CD","review":"CD arrived in very good condition in under a week and no problems in playing.

Her asides about her personal experiences in the city complement her grander historical and artistic musings: you never feel alienated from her prose (the way you can in her earlier THE STONES OF FLORENCE). Her anecdotes about the doges, Tintoretto, Veronese, the Councils, etc. greatly enhanced one's understanding of the city, and her musings on the art are thoughtful and illuminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Talk about taking the joy out of an experience.

The only upside is that it is short. Yuck, what a waste of time. My advice is: get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book. At least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails. Actually, in terms of a travelogue, \\"Vendela in Venice\\" far surpassess any other Venice book I have seen.

All Bryan Ferry's pet obsessions, word play and music that inspires. The playing is terrific and, although Eno would be missed, its clear that Ferry's songwriting was headed in more melodic directions that would require a more capable keyboard player like Ed Jobson.\\"The Bogus Man\\" is one of the strangest, trance inducing songs recorded. Although it doesn't sound anything like it, it best recalls \\"I put a spell on you\\" by Screaming Jay Hawkins. Don't ask me why.The slower pieces create an overall mood in contrast to the harder rock songs(like \\"Do the Strand\\"). If you don't like the mood, you probably won't like the song, but, given a chance, it'll transport you mentally to a wide variety of memories and sensations.

Intriguing, creative and yet totally \\"Roxy\\", this album nice balances the controlled and cool tendencies of Ferry with the experimental and improvised mannerisms of Eno. This variation is quite evident as songs range from the driving singles \\"Do the Strand\\" and \\"Editions of You\\" to the slow and almost-eerie \\"In Every Dream Home a Heartache,\\" with with atonal synthesizer textures which seem to fit perfectly with Ferry's sedated vocals.

The entire album is wrought with tension and angst. Sonically its fantastic, with Eno treating the various instruments electronically, which leads to a very alienated feeling by the listener. This CD has no filler, 8 tracks 8 classics, but 8 very very different songs. Blue Lagoons is the closest thing to upbeat this album has to offer, and even that has its weird moments. However, songs like Do The Strand, Editions of You, In Every Dreamhome a Heartache and Bogus Man each show a VERY different side to Roxy Music, each very dark and deliberate in their delivery. The piece de resistance though is the closer/title track, which devolves from a sad song to a cacophony of delay feedback and warped piano tones.Along with Country Music, this album defines what Roxy Music was about, what they could do, and why they continue to inspire musicians today."},{"rating":"2","title":"...the perfect sleeping bag!","review":"...I really love this very cosy sleeping bag.

The reason for that is because the ownership of the Cameo/Parkway Records recordings has been in dispute for years. (This is also why Chubby Checker's original hits are out of print.) So, until owership is settled, we only have rerecordings of their hits on CD. This particular CD is a live recording of Question Mark and the Mysterians from 1984. Despite this being 18 years after the band's hit days, they are still a solid band. This is a really good concert, featuring extended versions of their best known songs, plus some off color vocals by Question Mark.

Here she returns to her roots, and eschews the sexy lingere clad funk songstress that she was in her Prince days to emerge as a serious musician. Most of the tracks are instrumentals except two. \\"N PERFECT TIME\\" is a spiritual song with vocals by Sheila, and then her brother takes lead vocals on the song \\"Rite to Paradise\\". It would be a perfect album if you want some light jazz to unwind to. It is not in any way related to \\"THE GLAMOROUS LIFE\\". Artists grow, and this is a new avenue for Sheila's talent. The music is all solid, and it sounds great! But remember this is a jazz record, and Prince has nothing to do with it. Though I am sure he would approve!

However, I am extremely disappointed with the changes. In fact, on comparing with the previous editions I have, the eukaryotic sections are little more than a rehash. The sections on genome analysis are also little more than a re-write of earlier editions: chapter 3 includes several pages on Cot Analysis - does anyone still do this? One other major concern is the lack of new material/new research -almost all the 'further reading' sections refer to papers pre-1990! Genes was once the best advanced genetics text on the market - I sadly feel that Genes VII no longer holds that position."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This book is useful but if your new to genetics and want a nice reference book that is easy to read I recommend \\"Concepts of Genetics\\" by Klug and Cummings.

In an ideal world, the author would have written just for me: reordered the chapters, gone into greater detail for some topics and less for others, and inserted images that pertained to the level of detail I needed. However, the world isn't ideal. The book comes as close as any text can to meeting the needs of readers who need the book as a fundamental learning aid and as a reference guide. However, although it's jam-packed with information, it's a little tedious reading through the elementary text to get to what you need.

Based on the title I assumed it would talk about a god and how man made religions are flawed. The book did indeed cover the flaws of religion although perhaps too briefly. I'm sure a giant book could be written on the subject but this book just touches on it lightly. I also assumed the book would cover the topic of some kind of supreme being which would be proved by a mathematical or scientific method. After all the term \\"God Without\\" implies there is a god. Instead what it goes on to say is there is no God and everyone should worship themselves to fill the void of being godless.

In spite of its title, it is not against organized religions. It is in favor of expanding the sense of self to include and be compassionate with others. The way many religions are eroneously taught shows great insecurity on the part of their teachers. This is because they attempt to assure the congregants that their religion is right or better while other religions are wrong or lesser. This book helps you to see through this religious insecurity.

This amazing book shows you how."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerns about this book","review":"This book was interesting and enlightening in pointing out problems with our society today, where we divide ourselves based on our religions and other differences rather than realizing that we are all essentially the same. However, it always concerns we when someone says that they have the only answer and that everyone must follow only one path to God or enlightenment.

I researched online, found this and ordered with new Bosch O2 sensors from Amazon too. Had it all installed at a local Goodyear auto shop for eighty five dollars! Would recommend this route to anyone looking to replace a cracked manifold: find the part yourself and find a local shop willing to install it.

The Catalyst on these are not reliable I seriously cannot recommend this. After all this time of my CEL reminding me of what a piece of crap this is I finally decided to come on here and warn you all NOT to buy this product. Unfortunately I have not tried to resolve the issue with the manufacturer. I will have to find a suitable replacement at some point.

The reality of relationships and sexuality can be a challenging topic for people who support persons with disabilities. The author's decision to use each person's words to describe their relationship as part of a couple is a powerful support of the need for self-efficacy, regardless of cognitive ability. The common thread that runs throughout the interviews is each person's belief that they have the right to make decisions about who will share their life. For all people who impact the lives of persons with disabilities, this book is an eloquent reminder that we all share the same dream and we all have the right to pursue our dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infuriating and Wonderful","review":"Have you ever been watching something on television, something that unexpectedly catches hold of your imagination and makes you fall in love with the characters, only to have the words \\"To Be Continued\\" flash across the screen?

There's also no room to store a normal sized package of wipes!! Hello?! Diapers are just as important as wipes! I cannot store my package of wipes and all that would really fit in any of these holders is a travel pack. I am not about to start buying travel packs in addition to what I already buy.

Since I generally like Skip Hop products I thought this would be a good item. As soon as I opened it though I hated it. The caddy is made of hard plastic and is incredibly loud and heavy even when empty. The smallest movement makes everything rattle. The side pockets just slide on and move easily so it makes the whole thing just feel incredibly cheap and flimsy. The same for the drawers - just plastic sliding in plastic so it feels cheap. Despite how cheap it all feels, the cost (almost $40 at the time) is rediculous.

I have thought several times as using it for like a gift wrap of sorts for another baby shower but haven't yet. It's cute but it's so small and so, very impractical.

The book is an interesting read. It has a lot of interesting facts about Tesla and others that will paint a picture for you. Although IMHO there's some extra fluff and it wonders off into the lives of other people, it's mainly about Tesla. If you're the kind of person that wants something simple and factual then this is not for you. For those who can juggle numerous quantum facts to paint a final picture that could very well shock you, then give this book a try. I personally enjoyed it.

I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is serious about finding historical information about Tesla and his inventions. I was going to say the only thing missing in this fantasy trip was an alien abduction, but the author did one better, he said that Tesla was an alien from outer space.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book full of pseudoscience and conspiracy theories","review":"That Tesla was a great scientist and inventor I won't argue. However, this book isn't about that Tesla. Instead, it leverages off the fact that he could be a bit eccentric and uses some of his crazier ideas to push pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.

People who don't respect freedom or care that others are persecuted. People who think that violence is a means to subjugating groups of individuals. People who lump others together in tight little groups so that they can be more easily hated. Yes. Some people might be just the kinds of people to use this book as a doorstopper.

Although I believe their other live offering from their 1978 tour 'Live At The Old Waldorf' (see my review) may be more new wave-ish, keep in mind this 2-CD pick is good, too. Tunes that I found myself playing over several time include the jamming \\"See No Evil\\", the ass-kicking \\"Ain't That Nothing\\", their Bob Dylan homage \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Dorr\\" (nearly eight minutes of semi-musical brilliance) as well as the guitar-driven fifteen-minute \\"Little Johnny Jewel\\" and again their Stones cover of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\". Oh and at least one Television song here that appears to be exclusive to this title, the rocking \\"Venus de Milo\\". The overall sound on 'The Blow-Up' isn't perfect - but it's good enough, for a live album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music but poor recording","review":"It must have been a great show in 1978 but the poor quality of recording is disappointing.

Everyone seems to only mention Tom Verlaines work, but its the virtuosity of the guitar interplay that occurs between Richard Lloyd and Tom Verlaine (2 geniuses of the guitar) that make this band extraordinary (and Tom Verlains haunting vocals).I am amazed by their last studio effort in '92 which almost surpasses Marquee Moon and Adventure. I saw them live in '92 at Roseland in NYC and was amazed how fresh and new this band still sounded. No other band compares. Kudo's to Bono for mentioning Television and Patti Smith as their main influences during this years rock and roll hall of fame.

I think when they first came out, they immediately showed this force which gave the impression to the other bands something like \\"ok, you done good. Now step back, and let the Europeans show you how it's done.\\" Not saying Caliban does it better, but there's this feeling of freshness to the music that rivals some.

It's unintentionally funny, like they're trying to take the piss out of real emo bands.

HOWERVER, Caliban does not use clean vocals nearly as much Killswitch, and also Caliban's music is much heavier and far less accessible. This is a very go for the throat style of metalcore.

Caliban is stealing their music from Killswitch. Listen to the song The Beloved And The Hatred, then listen to Killswitch's Numbered days. It is an exact copy with different lyrics. To the second the talking screaming and singing are the same. What's the difference? there are two... 1) Killswitch made Numbered Days way before The Beloved And The Hatred, 2) Caliban's singer could only dream of singing like Jesse. This is not the only ripoff, practically all songs on the album steal from Killswitch. The only reason I give it two stars is because they do have the tallent to make half as good replica songs.

It is still an interesting read, and the stories she recounts are well done and witty, but the spotlight is less on her own story and more on the people she surrounded herself with.

It's by the same outfit, and advertizes it's from the creators of \\"the original.\\" Well, it may be from the creators..... but it's a TOTALLY different workout. :08 Minute Abs used to require no pressure or involvement of knees (mine are bad) and this new routine assumes that you have the knees of a 16-year-old.

For one thing, even though they state that you will be doing each exercise for a certain number of seconds, it isn't true. They start the clock while the instructor is explaining the exercise and you don't actually start the set until there's about 15-20 seconds on the clock, which is nothing I guess once you know the workout well, it's okay, but I really disliked that. I loved the original 8 minute abs and thought this new version didn't come close to the original.I would instead recommend Tammilee Webb's I Want that Body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Video Quality, Ok abs routine.","review":"I basically just purchased this as a replacement for the old 8 minute abs video I used to do.

While the comedic style is somewhat akin to Airplane or Naked Gun, the tone here is much more understated and the story moves along nicely and leaves you feeling for the characters. I don't think I've ever seen Chevy Chase or Martin Short being funnier, and who can possibly forget Steve Martin as he cries \\"I'm going to go talk to them - man to man\\" ! Non-stop laughter, good plot, perfect timing .. what's next, is a gringo going to fall out of the sky ? Yes, El Guapo !"},{"rating":"2","title":"you were supposed to fire UP!","review":"One of the great comedies to be released in the 1980s and featuring three great actors/comedians as out of work silent movie era actors (Steve, Chevy and Martin) who get called down to Mexico to help a small village rid of a bully.

Not only are the comedic situations hilarious, but a classic 'heros save the day' situation touches your heart while tickleing your funnybone.

It ranks up there with the best of the Saturday Night Live alumni celluloid offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie, no special features","review":"This is another movie that my girlfriend could not believe i have never seen. What makes this one even stranger is that friend from college had been talking about this movie for years, and i still had never seen it. Now i can finaly say that i have seen The Three Amigos .The premise of the movie is that a Mexican woman sees a movie of the Three Amigos saving the day. Only, she does not know it is a movie and thinks it is a newsreel. She invites the Amigos to help save her town from the bandits. Having just been fired from their movie studio, they accept, thinking that it is a chance to do a show and get paid for it. The movie stars Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short.The movie is funny and enjoyable as we see the Amigos go on the comedic misadventures. The only negative is that i had just seen Blazing Saddles and could not help making comparisons to it. The Three Amigos falls short in comparison.There are no special features on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Overrated","review":"I didn't see this movie in theatres because I didn't think it looked that good. They couldn't even pull a decent trailer together, as I recall.But I heard people say good things about it.

There's a campfire scene and the three leads sing and strum a guitar next to the campfire. And a cactus joins in and sings. That's it. There was nothing more to it. For some reason, people found this really funny.I suppose if they found that to be a knee-slapper, the rest of this comedy--as arid as the Mexican landscape in the background--would be equally as hilarious.I like the cast, I like John Landis...but this was not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where're the laffs?","review":"I love some of the reviews below for this film:\\"you snobs giving this a poor review need to learn to enjoy a good COMEDY!\\",and other similar deathless pronouncements.That's all well and good,but I prefer my comedies to be FUNNY,y'know?Someone else mentioned Ebert's 1 star review--what some may not know is that Chevy Chase agreed with Ebert,telling him \\"I don't like it either\\".This is just another flat attempt at comedy,with plenty of forced scenes,and a script nearly devoid of any humor whatsoever.I don't think the casting is inspired,but I doubt any collection of all-star comedic actors could do anything worthwhile with the script.This movie reminds me a lot of 'Spies Like Us',another un-funny film from around this time.Chase made a lot of bad choices in the '80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Watse of Film","review":"The review just before mine will give you a summary of the film.

Are they courteously waiting for the other guy to grab the punchline? Are they busting their reps to push a bad script?

My son keeps them on his dresser most times, but last night, he asked if he could sleep with them...so I put them on his pillow. Needless to say, he was delighted!Each of the figures have movable heads, which is an added bonus.My only criticism is that Gloria the Hippo sometimes wobbles...to the point of falling off my son's dresser entirely. If I open one of his drawers, Gloria usually takes a dive onto the floor.But for imaginative play--or just to have on display--these figurines are great for young Madagasar fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Dog Video","review":"It was with great enthusiasm that I purchased this Doggie Entertainment DVD after looking at the specifics, however I was greatly disappointed....as was my dog. Apparently there is a \\"high volume sound\\" that runs throughout the disc that only the dog can hear. And our dog hears the sound but doesn't connect it with what is happening on the TV screen. Consequently he runs around the house like crazy looking for the sound. The only time he shows any interest in the DVD is when a dog actually barks. There are some dogs shown, but many wild animals and birds....and they do not make any sounds. My dog has no interest in zebras and lions. It is virtually a silent DVD and our dog couldn't have cared less....and it was boring for us adults. Our dog actually likes television....especially when barking dogs are on it. But this Doggie Entertainment did absolutely nothing for him. Personally, I feel like I threw my money away purchasing it. The dog thinks so too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"The only part my dog pays any attention to is the barking; her ears perk up and she sniffs the TV for a couple seconds, but that's it.

Just recently I had a Microsoft Habu mouse, which was a decent mouse, but seemed to be messing up some. After i bought the G5, I gave my Habu to my friend to use. The weights are great, when I'm playing fps' I have them in, and when I'm searching the web i just take them out. The look and feel are sufficient too. Overall a great mouse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"G5 - comfortable and accurate","review":"I wore out my first G5 and HAD to get another one. I use mine to play a few PC games, particularly Battlefield 2142 where controlling the TV-guided missile requires a more \\"professional\\" mouse. It has a very ergonomic feel to it, more buttons that I have a use for and most importantly it has an on-the-fly sensitivity button that lets you quickly change the sensitivity settings. All that without having to mess around with any software. I have tried many different mice, and although this model is somewhat old it still does the best job for me. I highly recommend this mouse, especially for a PC Gamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech G5","review":"This is a fantastic mouse, once I received it it took a little bit getting used to the increased mouse speed. But now it's definitely my favorite mouse. The adjustable weights are a nice feature and so is the on the fly adjustable dpi. Both I don't use too much right now but it seems like i'll find a place for it later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Trust-maker","review":"My family got this mouse just a bit before I went off to college. At home, I used it for gaming, but it was a bit too big and bulky to take with me to school (though I like the size when I don't have space restrictions). Still, it served faithfully at home when I was there and catching up on games, or when I wasn't and my family was just doing standard computing.I've gone through a slew of mice over my college career, and very few even seemed to survive more than a year in my hands. This is the exception, a mouse that has survived all of this time and continues to be a stellar mouse even to this day, a number of years later. This mouse is a trust-maker for Logitech; I have a vast graveyard of mice in a box somewhere, and then this one still working great after all this time. I'm sold on Logitech for all of my future mouse needs, and recommend them to my family and friends whenever they tell me about their 80-some dollar mouse dying after only a year or two of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"$160.00 haha pathetic.","review":"i bought this mouse new when it first came out.for $69.99 now someone wants $160.00 give a break. talk about highway robbery.i wouldn't pay that price with your money. non the less my money.great mouse but not for that price, id look else where, IE:new egg, tiger direct, compusa, directron, ebay, ect. anything other than here.i love amazon and buy alot form here but i would not pay this its pathetic!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all durable","review":"I was extremely happy with this mouse after about 6 months of casual gameplay.

Does everything I need and I like the ability to make adjustments. Very smooth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near-perfect, high quality product.","review":"An excellent gaming mouse, the G5 has alot going for it. Wide poly feet are a huge step up from the old mx518. The button action is uniform and has a quality feel to it. The weight cartidge, which I had passed off as a gimmick is actually not only useful but is also very easy to set up properly to great effect for the balance of the mouse. And the sensitivity and accuracy of motion are second to none. In fact, the best feature of this mouse and all Logitech products is build quality. Not to mention it looks great.Having just retired a Razer Death Adder, the G5 is taking a bit of getting used to. The shape is a bit odd in that my ring finger is a bit confused as to where it's supposed to fall between the right button and the side of the mouse. And the cloth cord drags a bit on the back edge of the desk, which slows the motion of the mouse at inopportune times. But these are minor gripes and are far overshadowed by the positive features of the mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mouse","review":"I owned the earlier version of the g5 for a couple of years and found it hard they could improve but they did. For the price i dont think you can get a better mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gaming mouse period!!!","review":"I've tried quite a few including the G500, which I still own and use at work, the Cyborg Rat 7 (gimmicks nothing more), the Razer Naga (some heft please), the G700 (ehh) and I've always come back to my tried and true G5. I use all buttons including the side-scroll buttons and, combined with the weight and perfect ergos, this mouse has just worked perfect from jump start. I was trying to replace it because the app-specific button programming kinda sucks but I guess I'll have to live with that since all the others I tried don't stack up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this mouse","review":"I had my heart initially set on the G7 (cordless), but after seeing that Logitech had gone through the trouble to improve its original G5, while the G7 was still on the original design, I gave the G5 a harder look. I'm glad I did. It's much cheaper than the G7, easier to find retail, the variable weights are really cool, and the latter swayed my final decision. The cord is absolutely not a problem, so getting a cordless would have solved nothing, and would have added the cumbersomeness of dealing with swapping batteries. The built-in, on-the-fly resolution change buttons are a godsend for sniping. Lastly, when I describe this mouse to my friends at work, they treat me with new-found respect because they know I'm a *serious* gamer - heh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cord Ever","review":"The cord is far too rigid. It gets kinks, pulls on the mouse, catches on things, and just is a total nuisance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until the last ___?","review":"I love this mouse with the weighting and DPI selection. Improved my Call of Duty scoring by 25 to 30%. But---it went dead in the water after 3 weeks of use. Seems to be a problem with some of them. They freeze up cursor-wise. I'm going to try it on another computer (Forum suggestion) and if doesn't work, will return it for replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it","review":"The mouse feels great, but there is one HUGE problem:it is impossible to use the middle button without accidentally pressing the side scroll buttons too(which makes firefox go forward/back one page, for example).Also, it is 2010 already and Logitech still does not provide Linux support. How can they be so cheap? Just hire __one__ linux programmer to do the job.I am returning this mouse because the middle mouse does not work properly and there are no configuration utilities provided from Logitech. I am not looking forward 2 days of trying different xorg config settings trying to disable the extra buttons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel-good mouse","review":"I haven't yet investigated all the customizable features of this mouse but it does what I bought it for (work tasks, not gaming). It's very comfortable and the click wheel works very well. One nice touch is that you can press the click wheel on its sides to scroll left and right within applications and websites. I hadn't expected the USB cable to be quite as long as it is. I keep it bundled in the middle so it doesn't flop all over my desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse.","review":"I love this mouse. It has a great rough texture feel to it. It glides on my desk surface. The sensitivity changer is a nice feature especially in games. I love how this scroll wheel isn't crap like a lot of other wheels. It clicks and doesn't just glide easily like the revolution. The weights are great too for those who feel they want something heavier. I personally like my mouse light, but to each his own. All in all, I love this mouse for everyday use and for gamers."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Described","review":"Very pleased with purchase. It is exactly as described and takes the place of a wireless mouse that (through no fault of its own) was \\"sticking\\" and freezing-up. Back to wired has solved the problem.The G5 has a great feel to it and its textured surface allows for a nice bond between hand and mouse. I've never had a mouse that I could balance with individual weights. Frankly, that feature seems a bit over the top, but it is certainly unique.The wire is more flexible then others I recall using; so much so I don't even realize it's wired at all. This is a good one folks. If you need/want a wired mouse I don't know how you could pick a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech NEW G5 Laser Mouse","review":"I have been using a logitech wireless laser mouse for around 4 years now. The wireless was a bit clunky for gaming so I looked around for a better mouse. After reading numerous reviews the G5 kept coming out on top. I have used it for about a month now and notice that the tracking is much faster and smoother then my wireless laser mouse. If I had any complaints, my only one would be that it is wired and not a wireless mouse. Besides that, it is a great mouse that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good solid gaming mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse but I still prefer the old MX510","review":"I had the old MX510 (same shape as the G5 with the 800dpi red optical tracking instead of the 2000dpi laser) for years and resisted upgrading to the G5 due to the lack of a second thumb button. So when Logitech finally put the a second button on the G5, I bought one right away. Overall, the motion does feel a bit smoother however I find that the middle mouse button (the scroll wheel button) is too imprecise and I can't always activate it without accidentally scrolling the wheel, this never happened on the MX510. The sensitivity adjustment is pretty innovative however the sensitivity buttons are a bit awkwardly placed. I would have preferred if it was more like the MX510 with one button in front and one button behind the scroll wheel instead of having both buttons placed behind.So while I do like the mouse, it would have been perfect if they just put the laser tracking engine and sensitivity adjustments into the MX510 body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse for anything, not just games","review":"I had gotten my wife a replacement mouse, an expensive MS one, and she thought it was too light and cheap feeling. So I looked at all the mice available and decided to try this one because of the weights. She loves it!!! It has a great feel, she could set the responsiveness just how she likes it, and we weighted up to where she thought it felt just right.Note that she is not a game player (except solitaire), really just surfing the web and doing email/word/excel. I ended up with the expensive MS mouse and it does feel cheap and is too light . . . oh well, maybe I can get one of the Logitech G5's for Xmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice mouse","review":"My logitech wireless mouse died and I had a few problems with connection issues. So I decided I would go back to a wire mouse. I want a mouse that had almost the exact same button setup as my wireless mouse. Friend of mine has the MX5** version. I was looking for that one put I didn't chose it because of the color schemes that amazon was selling at the time. I am very picky. So I went with the G5 instead. I am very happy that I bought this mouse instead.

But this mouse is like cheating. The weight system is great, it is a huge improvement from normal mice with 1000 dpi, and is a very trusted brand. I probably won't be able to go back to any other mouse after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every gamer's dream mouse.","review":"PROS: Great button placement, wheel works really well in-game, love the on-the-fly sensitivity adjustment.CONS: Sometimes is painful after holding it. Maybe I played too much?FINAL VERDICT: Definitely worth the money. If you game and are looking for a gaming mouse, this is it.SUMMARY: Bought this after looking at online reviews, and many people seemed to like it. It has a great feel to it, lots of grip, has this crazy little tray of adjustable weights that pops out the bottom so I can adjust how heavy it is. But occasionally this tray will fall out. I love the software that comes with it, makes the mouse fully customizable. It is lighting quick too, an advantage over wireless mice that sometimes can lag out on you. (Which is not good in multiplayer) One of the edges is a bit sharp and depending on how you hold the mouse, can get painful if you're not careful. Try a few positions out, keep gaming sessions under 10 hours and you'll be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech G5 Laser Mouse","review":"Love this mouse, still using it 2 years later. the weights included for balance, weights were a novelty and I stopped using them. otherwise no complaints. Love Logitech products, especially their mice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse","review":"Was very interested in the G5/G7, but was put off by the fact that they only have one thumb button. So when I found out that they came out with a revision with 2, I was all over it. Love the mouse. Unfortunately only comes in one finish (the electric crackly blue one), but it's not as gaudy as the pictures make it seem.The adjustable weights are nice, and the dpi switcher is very snazzy. The middle mouse click can be tricky to push down, as it sometimes prefers tilting to the sides. I'm glad it has the ratchety precision scroll, but the option to switch between it and hyperscroll would have been nice.Otherwise, a great mouse. Highly recommended for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts my hand and wrist!!!!","review":"I bought this mouse based on the glowing reviews on Amazon, and on several other computer review sites that gave this mouse top marks.Well, I just plugged it in today and my wrist and hand are going numb!!! This has never happened to me in all my years of using a mouse. I am a female and have a small hand and because this mouse has a large hump in its center, its causing my wrist to bend back more and is hurting my wrist and causing my fingers to go numb. The mouse is also rough on the outside and doesn't feel good to me. I spent nearly $50 on this mouse and feel really disappointed. If you have small hands, don't buy this mouse!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"$100+ ??","review":"I've used a G5 mouse for a year before the right button gave out after a drop off my desk.

Well it didnt take anytime at all for me to realize that was a mistake. The main problem was the lateral/yaw movement was so slow as to drive me crazy! My a wrist and arm was sore after a very short time with this mouse, and of course I tried all kinds of adjustments both with game sensetivity and the weights.I had to bring it back, and exchanged it for the Microsoft Sidewinder Mouse. See my review on that one.I know the G5 has many fans so I will just say mine didn't live up to all the hype. Perhaps I got a bad one.Therefore I suggest you check out some of the other fine gamming mice including the MX518 which I continue to use on my other computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance but dreadful surface","review":"Before I ordered this mouse, I read a review about its bad surface. I did not want to believe it and just bought the item. After two days, I decided that I cannot work with it. Anytime I touched it, I got goosebumps.This is sad because technically this mouse is great. The accuracy of the laser sensor is amazing. And the possibility to change the weight is a great feature. However, if you are somewhat sensitive to weird surfaces (I thought I was not at all), better choose a different mouse or try it out at a local retailer.I sent the G5 back to the seller and bought the Logitech MX Revolution, which so far is really a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price - What the Hell?","review":"WHY ON EARTH is this mouse $179.99?

I tried a variety of ergonomic solutions but though they were somewhat comfortable they were usually not overly responsive and I still felt less than happy. Then I decided to try a gaming mouse on the grounds that they should be the most responsive and comfortable of mice. The first unit was defective but the second unit was everything I hoped for but there was still a snag. My work mouse runs three computers from a KVM switch and one of the computers uses the old PS/2 connector and the gamer mouse won't work with the old connections. Since we need this computer for legacy stuff it can't be discarded so I'm still searching for a work mouse - but the mouse is everything I could want on my private computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cord is a Major Flaw!!!","review":"Check out some of the other one or two star reviews on this mouse. They mention a cord issue. There is a general theme to all of these complaints including mine... The cord is flawed. The cord is covered in a stiff braided fabric type material. It looks nice. It makes the cord look sturdy and strong when you first buy this mouse. The reality is that the fancy braiding ends up kinking and tightening up on the cord. It ends up fraying and then eventually the cord shorts out. It just happened on my mouse after 6 months. I have a laptop and I travel with it quite often. This cord cannot stand up to being moved or folded up for travel for any length of time. I imagine if you park this thing on your desktop, it would last longer. Unfortunately considering how much this thing costs, there is no excuse for this type of failure. Logitech could care less about this flaw, so once it fails you're on you're own.

He had a book that came with his kit, but he'd already mastered all those and was ready to move on. This book, The Benchside Introduction to Fly Tying, was a huge hit with him. It not only works because it deals with many beginner techniques, but also because it has carried him along as his skills have improved. In fact, I don't know that he'll ever need another book, because this one covers all skill ranges. According to him, the pictures are great, very detailed, and he loves that he can lay the book flat (because of the spiral binding), instead of having to put something heavy on the page to hold it down while he works. He said he probably won't ever have to buy another fly! Overall, a great book and I, and he, highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benchside is great!","review":"I finally got a chance to use this great book last week. I had taken a fly tying class earlier this year and couldn't remember how to tie a couple of flies. The book is well written and gives precise instructions - with pictures - on how to tie each and every fly. The instructions are easy to follow. This is a must have for any person who ties flies!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the format","review":"This is a great instructional book. I am new to fly tying and the split format of upper page sections for the recipe, and the lower section for required techniques is very helpful.The only reason I do not give this five stars is because of the wire-o' binding. It is a little fragile and makes turning the pages difficult, a plastic spiral coil is always easier to work with. The larger size of the book is a plus, for these tired eyes, but a drawback also because it takes up so much room on my bench when open for use.I would highly recommend this book for newbies such as myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"It's not all that great dose not cut good at all.

After doing that, I blend it together (the video shows you how) and voila! A haircut just as good as from the shop. My boys liked their haircuts so much, they told me they want me to cut their hair every time. As a bonus for me, my 14 year old asked me if he could give me a haircut.

I really hate going to barbers as they can be quite inconsistent, so I bought this set. The Wahl set has been so comfortable to use that I have been cutting my hair at home for the past few years. This set really, really does last that long.I have also tried a Conair clipper set and have been tremendously dissapointed with that one. Do not buy that if you are contemplating between Wahl and Conair....make sure you buy the Wahl instead. The Wahl gives you a clean cut that is very smooth, whereas the Conair feels like it's pulling your hair rather than cutting it. Also, the Wahl comes with many pieces and additions/attachments you can add to it or purchase from the Wahl site. I would recommend Wahl to all first-time users as well as those who have been cutting their own hair for ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a clipper?

But, it's getting on in years, so when this turned up in my gold box, I jumped on it.What a horrible mistake.These clippers simply don't clip. What they do is pull on the hair. They rip the hair out. They hurt! I wind up flinching with each pass as my wife cuts my hair. In the past, haircuts simply weren't a big deal. Now, we both dread them.My wife has to move so slowly with these clippers (so that the hair gets clipped and not yanked out) that what normally takes about 5 minutes now takes 20+.If you're looking for a good set of hair clippers, pass on these."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Hair Clipper","review":"I bought the Wahl's 15-piece haircutting kit recently.

I tried to adjust the blades to avoid this, and found that the white plastic piece that holds the second, inner blade was not installed at an angle, which made it impossible for the two blades to align.

It was \\"art\\"music that was accessible to a larger public, black and white, than jazz enjoys today. I believe that the demise of the black community and, of course, the promotional genius of the rock music industry were two factors which contributed to what's happening now in both jazz and contemporary black popular music.

True, these arias were recorded at different times, but taken together, it is incredible that one artist was capable of encompassing all of this diverse operatic music. True, the voice sometimes turned strident above the stave, but the artistry that Callas uses is so profound that it transcends any vocal misgivings one may have. Forget the negative reviews from these know-nothings. Callas was an amazing artist, and her still-potent popularity (in terms of record sales) are testimony enough to her greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain Trainer","review":"As with the muscles in your arms/legs/back, you think you're in pretty good shape until you spend a day in the garden.

It performed just as promised and made my BBQing experience that much more enjoyable. The beer and a nice day outside also helped. I was able to keep track of the progress of the meat and my fire/grill temp without getting out of my chair and without having to open my grill or fire box too often. By not loosing heat when you open your grill, it actually helps cut your cooking time and better maintain your grill temperature. These were the best butts I smoked thus far. This is definitely a great tool to add to your outdoor grillig/smoking supplies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"I purchased two Maverick thermometers. The older product I order last summer lasted 6 months. This product failed right out of the box. High temp reading on the food temp probe.

It is very interesting to find out about the stages that your brisket is going through while cooking. It goes to the 150's and stays there even though the fire is still hot. Finally it goes up again. You can really tell the difference in your meat if you let it cook to 190+. There is really no way to tell when it's ready without a thermometer, and with this one you are not having to put your hand in and out of the pit, and not letting your heat out, either.

My probes both burned out within a couple of days of each other after four months of use.Pros:- Great concept, and convenient if you're smoking anything large that may take several hours- Dual smoker and meat probes are handy to have in one unit- Easy to read LCDsCons:- You have to remove the back cover of the sending unit each time you need to turn it off/on- The range is quite poor, especially if your smoker is outside and you want to stay inside. I keep my smoker just outside my garage and I lose signal inside my house unless I keep the receiver on the counter right by my garage entrance, so the range is only about 25 to 30 feet.- The temp probes on my unit seem to be consistently high by 5 to 8 degrees compared to my smoker's digital temp probe and other manual thermometers.- Short lived"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I got one of these because I thought the idea was great. I occasionally do pork shoulder over night and have to get up every couple of hours to make sure the temperature on the smoker is holding steady.

On the company website it says the probe has either melted or has been severely pinched or immersed in water. MELTED????? What the hell gives?

The cost of a new probe after the 90 day limited warranty is $12.00 or $17.00 for \\"The NEW high heat probe wire is rated for 570 degrees to reduce accidental wire burn outs.\\" WHAT A NOVEL CONCEPT! The standard wire is rated for use to 410 degrees. I feel the high heat wire should be the standard and the wire probe should be more robust so as to not short out by the mere presence of water which you will need to clean the probe. The accuracy of the temperature is not spot on and you will need to adjust your cooking to compensate. That and the inconvenient on off switch makes this a one star product for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, poor quality","review":"I purchased this item to smoke my Thanksgiving turkey. The temperature reading on the smoke chamber was off by at least 10 degrees and therefor I regulated the smoking chamber at the incorrect temperature. Additionally, in the final hour of cooking, the reading from the meat probe malfunctioned and and the display began blinked on and off without any reading. I put in an old meat thermometer and discovered my turkey was slightly overdone. I was very upset about this as I had many family members over for dinner. The good news is that everyone enjoyed the turkey anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use on a grill","review":"I admit I purchased it to measure grill temperature and not smoker. Unfortunately, that means I cooked the probe, even though I didn't go over the specified tempertature. Maybe the end touched the grate or something.

At least I still have the food probe; and I got to get a good idea of how temperature relates to the gas settings bvefore it died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for what it is intended","review":"I'm upgrading my recommendation on this thermometer to a 3/4. I've used it in a offset smoker for multiple cuts of meat and it reads fine. It does have several shortcomings.The clips for the smoker probe are terrible. You will need to find an alternative to the metal clips to get a good reading. I've found a wood block works very well in my offset. Just don't use wood if you are grilling rather than smoking.It's range is also terrible. Line of sight works if there is nothing in between. It does not work at 25 feet through my sliding door, but worse yet does not tell you it is out of range. It just keeps showing the last temperature.Once you learn where to set the receiver because of the range issues it performs well. Given that there are no better alternatives with dual probes this is as good as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Range is only 10 feet!","review":"The thermometer and timer appear to work fine, but the range of the transmitter limits the receiver to about 10 feet. That makes the remote feature almost useless. First, I tried the batteries that come with the device; then I changed them for fresh new cells, suspecting the batteries were weak, but that didn't improve the transmission range. I gave the unit one star as a remote monitor.

So everytime you want to turn on or off your opening the whole case up. The \\"wireless\\" works for about 8 feet, not whatever it claims. So I had to be walking by my smoker for it to read, which took the whole point out of it. Also, the base unit would not turn off, so i basically had to remove the battery to just turn the system off.

My smoker is in almost a strait line with the window of my basement so this might of helped. But it worked great! I was a little disappointed in the lenght of the probe wires, 2ft. for the smoker and 3ft. for the meat. I did protect the probe wires with heat shrink tubing to help protect the leads from wear.

To turn the unit on you have to remove the battery cover. The cover for the batteries is poorly designed and is difficult to latch. The belt clip will not secure to the receiver unit. The default temperature is 176 degrees and the only way to lower the temperature is to go all the way up to about 390 and start over at 40 degrees or so. And be quick about it, if you hesitate for a few seonds it reverts back to the default of 176 degrees.

Unless you are going to use it like the picture on the box (your smoker right outside your window) I wouldn't recommend it.

The message on the answering machine came off like it was a machine left on a number that never attended to. Sure enough I never got a call back after 2 weeks of waiting. The unit sometimes transmits the temp. and other times it shows you the old temp. that has not changed for hours, but when you look at the transmitter you see that it's way off. I was not further than 20 feet from the transmitter ever.

The purpose of the wireless unit was to be able to monitor temps from inside, making this unit worthless to me. If you just need something to keep outside for temps, this works fine. I also agree with the other reviewers that complained about the design. The switch being inside the battery compartment on the transmitter (although I understand why for water resistance) is just plain dumb. It may sound picky, but opening that compartment up to turn it on and off and sync the units (which needed re synching several times during my smokes) was inconvenient. I will try the ET-7 in hopes that it has a better transmitter, otherwise I will have to pony up the extra $30 for the ET-732."},{"rating":"1","title":"bbq dud","review":"Very disappointing.

A couple things that I didn't like though were that there were a few times that the units lost communication from each other, the on/off switch on the meter is inside the battery compartment so you have to open it everytime to turn it off or on, and lastly, the battery compartment door has 2 gaskets that both fell out after only a couple of uses.

Shouldnt have to do that while everything else works just fine. In addition, the way Redi Chek designed the on/off switch in the battery compartment is idiotic to me. Really?

This band comes from Spain, but the lyrics are in english...but you can hardly understand them...still a sweet band for your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent General Introduction To Golf History/Etiquette/Culture","review":"This is an excellent primer for beginners and advanced. It covers all the aspects of golf to make you well informed about history, culture, rules, courses, etc.. DK Publishing is a British publisher. The Brits are masters of book making, design and illustration; and this book is reflective of this. It is very well written and illustrations are beautiful.

However these two stories are mostly sexual tension and some explicit scenes as well. Well, explicit for this author's standards. The second story in particular, I am not sure why the heroine was attracted to the hero in the first place. She suspects him of cheating on the auction bid making her company lose millions, thinks he is a pervert seeing that he carries a porno magazine when he is on a business trip, yet the same day she met him, she has dinner with him. Spencer must have tried writing regular HQ type romances before finding her niche.

The only difference in between the original \\"xfps 360\\" and the \\"xfps 360 pro\\" is the color, and the x,y sensitivity adjustments. The deadzone is the same, and really upsets me. Incase u don't know what i mean by \\"deadzone\\".... when i try to sharpshoot a small target, the little minute adjustments of the mouse are not recognized.

For the most part I think shes gonna love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy for my artistic daughter","review":"This was a gift for my daughter's 7th Birthday - she saw it in the crafts store and asked specifically to have this as her present. She enjoys coloring this horse, showing it to the family and then waiting for laundry time to wash everything away and start over.Initially I was concerned about durability of this toy based on reviews. However, it survived at least 3 washes in our laundry machine at regular settings - colors wash out almost ideally (small tint of red could be found along the stitches sometimes), the toy looks almost new. We use air dry instead of the dryer since we do not want to try our luck with possibility of melting toy's fabric. The only thing that broke almost immediately is one of the horse's purple fleece lines (sorry, forget the right name of that part) - this material is easy to stretch and to break. We have fixed it with tread and needle.Overall, good toy with quality corresponding to the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"i bought this as a christmas present for my four year old daughter and was very disappointed when it came.

It does not give any information on how to check out your psychic abilities or any information on how to develop your abilities. It is just a collection of anecdotes (and not very interesting ones either). The format is that of an overview on the subject. I could have written it better myself.

The plot was riveting and kept my interest. The characters were not portrayed as stereotypical lesbians, which was a nice change from other novels that I have read. This is a definite change of pace from the Anna Pigeon mysteries I have become used to reading by this author. Sarah and Imogene were great characters. I only have one criticism. Toward the end of the novel, I was flipping to see if I had read something wrong, due to the author's use of pronouns and the name switch that occurred. Overall a great depiction of two women who knew their own strength and used it to their advantage! The scenery was vividly described and the characters well-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 words - depressing! depressing! depressing!","review":"Well written, but tragedy filled and depressing with no emotional or romantic payoffs!You are right there with the characters through every tragic event that besets them but you feel as though all the moments of joy, emotional closeness or romance all happen in between chapters in a world you the reader are not invited to share in - it is only eluded to in between tragedies.I really wanted to love this book but but instead felt kind of mad and cheated by the end of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone get me a gun...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all of Ms. Barr's other works of fiction, but good Lord, this book was depressing.

I also think if Barr wanted she could meake a second book about the lover that has become strong over the years, and where it could lead to a new life with all she has learned. I have a friend who has a family rance in NV and to go from one house to another is 28 miles on dirt roads, dusty, windy,and craggy. I could just picture the coundtry Barr discribed.

It is amazing how well it has aged. The suspense is palpable during the actual bomb disarming sequences. Plenty of neat details on the process, and a lot of good character development as well. Another reviewer noted a somewhat soap opera quality to the included love story and while that is a point, it does serve to develop the characters more so that you care what happens to them. That said, those aspects of the show do run a bit long especially in later episodes. I also think that the 'feel' of the show changed in the last few episodes with less cohesion among the main characters, something which is a bit of a let-down. Overall, though, this is certainly one of the best pieces of television made, in my opinion.

The film takes you through the arrival, exercises and finalistion of Operation Red Flag. It depicts all the details that the fighter pilots go through during the exercise by using spectacular shots from the air and from the cockpits of the pilots themselves.

From the moment they scrambled all the planes inside of ten heart-pounding minutes to the moment that the last plane was refueled for its return to base, I was agog.

Essentially what was going on was a camera mounted on some type of flying object, then the overlay was placed over the footage. I can safely say this because I was professionally trained as a computer animator. Also, many of the explosions on the ground seemed to be faked. As the other person above stated, it's pretty much a flare dropping festival.I was bored....I would spend your money on a different film, as I would rather watch Iron Eagle from the 80s than this.I have a feeling that used copy of this movie is going to go on an auction site soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this item","review":"it's a documentary about the career of 2 fighter pilot, not many time in the air but a lot of time on the ground to speak with the pilots"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighter Pilot: Operation red flay","review":"This is a super movie. we love it, and use it for demonstratons to sell speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cool glory pilot flick","review":"I liked the power and technology.

I would much rather have seen real strafing and bombing runs from a distance then fake explosions from close. Other things, such as the AWACS scene, look fake too. I have been in the E-3 sentry and know the screens they showed are completely fake. The real plane doesn't look like that at all. There are also some scenes were cockpits somehow instantly change variants. Like in a few scenes, the views kept changing from an F-15C to an F-15E.

I have to eject and re-insert several times before my PAL setup will accept the video. Consequently I have again ordered the DVD in PAL format from an Australian supplier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful movie!!!","review":"From all the movies Andrei Konchalovsky made (including in Russia before and after his American journey) this one is definitely the best. I wonder how much it's due to the script by Akira Kurosawa but in the end a powerful saga about freedom and fate was created. The story is about two convicts running away from the prison but is much more than that. It is full of symbolics. The movie is made in 1985 but it's as watchable today as probably 18 years ago. Jon Voight is phenomenal and Eric Roberts is also very very good. The rest of the cast is not on the same level (especially John P. Ryan, who plays Jon Voight protagonist) but it's probably not that's important. The cinematography is amasing. The scenes of running train in Alaska wilderness are breathtaking.

The story is about two men (Jon Voight and Eric Roberts) who escape from an Alaska prison, and try to stop an out-of-control train in the middle of winter, all the while being chased by a vindictive warden. This harrowing and adrenalin inducing film touches on one man's indomitable spirit to regain his freedom even if it may mean his death.The dvd is a rather low resolution, and unmastered film, with instances of dust, but the rough quality of the film perhaps enhances the gritty nature of the story.

Suspense builds as railroad personnel try to figure out a way to stop it (the conductor is dead from a heart attack), or at least divert other trains along the line away from it. Meanwhile prison warden John P. Ryan is determined to get aboard the train to stop Voight before he (Voight) becomes a hero to his prison mates back in Alaska. A lot in the picture doesn't make sense, such as why the train, which is barreling along at 90 mph, doesn't simply derail after plowing through snowdrifts and crashing into the caboose of a sidetracked train. The script seems as out of control as the train itself. But it IS suspenseful, and Voight's character is truly a dangerous psychopath - and he plays it to the hilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geographic problem","review":"Received DVD but it was not designed for US players.

It ain't something where you're going to jot down what year that Elco is, or be outraged that the consist is put together incorrectly. It's just intense, and thrilling.Our anti-hero, Jon Voight, is a very nasty con, and chews the scenery with the best of them here. His co-escapee, Eric Roberts, will usually turn me off to any film he infests, but he's actually the comic relief, with his whining and bitching, and hare-lipped enunciation. Rebecca de Mornay(as a young railway worker caught on the train)actually has dirt all over her face, keeps her clothes on, and gets pushed to limits we've only seen her approach inThe Hand That Rocks the Cradle.Runaway Trainis just an exciting ride, and not a movie for just kicking back and relaxing to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voight = realistic con","review":"Though the railroad headquarters scenes could've been a little less corny, the characters were spot-on believable.

When my youngest daughter first watched it, I made the mistake of voicing my own version of what Benji, lost in the wild, might be thinking, such as \\"Oh [...]! That's the biggest damn cat I ever saw!\\" This cracked Bianca up (she was only eight or so) and she made me do constant dialogue for all the animals for the rest of the movie, and for each subsequent viewing. After about four times through it over six months, I was tapped out of ideas, and she moved on to movies for which I did not have to create spontaneous scripts.

The viewer has to suffer through 90 minutes of Benji the dog and his animal friends mating and playing in the woods, complete with some terrible '80s synthesizer music and repetitive nature scenes. Almost no dialogue or action occurs during the film. There are only three major human actors in it, and they are on-screen for about 5 to 10 minutes. Man, is this movie deadly! No wonder it got ignored by the public, and shame on Disney for releasing such a flat-out boring movie like this back in the late '80s.

But this album is snlow and full of synthesizers and reverb, like a weird techno-trip back to the eighties. It's the music you might hear in a soundtrack of a corny after school special. The good stuff is buried too deep to find here."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is some serious crap on this O'Connor album - And I'm serious about this","review":"I mean when a musician of Mark's (local) stature tries to out-Rieu Andre Rieu or out-Tesh John Tesh you have to take him seriously.To Mark's disclosure credit, he doesn't try to hide IT - the crapola that is - preferring to slather it like peanut butter & jelly on the last sandwich before starvation. From the very first track he puts it all out there - the Tesh patchouli live at Red Rocks - replete with fast synths and keyboards.MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE TO MARKY MARK: Hope that paid some serious, serious rent/bills.

The influence of her simple but praying mother on her life. It is funny,a book that many people will be able to relate to. It is encouraging to see how God has used this young woman, given her a Godly husband and blessed them with two children. If you need hope, read this book. It is a simply written book about one young woman's life out of and in a wheelchair.

The selection looked fun -- a lot of recognizable summer party songs with the steel drum flair. But then I bought it and actually listened to it. The steel drum parts are really good; however, the synthesized accompaniment is over powering and really cheesy (it sounds like it should be on Barney). Please, save your money and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Good Turn...","review":"AURA by Carlos Fuentes, translated by Lysander Kemp, is a short read that I found wonderful and highly recommend. My Spanish is only mediocre so I was only able to take small advantage of the parallel text format. The plot has been reviewed by others, my only comment on the lists of comparisons, is to add Henry James' TURN OF THE SCREW that I kept thinking of while reading AURA. To those interested in gothic romance, I believe this novella represents the epitome."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the translation, not the Novel itself","review":"A key element in Fuentes' novel is the manner in which it's written: second person all throughout, mixing future and past sense, and thusly creating the imagery he wishes to portray. The novel (for its literary merit) is great; any one who appreciates literature (versus entertainment) will enjoy it. However, I want to make a note that the English translation is not the best.This version is ideal for those who know Spanish, but whose vocabulary will fail them sporadically--allowing for a quick glance at the translation. If, however, you wish to read only its English version, look elsewhere. The translator misses the literary focus of the author, who employs short phrases, interweaving past and present tenses. Given that the importance of this novel is due to its literary features--which together with plot create the message the author wants to make--much is lost with this translation that does not do justice to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you on your toes!","review":"Fuentes keeps the reader close to the climax threshold and maintains to do it until the story wraps up.

My favorite part is when the main character meets the girl that he falls in love with. I think every person should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master in his genre...","review":"Aura falls into a genre that is called, \\"magical realism.\\" After reading this captivating story, you will see why. Fuentes is a master at his craft. His story is layered with symbolism and can be understood better by having a knowledge of Mexican history. However, it's a great read for anyone interested in fine literary fiction. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very Faulkner-like story","review":"Wow! That was my reaction after I read the story for a class in college. Then, After only a month or so, we had to read \\"A Rose for Emily\\", by William Faulkner. Both stories are very similar in their central idea. My favorite of the two? Carlos Fuentes wins because he mastered the gothicism and the magical realism, and ultimately created a delightful blend. Wonderful story for a rainy day. Maybe if we look outside we will see a garden with burning felines...maybe not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird","review":"Aura is a strange work by Carlos Fuentes that incorporates realism and magic, brujeria (witchcraft) and religion, and linear and cyclical time. Good book to read if you know a fair amount of Spanish.The descriptive setting cannot get much better; Fuentes keeps the reader guessing from chapter to chapter. Although it was written by a Mexican author, this novella can be appreciated and understood by a global audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky!","review":"A perfect introduction to Latin American writing!

He is without a doubt the most talentless, the most uninteresting, the most humorless tertiary affiliate of the music scene, a man comfortable neither in the world of progressive rock (he has no rhythm, no chops, no ear) nor that of serious, i.e., classical music (he has no understanding of composition--I doubt he even knows how the circle of five works). It really doesn't matter how many guitarists he's got for this particular recording. They all sound terrible because the music Braca \\"wrote\\" is terrible. Just one monotonous strum on all six strings after another, with no rhyme or reason.

And you'll have more fun listening to the result taped on your beat-up radio afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute sh*t","review":"I've heard so many people tout Glenn Branca as the single most important artist in the past 2 decades. That's a pretty loft claim to live up to. Laughably, he falls ENTIRELY short. This is amassed, dissonant (\\"out-of-tune\\" would be the more appropriate phrase here), amusical GARBAGE. What Branca has composed here is utter crap, and the crappiness of the music itself is only augmented by the musicians involved with performing it, in particular, Stephan Wiscerth's awful drumming. I understand that Thurston Moore, Lee Renaldo, Michael Gira, and (less importantly) Page Hamilton have all played with him, but do not let that fool you -- Branca's music is completely unredeeming, humorless, and pretentious to the point of ridiculousness.

I film live bands. I eventually bought a firewire card and firewire ...problem solved. The Dazzle does nothing for me but the Pinnacle software that came with it is what I still use to do the transfer of video.

The book covers Loeb's acquisition of the paper, its mismanagement, his adulterous affair with Scripps-Howard heiress Nackey Gallowhur, and the use of the paper for their personal vendettas. Sadly it's a little outdated since William died c. 1980 and it doesn't cover Nackey's involvement of the paper in Pat Buchanan's presidential campaigns in the 1990's.

You can piece together what is going on, but it's painful. This isn't to say that the story isn't good, it's that the storyTELLING is terrible. A ham-fisted, amateurish attempt at movie making. Bruce Lee's \\"Fists of Fury\\" (as an example) is a superior movie simply for managing to present its plot in a half-way coherent manner, and it's so much older.If all you care about is the Kung Fu action, this movie has it in spades. If you are at all concerned with what holds the fights together, you may want to rent this before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese legend... played by a Chinese legend","review":"this is one of Jet Li's first staring role and the role that made him an icon of Chinese cinema. This has some great fight sequences and raised the bar for every martial artist movie that followed. Jet plays Wong Fei-Hong who is revered as one of the most powerful icons of the this era in China. He is the Chinese Wyatt Earp and is beloved in china. Many movies have been made featuring this martial artist legend ( and featuring Wong Fei-Hong father) This is also the beginning of a huge martial arts franchise, the panicle is Part 2 where Li fights Kung Fu legend Donnie Yen. this is a must for your martial arts movie collection and serves as the beginning of many great film by Jet Li."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Bad dubbing. BAD BAD DUBBING.","review":"I've seen this movie dubbed before, but I don't think it was quite this bad. If it's possible to find a version with subtitles, go with that! Also, I just read in another review that this version is probably missing about 30 minutes of footage.As for the movie itself, it's amazing. Jet Li is gracefully fierce. The choreography is so good, it has been copied a million times by now. There's action, humor, and a (romantic) charm that never makes you want to vomit. THANK GOD. There's NO need for that in a kung fu movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, bad DVD.","review":"The quality of this release is pretty poor for such a classic (four or five star) HK film.

If you want to learn little more than incorrect info about a film, listen to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true HK classic","review":"Once Upon A Time In China is a true landmark in Hong Kong film industry and also Jet Li's best film. It features some of the best Martial arts action ever seen onscreen. The fight between Wong Fei Hung(Jet Li) and Yim Chan Tung is truly amazing and at times surpassing any of Jackie Chan's movies. The film itself has a strong plot and could hold up against some of the best dramas in Hollywood. A for the DVD itself, picture is O.K for a film that is shot 10 years back and it includes trailers and some of Kwan Tak Hing's fight scenes(the 60s' Wong Fei Hung). There's even a booklet surrounding the real person and the actors who potrays him. In the audio department, it's a little dissapointing as some of the sounds sound a bit muffled. Overall this deserves to be in your collection because this is one movie you cannot miss at any cost. Purchase it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beginning to a saga","review":"Once Upon a Time in China is a great introduction to the series. It is an introduction to the main characters and the story line. Jet Li stars as The peaceful medicine Wong. His skills are known in the Mainland area. The story talks of how peace is the ultimate goal, but sometimes we all must fight a war to find the other side where peace lays. The fighting scenes are well done and though sometimes have a bit of randomness, believe me, there is a plot. The semi-negative portrayel of American's can be equaled to the portrayal of Russians in James Bond Films... Definitely a must buy along with the other films in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly mess","review":"Alright, I'll confess to a slight infatuation with Jet Li, but even that did not make this movie more than passable. The plot is all over the place. It barely made sense - characters would suddenly arrive, locations would develop and then nothing would come of them. The bad guys were just silly - I like real malice and evil in my badies, I like to hate them and enjoy their come uppance. Well the silly twisted bad boy was just pathetic, and Jet Li, ever serene, was so far above the whole mess, so detached and lovely, just going through a very routine job of being Jet Li. The evil imperialist Yankees plotting to capture unsuspecting Chinese immigrants and enslave them were cartoon cuts outs.Like every other enthusiast of this genre I enjoy the carefully choreographed fights and they were good, but not good enough to redeem this film. Give me Kung Fu Hustle any time - now there is quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tsui Hark's masterpiece?","review":"After reading several reviews for the movie, I was compelled to see what the hype was all about. Unfortunately, what others may perceive as Hark's masterpiece epic, I only see as a mediocre film. It seems as if Hark couldn't focus what he wanted the film to be. He took stabs at action, adventure, comedy, and romance, but unfortunatly failed to do a quality job on any of those aspects.If you're an action junkie and looking for a Jet Li martial arts flick, you better turn elsewhere. The few interesting fights are done well, but the film relies on a historical plot as it's backbone. For me, the storyline was sleep-inducing, but I suppose it depends on personal preference.Yuen Biao's comedic performance, and the battle during the end keep this movie above a 1-star rating. Admittingly, I'm not a big fan of Hark, but I'm no detractor of his either. This movie just failed to inspire any interest out of this disappointed viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking. This is not a movie you want.","review":"I've seen several martial arts movies. I used to wince at wire work, but flying monks plays a part in old mythology.Jet is always a draw for me, but what a let down this is.The camera work is poor, the characters are beyond sterotype, the fight scenes are okay, but just okay.If you really need to see this movie... rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I have recently become interested in chinese history, and have taken to seeing movies that may (even loosely) be based on chinese history. Martial arts is merely an extra benefit. After reading many good reviews on this film I wanted to buy it, but only the Mandarin 5.1 version. The cost, however, led me to rent it first. Thankfuly, I did! While it was the dubbed version, and not the original Mandarin, this was still just a very bad movie. The martial arts lacked, the acting was poor, and it seemed to me to just show the chinese in a rather poor light. I recommend The Emporer and the Assassin and definetly Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Save your money and just rent this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe next time that could make a movie with more politics.","review":"I found this movie to be the most boring and completly political. It isn't a movie at all, it is nothing short of propaganda and not even particully clever. The plot is weak, the acting atrocious. Even Jet Li whose martial arts prowess is pretty amazing does hardly anything. The movie does justice to no one. It makes every non-chinese appear evil and it makes the Chinese look easily lead and stupid. Which isn't the case. For being considered a Hong Kong classic I was very dissappointed. There are many other Jet Li films out there that are far better than this one. Black mask still being my favorite. If you want good action look to other Jet Li films, Jacki Chan or Chow Fat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep.","review":"Despite the martial arts filled story, the movies best scenes are of portrayal of Chinese persecution. It portrayed the hard choices that had to be made to respect your leadership or to follow your need to make it right. In the end, movie is not amazing in contrast to the next Once Upon a Time in China 2, but it is a good movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Upon a Time in China #1","review":"An Incredible kung fu movie!

This is hands down one of the worst martial arts movie of all time and these words are coming from a HUGE Jet Li fan.

Yuen Biao's character was dumb. The fight scenes were so so.The final fight with the big boss was way too long. It was over kill, that scene was either over edited or way under-edited. The movie gave me bad memories, i kept having flash backs about the part where Fei Hong's 13 aunt was about to be rapped. The only good OUATIC was the third one with the fu dog and dragon dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Upon A Time In China","review":"The reason I got this movie is because it received good reviews. After watching, I was very disappointed. If you'd paid close attention, Jet Li didn't perform much of the fighting sequences. It's some stunt guy doing all the fighting. Li only posed for the camera when the action had passed.Stick to Jackie Chan movies. He does all his own fighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn. Stupid Movie.","review":"I rented this movie after reading a number of reviewers who favorably compared it to Crouching Tiger. I'm a big Kung-Fu movie fan, but this movie was horrible! I read a lot about the historical value of all of this, but the main thing is this movie is boring. I found the fight scenes unoriginal, dull, and sometimes very fake looking (people flying across the room after barely being touched). The plot is dull, the characters are a farce. The movie doesn't know if it's a comedy or an action movie and ends up being neither. Don't waste your time.

After renewing the book three times from the library and studying nearly every page, I am now purchasing it as a reference. (Yes, I have PSP 9, but 8 and 9 are similar enough to justify purchase.)

One arrived with a small tear, but I was able to repair it with the small patches that were supplied in the box. No biggy I can live with an imperfect mat. Well I wished I would have returned all four. On the first camp out my pad went flat and I noticed the edge along the side had seperated. I am not a heavy guy, I weigh 175 lbs. Later my daughter's mat failed at the bottom edge. She is about 80 lbs. At first glance the mats look high quality, but I think they are poorly designed or poorly manufactured. The edges are glued or heat sealed or something? Either way, I have no confidence in this product, and believe a simple hard foam mat would be cheaper and work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pad leaks, don't buy","review":"I bought 2 of these for my wife and me and now they both leak.

That was a mistake! I used it twice before the seam on one side came unglued. I repaired the seam at the leak but then additional leaks started at different locations in the seam. I guess if I would've re-glued the entire seam it might have been okay. If Wenger would use better glue on the seams this would be a decent pad because its nice and thick.

There are plenty of samplers out there from these recordings, any of which would be more musical and more exciting than this.Try Karajan if you want beautiful and thrilling music, Solti if you want to test your car stereo, and Bohm if you like the excitement of a live recording.

The probelems are these:1) While the initial exercises are fairly easy to read, later in the book when the toms begin to be incorporated it actually becomes more confusing than traditional notation would be.2) The use of a non standard staff reinforces the notion that percussion instruments are not to be taken seriously, and that drummers don't really need to learn to read.3) Someone who begins in this book with no prior experience will have a hard time moving to other texts which do use traditional notation.4) Someone with previous experience and with properly taught reading skills tend to find the non-standard format annoying if not confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect book for anyone learning drums","review":"This book is a must have for anyone wishing to learn drums.

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolaroo does the job","review":"We bought two(2) of the Large Coolaroo beds so each of our Labs would have a comfortable place to lay down while in the kennel. So much better than old dogs laying on concrete. It keeps them off the ground and away from crawling insects. My only complaint is that the cover appears as if it may be vulnerable to tearing or rather running if on eof the dogs toenails hooks into it. The upside is that replacement covers are less than $20 here on Amazon and look to be super easy to replace/install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, good bed for outdoors","review":"I have a 135 lb Mastiff and I bought the largest size. She fits on it (barely!) but doesn't seem to find it very comfortable. I think it freaks her out a little that she's suspended. The construction is fine, the price was fantastic, and it's very easy to clean. Maybe if she didn't weigh so much she'd find it more comforting. She does sleep on it but if I bring it in the house she sleeps on the floor instead of the bed, so I know it's not her favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What My Dog Wanted!","review":"My Golden Retriever loves his Coolaroo. I purchased the large green Coolaroo; green only because it was cheaper @ the time of purchase but I actually like the green (its like a hunter/forest green.) My dog was hesitant at first trying to figure out the contraption but now he just walks on there and goes to sleep. I like how the Coolaroo is able to be used inside as well as outside. Its pretty easy to move as well, not weighing more than 8 pounds or so. However, you may have to adjust the screws from time to time because they become loose but a quick half-turn on each side fixes that. Overall, great product and would definitely purchase again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is the second Coolaroo Bed I purchased. This is very well built and easy to put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog doesn't like","review":"I bought this hoping it would be a great outdoor bed for my two dogs. As it turns lout, neither of my dogs like the bed and refuse to go on it. I can't really blame them, since the material is very scratchy feeling and rough. Perhaps they would use this bed if I put a blanket on top. I would recommend the manufacturer pick a different material, or no one should buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolaroo Bed","review":"Great bed - well designed, good price, very easy to set up, light weight, and convenient to move around.

Our Lab would like it better if our feet were on it too. He does lay on it when we aren't around but he really enjoys jumping on it with his toys. It is easy to clean mud off the bed with a hose. I would buy it again. I might buy a second one for the house but I doubt it will keep the dog off of the couch and our laps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old dog, No new tricks","review":"I bought this bed for my 13 yr-old Border Collie/Lab Mix (50lbs)who has metabolism issues that make her always too warm. I was trying to kill two birds with one bed... help tired old bones and keep her cool. She had no objection to getting on the bed when I promoted it... but she would never sleep on it. After a couple of weeks, decided it was no go. I rated it 4 stars because I thought it was well-made; and, after reading other reviews, had no problem with assembly. Was concerned it might be too small for her but think it was just right.

It is definately a little tricky to put together it almost seems like the pieces are the wrong size, then I brought up a previous review and what do you know i was able to put it together with the tips they give (thank you so much for that) My 90 lb lab already loves this and he has plenty of room. I can't wait to take it camping, he always thinks he needs to sit on my lab or chair so I think this will be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Cot","review":"Bought this for my Doberman. While it's sturdy enough the fabric is more mesh than expected. It says knit and had a closer to canvas look to me in the pics. If you have a young dog that likes to bite and chew it may not hold up. One snip at the cot put a hole in it. If you don't have a chewer you'll be fine. My Dobe weighs 80lbs and supports him just fine. Great for place training or just his own place to lounge."},{"rating":"2","title":"coolaroo dog bed","review":"My dogs love these beds! the two old dogs spend most of their lives on them.

The Coolaroo seems to be very sturdy and should last for many years. It's meant for outside but, living in AZ, we don't leave our dogs out.

Good price!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"falls apart when you move it","review":"I followed the instructions and put the bed together fine. There are no screws to actually hold the frame in place so when I pick it up to move it, the entire thing falls apart. Am I missing something or do I have a faulty bed? It makes no sense that you can only leave it in one spot. Shouldn't there be some kind of bolts that hold the frame together? Some of the pieces just slide into each other but not tightly and it would seem like they should be bolted together but there were no other holes and no bolts. Just a few screws in some of the parts but then the others just slide into each other but then slide back out if you move it. Surely this isn't the way it's supposed to be or my dog would collapse by laying on it?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice item","review":"I ordered three of these beds for our 3 dogs. I ordered size large which were bigger than I thought they would be, which was fine. Our dogs are between 35-50lbs and the beds can easily fit both of them, which is good because of cource when one is on one bed the other one has to also be on the same bed.They were fairly easy to put together. I took one star away because our pup chewed through it after just 3 days. He eats everything so I am not surprised this happened. If you are a dog owner who has well behaved dogs who don't eat everything these are a great deal. Good thing we have 3 of them because I am not sure there are going to last with a \\"monster puppy\\" in the house. Good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"coolaroo pet bed review","review":"The fabric part of the product sags, it seems stretched out, not tight - like a prevous coolaroo that I had. When my dog is on this coolaroo, the center of it is an inch from the ground! This coolaroo was \\"on sale\\". So maybe the \\"sale\\" on coolaroos is due to decreased quality since my last one, or maybe the \\"sale\\" coolaroos are returned items, or the company has surplus to unload.

I was hesitant when I read that you need two people to put them together. Not true, the first one was more challenging but after getting the hang of it, I put the second one together in 5 minutes.My dogs love them. The older dog is very comfortable. These are perfect for summer and winter. They are light, easy to move around and very easy to clean. They probably wouldn't hold up if they were treated roughly but the dogs dont do that as they are adult dogs and not puppies.These are great beds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"The Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed is well built and suites my needs well. I was looking for an elevated, resting area for my Golden Retriever. I wanted something that I could leave out on the back patio for her to lay on when playing outside or to dry off on after swimming in the pool. The product has held up well so far (albeit its only 3 weeks old) with no signs of rust or wear. My dog does use it occasionally when she is wet but seems to preffer the floor right next to it when she is dry. The product takes up more space than I though it would. I bought the large size based on pictures of similar breeds of dogs on the bed, but I think the medium would have been fine also.I think it was worth the money and because replacement parts are available, I'm sure I will get a long life out of it. I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleep is wonderful","review":"My large labs both love this bed.

I told hubby that he would have to work to get the bed on the frame and mentioned the tips I saw in the reviews. When he put it together and it went on easily and felt slightly loose I should have realized there was something wrong with it. After a week it sagged low enough that it touches the floor in the center when my dog lays on it. He still uses it and by July it had a 2 inch diameter hole in it. I'm not really impressed with this product but honestly think I just got a defective bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a stronger material, dissappointed","review":"Very easy to assemble, I ordered the Large Bed and it is plenty big for my very large Catahula Leopard Dog, and Bull Dog. It did not hold up to my puppy chewing Catahula, as the first thing he went for was the label, had it for one night and he chewed it loose. I bought 2 Large ones, I will not more, until they improve the material. I'm thinking a mesh like a trampoline. in thickness. I had such high hopes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"I ordered this bed for my female bullmastiff as the tiles on the floor can't be that comfortable.

Annoying but these things happen. I called the manufacturer and they just wanted my address. A week later the screws arrived.

The mesh bottom is strongly built and can stand a beating. My dog jumps, runs over, and of course sleeps on his bed and it has yet to show any signs of wear on it and I have had it for months. The only thing that is noticeable is that it sags, but it still downy touch the ground.It is big enough for him to stretch out on and more even big enough when he curls up on it. And as it is very easy to move around, clean, and put outdoors you really cant go wrong.

But, not funny. I was so exasperated trying to get that last end to cooperate without twisting. Finally got it together, though not as satisfactorily as I would like, and hoped she would like it. I tried it outdoors, indoors, outdoor shaded area, indoors with her bed on it, and she doesn't care for it at all.Ah well..shucks.

It wasn't chewed, it just ripped due to poor quality. It is unrepairable. The size is supposed to accomodate Rottweilers, German Sheperds, Dobermanns, etc. I have an American Bulldog (appx. 100 lbs.) According to the breed class, it should have accomadated him easily. Product fell considerably short of its' expectations; this isn't even good enough to be called junk.

It stays outside because that's where he wants to be most of the time. It helps keep him clean (he's mostly white) and keeps him from bringing in all the dirt, leaves, sticks, etc that love to stick to his furry body when he lays on the ground. This is his second Colaroo bed. The first one lasted for 3 years - outside in the Florida weather 24/7"},{"rating":"2","title":"dog loves it","review":"he sleeps on it whenever he can its either on the porch or in the backyard depending on the season. probably going to get another so i dont have to move it around. i had a problem putting it together cause i rushed thru it. when i slowed down it went together easy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep.

I just throw her light blanket over for more comfort. I had tried everything else & was desperate for something that is not only large enough for her but also easy to clean. She had been sneaking onto the sofa after I went to bed and sometimes has accidents when she's sleeping. Problem solved."},{"rating":"2","title":"dog is ok with it....nicely made","review":"Got this for the summer....my dog was a little timid but we encouraged her with biscuits to go on it.

Just wish our dog was more apt to get on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw Away; Metal Bent easily","review":"I purchased this bed for my husky as I live in Saudi Arabia and was concerned about him having a cool place to rest. The bed was of good quality (though as others have written, it was a bit challenging to put together effectively). My 60 pound husky bent the metal within 20 minutes and wouldn't sit on it after. I ended up throwing away; he never used it.One perk--my dog chews EVERYTHING, and he didn't tear at the fabric on this bed. Perhaps with a less agressive dog this will be a better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slippery","review":"I like the notion of this dog bed, but the plasticky mesh material is too slippery for my German shepherds. I understand that to have a mesh that will let water and air through (which it does) some compromises must be made, but none of my 3 GSDs will get on it voluntarily because their feet slide around, esp their rear feet. When I ask them to get on it (only one at a time!) and they lie down, they seem comfortable enough. I've put a soft fabric dog bed on top of the mesh and that makes it less slippery, but the point of this bed for us was to leave it outside on the deck in the rain. Adding a top bed defeats that purpose.Didn't have any trouble assembling thanks to other reviews that mention leaving slack in bolts and letting it rack.The cadet blue I ordered appears similar to the color I see on product description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - my dogs love it!","review":"Amon & Lexi (my dogs) just love these beds.

We use it inside and put a small blanket on it. The cover alone seemed a little rough. I love it because I can vac all around and under it, instead of having to move the dog bed every time I vac. I rated it a four star because it arrived with missing parts. I called the factory and they immediately sent the part to me. It was just a matter of having to wait the extra week. It does take up quit a bit of room, but hey, it's a large bed for large dogs. I had no big problem putting it together and so far see no bending of the frame, possibly a slight sag in the material although the dogs are still elevated off the floor even when both of them are on the bed at the same time. And I don't foresee the material stretching any further. For the price and even much more, I don't think you can get a better bed. We have placed an order or another, the dogs are tired of sharing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Dogs","review":"After two years of cleaning dog beds..washing washing ugh...these cots are the perfect answer..our dogs love them..just hose off once a week sweep all gunk that goes thru the cover onto the floor...Initially I ordered 3..one came with defective stitching...the company sent a new one right away...great customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice easy clean bed","review":"The bed was easy for me to put together. I have an old dog (rot/lab 70 lbs)that likes to stretch out and it gives her plenty of room. It is easy to keep clean. The only issue is that the fabric is a little bit slippery and she hesitated a bit. I put a light weight sheet and now she is on it all the time. She seems to like it better than her other \\"stuffed\\" dog bed. I think it is easier on her old joints as it has a little bit of \\"give\\" to it. Plus it raises her up a bit and she can peek in the window better. I would not hesitate buying again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our dogs love this bed!","review":"This dog bed is a hit!

Our cats sleep on it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps him off my bed","review":"Worth the money overall. They work fine for leaving in one space but I worry that because I put them down at night and then up during the day that the screws that put them together will loosen up. I guess that's what screwdrivers are for though. All in all a fantastic bed at a bargain price. I have three dogs that I bought two of these beds for. I have a very large 65 lb. Labrador and two medium cats. The Lab sleeps on one and the two medium cats sleep on the other one. They are suprisingly large beds and my dog and cats are content to lay on them. The great thing is how washable they are, just drag them into the back yard and hose them off. I had a naughty cat that was peeing on the plush cushiony dog beds I had before and he seems to have no desire to pee on these beds thank goodness. The only thing I would change is to make the beds a bit more nicely put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"large dog","review":"Owned two of these, same problem with both.

My English Bulldog loves sunbathing on this! It's a little hard to put together, you will need some help as the legs like to rotate so it's unlevel. Sturdy enough for my dog. She's 55 lbs. The material appears that it will be durable and last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raised dog bed","review":"We have been looking for a raised dog bed for quite some time and can not find them in stores. I found this one on Amazon and it was reasonably priced and FREE shipping. I received it within 2 days. Our dog likes his new bed; I am hoping it may keep him off our couch, where it is raised it is more like the \\"people furniture\\".He is a large dog 90+ pounds and the large bed is plenty big enough for him. You do need some space for this because it is 51\\" long and 43\\" wide. This bed is of excellent quality; much more than expected, especially for the lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolaroo Pet Bet","review":"I ordered the large size Coolaroo Pet Bed for our 7 month old Lab/Boarder Collie Mix. Took him a day or two to accept it, but since then loves to lay on it.It wasn't too difficult to put together, but a second person to hold one side down while the other side is put together is recommended.Seems sturdy enough - our dog is about 45 pounds right now and he leaps on it with all his weight repeatedly throughout the day.If your dog is a puppy or a chewer, you may want to supervise him/her. One corner of our bed cover is slightly chewed through and I have since ordered a back up cover. However, I think he did this on accident and hasn't shown any other signs of chewing on it (and he is a big chewer).Overall, I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for this type of elevated bed. It's a great price and a sturdy product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The dogs bed arrived a week ago and has served both my GSD's well. I have a puppy and a 3 year old and so far, they are enjoying it. It was fairly easy to set up. It arrived when expected and appears to be well constructed. It is a good alternative to the traditional pet beds that sit on the floor. I purchased this bed because I like the idea of being able to hose it off and its pest prevention. I would definately recommend this cot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chewing Dog Owners - Beware!","review":"Coolaroo Medium Pet Bed 3' x 2' green with black frame 317270It's not as durable as I had hoped for. My basset and my beagle absolutely loved lying on it, but my beagle loved it more as a new chew toy. It didn't last a month. I did discipline him when I caught him chewing on it and I sprayed it with Apple Bitter (dog chewing deterrent spray), which did not preserve the life of the Pet Bed. Also, I tried to register the warranty on-line that proved frustrating and unsuccessful. Now I will try to order a re-placement fabric and pray this time around I get lucky with the ordering through the company and with my destructive beagle."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not recommend","review":"I bought two of these beds thinking they would be great for my dogs. They worked great for about a month. After a month, that's when all the problems started to happen. First I noticed tiny holes started to show up from my dogs getting on and off of the bed. I assume it's from their nails. I trim my dogs nails and they're not long at all so it shouldnt be doing that. Then, The bars started to bend. I bought the right size for my dogs weight so it should'nt be doing that either. The screws came loose constaintly and I always had to tighten them atleast a few times a week. Then the cover started to stretch so the holes got bigger and at this point when my dogs lay on it, there laying on the floor. I am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it at all. This product was obviously made cheap, and was a waiste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at All Durable","review":"These beds come at a great price and are fairly easy to assemble... but as for durability-- no way! I have 100lb dogs that loved to lay on the beds. They did not chew them at all. The material used for the bed portion is simple \\"green screen\\" that you use on chain link fencing to block wind and view. What happened with all (4) of these beds was that when they got on the bed to lay down, a toe-nail would start to spread the fibers in a spot, then the tiny hole would proceed from there until the bed was 1/2 hole and not usable. (and I trim toenails religiously!) I did buy extra material, figuring that 2 -3 of those would still be less $$ than a Kuranda bed.. but over time, the inconvenience of having to replace them frequently wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked great, but mine had a manufacturing defect","review":"This product looked great, but I believe mine had a manufacturing defect that made it impossible to assemble (the canvas part was too short on one side).Amazon was great as usual and provided me with a refund.

However, I found that the legs could shift when you pick up the bed from one side. We had gotten the bed because our dog kept digging to find a cooler place to lay. Our dog is about 70lbs and fit fine on the bed. He seemed to like it for a few days. Then he started tipping the bed up and digging underneath it. The hole got deep enough to where he could lay in the hole with the bed covering him for shade. Later he tipped the bed over and got his cable wrapped around it and somehow managed to pull the legs apart. So now we still have a hole in the yard and a bed in pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog doesn't like it...","review":"This product was easy to assemble, and seems sturdy. We've had it for nearly a month now and my dog refuses to lay on it. He's gotten on a few times and circled, but never actually lays down.

The other one is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pet bed!","review":"The best thing about this product was how fast it was delivered. It was at my house 2 days before the estimated delivery date. The product itself is great. Putting it together is a two person job though. My dogs are very interested in it at the moment, but I just put it up so I know they will have to get use to it. I thought my dogs would love this because they all love the trampoline. My Boston terrier and pekingese can both fit on it together and my jack russel loves that it bends under her weight. All around this is a great pet bed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable!","review":"Bought this for the Grand Furbaby and she likes it. Not hard to put together and she knew it was hers.

I have two 45 lbs. dogs and one 95 lb. dog that use them. My big dog who is long and tall can stretch out comfortably on the large bed and when he is curled up one of the other dogs can curl up next to him on the bed. Two medium or medium-large dogs can easily fit on the large bed. My dogs get on and off, get up and turn around, roll around and wrestle on these beds without causing any damage. Despite all that my dogs subject their beds to, the fabric is still tight and durable and the frame is still strong and sturdy. I put faux lamb's wool pads on the beds because my large dog has very short fur and will not use the bed without the pad. However, my other two will use the bed without a pad. These beds are very easy to clean and do not get smelly like fiber-filled dog beds. I use the beds inside and outside. I highly recommend these beds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dog Bed","review":"Love this dog bed. Was very easy to assemble and both of my two 25 pound beagles love to lay on it together.

But my 5 year old lab Stella (60 lbs.) loves it! So we're keeping it. One size smaller would have probably worked. But the large size is big enough where Stella's bed fits on top and she is not laying on top of the perimeter support bars.Good purchase. Very sturdy. Does not move on the floor when Stella jumps on and off of it. Top canvas/fabric part is very strong and sags only slightly when Stella is on top of it, so Stella seems to feel secure and comfortable laying on top of it.Color is darker than it appears in the picture -- it's more of a medium to dark green color in most lighting.

It's been outside year-round in sun, wind, cold and lots of snow. I have 2 Siberian Huskies and a German Shepherd/Boxer mix. They all use the bed daily, sometimes all the the same time, and it shows no sign of bending, sagging, tearing, etc. They nap on it, they use it like a trampoline and it often serves as safety during games of tag. I haven't had the same luck with the other outdoor beds I've bought and the dogs always choose the Coolaroo over the other beds anyway so, I just bought another one. These beds are very easy to put together - it took 5 minutes from the time I carried the box into the house to the time I carried the assembled bed out to the yard. I learned with the first one to leave the bolts loose and twist the last leg up to align the holes for the 4th bolt.

I REALLY wish I could return this. I should have bought the more expensive brand. I wish I hadn't listened to the reviewa of people that claimed dogs couldn't/wouldn't be able to destroy this item.

Originally one of the dogs wouldn't get near it that's why I only had 2, but now I can't get her out of it. The only down side is, when you have it inside the house it also does what it's designed to do and let the dirt and hair fall through(this works better outside obviously) so I have to make sure I pick them up to vacuum all the dog hair out from underneath that sifts through.

Amazon is a great company!!!The final decider was the dog. It was her opinion that was most important.This bed is very different from her Pooch Planet Thermacare beds.Dog was reluctant at first, but I would have to say \\"DOG\\" is very happy with her new bed!Great product and a good price.I will be purchasing another as soon as I get the funds.As you can see, yes she is a spoiled rotten dog, but isn't that the way it is supposed to be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Pet Bed","review":"I absolutely love this bed for my dog.

She pees on her beds. (We're working on it.) In the meantime, here's a dog bed she can't ruin with urine and doesn't harbor fleas. The medium is plenty big enough for my 38 lb shepherd mix and her pug friend to lay on together.I would give the bed 5 stars, but the fabric is so scratchy that my dog wouldn't lay on it at first. I covered it with a towel, which is not ideal, but now she loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best outdoor pet bed ever!","review":"Just purchased our second Coolaroo. Our first lasted many, many years but it was time for a newer one - and a bigger one. Our pug, Joey, had the small Coolaroo but his 35 lbs of chunk was ready for the medium (he's taller than most pugs thus the extra poundage). The Coolaroo is a pain to put together but your dog will love it! It shipped amazingly fast also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large for indoors but dog likes it","review":"We bought this for our border collie mix, who is a pretty good sized dog. She is used to sleeping on this type of bed when she goes to the kennel, so there wasn't any \\"getting used to it\\" for her. That said, she still likes to sleep on the floor at times, but will get up and lay on this eventually. It's pretty big, though, so be aware that it takes up a lot of floor space. We have a crate that she sleeps in at night and there is no way this would ever fit in there. It isn't really portable but my husband moves out to the deck for her to lay in the shade but she doesn't seem to like it as much outside. It's holding up well so far but we've only had it maybe a month. She really zonks out when she's sleeping on it, so I consider it a successful purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loves it.","review":"My dog has chewed up every bed I have bought him.

When we first bought it, I was unimpressed by its lightness and apparent flimsiness, so we also bought a much more expensive Petmate bed. Within 2 months the expensive bed was seriously damaged, but the Coolaroo is still going strong. I recently bought another one for another room, and a smaller one for our terriers.

Originally we only bought one of these beds but we quickly realized he needed one for outside and one for inside. The bed is great; sturdy and easy to clean and like I said our dog loves it. My only concern is that our puppy may outgrow it. We bought the medium size based on the description that it was appropriate for Bull Terriers, but at 4 months old Tucker is already 30 pounds and will probably be at least 60 by the time he is grown. I'm not sure the medium size will accommodate him into adulthood.

It's constructed so there's really no appealing place for your pup to chew, and it's off the ground, so I think the puppy has gotten the idea that he's not supposed to pee on it!

That being said, I have had a problem with the covers getting big holes in them. I bought my first one a few years ago, and my 100-lb Lab loves it--it keeps him cool and off of the hard floor. After about a year I had to replace the cover because of holes, and am now in the process of ordering another bed. It's on sale for a good price, and since the screws are starting to rust, I figured I'd be better off just buying the whole thing.Obviously I like the bed and recommend it--I just wish the covers would hold up a little longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure.","review":"I have 2 dogs...one of them a 190 pound Neo Mastiff...neither of the dogs will lay on this bed.

The cover ripped completely. The plus is we can buy replacement covers, but if they are that weak, it will get pricey fast. Possibly by somehow securing a blanket over the bed this would have worked better; however that will limit its use outside.Also, I did not find this a joy to put together. It took a little finesse to get it nice and sturdy. It was not difficult, just be warned that you should clear a space and some time first.Bottom line: not recommended for large/heavy dogs or rambunctious dogs with long nails."},{"rating":"1","title":"coolaroo dog bed","review":"These beds will not hold up to English bulldogs.

Also put a treat on bed so she would have to get on it.The bad news is that it did not come with the 4 screws. They did not have the screws at Lowe's so I bought them at Ace Hardware. I could have sent it back, but didn't want to wait. Spent a little over $2.00 for screws.Did not take long to put together, about 15 minutes. Other reviews are correct when they recommend that you keep screws loose until all of them are intact, then tighten while cot is on the floor. You will probably have to re-tighten occasionally but I find that it's worth it to have a dog bed that is comfortable.Recommended for large dogs that can flatten those pillow beds easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"These beds are awesome. I have two medium to large dogs who have destroyed nice beds on the past (the ones from Costco - 5 and some others), to a point that we gave up buying them new beds and let them sleep on their own couch.

They were easy to put together and immediately after they were setup and covered with dogs blankets (bought at Costco), each one of the dogs jumped on one of the beds and have been happy with them ever since.They're easy to clean, comfortable for the dogs and with the blankets, easy to keep them odor free. We wish we have bought these a long time ago.We read some reviews stating they were hard to put together. Unless you don't know how to read instructions, I can't see how this is possible.

If you move it, the legs will twist a little so it is not quite level. However, this can be easily and quickly adjusted. This is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.The bed is a little bigger than I anticipated, so you may want a smaller one if you have a Shihtzu, Dachshund, Schnauzer, etc. My little Pluto gets on it easily and watches his squirrels as he sunbathes. I have already bought a replacement cover, as I was worried one might not be available in 2 years, like with the last outdoor pet bed we bought.

I like it because I get CD quality sound and 74 minutes of music (or whatever) in such a small package; it fits easily into my shirt or pants pocket. Plus, it's totally handy to have this tiny unit that plays and records -- I can pull stuff off radio, CD, tape, etc. The battery doesn't last as long as I want it to (like 12 hours) but it does recharge very easily. Sound quality is fantastic.

You can get a cable for $3 and the software is free. You can use napster or windows comes with one usually. I am purchasing the Sony Model MZR70 now without the PC link.

It provides historical context lacking in most other texts, and does so in a relatively concise and well-presented manner. The American political development (APD) scholarship it's based on works well, certainly much better than the Kernell/Jacobson textbook. Their framework of democracy versus rights, however, does not come off quite so well as they would like, sometimes obscuring the larger point they are trying to make in each chapter. Sometimes the writing, in an attempt to be concise, may be a bit too dense for some students to grasp.

It was time to trade up and I picked the Sherline, which I was familiar with back in college. It is still a tremendous workhorse; I get great accuracy, a wide turning speed range, and the accessory package has more than enough components to get started to say the least (The thread cutting kit is finally coming in handy).If you are planning on purchasing a small lathe for accurate metal, plastic and woodworking, I highly recommend this machine. It is lightweight (roughly 45 pounds), which means you can store it away when not in use. However, this also means that it is critical that you are able to bolt or clamp the lathe to a surface before you begin your work.It is well worth the money and if taken care of, will last for decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS CALENDAR!","review":"We are a pretty busy family and this calendar helps me keep everyone's appointments, meetings, parties and bills organized.

(That's what lured me, the stickers.)Second, the bad news: it's not all that well done. The weeks are arranged horizontally which means that one has to write the family members' names 4-5 times per month into their little boxes - that's a huge waste of time and simply annoying. Then, the boxes are too small - one can fit one engagement per day per person which is NOT enough, believe me. There are too many graphics; as someone else already mentioned, the illustrations are often dark and block out entire days. The stickers don't stick well and are too big for the little boxes.So, the calendar is fun to look at and frustrating to use. We used the Mom's Family Calendar by Sandra Boynton for years and wanted something different this year. But one week into the new year and we went out and bought it again. It's just much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"2006 Mom's Plan-It Plus Calendar","review":"It's ok except for the fact that you have to write everyone's name in every month & the stickers fall off the sticker sheet!

While they are cute, the drawings should have been contained to the borders of the months. These drawings prevent me from just glancing at the calendar to see what is going on for the week or day. The drawings \\"fill up\\" some of the days and make you spend a little more time staring to see which days/weeks are free.2) There is only one pocket for the whole year. Pocket calendars that I have used in the past have a diff pocket for each month.Lastly, the stickers that are included that say \\"doctors appt\\", \\"no school\\", etc. are useless. They blend in with the drawings on the page.

Both disturbing and provocative, his selections force one to confront and view these creations with a fresh perspective. Of particular interest is his writing on French artist Jean Dubuffet, who was among the first to recognize such works as real art with something worth exploring and accepting, on par with \\"formal\\" art.

Very TV movie in its look and overuse of extreme closeups. A view of the 60's counterculture that didn't even ring true then. I also seem to recall that when I saw this in the 60's that Susan Clark points out the actual Coogan's Bluff (a real natural landmark in NY) to Eastwood's character during their scene above the Cloisters. She tells a little story about it, tying it to the character's \\"bluff\\" about how tough he is. If I am recalling correctly, that scene has been clumsily trimmed out on this DVD. Note how in one shot Eastwood is wearing his hat, but in the very next one it is off. At that point the dialogue appears to jump from one subject to an entirely different one.

Due to arthritis I wanted to replace with a \\"trigger type\\" cookie press and unfortunately made of plastic, it just did not work properly from the first and only batch made ... However, the dough DID work in my older press, so I know it was not the dough. Although the recipe for the spritz cookies on this cookie press was different than the older one I'm used to using. Yet it still did not work in any capacity. Waste of all the ingredients, time, money and efforts.

My husbands favorite cookie is the spritz cookie. I tried to make him some spritz cookies for Christmas time and every time I put a disc in the press and started pushing the dough out the disc would pop out of the press and start shredding the plastic off the edge. I spent half my night trying to get it to work, with no luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe some of the reviews","review":"The Wilton Cookie pro Ultra II Cookie Press Is a piece of junk. My dough was fresh, at room temp and the cookie sheets had been put in the freezer. The press was so hard for me to use. The squeeze trigger was so hard to work that I had to have my husband do it and even then it was hard for him. I used the Wilton recipe that came with the press and it was so stiff that it broke one of the disc Everyone talked about how easy this press was to use............ Not for us. Maybe we just got a lemon. Once is enough for me. I will never buy a Wilton product again.If I had had a place to put a negative star I would have. NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally worthless","review":"I am new to working with a cookie press, so this review may be pertinent only for newbies. The press is very difficult to get cookie dough into and impossible not to have air pockets in the dough. About 1/3 of the cookies come out nicely pressed - the rest are a mess - useless and a waste of dough -0 not sure if this is because of air pockets in dough or dough sticking to bottom of press - or both. Wilton seems to have a good name and, generally, make good products. It seems strange they would put their name on this disaster - I wouldn't want my name on it!It holds very little dough - not even enough to fill up a single cookie sheet. This was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After just a few uses one of the plastic disks cracked and was unusable.

I was worried it wouldn't live up to it's description but it worked like a dream. It was easy to take apart to wash and easy to put back together. My friend and i had heaps of fun making the recipe included. Just one batch made nearly 160 cookies, which was great for the party we were having. The press was easy to use. It was a bit messy to fill but i think that was us rather than the Press and we got better as time went on.We loved it so much my friend bought one too, so that we each have one and can make them in half the time, when we are together. We are at the point where we are trying to think of excuses to make so many cookies.

Grips cookie sheet while you make the cookie. Helps with stability, and a very good idea.Ratchet action: nice to use, and gives an even press for each cookie.THAT SAID, This over all flimsy, the disks, plunger and rings top and bottom are going to crack. It has a small capacity, is a MAJOR pain to load with dough, and the shelf that holds the disks is too shallow. Also the included recipe calls for a greased cookie sheet. No, no, no. They'll never stick.It is not an improvement over the old metal cookie presses, and I'm now shopping for a vintage type model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Kookie Gun","review":"I have been using this press for about 5 years. The original spritz recipe I tried to use had cream cheese in it. A fabulous recipe, but didn't work with the gun, nor have I found a gun that it will work with. The dough is just too thick. I switched to a Southern Living recipe that uses butter flavor crisco and voila. The cookies stick (and I even grease the cookie sheet). It presses out cookies fast, and easy. Love this cookie press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I was very excited to start making Christmas cookies with my daughter, but when I made the first batch (per the instructions), the disc shot right out of the press leaving me with a pile of dough and a disc stuck on top! I tried all of the discs with the same result - they were pushed right out of the press too.I followed all instructions. Honest. Needless to say - this was returned to the store and I found a nice, vintage press on eBay that works like a charm!(I would have rated this zero stars if Amazon would have let me)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have been able to use this press twice. The first time it was OK, the handle that you squeeze to press the dough wears on your hands after a few. Also had some issues with the design inserts popping out through the front of the press.

While the Wilton looks handsome and contains a nice variety of shaping disks, the press functioned poorly right out of the box. It takes a bit of wrestling to get the handle screwed onto the cylinder. A good press should kick out one cookie per handle press. The Wilton requires two or three presses to move the cookie dough through, leaving the baker with unevenly sized cookies and a sore hand. On about my 5th dozen, the black plastic screw on mechanism inside the handle cracked, leaving the unit useless. Back to the store it went. Next time, I will purchase an electric cookie press like my Mom has such success with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cookie Press, Please","review":"Bought it, used it, and not planning to use much more.

I had to keep a close eye out to make sure none of my cookie had any black flecks in them. I tried several different disks and had the same issue in time with all of them. I was extra careful to make sure I put it together right. After time the disks chip away so much they won't stay in the press anymore and just push right through.

The piece that holds the cookie cutter disk on, on my model, was metal and was fine.Cleaning was okay.HOWEVER -- the black plastic bands that run along the sides of the dough barrel BROKE on me this year in the midst of baking 14 dozen Christmas cookies. I had to duct tape the thing together in order to finish my dough.Now I'm shopping for an Italian-made model (Mercado) - they're (almost) all metal and should last forever with proper care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I grew up eating spritz cookies so was very anxious to make them for my family too.

There were problems with the ratcheting from the get-go, a lot of the cookies came out too big, and depending on the disc used, they may not have come out at all. There were maybe 4-5 discs that would produce an adequate cookie. This year I had the same problems, and when reloading the tube at one point, I noticed that a piece of the arm that attaches it to the tube had cracked and broken off. I managed to squeeze out the last few cookies, but now after less than 2 complete uses it is useless.

I couldn't put it down, and consider it one of the best books on being an artist that I have ever read.I should add that it would be especially comforting and inspiring for women who want to be artists (or writers) yet still maintain close, loving families and home life. For many women today, it is an \\"either or\\" proposition, but I love the way Anne Truitt shows how her domestic life informs and balances her art.

All of the players, but Medeski in particular, are pushing way past anything they've done before. The results are mixed, but the sound is completely unique. If you thought Combustication went too far with the DJ stuff, then this album isn't for you. I tend to listen to Combustication more often, just because it's a bit easier to slide into the funk.

Listen 3 minutes into the title track and you'll know why you need to be dedicated as a listener to get the full potential of what MMW are conveying in this music of theirs.

The songs are really space but still amazing. It seems that Medeski Martin and Wood finally achieve what they are trying to do with this album. The songs aren't very structured, but its on purpose. The keys are a little bit too spaced out sometimes, but the increadible rhythem of the drums and bass keep it all in line. If you liked \\"Shackman\\" you should love this album, although I like \\"Shackman\\" a little bit more.

Tracks like \\"We Are Rolling\\" and \\"Bone Digger\\" show you how well it all works: the grooves are driving but never stiff, the improvosation is risky but never looses the song.

He attempts a couple of solutions that don't work (alcoholism and suicide) before hitting on the right one: just take \\"Happyzac\\" pills and become purposefully stupid.

The other reviews posted here are shockingly positive as the book is quite terrible.At essence, this reads like a college student's writing project, an essay that is the stream-of-consciousness outpouring of an immature writer. The book needs serious editing. The writing drifts, the characters are poorly developed, and the book is chock full of sloppy contradictions. (The main character is so moral he cannot eat fast food, but has no problem stealing from grocery stores?)The essence of the book is about the intellectual in society, but even this is poorly developed and weakly defined. Somehow intellectualism includes moral behavior, introspection, intelligence, and opposition to consumerism, but not rationality?I have thought about what I could say about the book that is positive.

The items in the bag seem to be decent quality although they are made in China and Hi-Lift claims to be a Made In The USA company. The box was also missing the bolts and pins that you use to attach the kit to the jack. Called Hi-Lift about the missing parts and they said they would mail them out to me. 2 months later the bolts never arrived. I was able to find the missing parts at the local hardware store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in the middle of Canyonlands","review":"Well this product let me down in a big way. I didn't have time to assemble it before I left on my trip. Got down in the maze and the tensioner mount had the hole drilled to far in so the chain link wouldn't allow the bolt to go though. Useless. Also the gloves ripped apart the first time I pulled them on. Go get your own chains.

Be smart and assemble it BEFORE you hit the trail. Although it was a tight fit I didn't have any of the issues that other reviewers had with the bolt hole or chain not fitting in the winch tensioner. Practice with it once and you will see how easy it is to use. Check out Hi Lift's video on Youtube to see it in action. It's obviously a lot slower than an electric winch... but a lot faster than walking to the nearest hard top for help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful but not all you need","review":"I like this kit. I think it is very useful. It would probably be better to buy a winch. I got this kit for Christmas because I don't have a winch. Even if I get a winch I will probably still cary this because i have been stuck and had winches not pull me out. Anything you can get helps! Also, they don't tell you, but you need at least about 20 feet of chain and as many tow straps as possible. Also, the parts bolt onto the jack, but its not like they need to be tight or anything, the bolts just keep it from slipping off the jack. So to save time, I replaced the bolts with pins which is a lot nicer.

The drain is hopelessly clogged. Whatever water you think you will save is no reason to buy this urinal. Look at your water bill. How much is the rate per THOUSAND gallons?

Now add the cost of wasted drain opener, a snake, a plumber and, finally, the cost to replace this unit completely and add a new water supply (because you simply need water to flush or it will clog the waste line). I'm waiting for the class action suit on this product. Looks great, works well at first, and then . . . a clogged disappointment. Kohler is a great brand and should be ashamed of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought into the hype","review":"We installed 4 of these into our manufacturing plant restrooms. It's only been a year and we are experiencing clogged drains due to sediment buildup. We pulled one of the problem urinals to see if we can figure out what the problem was and it was literally 2 inches thick. If we use occasional water to flush them, we experience sewage smell because we wash away the chemicals that are recommended by Kohler. It appears we need to treat the urinals more often with the recommended cleaners / sealers but I expect that to quickly erase the water savings $$. If you plan to install this urinal, know that although there may be water savings, it won't necessarily translate into money savings. In fact, from personal experience it may cost you more money in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I feel that this project is a let down compare to where this ministry was going.

Every once in while, when I stand in front of my CD collection, especially in the sombre days of the ending year - just as today - I pick up this Concerto and fall into the depths of this masterpiece. The three movements of the concerto show me a realm of sound, solitude and beauty. The Sound of the saxophon is overwhelming and the recording is outstanding regarding the time of production, 1990. The musisicians are a who's who of those days, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour and Pino Palladino. The music is haunting and never lets you go. In no other work of is too short life achieved Kamen such a dephth and densitiy.

The book furthers that this is HER fault--after all, she chose to be obese and all she has to do is stop pigging out and excercise and everyone will like her....The harassment this character receives from other animals is considered justifiable because of her appearance--talk about sending the wrong message! And yes, in the end when a young mole appoints himself her personal trainer and decides to teach her that being fat is bad, all the animals do indeed come to like her and feel sorry for the way they acted. Only in a fantasy world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sad.","review":"I remember this book from when I was a child. The sad illustrations and storyline would cause me to become teary-eyed. It was successful in getting the point across that it is very mean to tease fat kids. I always defended the chubby kids after reading this book. There is one picture in this book that became burned into my memory- of the cat eating a sandwitch with tears running down her face.I could cry just thinking about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw this book away","review":"I threw this book away. Not only does it show the fat kitty being forced into weight loss so she won't be teased - INSTEAD of teaching tolerance toward children who are different - BUT cats cannot live on a vegetarian diet. They are obligate carnivores. They MUST have meat to survive. God made them that way. Any uninformed person who reads this book and gets the bright idea to put kitty on a diet will end up with a blind, sick cat...eventually a DEAD cat.Bullying is a serious problem and this book treats it as a way to get someone to change their lifestyle.

This book teaches children that food should not be an escape from reality, it should be a fuel for our bodies and minds. I read this book as a child and I received a copy as a gift the other day. I don't think that the writer of this book meant for people to take his story as saying that fat people and animals aren't accepted, like so many of you have written. I think he wants us to all learn the importance of healthy living. Catundra is my favorite book in the world.Stephanie"},{"rating":"1","title":"a hugely disturbing children's book","review":"As someone who has always been overweight, naturally I bristled at Stephen Cosgrove's _Catundra_. But the book isn't just about fat; it's far more troubling than that. It imparts the message that if other people make fun of you for being different, you're the one that ought to change. That Catundra *can* change is a matter of luck; that she is badgered into it is a tragedy.I wouldn't go so far as to say that this book should be kept out of the hands of children, but I do think that any reading of it should be accompanied by intensive discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective combination of psycological drama & spy thriller.","review":"Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard from Star Trek) plays a retired security agent who's developing Alzheimer's disease. He plays wargames & simulations to keep his mind sharp, and believes he's the victim of a conspiracy. His well-intentioned daughter hires a new housekeeper to watch after him, and after a rough start, they seem to make friends. But it's increasingly less clear whether all of his suspicions are unfounded, and gradually becomes more intriguing, both a psychological drama and suspense thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky","review":"I rented this movie at first because I like Patrick Stewart. I was a bit surpised that he would be in such a typical genre piece, but I figured it would be a harmless way to pass a slow Friday night at home. Well needless to say this movie soon turned out to be much more. Is he really rational? Is he a victim of mental decline? Is he paranoid? Is it a tale of political conspiracy or just a rather sad tale of a man who is going quickly into the darkness? I'm not telling, but believe me you won't be able to make up your mind until the very end.This story was risky. It goes around between tounge-in-cheek humor, pathos, suspense and mystery, and often such an ambitious undertaking turns into a mishmash, but not this one. This is a fun movie and a very good way to pass a slow evening. When it's over you'll find yourself amazed at how quickly time went by and you just might wonder if your suspicions and fears are all that irrational after all.

It is funny and serious and has moments of elegance woven into the plot. I always enjoy Patrick Stewart and Kimberly Williams and they were wonderful together in this drama. Given that all things are relative, the movie probably did not deserve the four stars but it was better than three. There is some violence and a few f-bombs. It would not be particular good for children but most of all, they would not enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"While I have always enjoyed watching Patrick Stewart's performances, I have never seen him in something where his use of profanity was extreme or where he did a nude scene.

Overall, it is a strong collection of songs from the Passion movement. It has some great anthems like \\"Better is One Day\\", \\"Salvation\\" and \\"Shout to the North\\". Probably my favorite song on the album is Matt Redman's live version of \\"Let my words be few\\". A simple but powerful rendition.My one complaint about this album is the lack of diversity of the tracks. Simply put, some of the songs start to sound alike if you listen to the CD from start to finish. It is not that I don't like any particular song, they just start to run together by the end. A little more diversity of sound and this album is easily a five-star CD.I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys inspired live modern worship music. It is a fine addition to previous passion albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Songs Make For Hitting for Next Song","review":"I love these artists individually (Chris Tomlin, Charlie Hall, Matt Redman, Watermark), but these songs are soooo long and drawn out that I found myself going to the next song each time. However, song number 5, \\"Grace Flows Down\\", sung by Christy Nockels, is a true gem that I listened to all the way through. Maybe I am a bit biased as I do not care for live albums, for reasons like long songs and random talking during the song. Maybe if I was at the Passion: One Day experience, I would have enjoyed it, but hearing someone sing \\"We Fall Down\\" in a different language does nothing for me. Also, this CD is in desperate need of David Crowder! Alright, let the negative comments ensue!

When I first went to my univ. my roomate and I used to blast it every morning! When I was shuffling from home to school... I lost my copy, and just re-purchased it. Songs like Breathe, and Grace Flows Down bring absolute peace and contentment on my most turbulent and upsetting days. The songs The Noise We Make and America get you pumped up for God and inspired. The song We Fall Down, that's sang in Setswana, is absolutely magical and powerful. Salvation is always a song I come back to when I need to feel God's presence.

While Lena Jacobson does show a penchant for the more astringent and reedy stops, I cannot agree that the sound is shrill and aggravating. I found it quite interesting, and she displayed every facet of the potential sound. The Fredriksborg organ was rebuilt in the 1980s and there is a disc illustrating its mellower side on Marco Polo records. Nevertheless, I would be loth to surrender this recording. I find the clacking of the mechanical action and the occasionally asthmatic sound rather charming.

Sure, the glam posturing is fading, and the remakes of 8 Miles High and the Midnight Hour are campy. But Ferry's unique crooning and songcraft are starting to supplant the fashionista gimmicks of Roxy's 70's art-rock schtick with work that sticks in your head because of its beauty and content, not its image. Oh Yeah is a beautiful, wistful song of lost love that that doesn't sound dated after 24 years. My Only Love is heartache in melody, and Flesh + Blood is still hard to figure out but impossible to resist. Running Wild is a melodic musing on self-destruction, and if you've seen someone else crash-and-burn, it becomes all the more interesting. Overall, this album is better than its precursor Manifesto, and a great prelude to the classic, unforgettable Avalon.

And considering I reside in CA that is not an exaggeration at all! They are extremely comfortable, the foam sole molds to your foot. The fabric strap is very soft and doesn't rub at all. Though $20+ seems like a lot for a pair of flip flops, they are well worth the investment. I have burned through 6 pairs and have never had a single one fall apart. I buy a new pair to replace them once I wear all the tread off the bottom of the sole which takes about over a year of daily wear. They are incredibly well made, I once got my foot caught in a mud hole (the knee deep kind around natural hot springs) pulled the shoe out in one piece despite the tremendous suction that required my husbands help to free me. They are by far, the best flip flops on the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Go-To Shoe","review":"I have purchased 3 pairs of these same flip flops and I have no intention of ever switching to another sandal. They are durable (last over 2 years), comfortable (I have taken them hiking), and look great (they don't fray or discolor). Buy a pair and become a convert to this flip flop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sandals!","review":"Sandals that last forever, are comfortable, and very durable. The color choices are great, too. Reefs are by far the best flip flops ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"For years I have worn Reef sandals on the recommendation of my foot doctor. These have always had a raised arch support. I assumed this was a feature of all Reef sandals. When they arrived and did not have this feature I sent them back and requested that the supplier send me a sandal that did. I specified that it could be any style and any color but at the same price, otherwise I requested a refund. I got the refund but was out $13.50 because of shipping costs both ways. Since the shoes cost less than $25 to begin with I felt this was a steep price to pay. Won't make that mistake again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"Purchasing was easy, delivery was quicker than expected, and the product was in great shape. I am extremely satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable flip-flop, runs normal to wide","review":"My girlfriend has the men's version of these and I loved hers, so I went looking for a pair for myself for our upcoming Hawaii trip. These are great, and I love the thickness of the sole - minimal impact on your heel. I'm a fast walker, so I needed something that wouldn't rub between my toes. These don't. The only thing I will mention is that I have very narrow feet and these are definitely normal width-wide. The sole of the shoe is larger than the diameter of my foot by quite a bit. Not very elegant looking, but great for casual days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super comfy, but runs small","review":"These are some of the most comfortable flip flops I've ever purchased! Reef tends to make good, quality flip flops, and these don't disappoint! The heel is thick enough to be sturdy, and the arch has \\"anatomical support\\", unlike most flip flops that are just flat. My only complaint is that they run a little small and don't come in half sizes. I usually wear a size 7, but my heels were just at the edge of the back of the flip flop, which bothered me. I returned and ordered a size 8, which are a little big but they will work for me. Again, half sizes would be nice. These flip flops are definitely worth the price, and they will last a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These flip flops are the bomb!","review":"I love, love, love these flip flops. I had never bought this brand before, but I will definitely buy it again. The sandals fit great, are comfortable and look good too.

I've gone through a summer with these plus wearing them whenever I don't feel like putting on my shoes. I've even worn them when I'm walking my dogs! They are still comfy. They are still in one piece. I'd definitely buy them again when my current flip flop wears out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love me some Sandy!","review":"I have these flip flops in brown and black with pink and silver. I wear a size 8 and they fit true to size; they fit exact so there is no extra room at the back by the heel. The size 8 will look neat and cute on your feet. My feet a little wide so they fit great. If you have narrow or normal sized feet they will still look good. This slipper is not as broad as some reviewers said (imho) You can't go wrong with these! Will always be a Reef lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"OFFFF THa HOOoOOOK!!!!!","review":"This album is chock full of mind opening lyrical content, simply off the hook!!!!!

It gives you an insane amount of gain. It's kind of like adding an extra channel to your amp. Dial in a good crunchy rhythm sound and then kick this thing in for a scorching lead sound. If your amp is already really distorted it doesn't seem to add that much. Works best (as far as I've seen so far anyway) with lower gain settings on the amp. I tried it in front of a distortion pedal and it gave that a nice kick too but I like it better straight into the amp. Buy one while you still can at this great price. Or pay 3-4 times more for a boutique pedal later."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGNIFICO LIBRO","review":"Studied Spanish at the University of Minnesota back in the early 1970's and this text book was my introduction.

I'd say it runs quite well and is cute looking too. There are also a few parts available for it, to make it run better. My only complain is that it should have a tail light and that's why i only gave it four stars. The scooters trunk lid did have a big chip out of it and was scratched but the company promptly replaced it. Both the front brakes and rear brakes work quite well but like any auto or motorcycle the front have most of the stopping power. i like it so much i may buy another so we can ride together, especially since it's only three hundred bucks.

No character can just walk across the room without the reader having to hear every thought in every mind of every character at that very moment.

The music has something for everyone, slow, upbeat, contemporary and country. This is one you will want to read the words to the songs as well as just listening to the music. Two old favorites, Where No Man Stands Alone and Sinner Saved By Grace will reach out, grab your attention and maybe bring tears to your eyes.

Many choirs would be lucky to have one of these men for every 50 members. As a masterer, I have dissected this CD countless times as I have listened from cover to cover at least 300 times. An excellent job with mastering with just one exception: at the end of the \\"I DO BELIEVE\\" solo by Mark Lowry, the piano finishes the song. The piano sounds distant, tinny, and just out of the mix.

This is because the articles range from the early to late the 90's. The mini interview sections after each article titled \\"In Ivar's Words\\" (not 'Inar' lol) often clarify or update the content of the article.

(I ended up buying her her own kit so she could leave mine alone.) I have been scouring the craft shops for silk flowers to support my \\"habit\\"! Also tried experimenting with bigger floral wire to make bigger \\"people\\". Needless to say, I'm hooked. The instructions are clear, they're easy to make. I've made some with kids, no problem. Each design is unique and you can make them as simple or complex as you like. And making one doesn't take all day -- you can have a 20 minute project or a 2 hour project.

Tom Wopat's voice is deliciously smooth, but with the occasional rough edges that let you know he is deep inside these wonderful songs. The arrangements are gorgeous, from the twinkling jazz piano to the full-blown brass, and I must agree that the duet with Antonia Bennett is absolutely adorable. Baby, when it's cold outside, this CD will warm your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wopat fan from way back","review":"I REALLY wanted to like this CD, because I like Tom Wopat and have gone to his concerts on several occasions. I even belonged to his fan club and have met him 3 times. But I don't. I didn't read the other reviews or I probably wouldn't have bought this CD. I just don't like the \\"crooner\\" type of music. His country efforts were MUCH better. While I'll probably be in the minority, all this CD did was put me to sleep. I'm hoping for a better one next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone can sing, but should they?","review":"Tom Wopat has always been a very likeable guy and to tell you the truth, I wae really looking forward to this CD considering the choice of selections. Starting with the packaging I was very impressed with the presentation. I had seen him perform on the Tonys and thought he was having a ball, if not quiet on pitch with his fellow performers. I had heard he was performing in several Broadway productions and cabarets recently and assumed he had gotten much more comfortable with singing. Unfortunatly, unlike fine wine, he has not improved with age. I would probably go see him in a play but as far as musicals go, I don't see how he could be a selling point. His voice quality has none and the delivery seems tenative and frail. The arrangements seem to be meant for a strong singer that would enhance them. The man should stick to talk shows and acting because he has now proved that anyone can sing---but should they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Broadway treasure","review":"I was always hesitant about buying this cd when I'd stumble on it here on Amazon. That all changed when I saw him perform as Billy Flynn in the touring cast of Chicago. Tom Wopat has an amazing singing voice! Granted, he does not have a typical Broadway singing voice, what he does have is a lot of passion and strength. I'm recommending this cd to everyone I know. I was so impressed with him that I bought his cd at intermission. And being the great guy he is, he even autographed my cd in the lobby after the show. A must own cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great recording.","review":"In these times, when loud screeching and atonal bombast pass for music, lyrics about human depravity are applauded for plumbing the depths of profundity, and a great number of the top 100 are most suitable for accompanying root canals, we have a retro-album from Tom Wopat to soothe the soul and elevate the human spirit.When I bought this disc, I was expecting a Broadway-style production ---- full of razzle-dazzle and sock-it-to-'em bravura. I was more than delighted to encounter a series of songs presented in such a tasteful and understated manner, that, to my surprise, I have kept replaying them more often than I ever anticipated.This is a very classy and exceptional offering. I hope Tom Wopat will put out a lot more material with the same approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's making me fall in love with him all over again!!!","review":"It is so Romantic, playful and wistful.

Certainly not I.I don't understand how this CD could possibly be considered country? It truly is an amazing CD; so very expressive and heartfelt. I LOVED it!A MUST HAVE for anyone with GOOD TASTE!

Quite summarised, the approach used for discussing the PDEs is not familiar - see other reviews. The book as a whole doesn't fill any gab, e.g. it is not a mathematical finance book, definitely not., see Shereve or Neftcie for an example. On the other hand it is not a tools or recipes book for pricing derivatives. It doesn't do any function for me, just a waste of space.

It certainly needs to be supplemented by a respectable book if you want to learn derivatives (c.f. Hull's textbook, for example), and on the other hand, the math isn't rigorous at all, so you'll need a book on stochastic calculus (e.g. Michael Steele's, actually there are tons of better books out there, it's not hard to find better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copied Equations","review":"Wilmott seems to have copied theoretical derivations using partial differential equations and matrix multiplication symbols. The only examples in the book use basic algebra, so it seems as if the authors don't understand how to apply theory to practice except in the most simple cases.This book is irritatingly bad. Terms are not well defined. There are no concrete examples following the derivations as if the authors don't understand the meaning of the equations.The information on options seems to have been copied from the many derivatives dictionaries available on the web. It's clear the authors don't know how to apply the math to price these options.

This starts with some mid 60's beat music by Billy Barry that at no time resembles the rockabilly tracks on the rest of the series I have listened to and does not get any better. The first Ronnie Dio track 'Do the OOP-POO-PAH-DOO' has a soul feel to it and the second track 'Love Pains' is more reminisent of the teen idol hits of the early 60's. Billy Balls' 'Motorcycle' is more rock and noise than Rockabilly. Charlie Starr provides the best track on the CD 'Black Jack Joey' but the rest of his offerings are purely pop. The Otis Blackwell track is interesting purely to compare to the version Elvis provided for the movie 'It happened at the worlds fair'. But again a pop offering not what we have come to expect from the 'That'll Flat Git Series'.

But Easterbrook doesn't exactly give us much else to hang on to: with overcooked metaphors and undercooked characters, this doesn't read like anything other than bad fiction from someone convinced he's writing something brilliant. The \\"dude, what if...\\" premise--cribbed in equal parts from b-grade sci-fi and \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\"--is almost cringe-inducing. And the point he's making--that modern society is, like, bad or something, because people, like, sell out--is embarrassing to hear. Not because it's necessarily untrue (in many cases) but because everything Easterbrook presents is so without nuance, subtlety, or grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"I ordered this used equipment for my son to practice on, however the speakers did not work, the mic was missing.

But nas is nasty and this album is hot. Why compare it to illmatic, i dont see ppl comparing blueprint to reasonable doubt. As far as im concerned jay-z has done 3 good albums, actually 2 1/2.Anyway This album is incredible, both cd's, take it from me. You not only hear music but you learn also. The prodduction is different from any other you'll hear out there, it isnt your typical kanye west or just blaze, you actually hear real instruments blend in with his lyrics.

Why don't he just write?","review":"Come on now, everyone be real. We all know Nas can't rap, he can only write. This cd lyrically can only be considered as average, compared to Jay-Z's \\"The Blueprint\\" and even that garbage rapper Eminem's \\"Encore\\". Nas hasn't made a great cd since \\"Illmatic\\", and hasn't made a decent cd since then. The main point is that even with the release of \\"Illmatic\\" Nas can't rap. Nas has lived a life full of contradiction, and more contradiction, and that is exactlly what \\"Street's Disciple\\" is, just 2 dics of contradiction. There was one track i did seem to like to a point and that was \\"Bridging the Gap\\" which he did with his dad. Suprisingly I believe his dad has more talent then him. If you want to hear some real rap by some artists who can actually flow and have great lyrics, then go buy Royce Da 5'9's \\"M.I.C.

The only good song on here is \\"Thief's Theme\\", everything else is trash from start to finish. First of all the production is the most hideous and repulsive I've ever heard. The beats on here sound like they were produced by a 2 year old. Who ever produced this album should be shot in the face pointblank with a shotgun. The lyrics are bellow Nas's standards and his perfomance on here is shockingly bad. I've always had respect for Nas but this album is just so awful and lame I couldn't hold that in.

Nearly all of the rhymes are good and most of the beats are decent too. He covers a wide range of subjects from american heroes (These are our Heroes)to dead homies (Just a Moment) to his daughter (Me and You). If I have one gripe about this cd, it is that there are not enough good choruses. It gets kind of boring at some points because there aren't any really catchy hooks to keep you singing along. I would recommend this cd to Nas fans and anyone that likes good old school hip hop, but if you are into all that gangster crap, then this isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Evdizzle and Taron Jeremiah Summer","review":"Who do you think you are saying any of this is, dare I say the nasty \\"C\\" word....

Keep crude remarks like that to yourselves and stop listening to him if you're crazy enough to think that. I mean this isn't like 50 Cent or anything, and if you use the two \\"C\\" words, I'd think you were. Nas is a real rap genius and all the losers who say nasty things about Nastradamus are idiots who need to leave Nas alone. I listened to Nastradamus and it's really good!

He acts like a tough guy calling out Kobe and Tae Diggs etc. etc. but all of a sudden he bitches up on some subliminal nonsense throughout the second verse.Nas said this person has an album. I think he might be talking about Puffy cause he said the line about the election and we know how hard puffy was pushing the whole vote thing. Then he said something about the next conscious MC. There is only one concisou MC that has made enough of a impact on hip hop in the last year plus; Kanye West. I dont remember Kanye in any election business though.

Every song is atleast good, and when you here it more than once it becomes even better. I don't think he should have cut it into one disc, because each cd has a different feel to it, the second one has more of a good feeling to it. Five star album just for U.B.R.(unauthorized biography of rakim), that stuff needed to be said. Of course it would have been dope with premier, large professor, and pete rock on production, but this ain't illmatic again haters!

Nevertheless, \\"Street Disciple\\" should have been one disc, if u combine the two though you have arguably his best work to date.

Unlike most of rap contemporaries NAS is truthful, consistent and humble. \\"Street Disciple\\" in my opinion is NAS's most reflective, sentimental and personal album.

He got the illest rhymes, mad tight production, he can make you contemplate life (Live Now) and then make you wanna smash someone's skull (Suicide Bounce) in a heartbeat. But for some reason these days, he always seems to produce one or two tracks (especially that track with Maxwell) that ruins the fluidity of his albums (think \\"Bravehearts\\" featuring Mary J, and y'all know about the one with Ginuine). But this is still his best release since the amazing Illmatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really slick album but......","review":"This 2-disc could have been just put into 1 disc. I guess Nas felt left out that 2pac, Jay, Biggie, and others can make a 2 disc, why cant I? lolAlot of the songs I was feeling but yo who is this Scarlett chick? She killed Live Now and the other one. Kelis made American Way suck balls at the end. Nas needs to make a CDE with just him like Illmatic. Why is Ludacris on this album btw?

No filler tracks, and yes, this like most other double albums could be classic if it were 1 CD, however, in its own right -- it's as close as a Double Album has gotten lately to being classic.Nas has shown over his last 3 albums a sense of consistency -- on point lyrics, good production and he actually is \\"saying something\\". Refreshing to see someone in the rap scene is keeping it close to the streets.A classic to be realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly a HOT release","review":"I ain't a huge Nas fan but this album certainly proves me wrong.Heres my list of hot tracks and whack ones:HOTA Message to the Feds, Sincerely, We the PeopleNazareth SavageAmerican Way (with the exception of the whack chorus)These are Our HeroesLive Now - the first half anyway, before \\"scarlett\\" messes it upRest of My LifeJust a MomentReasonSuicide BounceStreet's DiscipleVirgo (kinda commercial and boring subject matter but it's still a good track)Remember the TimesThe Makings of a Perfect BitchGetting MarriedBridging the GapWarThief's ThemeWHACKDiscipleSekou Story - good concept but i hate scarlett (whether it's actually nas or not, its still garbage), wheres jean gray??You Know My Style - too commercial for meU.B.R.

Another Great Album from a nasty lyricist","review":"After the ok God's son Nasty Nas returns with his nastiest album since stillmatic. Nas unleashes his fury on tracks like nazareth savage, and on these are our heroes, and american way where he discusses how alot of rappers are trying to be political with thier songs. Others highlights include: Suicide Bounce w/Busta Rhymes(Sick ass beat!!!) Virgo w/Ludacris and Doug E. Fresh Beatboxing!!! The Makings of a Perfect B#$%h. Overall this is a hot album from one of the best rappers ever!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This is one of the few double albums that has little or no fillers in it.

I don't think your rap collection would be complete without this album. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Likely the best double album since Life After Death...","review":"This is a killer album, to say the least, easily Nas's best effort since Illmatic. Nas, who is often criticized for his inconsistency, lacks none in this album, as even the more commercial joints like \\"Makings of a Perfect B****\\" have a unique and well thought out plot. Nas uses mainly Salam Remi, Chucky Thompson and L.E.S. as his producers, all of which try and bring back the old school and golden era of hip hop back into this album. Surprisingly, the last track (excluding the banger \\"Thief's Theme\\") \\"Me and You\\", where Nas harmonizes all thru the track, actually seems fit, and doesn't fit in with the corniness of past rappers singing like Eminem on the Eminem Show. All in all, a must buy for the Christmas season.Top 5 songs:Just a MomentLive NowStreets DiscipleWarRest of my life"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Album","review":"Nas did really good with his last output: Street's Disciple. Nas is still one of the smartest storytellers in Hip-Hop history. Even though he should have cut down some of the tracks and made it into a single CD, I still enjoyed it. The most stand-out track on this album is \\"U.B.R.-Unauthorized Biography of Rakim\\". If you had never heard or knew anything about Rakim until this song, then you will know who he is and what he has done by the end. His lyricism has not fallen off from any of his albums. None of his albums can be compared to each other. You can tell that he has grown from Illmatic all the way to this album.

Instead of making a two disc C.D. set, Mr. Jones should have just taken maybe 8 from each disc to make one 16 track album(could have cut out the album filler that way, this album has alot of filler)!

Straight up. The whole cd (with the exception of makings of a perfect bitch) is great. I would give a standout song list but id have to list the whole cd, so ill leave it to you to sample it. The only problem i have is the fact that this is a double album. Nas would have made it better cut in half and sold seperately, especially since we're probably going to have to wait a couple years for another release.

This double album is much better than 2pac's \\"All Eyes On Me\\" (sorry 2pac fans, this is the truth) and is probably the best two disc album in rap's short history. Simply put, there are no filler songs on this album, which is quite rare for double albums. My favorite jam on the album has to be \\"War\\" (no it is not an anti-Bush rant so don't ask).

This spoils two promising songs.The 2nd cd has some good tunes like Suicide Bounce, Virgo, Bridging Tha Gap and War. Some songs I think are just to fill up the numbers like U.B.R, Getting Married and Remember The Times which has an intro thats counted as a song, with the song being below average.It's an album worth getting as out of the 26 songs theres about 18 worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juggernaut","review":"Nas has done it and will continue to do it as long as he has air in his lungs and the energy to spit a verse.

He's poetic, he's deep and he keep's it real. ALL this talk about how he contracdicts himself, well HE DOESN't. He's HUman and like us, he goes through different events, feelings and emotions in life, and all that is put into records. Thats da way its suppose to be.

As you start getting to grips with Russian (or English) you will definetly need a 'heavier' dictionary.

Native Chinese teachers who don't even bother to read the numerous monolingual books in Chinese (students can't use them because there's no English) often claim that they can't be explained. This book proves them wrong. Scholars might be concered with some individual entries, which might reflect Taiwanese usage more than Mandarin, but for the student this is a minor matter.

A weak comeback attempt after 4 years out, this album is little more than a pale shadow of Roxy Music's early work. 'Dance Away', 'Still Falls the Rain' and 'Ain't That So' are good Roxy tracks but the rest falls short. The title track is almost abhorrent. If they were looking for new musical styles, then they found it on the next one 'Flesh and Blood' and 'Avalon'. Forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ill fated comeback attempt","review":"Roxy Music broke up after Siren, leaving fans wanting more, but with a near perfect catalog.

You can recognize the classic Roxy Music by few songs like Manifesto, but the main line is softer than ever, till then. Actually, \\"Manifesto\\" is more Bryan Ferry solo, although Manzanera and Mackay did some writing work too. Ferry took the rocky \\"Angel eyes\\" and make it a disco version, that luckily, is not in \\"Manifesto\\". \\"Stronger through the years\\" can make you sleep, \\"Trash\\" is not far from being trash, \\"Dance away\\" takes you directly to the next dead album, \\"Flesh and blood\\", and the rest is boring - the last word to describe Roxy albums till then."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Roxy Music Album","review":"This disc would be more beloved if it weren't for the exceptional strength of the Roxy Music catalog. For fans that prefer Roxy Music, the band, over Roxy Music as a Bryan Ferry back-up band, Manifesto is truly primo stuff.The sound of Manifesto is much, much more varied than the mush that was Avalon. Half of the ten tracks were co-written (4 by Manzanera, 1 by Mackay). Many minor quirks in the sound -- enough to give it that Roxy distinctiveness without calling too much attention to cleverness for its own sake. With few exceptions, these songs just could not have been created by any artists other than Roxy Music. Sometimes it rocks out, other times it sighs.

I could not remove the metal cap. After time, it rusted and became stuck on my valve stem. I checked the other tires and two others were completely corroded and/or rusted in place. I could not get them off and could not grip the valve stem any harder or risk twisting it off. I tried everything over the next few days, including penetrating oils and heat. I could not get them off. Finally, I had to take the car into my local tire shop and have new valve stems put it.

And it does so perfectly.I have to also give the authors praise for writing this in a very understandable, conversational type English.

Every page was painful. Characters who appear, disappear and reappear 100 pages later and you don't remember who they are. Too many plots and subplots. I could only read a few pages at a time before I became physically exhausted. There were long rambling sections which were excerpts from the dictionary he was writing. These entries did not advance the plot or characters and I just didn't care. The characters were so one dimensional, that you just fail to connect with any of them. I made it 3/4 of the way through and finally just raised the white flag.Other reviews here reference how difficult the book is to read yet give it 4 or 5 stars.

Wasn't able to read it all the way through, ran out of patience around page 200. I can't remember having ever met an author with such an irritating \\"style\\". Norfolk's pretentiousness is only equalled by his inaptitude. He jampacks his novel with unexpected historical and cultural references, but unlike Eco, he only seems pedantic and smarty. The action itself is pulled by the hair, far from even pretending credibility. At regular intervals nebulous effusions occur, meant to give an \\"artistic\\" spin to the sub-pulp quality of it all.

Ok, so the suspense wasn't quite the same, but a lot of the narrative/plot made more sense.

It was dissapointing to see how much juice was still contained in the pulp and how much pulp seeped into the juice itself. I am not particularly crazy about straining my juice after it comes out of the juicer. The feeding tube is so tiny you have to quarter an apple for it to fit in. Not as easy to clean as Breville either, even though it's definitely a plus that you don't have to worry about the pulp collecting in the juicer and can go on indefinitely. At least that's what I hear.

With great detail to the action, Prata brings the Knights of Malta to life once again.It is perhaps ironic that it does give some insight into the mind of Islam, given current world events. If you, like me, find tales of heroism in the face of unimaginable odds to be irresistable, this book fits the bill.One thing I would have liked to have seen was more background on the knights and their motivations.

Very good historical fiction, nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This book might be ok if you're a pre-teen in the early 1950's or before.For anyone else, this is just uninformed, badly written, inaccurate and clich��-ridden drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood and Death","review":"I enjoyed this refreshingly fast paced historical novel about a crucial 1565 Christian/Islamist confrontation at the island of Malta (just south of Italy). Christian knights against Islamic Janissaries in a months long siege of the vastly outnumbered and outgunned Christian defenders of the island.Prada excels in his description of weapons, military tactics and the grisly, brutal reality of 16th century hand to hand combat with swords, axes, pikes, spears and the like. He tries hard, and to an extent succeeds, in making you almost smell the blood, dust, urine, feces and rot of the battlefield.But I would have liked more historical context and many of the battlefield scenes in the second half of the book seemed plagiarized from the first half. He also goes a little overboard with his superhuman knights against the brave but dumb Turk horde.But read the book.

Akhenaten is my absolute hero and I don't know where these people who detract from him including in this work think they'll get off taking untruthful and cheap shots at him. Obviously, they are afraid to look further into the sheer beauty and kindness which radiates from both him and his brilliant poetry.

I know it's pretty cheap at the moment, and if a cheap basketball game is all you're looking for, I would try an older 2k or NBA Live game. Way too easy, a lack of good game modes, boring gameplay, and the fact that it's offline now are some of the problems this game has...

You can pull your controller up to the left and hit the pass button trying to get the ball to a wide open teammate and it will pass it to a guy behind you to the right.- Too many slam dunks, had 12 dunks in a row in one game- Limited number of set plays (4 on offense and 3 on defense)- No defensive controls expect poke at the ball which 90% of the time just gets a foul called on you- Season mode is a joke as wellOverall- One of the worse sports games Ive played in a long time, its a sham that this game was released in the state it is in."},{"rating":"1","title":"review from Roma","review":"Hello music fan - here is 'Alto' from Italia - I return this cd because it was too \\"hollywood\\" for me - it sound like nothing like what I expect - i like the lofi of Savage Isles more.

Yes i admit that the tones are cool but they're songwriting is not anywhere as interesting as other bands of the genre - namely the Untamed Youth, Boss Martians, MOAM, and others.

The shopping cart experience was unusual. I was charged sales tax even though I ordered the product from another state. I was given the final price and then afterwards was charged sales tax (per the receipt) because it was shipped from a company in my same state.

I find that a pair of shoes drys from daily wear within 8 hours. It also works well for drying shoes or boots that have become soaked in rain or snow or after washing. Let the shoes drain slightly so they are no longer dripping and you can expect them to be fully dry in as little as 8-12 hours. Operates silently (by convection) using an elegantly simple design so there is no motor to wear out.I have been using my shoe dryer for over a year and am very happy with it.

This book is somewhat interesting, and has at least two pages worth of excerpts humorous enough to share with a class, but I feel that for so little real humor, I wasted my money buying an entire book. Now I must confess, I've only read half the book (trying to find the stamina to continue), so I just might find a few more funny pages, but so far I'm disappointed, and if I weren't a teacher, I wouldn't finish or keep the book at all.

Following in the footsteps of Stephen Covey, Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer, he has abandoned legitimate science and moved into the touchy-feely realm of self-help psychology, by appealing to people's thirst for easy answers to difficult life problems. Having been down that road many times with the aforementioned authors, I suggest avoiding said road like the plague! Life does not offer easy answers. Changing attitudes and behavior is hard work, and anyone who tells you otherwise is a charlatan.By contrast, Dr. Aaron Beck, the founder of Cognitive Therapy, is a brilliant scientist - I repeat, SCIENTIST - who built a school of psychology one brick at a time - through careful research and testing.

Other sets are cheaper, so you go for them, but you end up frustrated. That's what happened to me as well. This is the best set on the market for general woodworking and furniture building (I am not including specialized bits and screws professional cabinet makers use). The drills are sharp and longer than competing sets, which gives you added flexibility to adjust depth. The collar has multiple cutters (BTW, Hitachi collars have just 1!) and 2 (not one!) screws to hold the collar in place without slipping. The end result is that you can make clean, precise cut every time, without splinters, without fear that the collar will slip. If I had to do it all over again, I would have bought this set right away.

I'm am the second person who bought this same set and had the same problem. I will probably replace the center tapered bit with a regular bit and continue to use the countersink but I most likely won't buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings at best","review":"I have been using these bits on red oak for a project today. They work fine if I am drilling through 3/4 in boards but when drilling into end grain the fluting does not clear out quickly enough and then they discolor and come out with burnt material and smoke rolling off. This happens less on low speed for my drill, on high speed it is near flames. Happens on my cordless drill so I tried my drill press and had the same result. Again, pre-drilling the boards and countersinking them the bit is great as for going full depth in hardwood - not so much; I went back to a regular bits. Also note, when using the drill press - raising the bit out of the hole 3 times during drilling minimize the burning as it cleared out the bit - that is not the intent of this for me since it was meant to be used on a cordless drill."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"I bought these bits at the local home depot.

That's it. This book goes on and on basically repeating that. Listing examples of patients (non traders) who the author helped with their personal problems and then drawing analogy to trader's pitfalls. If you're good at decision making in general, disciplined and like to work hard and learn always, then you most probably will make it in the markets. I wouldn't recommend this book on a trader's shelf. You better off reading \\"Come Into My Trading Room\\". It asserts the same concepts without filling a whole book for it.

I don't see how that works in a trading environment and is a rather simplistic view of psychology in general and so I give a pass.

Maybe he doesn't realize that there's a bubble in psychologists who think they can help losing traders. I don't think there's anything more weird than a half-trader, half-psychologist. If they're so good, then why aren't they full-time traders themselves? You'll find the typical \\"trading is war\\" analogies and hey, look at how those professional athletes train! Guess what folks?

I wish there had been the option of having an opening or not. Better yet, a flat rack like the one offered for the left side would have been IDEAL! Regarding the plastic coating, beware, it does melt if hot items are placed in/on it. I wish there was generic for this item with improvements.

This book along with And There was Light by Jacques Lusseyran are the most powerful books I have found about the 2nd World War in France. Perhaps it was made especially poignant because my uncle was a paratrooper at Normandie. He, much like my father who was the radio operator on US subs during WW 2, refused to talk about his war experience. So I sought it out in this unlikely form; through the words of a young French girl. The utter stark honesty of her painful upbringing, told without judgement shows a soul who has learned to forgive and to see the dignity of even the most beastly. Genevieve, who received the highest civilian citation for her work is to congratulated, the book highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, disappointing and expensive product.","review":"Pay heed to all the comments above from the previous reviewer - also read the epinions comments.

This book is one of the few that offer code where register_globals is \\"off\\" as had been my problem with other books.

Variables are created on the fly and creates some error messages with uptodate PHP. The explanations of certain things requires several readings sometimes to fill in blanks that a beginner should have explained. The use of CSS is not even mentioned so far and the html does not meet Xhtml standards.

I was humming along to the catchy hooks in 'wannabe'; 'can't come down' stuck in my head and I was singing the refrain in the shower for a couple of days; 'reason' scared me silly the first time through with its dark tones and seemingly darker message, but in the end it turned around for me into a clarion call of triumph and resistance instead of a dirge of capitulation, submission and decay.

I first purchased this nailer when a remodeling project required 8d nails be driven under an existing roof line that provided less than 7 inches of vertical clearance. Clearly not a hammer job. I've driven 8d - 16d nails with roughly equal success, although the smaller nails will occassionally bend if the drive angle is not consistantly maintained. If you can't tolorate an occassional bent nail, I've found using stick nails (purchased for my Porter Cable F350 nail gun) solves the problem. Although I originally pruchased the palm nailer for use in difficult-to-reach locations, I've grown to using it more in situations where convential tools would also work. It's light-weight (unlike conventional nail guns), drives a 16d nail in less than 2 seconds, and, at the end of a remodeling day, doesn't send me home with a sore wrist and arm. All in all, a very good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"try another brand","review":"Those of you who contract remodel jobs know just how handy a palm nailer can be installing Simpson hardware in those hard to get at places.

To be fair I can only speak for Savage Island, but this album was entirely disappointing. Like I said I am a fan of surf ROCK, but this has no backbone at all. It lacks that certain punch that we love in other bands. It's really more like lounge music. It's fairly soft, meandering and to be frank a bit boring.

Home Invasion is a near classic because of the hard beats and fresh lyrics. This sounds too produced. I think Ice T fans will get the most out of this.

Mr. Morris' books are for young people. This is where they will get information not only about Gypsies but about their significance in the Holocaust.

Pete spoofs many popular movies (ie: The Matrix, Aliens), television shows (ie: Star Trek, X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, etc.), and on occassion real-life events. Pete has managed to create a unique comic strip with deep and involving story-lines, well-developed characters, and a new twist on talking animals (a cute bunny-rabbit with a switchblade, a glock, and an attitude that would make Dirty Harry proud).I highly recommend this and the other Sluggy books to those who love comic strips, good humor, comic books, and Harry Potter books (hey, I've seen all of you adults reading the Harry Potter books! )."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, and remarkable guitar!","review":"I searched the stores in vain for 6 months for this cd, and found it on Amazon in less than one minute!

The production work are incredible, every track gets your adrenaline pumping. The beats respect hip-hop's history, with old school tracks like \\"Criminal Set\\". The album, particularly \\"Tough Guy\\" and \\"Scent of a Woman\\" feature honestly creative production work - not something you see on a lot of mainstream rap these days. More modern sentiments are represented as well, particularly on \\"Klack Klack Klack\\". There's a lot of good production going on on each of these tracks.Xzibit's rhymes are good, but they can't measure up to the beats. He's at his best when he just cuts loose and has some fun, as on \\"Back 2 the Way it Was\\" or \\"Tough Guy\\". When he tries to make political points, as on \\"Cold World\\", he comes off as pretentious.

The best thing I could say about this album is that it's consistent, unfortunatly for us, it is consistently bad throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"By far the worst Xzibit album I've ever heard.

Other than that, \\"Criminal Set\\", the Busta Rhymes-featured \\"Tough Guy\\", the anti-Bush intro \\"State of the Union\\", and Muthaf---a are the only good tracks. Guest appearances AND production are terrible. His new group, Strong Arm Steady, is more annoying than Cam'ron and The Diplomats, to say the least.

The screws were brittle, however. Half of them broke while installing. I substituted sheet metal screws which worked just fine.

The aluminum is easy enough to cut with a standard hacksaw (I used a vice to hold the sweep while I cut).Before inserting the screws, you'll want to use a 3/16\\" or so drill bit to pre-drill the holes in the door. Even then, if you tighten the screws snugly, the heads will pop off on a few. I had two of the included screws' heads pop off when installing, which mean I had to grab out a couple sturdier screws.Just buy a few sheet metal screws or better wood screws to go along with this sweep and you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Well, like all other 900mhz DSS phones I've heard, this one has poor sound quality (I had reason to hope since I own one of Panasonic's excellent 900mhz analog phones).

I called my wife as a test, and she said it sound like I was talking in a box. Alas, for those of you wanting a phone with digital security that sounds good, I have no answer.

I exchanged it at Target (hoping it was just a dud). However, after watching about 6 movies on the new one, the screen started going blank again. It was very frustrating. Sometimes you could get it to come back on by fiddling with it, but this meant you had to start the movie over and skip back to where you were. I do not reccomend buying this unit.

Even the back cover contains rudimentary grammatical gaffes. It tries to be folksy and comes off as a tedious amateurish effort.The substance, pointers about travel (for which I'd bought the book), could be easily condensed to five pages.The 'humorous' anecdotes are rarely funny (though there are a couple of good laughs) and often seem unlikely to have happened in the first place.It seems as though someone had a brilliant idea: Whilst trying to rough it through airline-imposed wage cuts, write a book on air travel.

Now I am stuck with an item that cannot be used and cost me a pretty penny to boot or of course I can sell it on Amazon myself, for less and pay the shipping.

For those of you that \\"must\\" have the tools used on Hometime or other home show of choice, go ahead and spend the extra money for the 18v gear. Then enjoy it's extra weight and size. Ever tried installing a sink with an 18v driver? Oh, you haven't lived yet. In most cases if you need more oomph than a pro quality 12v tool can provide, you need a corded tool.

And yet, you're not gonna believe this, but Faulkner's muse alights from the book at about the three-quarter-way mark. But instead of winding it up at that point, as he well could have, he putts along a little way under effort-power until it all folds up just the same.To weigh in on the comparisons with Cormac McCarthy: Faulkner does a better job of reading his characters' minds and motivations, whereas the 'Child of God' eschews such trivia for matters of greater substance. It's like Faulkner has a greater knowledge of literature; and McCarthy a greater knowledge of life. Or Faulkner has seven eggs in the mind basket and five in the heart; and McCarthy vice-versa -- which actually makes him a little bit smarter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intersecting lights","review":"This is not my favorite of Faulkner's novels--I like SOUND, ABSALOM, and DYING more--but it is still a great read. It's a little more linear in plot than the others, which makes for an easier read despite its considerable length. The Hightower section at the end of the novel is a little cumbersome and I think Faulkner might have been drinking a little too much while writing it.Favorite passage: 'It is because a fellow is more afraid of the trouble he might have than he ever is of the trouble he's already got. He'll cling to trouble he's used to before he'll risk a change.' (Byron Bunch)"},{"rating":"2","title":"light in august","review":"I tried to re-read Faulkner's novels, Light in August, was the first one followed by Absalom, Absalom and The Sound and The Fury.Faulkner's work is so well known that there is hardly anything one can add to all the critiques expressed.I find though that one has to have a lot of patience to plow thru those novels, despite the best of good will, the novels are a bit dated after all. It may well be that television and movies spoiledones attention span for Faulkner's meticulous descriptions. Or one simply has no interest in books one read for school and college. At any rate for me it was not a fruitful endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow I did not like this book","review":"A friend recommended this to me. I cannot belive how wrong he was about it. First off, I found it extremely annoying and confusing that there were several characters who had the same or similar names; it was kinda hard to keep track of who was who or what was going on. Second, and my main problem with the book is that I just could not relate with or even like one character in this book. I can't connect with a book if I hate every single character. Overall, this book was just dismal, although its one redeeming quality was its narratives about racism and the differences between whites and blacks. That is the only thing keeping me from giving this a one star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine characterization","review":"I enjoyed this book much more than I expected. It explores the questions of race thoroughly without hitting the reader over the head with it. The characters seem real, neither demonic nor angelic. The impact of race is ultimately devastating to Joe Christmas and many of the people around him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character driven story telling","review":"This story was published in 1932 and was written for a different kind of audience than today's reader. Most people don't realize that Faulkner was a failed poet who paradoxically made his mark as a long winded writer prone to run-on sentences with poor punctuation. But, he brought his characters to life! Somehow he made you feel what his characters were feeling. And, that ability marked him as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleven Days In August","review":"This book has been touted as being Faulkner's most accessible. Although a bit easier to follow having less stream of consciousness it still requires some patience and appreciation for nuance. Further, if you take the story at face value you will be missing out on 90% of what it has to offer. The themes run deep and the characters symbolic. I'd recommend reading exerpts from One Matchless Time by Jay Parini who provides some good insights into Faulkner's life and his writings. I'd also read the review written by A.Mason (below). This was one of the more violent and sexual books that I have read of Faulkner. Although I was surprised, I was in awe of his tact and style in portraying these events in a subtly gruesome way that takes the reader off gaurd. The climactic scene of Joe Christmas's undoing was Faulkner at his best. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves good writing and is fascinated with the tragedy of the post-Civil War southerner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the \\"Best of\\" but entertaining !","review":"It was so much fun watching these old episodes !

Finally, 40 years later, I do.Granted, some of the magic is gone. Most of the special effects are pretty lame by today's standards, and the monsters are about as scary as a stuffed teddy bear.

It's a masterpiece, a unique work of a genius called Irwin Allen; a TV show that will probably never be equalized.It's not difficult to make a pretentious and \\"serious\\" sci-fi show like Star Trek, any cinema student could make it. But you need much more than that to create anthologycal pieces like Lost in Space (or even Star Wars), with the right doses of humor and absurd.LIS is not only for children, but for everyone with an open mind. It happens in outer space, but talks to something inside of us, cause the characters are so convincingly human.Thank you, Mr. Irwin, for taking my childhood through fantastic worlds and beings. And, most of all, for making me feel like a child facing the universe, even when I'm 45 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Happened???","review":"Thrilled to see that the first season of LOST IN SPACE was to be released in January 2004 at a reasonable price I find it odd that now it is posted in the Amazon catalog as 'not being in production' with no price listed....What happened???I was hopeful that the release in January would lead to the release of the hysterical 2nd and 3rd seasons....now it is very questionable as to whether it would happen.Oh the pain, the pain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Violence Been Cut Out Of Episodes?","review":"I have just been re-watching Season 1 and am concerned that \\"Return from Outer Space\\" has had a cut.Will Robinson steals a bottle of carbon tetrachloride and runs out of the store.Next thing we see is Will and the store owner talking to the Sheriff outside the store.Was an action scene cut out or is it just poor continuity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharing a little of my childhood","review":"Lost in Space has been a guilty pleasure of mine since I was a child. Granted, Jonathan Harris is often over the top and the plots were sometimes ridiculous, but as a young boy I was captivated.However, since buying this set my love of the series has grown even more. My five-year old daughter loves this show, and it is one of the few shows we can both really enjoy. The lessons the program attempted to stress, at least during year one:togetherness, rejection of greed and laziness, and most of all family...resonate today just as it did in the early '60's.I can't wait for season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danger Will Robinson","review":"Watched Lost in Space when it first came out in '66 (thats when it arrived in Australia) I have been waiting for the DVD for 37 years !I hope Fox release the rest of the series, Otherwise Danger !

Everything was state of the art including the robot. The first season was in black and white and was by far the most interesting. Initially the series had serious storylines that centered around the Robinson family members. Subsequent seasons became sillier and focused on Dr. Smith, the robot and young Will Robinson. The rest of the cast was mostly ignored and the quality of the show suffered.

It was aimed at 8 year olds.","review":"Stephen has aptly summed up the problem with Lost In Space. It WAS aimed at 8 year-olds. Those of us who were around 16 when it came out found it unsophisticated, boring, and silly fluff compared to the far more intellectually stimulating Star Trek. That's why the Lost In Space movie bombed too - it was as awful as the TV show - while Star Trek spawned a number of superb films and all manner of stellar spin-off TV series. Long live Star Trek. Lost In Space was a yawner. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The \\"Lost Space\\" In Your Home","review":"Only television fans who have cash, time and shelf-space to burn should consider acquiring this boxed set, and only then if they have a strong masochistic streak. How could this series have been so popular?Admittedly, the production values of the DVD boxed set itself are quite high. It's a well-made and attractive set. But the show itself is nearly unwatchable. The first few episodes are so sluggishly paced and woodenly acted, with such protracted pauses in the dialogue, that they seem endless even without the commercials.A big disappointment. What promised to be a nostalgic and campy pleasure turned out to be a tedious waste. I have been unable to bring myself to watch the entire set; I can but hope the later episodes were an improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was worth the wait!","review":"I have loved \\"Lost in Space\\" since I was a kid.

I am watching it on my computer and the resolution is quite good. I even noticed that Don is wearing a necklace in the \\"Oasis\\" episode!

I'm 48 and plan to purchase this as a X-mas present for my brother. We all grew up loving the show and to this day still mimmick the lines of Dr. Smith. In my opinion I believe that Jonathan Harris character of Dr.Smith truly made the show. If it was Allen's decision or the Exec's to turn Smith from a villian to a scaredy cat /comedian it was pure genius that made the show. It allowed Harris to shine in this role.Of course to this day one of my family's favorite episodes was \\"The Promise Planet.\\" -----\\"It's like freaky man! Real freaky! We're going to freak out together!\\"\\"Dr.Smith what happened to you?\\" --Will\\"I'm way out man, like the rest of you cats!\\" --Smith\\"Wow man you're ready to groove!\\"--Penny\\"Yeah!

Danger Will Robertson!!","review":"I had the wonderful fortune to meet Jonathan Harris a couple years before he died. He was in a bookstore and he was so lively and fun to talk to. I was a big fan as a kid.They are corney - to the extreme - the effects are left over Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (both Irwin Allen productions so you would see a monster on Voyage one week and Lost in Space the next!). The early part of the series tried to be more serious in tone, and it dragged, but as the robot and Dr. Smith were pushed forward, the episodes became more campy and great fun!So have a ball.

Like many, I was a kid when I became addicted to Lost in Space (about 1969). Around that time I moved to Puerto Rico and wondered if I'd ever see it again. To my surprise, it soon arrived in Puerto Rico -- dubbed in Spanish. So, it was an added bonus to me that this DVD collection also has the Spanish dubbing of each Season 1 episode. Believe me, not much was lost in the translation. Still, nothing compares to hearing Dr. Smith in his native English. For those who like \\"special features\\", this DVD may come as a disappointment since it only has two (the unaired pilot and a featurette).

I was drilling kitchen cabinets for a screw hole so it was not heavy duty use. The \\"break\\" did not occur on the drill bit itself, but where the drill bit fits into the hex shaft. The bits are actually two pieces, a regular drill bit which is pressed/inserted into a hex shaft. Since it was exposed, I was able to see that the drill bit shaft had a flattened area that apparently is supposed to be held by another flat area inside the hex shaft. I was able to reinsert the drill bit back into the hex shaft and turn it freely by hand. Whatever was supposed to \\"catch\\" and keep the bit from spinning was obviously long gone. Hopefully I just had a bad batch. Amazon is replacing them and I'll see how they do. Knowing what I know now, I'd probably opt for a one piece hex drill bit, rather than what turned out to be a two piece setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smallest bit spun out","review":"Smallest bit spun out of its holder on first use, rendering it useless.

This oriole feeder goes in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed well for orioles","review":"Although this is a nice looking feeder, it is very impractical. The only reason I gave it even one star is because the hummingbirds like to drink from it. The basic problem with it is that the the length of the perches are way too short for the size of an oriole. They land on them and cannot drink. They then try to reach around to the next hole to drink and cant't reach, get frustrated and leave. Now, if a hummingbird can sit on the perch and drink wouldn't you think an oriole might be too big? They are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"As received, the two-piece plastic base was poorly assembled and could not hold water. Fortunately, it was so badly made that the problem was obvious. After much fiddling to mate the pieces together as intended, it still leaked. The parts were warped and did not line up well. A tube of crazy glue completed the construction of this product, creating a leak-free reservoir. The plastic threads on the base looked trouble-prone, but did screw together satisfactorily with the glass tank. Looking at the placement of the perches, I wonder if a Baltimore Oriole (what I get) will be able to use this feeder. Be sure to mount with perches pointing down, not up. Will try bending them further down to increase the distance from feeder ports. It is a very attractive feeder, but will look even better if the orioles use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive but needs to be redesigned","review":"This is a very attractive feeder, but it needs to be redesigned to be more friendly to orioles. When I received mine I found that the perches were much too short for orioles to sit and feed comfortably from the nectar holes. After assembling the feeder and comparing its perches to those of other oriole feeders offered on the internet, I returned the feeder to the seller. This was with some regret because I thought it was quite beautiful in appearance. The illustration doesn't show the birds actually feeding so one doesn't know if they can easily drink the nectar. This product was a disappointment, but I think it could have been redesigned to make a more oriole friendly source of nectar and a really beautiful addition to one's garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oriole feeder","review":"DOES NOT ATTRACT ORIOLES, JUST HUMMERS.

After drilling five holes through a 18 gauge flat sheet of aluminum it was finished. On the sixth hole it just spun but didn't cut.This Chinese manufactured drill bit is made out of cheap metal that is just a bit harder than the aluminum that I was trying to drill eight holes in. The last new DeWalt item I bought, a circular saw, was made in Mexico, but has performed well for the past 8 months.

Has a separate on-off switch, easier to turn off, other similar torches usually only have a gas valve.2. This item has good quality of metal finishing.Cons:1. Not good for a torch.2. Hard to light.This item is fine if you are going to use it for soldering, because if you move the torch around an object to heat it, most of the time, the flame will go off, as the other reviewer has stated. (after it goes off, you can still hear the strong hiss of gas flow, so it is not a gas amount problem) This usually won't happen when you solder, because you will hold the pencil with certain angle towards the spot you are soldering. Besides, this item is hard to light, you have to hold your match right at the tip for a while to light, before it is fully ignited you will see the flame goes on and off. Other torches I have, they just take one click of the piezo button to light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away for all costs","review":"Used maily for soldering. The torch does not have built-in igniter and the re-fulling vent is of a poor quality, it failed after two refillings with ORIGINAL refill kits. It worked for me for a month - it's waste of money. Owned different butane torch that was \\"made in China\\" that was faaar superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay lit, just goes out all the time.","review":"Torch always goes out, especially when you turn it up. When you turn off the red switch, it doesn't immediately turn off. It's barely hot enough to melt silver bearing solder and then the torch flame goes out while gas is still released causing you to restart heating up your parts. Probably better off just using a standard plumbers torch to rock up the heat and have your weld quickly happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a better one","review":"As many others have already noted: goes out easily, difficult to light when wanting to use the soldering tip.

Anyone who reads this book should also read \\"Chizzuk Emunah Emet\\" (True Faith Strengthened) by Rabbi Jechial Tzvi Lichtenstein. R' Lichtenstein was a 19th century Rabbi who became a follower of Yeshua (Jesus) as his Messiah. His book, \\"Chizzuk Emunah Emet\\", written in Hebrew, but an English translation is on its way, was a strong rebuttal to this book by Troki. Fellow Jews should take Troki's arguments with a grain of salt, seeing that he was a karraite, not believing in the oral law.

This is another CD that does not hit the mark.This guy is singing songs where the music does not give his voice the opportunity to be heard. I have about 5 of his CD's and mostly have been disappointed in all of them except his first. Billy Ray can sing a ballad probably better that anyone and with feeling. This is the music that would get him recognized not the screaming songs. He very rarely puts a ballad on any CD's but when he does they are great. From other CD's listen to \\"She's not cryin anymore\\" and \\"When I'm Gone\\" then you will see what I mean. I am not buying anymore of his CD's until I am sure he has some ballads on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRY AGAIN!","review":"This is absolutely the worst BRC cd I have ever heard. Where did this new voice of his come from? He sounds like a wimp! I am a very BIG BRC fan, but come on. You Won't Be Lonely Now and Southern Rain are the only two good songs on this CD! I gave 1/2 star to each song to get this rating. Billy Ray needs to find another \\"Achy Breaky Heart\\" hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy ain't Billy anymore","review":"Billy Ray has steadily declined in his performances with each passing album. I base this on a standard of true country music. His first two CDs were exceptional. However, this and his last have left Nashville and country music long behind.

Come on Billy how about gettin country again."},{"rating":"1","title":"[BAD]!","review":"What the hell is this! Billy Ray Cyrus has turned Rock and Roll. the billboard charts tricked me because one of the very few songs that actually made it to the radio called You won't be lonely now is such a great song I thought the whole album would sound similar to that. Southern Rain is the only other song that is good. Pardon me but I really don't think a song called Burn down the trailer park belongs on country radio , sounds like garbage Pot heads would listen to.

Each song on this CD brings you to a different mood, and you feel like you're getting a piece of BRC's heart with each one. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a true country music fan, and enjoy's CD's that you don't have to skip any of the tracks. Favorites include the prince charming-esqe \\"You Won't Be Lonely Now\\". The tender \\"I Will\\". And the soulful pleading in \\"Love You Back\\".

The 11-minute-plus live \\"So What\\" is harrowing and awesome, almost worth the price of admission alone. But other live versions, such as the pummeling 9-minute-plus \\"Stigmata\\" and the pounding \\"The Missing\\" also display absolute live concert bliss.This 6 song live album really captures the essence of Ministry's live sound, and it shows why Ministry is one the best bands to see live.

It has some old goodies like \\"Baby Got Back\\", and \\"Groove is in the Heart\\". These are two great songs that you wouldnt want to buy the cd, but love the single. Some old 70's songs are on it, too. The other Destiny's Child song, \\"Dot,\\" is a bit mediocre and was sloppily put together. But its catchy, and thats what counts, right? There arent many new songs on it, the Aerosmith song is alright, and the Fatboy Slim song isnt even the full version. I reccomend this cd to anyone that likes any of these songs, it is definately worth it overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The soundtrack has got some classics like Groove Is in The Heart and a pretty good remix of the Angels' theme, but that's about all. The new Aerosmith song is horrible and the song by Destiny Child is being played to death on the radio and on MTV/VH1. All the great music you thought you would hear from the action scenes are not in the soundtrack; instead, we get tired-out top 40 songs like Turning Japanese and Baby Got Back. If you feel like being silly and listen to has-been songs, you can get much better compilation albums for cheaper price. This is an album you would listent to once, maybe twice, and would forever thereafter gather dust on your shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"just fun","review":"have fun with this soundtrack?.

This is not a bad movie but it is really not a great movie. It isn't bad but it uses the character of Buford Pusser and the rural setting for a pretty much fictional story. Brian Denehy does an ok job as does Ken Howard as the heel but it doesn't stand up to Joe Don Baker in the origional flick. Not even sure it is as good as Walking Tall II or Final Chapter Walking Tall.

With intimate interviews, it also reveals the behind-the-scenes touches here and there that made this genre so different from hollywood. Included are interviews to set designers and stylists, with illustrations of sketches of sets, costumes. I was always touched by the \\"grunge\\" feel of the clothes worn by the actors, a torn shirt with holes and loose buttons, dirty boots. As one poster says: \\"he smokes short cigars, he has a long gun, he wears a poncho\\", and the interviews reveal how the \\"leone style\\" was created. Unfortunately there is no english translation of \\"L'avventurosa storia del cinema italiano raccontata dai suoi protagonisti\\" (Vol 2, 1981, Feltrinelli, F. Fofi), but this book beautifully selects the best of that time in a high-quality printed production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and Enjoyable","review":"This book is like an encyclopedia of Leone's Italian westerns.

His selection of titles is one you won't hear on anyone else's and they are all unforgettable. Of course, it is his great voice that makes it all come together. I keep his CD's and cassettes in the car and in my den so I can hear them wherever I go. Also have made copies of cassettes which were impossible to find to give to my friends.

So when I found the Dora skates for my daughter I just knew I would love them and she would too. THEY WERE AWFUL -- SIMPLY A WASTE OF MY MONEY!!! First I don't these skates are for 3-6 yr olds -- the wheels go back and forth just like real skates--THERE IS NO LOCK to hold them and teach a 3 year old how to skate (perhaps thats why they give you the safety pads because a 3 or 4 year old will DEFINITELY GET HURT when they put these on. The next problem is that package says the skates will adjust to fit shoe sizes 6-12, what they don't say is that the CHILD CAN'T WEAR GYM SHOES WITH THESE SKATES because the toe of the gym shoe WILL NOT FIT INTO THE SKATE!!! I looked at the packaging and the child on the package is actually wearing some kind of casual shoe. Most parents who allow their child to skate would probably put them in gym shoes just for safety reasons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and not so cheerful!","review":"These broke within minutes of being opened.

Howerver none of her sneakers fit in because of the small plastic arch around the toe. Only shoes we were able to find to fit in were ballet flats and slippers! She still loved to skate with slippers, but I did not like it at all for the safety. The rollers went too fast unless she stayed on carpet or grass. She finally learned to control by the brake this spring but it was too small for her by summer...

Scandinavia is fabulous, but this book won't get you too far. Unfortunately I haven't found one that will. ....The quality of the book is horrible. I was chasing pages down the streets of Tallinn cursing Rick's name two days ago. A tour book should be able to hold together. Carrying it around is really the point, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Thin","review":"Although I've found several of the Rick Steve's books great, this one is not. I'm staying in Stockholm for four months and the book simply does not cover many things in Sweden. There's very little mention of the archipelago around Stockholm. The treatment of the Stockholm museums is equally weak. I think Sweden desreves a book of it's own -- not folded into a Norway, Sweden, Denmark book where none get the attention they deserve. I have the Rick Steve's Scotland book. That's an example of the treatment Sweden should get. In the particular treatment of Stockholm, I wonder if Steve (or his staff) wrote it from the view of a person taking a boat here and having only a day or two.

Only a few of the songs really showcase Billy's vocal talent. (By the way, Charlotte steals the show in the duet.) I get the feeling this album was sort of thrown together on the wave of \\"One Voice\\"'s success. Don't expect the polish of the prior album. If you just can't get enough of this kid, youll probably like it. If you are in the market for a new christmas album, you can't go wrong here.

I figured he was just there as a warm up band for George Thorogood. On the contrary his performance was outstanding. Shades of Stevie Ray Vaughn,Jimi Hendrix,Eric Clapton and Duane Almond came through the intricate guitar work. Some of the music was laced with the old style jam session with vocals that were powerful.Throughout the entire show the music held a special quality that was all his own. After the gig I purchased this cd and So,It's like that. Both cd's are an accurate reflection of the live version. If you get a chance to see this performer don't miss it. Don't be surprised !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues Rock Gem","review":"I bought this under the recommendation of Amazon. I am quite impressed. This guy has a gritty, soulful Greg Allman or Jonny Langish voice. There's alot of SRV-Type blues mixed with rock riffs. He's a much better guitarist than he leads you to believe. My reluctance to give it 5 stars is based on the fact that his choice of guest musicians (Leslie West? Rick Derringer?) although credible, detract rather than add to their tracks on this CD. This guy has alot more up his sleeve and I can't wait to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guitarist","review":"Joe Bonamassa is one of the best guitar players to come along in a while. Not a bad singer either! His style is listenable, unlike some of these 90 notes a second guys around. If you're a fan of the blues, and good rock, you'll like Joe.

Buy it and play it loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR HEAVY METAL-POP-BLUES-AND ROCK FANS","review":"Joe Bonamassa is similar to Walter Trout. Heavy metal mixed in with a lot of other styles. He may be a better guitar player: he doesn't play 2200 npm (notes per minute), a phrase a reviewer labeled Alvin Lee. He's an excellent singer, and a fairly good songwriter, on his contributions. You will like this disc more as you listen to good songs like: CRADLE ROCK (heavy metal); WALK IN MY SHADOWS (blues); A NEW DAY YESTERDAY (metal); IF HEARTACHES WERE NICKLES (slower blues); and CURRENT SITUATION (soul blues). He does his best singing on HEARTACHES WERE NICKLES, sounding a lot like Janis Joplin. All the numbers on A NEW DAY YESTERDAY are worth listening to: a can't miss buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this disc because my brother is a big fan of this guy. He's also very much into Stevie Ray Vaughn. Trouble is, Joe Bonamassa is basically a Stevie Ray clone here. Lot's of hard driving blues rock with the guitar front and center. But there is nothing new here that wasn't done better earlier - like Stevie Ray or Buddy Guy etc. The songwriting is a bit weak. My big complaint is the lack of variety in the music. I expect guys who are basically \\"guitar heros\\" to mix it up a bit - a la Jeff Beck or Eric Johnson. There is an all too brief flourish of acoustic guitar playing that only leaves you wanting more. Sadly the album just winds up being repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST","review":"This compilation takes the viewer from the video history of the music, the artistry, and the transformations of the brilliant k.d. to the music from the motion picture Salmonberries.

If it's dynamic, intense, eerie, exciting, or spooky it's on disc one and yes John (then known as Johnny) Williams wrote it. In fact John williams' best work was the music he wrote for Lost In Space. And yes he wrote Lost In Space's best music. If it's quirky, silly, a little generic, or mildly interesting it's on Disc two and written by the other composers. Alexander Courage of Star trek tv series fame to mention one. The CD is out in my car and I'm too lazy to go out and get it. Plus I'm in my undies anyway. The only thing that seems to be missing is that very sad moving piece used in Cave Of The Wizards, but best remembered in Trip Through The Robot where the robot's mechanical heart beats one final time and Dr Smith tries to console Will.

Theirs is properly made, well packaged and quite nice, and not much more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like this book but...","review":"I like Rake's. I don't mind bad boy behavior but Jered was a bore and over the top in his poor behavior and as for our heroine, Tessa - get some self-esteem!!! It is all well that she wanted to be his friend, wanted sex, he was gorgeous, but to be constantly made aware of his poor behavior (kissing his mistress in front of her) well, get a grip girl. He deserved to be spanked for such boorish behavior. This was not romantic, just a story of a world weary man taking advantage of a young girl. If only Ms. RAnney had given Tessa some backbone, like her mother. Also, the Jered showed such disrespect for his in-laws too that there was really nothing to like about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hero's character was too flawed!","review":"I thought kept hoping that Jered would reform but it didn't happen until the very end of the story--but it was too little too late. By the time Jered was penitent and realized his mistakes, it was too late for me to like him. Tessa was excessive in her forgiving nature. I kept wishing she would exhibit some spunk, a spark of independence or teach him a much deserved lesson. She never really does and I was further annoyed/disappointed. I suppose her nature is much preferred to those overly proud characters found in other books-- but I would like to see a little more backbone. I found her character to be a bit annoying, overly child like. She prattled on, asking too many silly questions.I am not saying that this novel is entirely without merit, it had its momments, but on the whole it was mediocre.Still, I find Reding has a nice writing style. I will still give her other books a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upon a Wicked Time..not a treasure","review":"It seems to me that the heroine of this book is a spineless woman. She stalked her husband everywhere and well, did quite a number of stupid things. She is also hopelessly naive. Not a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ass And The Innocent.","review":"There was simply so much frustration in this book. The heroine is a completely gullible young girl and the man is a complete ass. I couldn't see how a man can think he has the right to toy with a woman's feeling the first minute then turns around and have a public intimate flirting with another woman. For the most part, there was no character developement. He was the same ass with a love proclamation and she was the same gullible innocent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing but plot is too dark","review":"Karen Ranney is an exceptional writer, but I didn't like this book very much. Jered was very unlikable...too depraved, arrogant, and cynical. His only redeeming quality was his good looks. I much prefer humorous, honorable heroes. Karen Ranney's book Beloved is much more romantic. In my opinion, the best book ever is Shanna by Kathleen Woodiwiss. Ruark is the perfect hero. I wish all books could be like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful!

He is so dead set against feeling anything for her that I sometimes wanted to crawl into the book and knock him upside the head. Tessa keeps him on his toes with her straight forwardness when it comes to his behavior, which I loved. Wonderful characters and a moving story sure to earn a place in your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 days of my life I'll never get back","review":"This book is just plain boring. I wasn't for a minute convinced by the hero's motivation to act life the ass he is, and wanted to throttle Tessa for acting like a moonstruck nitwit. Her incessant chatter, jumping from one topic to another, also grated on my nerves as the dialogue lacked wit and sparl and doesn't serve any purpose other than to highlight how TSTL she is. A most unatisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!!!!!!!!","review":"I CAN'T BELIEVE A 20TH CENTURY WRITER WROTE THIS BOOK. I THINK WHEN HISTORICAL ROMANCE WRITERS WRITE THEY SHOULD BE UNIQUE IN THE WAY WOMEN WHERE TREATED AND EXPECTED TO BEHAVE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. THIS BOOK BELITTLED TESS. INSTEAD OF HAVING HER FEET PLANTED ON THE GROUND ALL SHE WAS DOING WAS FOLLOWING HER TWO TIMING HUSBAND WHO DIDN'T DESERVE HER LOVE. SHE SHOULD LOOK AT GARWOOD'S, KANE'S AND QUICK'S WRITING.

I find no way to make any sort of sympathetic connection to the selfish jack-ass that is Jered and the stupdily naive Tessa. Honestly, although I have only read about half way through, I am ready to just burn this book to ashes. Short of self-castration, there is nothing Jered can do to win over my sympathies, and even then I doubt it would change my mind. And Tessa! Why on earth would she want to befriend someone who obviously does NOT care for her even when he confesses to admiring some of her qualities (apparently he forgot to list \\"idiotic\\" and \\"has no self-esteem whatsoever\\") When she calls herself an idiot, she's right! I am willing to just drop this book and give Ranney one last chance but if her other books turn out to be as horribly written as this one, I may throw up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best authors i've stumbled upon","review":"The story 'Upon a Wicked Time' was a great read. Karen Ranney has a rare and unique ability to portray the emotions of two deep characters - Tessa and Jered. Jered has been hurt in the past, a hurt he wraps around him like a dark cloak, keeping him from happiness. (Which is a persistent Tessa.) Ms Ranney's character's antics are hilarious and their depth startling - a combination that was extremely satisfying. I definitely would recommend this book. It was my first by Karen Ranney, but i'm ready to search out more."},{"rating":"2","title":"KABAR KILLER","review":"haven't had a chance to use it in the field, but as soon as i got it it seemed a bit dull, needs sharpening out of the box but very sturdy structure, and tight construction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only the kind of book that helps you to prepare for a visit and to enjoy it, but also a souvenir you will treasure...","review":"This guide to the Metropolitan Museum of Art helped me to plan what I wanted to see in that museum, and to learn beforehand about many of the works of art I was going to find there (for example European paintings, Egyptian, Greek and Roman Art, etc...). What is more, this book allowed me to read about some paintings and sculptures I didn't have time to see, even though I would have loved to be able to do so (too many beautiful things to see, to little time). Well, I suppose next time I will just have to start by the 2nd floor!.I think you will appreciate the beautiful color illustrations, and the opportunity to plan ahead of your trip and not in a hurry what you want to see first. This is not only the kind of book that helps you to prepare for a visit and to enjoy it, but also a souvenir you will treasure after returning from your holidays.

In October they said that they could not find a comparable product so it was delayed. A few weeks later they said \\"it will ship out today.\\" I still have not received it.

If you are into NIN ( My favorite band ) you will get a kick out of it. Then there's Rollin, whcih is quite possiably the dumbest song ever made. Ugh, I could on and on but reading some of the reviews I would just sound repeatitive. This is just angry music for the kids who get made at there parents for taking there allowance away.

People are more concerned with the image than they are with the sound. However, I can't understand how anyone could be interested in the whiny, non-musical voice of Fred Durst. When I first heard this guy I thought he was joking. The band may have a future if they kick him out and find someone with talent. To the current hard rock standards, the music is not that bad. It's weak, it's bad--but it's not that bad. Yet if they had any comprehension of the art, Fred Durst would have been gone long ago. You can't take Limp Bizkit seriously. Not worth one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can it be?","review":"How did people get away with calling this a rock band? This album shows that Fred Durst is nothing but a rapper, and not that good of one at that. The talent of the musicians is not all the way their either. Wes Borland spends too much time putting make-up on to practice and get better, their bassist is slow, and doesn't have what it takes, and the drummer is a geek. I don't see how this is selling so much, but it just goes to show what kind of music my country is into. Pure RAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh for the love of god...","review":"Once again, Limp Bizkit proves that they are just a bunch of sell outs. After \\"3 Doller Y'all\\" it all just went down hill.

I was depressed that people could stoop to the level of actually thinking this garbage was any good, the disc's only useful purpose could be as an expensive coaster or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uglier and Uglier","review":"First off Limp Bizkit is the weakest band ever. They went from horrible to total garbage. Their isnt one song on this cd that requires talent. Fred Durst is the ugliest wanna be rapper I have ever heard in my life.

In the near future, we will be laughing at this pathetic poop in the same way we make fun of Vanilla Ice now.I'll admit I can't stand Limp Bizkit from the moment they came out, BUT, I assure you, this is far worst than their earlier work. I've listened to just about everything they put out because I used to have cruel roommates. Don't buy this album, and go find something good better that isn't rigged on TRL. I think Nu Metal stinks in general, but I'd bet you'll find something much better (or real hardcore) if you look more towards the underground and independant bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible- a typical rap/rock album","review":"I would have given this cd maybe a half star, but of course I can't.

The repetative formula throughout the whole album gets boring and makes you feel like a right saddo if you actually listen to his lyrics. The rest could prevail without Fred as he can't write and that squeky voice is just annoying. He is 35 for god's sake! Listen to \\"My Generation\\" with this in mind and you'll understand all of what i've just said. The only condolence is the fact that the MI2 tune is okay. \\"MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY\\", yeah, okay then Fred."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be 0 stars","review":"This album is bad. Limp is angry, but they have nothing to be angry over. Fred cant rap, he cant sing, and he can't write anything intelligent. The only reason anybody buys this is because it somehow got popular. Shallow people like dumb jocks with low intelligence might enjoy this album. If you want a real rap/metal band get some of the older rage albums. And oh, zack de la rocha's rapping skills is superior to fred durst's."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money for some *real* music","review":"i was really looking forward to the release of this cd, and when i finally got it i was *extremely* disappointed. dont get me wrong, im a huge limp bizkit fan, but this is just not anywhere close to the quality of three dollar bill yall$ or significant other. if it was possible for me to give it less than one star i would because theyve gotten so much worse since their debut. pass on this one and buy something that youll listen to all the way through. try some pod or deftones if you like their older stuff, youll be much better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Screaming Post-Teen Angst","review":"Another talentless, production session of screaming \\"lyrics\\" from the angst-filled members of Limp Bizkit. One can only wonder how those so young and untravelled managed to become so enraged and manic. Or how a few years of real issues such as taxes, children, mortgages, et al might impact the hostility of this \\"music.\\"Normally, I would ignore such hackish attempts if there wasn't the incessant hourly air play this crap seems to garner. I'm amazed that my fellow man and local program directors are placated by this trash. Rise up fools! Rebel! Demand that talent accompany your rage session."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"I have nothing against Limp Bizkit. \\"Counterfiet\\" is still one of my favorite rock songs of all time (or is it a rap song?), and the M:I2 theme \\"Take a Look Around\\" is pretty awesome. But this new CD is just bad. The music is nonexistent and the lyrics are built entirely around excessive use of the f-word. Also, with Chocolate Starfish, Fred Durst manages to take the \\"whiny white kid trying to freestyle\\" shtick to a new level, spouting off lines like, \\"Now I know y'all be lovin' dis sh** right here!\\" He also manages to mention either his name or the band's name in every song without fail. The fact that this CD is successful is proof that there must be a whole lot of 11 year old boys out there desperate to be cool to their friends (or perhaps to make friends). If I can stop just one person from buying this load of crap with this review, I can die a happy man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insert a title, if u will.","review":"The only good thing about this album is that Trent Reznor gets money out of it. Apparently Durst couldn't think up enough actual lyrics (without swearing) to fill the album, so he borrowed Trent's. This album is a good example of the kind of corporate-rock world in which we live. Clearly Chocolate Starfish... was put together to cash in on the band's fame, and not for the sake of music. The day I buy this album will be the day I shoot myself. (I mean that.) So here i am, patientally waiting for the next movement of pure music to wipe-out the current excrement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"This album is not as bad as I remember it. I think this is pretty good. The ending songs start to go softer and the Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle) song sucks but the album is pretty good. The only song that could have been better was the song \\"Hot Dog\\". Instrumentally it was good the lyrics just sucked. I didn't like that whole \\"F\\" word every two seconds thing that was going on there. Other than that, go buy this album if you're into the rock/rap type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Terrible Music!","review":"This Limp Bizkit stuff is enough to drive any person with a normal head crazy. How can anybody listen to this! I borrowed this cd from a friend because he claimed this music speaks to you. Whatever that means? Do not buy this you will seriously regret it!

At first I thought this album was awesome. I listened to some of the songs and realized that it is one of the worst existing CD's of all time. The lyrics are horrible (take 'hot dog' for example. I've never heard so much use of the 'F' word. I think he says it about 50 times (honestly). I recommend this CD to nobody. It is terrible. If you listen to it the first time, you'll think its cool. Listen again. Its like you're listening to a new, bad CD. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm.. Whatever","review":"This is by far the CD I most regret buying last year. In fact, the only CD that was worst was Jennifer Lopez's \\"On The 6.\\" In the words of your typical teeny bopper girl I can sum this baby up in one word: EW! If it weren't for Fred Durst's bad boy image, this band would be nothing more than a bunch of derelicts running around cussing. The only song I can stand without wanting to sue them for verbal assualt is \\"My Way.\\" As for the overall feeling of the album, well, we're paying a group of guys to scream profanities at us. If you want good hard care stuff, check out the recordings from the family values tour or Eminem's \\"The Marshall Mathers.\\" These are some CDs that actually are catchy and enjoyable though granted, they're still just screaming at you and/or bashing you and your beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad.","review":"I'll make it simple. Limp bizkit is a band who sold out to get known and to sell. Three Dollar Bill will definitely be their best album, they will never top it. The band members lack talent, all Wes knows how to play are power chords, John's drums are awful, all he knows hot to hit are the bass drum and snare drum, Sam's bass, is worser than significant other.

I guess it got smoked with Method Man and Wu Tang. The only good song on this cd is \\"Full Nelson\\" but it's a blatant rip off of their own, better song, \\"Stuck\\".

Some of the tracks our excellent, such as the beats of Livin' it up and the slow but very nice song, Hold on with Scott Weiland. There is Getcha Groove on which grows on you much like its brother ... did. And the urban assault version of Rollin is very catchy with method man back and DMX. This is a very good CD, I defientlely recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hott","review":"this cd is awesome almost all of the tracks are tight if you are a bizkit fan this is a must have for you.. the reason i only gave it a four is the song \\"hold on\\" with scott weiland is horrible not very much like limp's usual stuff but overall this is a great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"this new cd from limp bizkit is very good.. its not btetter than there older ones; its kinda different. I would recomend this cd to anyone who bought 3 dollar bill"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only time will tell","review":"I bought this album the day of release, and I was thinking about it ever since I got Significant Other last summer. I was already aware of the singles (\\"Rollin' & \\"My Generation\\") but I wasn't too sure about the other tracks. After the first couple times I listened to the entire record I wasn't really convinced that Limp did a very good job. But it's now been almost 3 weeks, and I have not gone a day without listening to this ablum at least three times! Over time this record grew on me even more than their previous. So if your still kinda \\"ify\\" on this ablum, try it out and I'm sure it'll begin to grow on you as well. Limp Bizkit definately shows promise! You know what they say, third time's a charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"They'll never change","review":"Limp Bizkit is still a pretty good band. But from their first release to this one they have not changed at all. Fred Durst still make that funny voice and their Rap/Rock style is still the same. If you're a Limp Bizkit fan I recomend U buy this Cd. It's not all that different but it has some new songs for you to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened between Sig. Other and this?","review":"How could they have worked on this so long and still made one of the worst CD's ever? Another question, why are people still buying this? Don't get me wrong, I like the new Rap-Rock thing going on but this is just dumb. I felt liking falling asleep listening to this! I just about threw this piece of garbage in the trash but then my friend asked if she could have it...two days later she threw it away! If you bought it already, throw it away, go grab a good Alice in Chains or Godsmack CD and listen to a GOOD band. If you haven't bought this, STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"erm... this is bad.","review":"I know this has been said countless times, but I just feel like driving this very true point in further. Limp Bizkit has no talent. None whatsoever. Fred Durst's \\"look! I know how to say the F word! isn't that so Fing cool? F this, F that!\\" Which does only appeal to 10 year old children too heavily influecned by Carson Daily and his homies on MTV. If you want something good then look into Black Sabbath, Godsmack, Red Hot Chili Peppers and even Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather listen to the Aflac duck sing Christmas carols...","review":"...then subject myself to this a$$ clown parade known as limp bizkit.

All I even listened to were a few samples of songs from this CD, and instantly, I thought of calling the police. No, not really, but I did think of shooting myself because my brain had instantly been forever poisoned by this trash. Honestly, I at least gave the album 1 star because the band isn't horrible.

LIMP SOUNDS SOLID","review":"Limp Bizkit sounds phat on this cd. Even though Fred is still rapping, he does a great job at it. Wes sounds real good with his new PRS guitar.

This CD beats the pants off the toehr two(well mayby not the first but defibitely the second). BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD wreaks of awesomeness!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This CD rules!!!!! I was expecting something that had more rap-type songs but it's not like that at all. All of the songs are great. I'm listening to it right now and I can't help but bob my head to the music. It's evident by a lot of the songs the Fred Durst poured his soul into some of these songs and songs like \\"my generation\\" can serve as an anthem for kids everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of all time. There are no bands that can hold a candle to Limp Bizkit. First of all, the level of musicianship has clearly gone up on this album, resulting in some great songs, like \\"Rollin\\" \\"Take a Look Around\\" and \\"Hot Dog\\". Fred Durst's lyrics have gotten better, and the whole bands has a better sense of grooving. I highly recommend this instead of bands like Sabbath, Metallica, or Nirvana."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've now grown old of Bitz Climpkit, oh, Limp Bizkit.","review":"Who does Fred Durst think he is? I've now changed. Limp Bizkit is the BEST BAND EVER! NOT! Ever heard of Linkin Park, KoRn or Drowning Pool? Or even Pantera, SlipKnot, Coal Chamber, Ill 'Nino or Sevendust? They are way better than Limp Bizkit. Limp Bizkit: SELL-OUTS! The songs: My Way, Rollin'(Air Raid), My Generation and Take A Look Around are the only songs that have any talent. But, they have two good albums. Give Significant Other and Three Dollar Bill a chance. Limp Bizkit were once one of the best. Now they're just awful. Pick up a Drowning Pool or KoRn album."},{"rating":"1","title":"L to the I to the M to the P","review":"its the limp bizkit definitely in the house limp bizkit are real nutjobs and that is why they make such good music all you hatas who must be racists or just dont knowgood music or dont like curse words (are you ten years old and your mommy dont let you curse whats the mattrre punk?) all you real nutjobs out there who want to get down, get doewn with the L TO THE I TO THE M TO THE P cause limp bizkit is definitely in the house"},{"rating":"1","title":"I remember when I had this..","review":"I remember I was in the 9th grade I walked all the way to Bestbuy just to buy this album which the distance from Bestbuy to my place at the time was a very long walk. I was a big Limp Bizkit fan in my 8th grade year thought they were the best band out there. Now that I have grown up and look back it's like man how in the world can you like this stuff? It's just terrible.. I threw away this cd along with all my other Limp Bizkit cd's awhile back ago. Now I still like alittle bit of material off there first 2 albums I'm not going to lie there good songs when you want to listen to something just for the kick and that don't really mean anything. But the lyrics on most Limp Bizkit songs are just pointless and real childish it is pathetic. Well I didn't want to give this cd 1 star but I had to. to Do not get this CD if you must get something Limp Bizkit get Three Dollar Bill Or Significant Other but even those albums after awhile will start to become pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...","review":"This album suck like a PoP Mc Hammer album but with electric guitard and a real drum.

All other songs here are bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just keeps getting worse","review":"Don't get me wrong, I like the bizkit, but Significant and Starfish should've been combined into one album with all the crap left off. You wanna know what I never liked about rap? Rap albums have 2 trendy songs and the rest of the songs are filler - a bunch of cliches and songs about how tough the singer is. In that regard, this is a true rap album. Fred ruins perfectly good songs by singing stupid lyrics that you can't sing along with. Yet I like this album enough that I still listen to it. Go figure. Oh, and what is this about 2 discs? Did everyone else get 2 discs? I am trying to find my case to see if I someone didn't notice it was a 2-disc set because I never noticed before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp bizkit has lost there way","review":"I loved Limp bizkit i nthe days of three dollar bill ya'lll and half the songs oof of signifigant other but what is this! it seems like a poser rappers album the only reason i didn't rate it one star is theres one or 2 decent songs but thats it, i feel that Lb is going down the mainstream road and it pisses the sh*t out of me they had so much potential! and im dissapointed in them.No wonder Wes left the band he wanted to rock he wanted to play metal!!!!!! SO fred stop worrying about britney spears and go back to your roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands down the worst album ever made...steer clear!!!!","review":"This album is terrible, there's really no other word for it. The production is WAY too overpolished, the lyrics have no quality whatsoever (unless you count vulgarity as \\"quality\\"), and the songs are poorly written and arranged. My dog can write better songs. This will appeal to all you \\"angst- ridden\\" 15 year old kids who have yet to discover REAL music yet. This album gets one star, and only because I feel bad for Wes Borland, obviously the only real talent in the band, even though he can't let it show. Hopefully this will be the last Limp Bizkit album, because this is by far the biggest waste of plastic and paper ever, and I dont see how they can get any worse. Fred Durst says, \\"Its my way or the highway,\\" and the latter is the only answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"more metal is better","review":"limp bizkit new cd is more metal and to me this is the best guitar work wes has done. my favorites songs are \\"my generation\\" and \\"rollin\\" that i cant get enough of. i am not a fan of hearing the f word a hundred times but on my two favorite songs its very limited. i really enjoy the music on this cd more then the vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best new albums out there","review":"What... are all these other people smokin sayin that this album(is bad)?!! I think it is a great record and deserves alot of credit. All the songs are new, hip, and fresh. Although the album may not be as \\"heavy\\" as the 2 other limp cd's, it's still has very well written songs, excellent harmony, and great music and lyrics in general. This is a VERY GOOD RECORD and deserves to get a litte more attention for it was welly-made, and put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Limp Bizkit adrenaline!","review":"Being a Limp Bizkit fan, I am surprised to say that this album isn't as interesting to listen to as their previous album. \\"Rollin'\\" is full of energy, but the lyrics just doesn't hit me in the heart as well as many of their previous songs. \\"getcha groove on\\" is has that tune to keep you repeating it over and over in your mind. I enjoyed \\"my generation\\" the most. Over all it is a fantastic CD to listen to, especially for Limp Bizkit fans. I play this CD every night before I go to sleep, soothing to the soul. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total [Junk}","review":"Hey everybody, lets get a hit album and not do anything new and innovative and stay in the same pile of crap. $3 Bill was a great CD, but Limp's records have gone downhill since then. ... . Anyways, Durst's \\"lyrics\\" are more like he's trying to get slogans and not say anything important at all. I will give the band credit because they rock, but they need to lose the dead weight of Durst to get a credible lead singer or maybe even an MC with real skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"I RATE NEGATIVE INFINITY STARS!!!","review":"PPL THINK THEIR SO COOL JUST CUZ THEY LISTEN TO MUSIC WITH A BUNCH OF CUSS WORDS!!!

This CD was put out just for fame, it was all just thrown together, 3 chords per song, same lyrics. If you want to listen to some quality rock that has a meaning I would recommend some bands like TOOL, Filter, Nine Inch Nails, Or A Perfect Circle. Maybe Korn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of 2000","review":"I have NO IDEA as to why this album got such bad reviews. It is, quite possibly, the best CD that I have ever heard. I love Limp Bizkit, but their first 2 CD's aren't that great. They have a couple of good songs a piece, but nothing special. This CD has it all. There are no really BAD tracks. Tracks 2,3,5,6,7,9 and 14 are all great, and the others aren't that bad. The hidden track in between tracks 8 & 9 is pretty cool too. I recommend that if you haven't burned/bought this CD to purchase it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this [junk]?","review":"...I'm so...sick of hearing Fred Durst's annoying, whiney voiceand the rest of Limp Bizkit for that matter. I think they wrote these songs in five minutes in hopes of getting fifteen buck out of a bunch of middle schoolers, who would listen to John Denver if it was played on TRL. This album is so stupid and every single song sounds the same. Mabye if these guys sat down and gave their songs some thought, insted of [usingprofanity] every two seconds, they could write something that has some meaning and sounds halfway intellegent. The only song that sounds different from the rest is \\"Take a look around\\". I loved Limp Bizkit on three dollar bill, but now I can't even stand hearing the words \\"Limp Bizkit\\". And just like the review above mine, what's up with Fred putting down Trent Reznor and the Nine Inch Nails. Trent will be making music long after Limp Bizkit has gone bankrupt and nobody remembers them. Sorry L.B. but you also lost another fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mix of their previous albums","review":"This album is similar to Significant Other, but there is also a bit of heaviness from their first album thrown in.

And then month after month it was delay after delay ...until finally today! And to start it off by saying I'm not disappointed at all. Every track on this cd minus the remix of \\"Rollin'\\" is good, and great in some cases ,as far as my opinion goes. It kinda picks up where the first 7 or 8 tracks of Signifigant Other left off, if thats of any help to you. My favorite tracks are probably \\"Hotdog\\" and \\"Boiler\\". So here's a 4 star, would be 5 start rating, to in my opnion, the best Limp Bizkit CD yet released............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"If you're into rap or into hard rock, this CD is great.

For one, the melodies and notes are too disjointed to sound proper, he tries to maintain this tough-guy image with hard and drawn-out riffs with rough vocals and also (for some odd reason) this sensitive guy image ... where he tries somehow to mix melodic soft singing with his completely inept singing voice... (...buy the CD just to cringe over his obnoxiously horrible vocals...)He's making himself into what he used to hate: a fake. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"I NEVER liked Limp Bizkit. In fact, the ONLY reason I bought this cd is because a friend of mine said that it was \\"the best thing Limp Bizkit has ever done.\\" Boy, what a load of crap that was! This cd perfectly displays how Limp Bizkit was one of rock/metal's biggest mistakes. It's a pure disgrace to know that KoRn, the most important band in metal history in my opinion, discovered these [guys]. The music that Limp Bizkit plays on here is as always, repetitive and bland. Fred Durst doesn't even attempt to sing on here. Why bother? We've all heard him try to sing, and he just plain [not good]! And also, the constant use of the f-word is just kind of immature. REAL musicians don't find it necessary to constantly use profanities in their songs. Avoid this cd at all costs. Nothing on this cd is worth anyone's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"I'm not referring to the band with Shirley Manson in it when I say \\"GARBAGE\\".

Rap is not Fred Durst's forte, and his use of it on their third \\"effort\\" has lost him a lot of fans. The music that used to be the mook metal of \\"Significant Other\\" has degraded into a typical rap album. Where Durst used to write real lyrics, the newer songs (save a few lucky good ones like \\"Take A Look Around\\" and \\"It'll Be Ok\\" plus Scott Weiland's \\"Hold On\\") are mostly the rap standard, \\"be cool, keep it real, and don't get in my way or I'll ... beat you down into a mushy pulp. But stay cool.\\" Sad really, their first album they were just having fun. The second album they were selling out and having fun, this one is just media puppet, TRL sellout stuff. Good Luck on the fourth album."},{"rating":"1","title":"should've stuck with what worked","review":"this was a major dissappointment. their previous cd was much better. only my way, take a look around and rollin' make this cd worth listining to. it seems limp thinks if they use the \\"f\\" word more than 100 times on the cd then people will like it more. what the heck is up with hotdog? they were right when they called it a \\"f-ed up rhyme\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, worse and ugly","review":"This is awful. I'll agree with other reviwers and say their bassist is good, and I can't deny Wes Borland looks cool. But everything else - Fred's embarrassing lyrics (\\"I'm gonna fly like an eagle to my destiny\\") and complete lack of rap skills. The drumming is mediocre. DJ Lethal deserves to die for the mangling he makes of some songs, especially \\"Getcha Groove On\\", which is the worst song on the album. It's fun to listen if only to laugh at Durst's unintentionally funny lyrics, or to play spot the swipe, wherein you try to guess which other artists the band has been [listening to]. Durst doesn't realise that people don't hate him in a Sex Pistols/Eminem/NWA kinda way, but in a Spice Girls way. To all the 14 year olds buying this - I predict in three or four years you'll look back with utter horror at being in a Limp fan, in the same way as NSYNC and Britney fans will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable as long as you don't pay alot of attention to it..","review":"This is one of those albums you could only enjoy while you're doing something else and not really paying much attention. They have some catchy rythms but come on, how much time did it take to come up with lines like \\"keep on rollin' rollin' rollin'...\\"? And the fact that they had two songs based on that line was just downright sad. The lyrics aren't really going anywhere...or coming from anywhere for that matter. They're kinda just there for the sake of filling up some empty space although I believe they would have been better off making this album purely instrumental. If you're gonng listen to this album, read a magazine or watch TV to occupy your mind or you'll be hitting the skip button alot. ...But then again, I never really was a Limp Bizkit fan...."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST RAPCORE CD EVER!!!!!!!","review":"This is truly the best Limp Bizkit WAIT no no no no, this is the best RAPCORE(rap + rock) CD EVER.I LOVE to Limp with the Bizkit(weak I know, but hey, why not).My favorite tracks are Rollin\`(Air Raid AND Urban Assault Vehicle), Full Nelson and My Generation.Truly Limp Bizkit is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tight!","review":"This is a good albume and i think all limp bizkit fans would like it.

The filth of commercial music is spilt all over this one, and it oozes of the reek of putrefaction. Terrible, tasteless arrangements, the most patronizingly annoying voice ever recorded (kudos to mr. limp, fred durst), no talent, pure monotony and endless repetition.

The people that don't like it ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT because it does not cater to their tastes. The lyrics ARE NOT, I repeat, ARE NOT supposed to be \\"intelligent\\" or \\"deep\\". The intro says it all: this is not a test---this is reality. The lyrics and song contents are simple takes of Fred's view on his reality as it stands right now. The band is fantastic and provides all the straight-forward no-nonsense in your face music that Limp Bizkit is all about. They are very talented---they don't need to play monotonous solos or write self-indulgent pseudo-profound lyrics like other flashy bands who ARE NOT REALITY BASED. So lighten up and just enjoy the blasting riffs, pinpoint bass, great beats, and cool scratches. The songs themselves are also very gratifying and extremely enjoyable, especially if partying or driving or just hangin' out. What more could you ask for???

Creed has talent and can write songs. Fred's voice is corny and he just curses all the time for no reason. To think that i actually though of giving this sorry band a chance.

They lyrics are so meaningless, and half the time don't make any sense. The songs are almost all hip hop (and not even very good hip hop) without any screaming or muxing in any other hard core.

The result is their best album yet.The album carries from the funny rap style of \\"Hot Dog\\" to the rock of \\"Take A Look Around\\" to the ballad \\"Hold On\\" to the metal of \\"Full Nelson\\". There are 13 songs (not including Intro and Outro) with guests ranging from Scott Weiland of the Stone Temple Pilots to DMX. It's a mix of metal and rap with a touch of other genres to make a smooth yet bumpy album. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Is there any other way to describe this album, other than using the word trash? I have never listened to a more copied, unthoughtout album in my life. I mean Limp Bizkit was good on 3 dollar bill and sig other kept them going. but this is (....) how can u put out an album using the same riffs and useless lyrics. the only reason i gave this album 2 stars instead of one was becuz i enjoy \\"hold on\\" which features Scott Weilend (i belive) the rest are repetitive and meaningless. limp would be cool without fred but nothing will ever happen to limp since fred is head of interscope. too bad for jon, sam, wes and dj lethal. quite talented guys too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fred Durst and the Boys do it again!","review":"Who thought that they would put out an album that rivals all of their previous releases?

A true protoype....LIMP BIZKIT. Silly name, silly music...and lyrics are just an excuse to say the F word a zillion times. If 6 million records were sold in USA, it goes to show the number of idiots in the country who can be easily amused by such crap.

Even when I listen to it now, it's still gets me goin'. Wes Borland has some great guitar riffs, and Sam Rivers makes the some of the best bass tabs ever. John Otto has some great beats, and DJ Lethal keeps on getting better. Fred Durst has finally matured in his voice, he can now control it, which makes the songs even better. Overall, this CD is Limp Bizkit's best one yet. If you haven't gotten it yet, go get it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I give cd 2/5 because 2/5 of it is worth listening to. Before I decided to buy this cd, my friend showed me the lyrics to hot dog. The funniest thing I have ever seen. Every other word is f---, which doesn't sound terrible with the song. But just seeing the lyrics was hilarious. I only like 3 songs on here. Can you guess which ones? My generation, my way and rollin. I must admit, I haven't even tried listening after livin it up. I wanted to puke. Limp Bizkit would do much better if they stayed with 'metal' (if you call what they sing metal). I still wouldn't listen to it, but i think other people would.

All of their songs are they same poser bullcrap. They are a gimmick. How can you take a band seriously when they have a song like Hot Dog? And My Generation? That song is such crap. It is sad that a bunch of loser kids who like to think they are cool listen to Limp Bizkit.

He cannot rhyme worth of lick other than the song where he used 64 \\"F\\" words and rhymed with simple stuff like mom dad, cop, badge. I was eager to listen to this album after I heard the song Rollin, Rollin remix, and My way. Broiler was on TV and that song is just 5 or 6 lines being repeated.

No wonder everyone suggest gay things n addition to this cd. That includes N'sync . I think its sad that Limp bizkit went from awsome to being in the same class as N'sync. All around this cd is horrible. I would have given it zero but they wouldnt let me. I cant belive it.

All that egotistical Fred Durst can say is \\"f this,f that.\\" Ridiculous. The musicians are only slightly better, fairly mediocre, if you ask me. And poking fun of Reznor? Trent is a thousand times better than Fred could ever imagine. He is not a moronic poseur like these sorry individuals. Save your cash for Nirvana or Smashing Pumpkins.

What's he trying to be, another Insane Clown Posse? Then he has the nerve to insult other bands that \\"don't match his style\\". His punch on Nine Inch Nails was really uncalled for. They're metal, he's ....Heck, even the album's title [stinks]. It has no meaning, no reason, and it's too long.The pathetic thing is that the rest of the band has huge potential! Wes Borland scored among the top ten best guitarists in the COUNTRY. And yet, he is stuck in a band run by someone who practically pirated his way into Interscope.All in all, Durst is ... now.

In fact, this album might have inspired me to look at Xzibit.The rest of the songs are childish, repetitive, stuck-up, and annoying. This is a terrible way for such an awesome band to end.

When I heard it I didn't see what the big deal was with this. All it is is Fred Durst trying to rap. Wes does play some heavy riffs though. The opening song I thought this was going to be something heavy but all fred is doing is talking smack about Trent Reznor from NIN. Fred Durst can't rap. No wonder why Eminem dissed him.

The only things that I can give this album is that it manages to keep a decent beat throughout, and the production of the MI2 theme song is alright. The blend of musical styles, not dissimilar to Linkin Park, completely and utterly fails in this album.

And he tries to dis Trent Reznor, please, he was making music before you and he'll be here after the end of your disgraced music carrer. Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is 100 times better than all 3 of Limped Bizkit's cds. And at least Mike can actually rap without the ghost writers. Fred, I advise you not to rap anymore, because you Can't. No More Bizkit's Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say Wha??","review":"I once was a big fan of LB...then along came this album. Intro sucked...then came \\"Hot Dog\\", which is an infuriating track because it just so happens NIN is my favorite band. It's nothing but a wasted effort to \\"try\\" to prove that LB is more creative and more bad@ss than NIN. Sorry Freddie, didn't quite catch on. The whole album is far from creative. The whole album is nothing more than whiny, unthought lyrics and sounds that leave your mind confused rather than mind blown. Every other word on the disc seems to end up being ..., which could be one reason some people call some of these songs catchy because you can easily learn the words by simply guessing when the 'f' word is going to come in. I give credit to Fred for introducing us to Staind and Cold however.If you absolutely don't like this album buy every NIN album and Slipknot album available!!! Truly creative music that will never disappoint!!! Also D12 is a good one to consider because of track 19, which is kind of a hidden track!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Word","review":"This is awsome!

He is a stupid,corny,idiotic poser. He tries to rap on these rock records and he sound pathetic. I can't believe Limp Bizkit has gotten this far. They are quite possibly the cr@ppiest band of the 90's into 2000. Everybody kisses Wes Borland's @ss, but he can't compare to guitarists like Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello. This is the bottomline. Fred Durst is an idiotic poser. Limp Bizkit is a wannabe nu-metal band that makes pop-rock \\"music\\" for Top 40 stations and MTV (\\"This is Fred Diggity Durst yo, live on TRL!\\" - Fred Durst - retard). This is not rock. Or metal. Or even genuine rap-rock. This is what gives rap-rock a bad name. I can't stand this group and everytime I hear Fred Durst's voice I wanna bash his stupid, poser face in. He needs to go back to stalking women on his website that he has absolutely no chance with. This is not music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pathetic Follow-up to Significant Other","review":"Only the most devoted Limp Bizkit fan or anyone who thinks Fred Durst is hot will truly love this album. But for anyone else who has been waiting for this release to get their dose of rap-rock, this CD isn't so appealing. Limp Bizkit has seemed to use the same material and music making skills used on Significate Other to create the wishing to be comercial success of Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water. Fred Durst goes on swearing for no real reason, DJ Leathel scratches in songs that sound actually good without it, and Wes Borland, Sam Rivers and John Otto play the same rifs and hit to the same beat as their sophomore release. The entire CD sounds the same as the last, so close you can even match songs together from both CDs. If you like Limp Bizkit and don't care about the unoriganality of their music, go ahead and buy this disc. But for those of us who like listing to GOOD music, mabey something else is waiting out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny","review":"it's so funny to see the reviews of these mtv airheads saying stuff like \\"if you dont like the album you probably just dont understand it.\\" yeah, thats right. i guess the lyrics are just way over my head like for example how fred durst uses brilliant irony in the song \\"full nelson\\" in saying that people shouldn't talk trash about him behind his back but instead say it to his face so he can kick their a$$. pretty funny considering that \\"hot dog\\" is nothing more than making fun of trent reznor behind HIS back. it's also really intelligent in the song \\"take a look around\\" when fred says \\"i know why you want to hate me, because hate is all the world has even seen lately\\" which brilliantly juxtaposes the rest of this hate-filled cd.truly brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most talentless band ever","review":"Seriously, every song on this album is terrible.

To the guy who said that Fred Durst is a \\"wigger\\" and that anybody who listens to Limp are \\"12 year old wiggers\\" needs to grow up and actually listen to the lyrics without being a no-good racist piece of s**t. Songs like \\"Take a Look Around\\" are good examples of why people like you should keep your mouth shut."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREAT","review":"Yes alot of people hate fred durst. There are also alot of people who think he is an excellent muscian. I am one of them. They have changed there music alot from there first album. When Significant Other was release their music was more put together than thier previous album, but thier songs werent as serious as Korn's songs. Thier new one is a great achievment. They geat more serious with music that makes u want stand up a scream because this album is full of adrenaline. They also add some rap songs wich give it a nice glossy finish. This is a tight cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actaully surprisingly Good","review":"I don't know why everyone is so down on this album. Shouldn't bands change and move to new forms of music. Everyone compares this to Significant Other. Why? Would you want Limp Biz. to simply do what Rob Zombie does and remix the same songs over again? Granted not all the Songs on this new cd are \\"great\\", but enough of them to make me feel like the purchase was worth while. If you looking for something new to listen to, then pick this up. It's not as bad as everyone says. Granted having a nicer stereo in your car and or home, will make a ton of difference, since there is more bass in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best they've done - hints of selling out on here!","review":"This is definately NOT one of their best works.

Some may say Fred has sold out, but once you get a chance to listen to this album word for word, you might fell differently. For someone to really enjoy the full front of this CD, they would have to respect Limp for their stellar performance on Significant Other. Tracks like Livin' It Up, Boiler, and It'll Be O.K. prove that Limp hasn't sold out, they are just showing the fans a new way to look upon them. This album is a great buy, and follow up to the sophmore release. All the tracks are appealing, and this CD is one of the best for the \\"hard hop\\" taste. Pick it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Do all Rock Fans Put Limp Bizkit down so much?","review":"What is it with rock fans? If the message isnt all about slitting wrists an artist is stamped with the 'rubbish' label. I like all kinds of music, mostly rap and House, but then I heard a few Limp Bizkit tracks. I decided to buy the album and I felt that it was worth my $15 for the songs it included. 'Take a look around' and 'Rollin' I feel are very good songs and are a breath of fresh air from the usual dark message of rock. I am willing to accept that because I am not into rock music much many people may disagree with my review, but to anyone like me who enjoys more than one type of music, I would strongly suggest buying this CD to add to your music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up","review":"I must admit, I did not purchase the previous offering by LB but enjoyed it thoroughly. Figuring this CD couldn't be much worse, I dished out 15 bills and was shocked at the lack of feeling that went into this CD. Only one catchy song (Rollin') and the rest was just rants and profanity. Not what I was looking for in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Personal Opinion","review":"Well, I have read all the reviews for this album, and it seems that everyone is concerned about the profanity, especially with one of the songs where Fred Durst swears at least 100 times. In my personal opinion I liked the album,(especially Take A Look Around and Stripper) it is definatley different from their first two, but that's what makes it their best one, you can actually tell that they took their time with this one, and actually thought it through. For the one's that didn't like the album that's your opinion, but don't try to push your opinion on other people, and don't assume that anyone who liked it is a 13 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bizkit: Number 3","review":"Limp Bizkit has rocked on to their third album, but it isnt the best. i admit, it rocks, but if you are looking for the best, then go for significant other, but otherwise, this album ROCKS... all the hype was DEFINITELY worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dude, This.. DUDE... Awesome Dude!!!","review":"Yes I know I Tripped over my words when typing my title , but that is how to express LB's greatness. ME LIKEY!!!. The song hot dog is funny and should be called the F bomb song. Ill admit this isn't the best CD in the world but its close. Some songs you'll like right away and some are, shall we say...\\"get to know them better\\" songs. Just listen to the boring ones a few times and you'll have yourself a good CD.

Just take it eaze an' listen 2 diz album. Freddy-D is a genius, he drops dem wicked rhymes just like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer before him. Whats more, he keeps one foot firmly planted in Backstreet Boy territory with his emotional falsetto. And whats all this talk about the f-bomb? The Bizkit Crew is just trying to keep it real. I don't know what you are all talking about, Limp Bizkit is the shiznack and have loads of street cred. If you want some mad rhymes and some good cruising tuneskis, then pick this album up. If you want to be enlightened and empowered then buy it. Limp Bizkit is still relevant in today's modern social landscape.

Their second CD wasn't bad either but i figured they would come back harder than ever. Wow, was I wrong. This is quite possibly one of the worst CD's i've ever considered buying. Theyve almost totally abandoned their rock roots and gone completely rap. It's not even as if they are good at rapping. Rollin' is basically the hokey-pokey in a rap version and my generation is an excuse to say the word F*** as many times as possible. Terrible lyrics, bad music, and the loss of what got them here in the first place make this album one of the worst post-debut album I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Bizkit is utter [...]","review":"This album is nothing but the same old rehashed junk from signifucant other.

If you want some good metal/rock go for Spineshank, Tool, Godsmack, Simon Says, Disturbed, or anything but Bizkit.

It appears as if Limp Bizkit is trying to aquire a new style, that just didn't work. It's half rap half is some semblence of the alternative style they have devolped previous to this cd. It is possibly the most conceited album ever created, with the use of their name in almost every song. Further, the lyrics have something to be desired, specifically in songs like Rollin' (both versions) and My Generation, in fact they come off as goofy.

From the hard, loud rock they are so well known for (My Generation, Rollin) to Hip Hop (Getcha groove on) to the slower rock you might not expect from them.

Also Fred Durst's voice on this album is extremely annoying. All he does is squeek his voice, and he does on almost every song. These guys are too caught up in the whole junior high, mainstream TRL crowd, and it's made them forget their early, true fans.

Musically, what is there to really talk about, just some simple open strumming or basic 2 chord songs any beginner guitarist can play.

Limp."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD takes it to a new level!","review":"This CD really shows the limitlessness of where Limp Bizkit can go - if they set their mind to a certain style of song, they can accomplish it. They have hardcore rap (Rollin'{urban}, Getchya Groove On), hard metal (Full Nelson), anthems (My Generation), quiet and soulful (Hold On, My Way) and Eminem style quips (Hot Dog). They truely are a widely diverse band. They have moved away slightly from the last albulm, it is far more similar to their first LP, which I believe is a move for the better. This CD is really one of the better CD's of the year, and after a few listens it'll grow on you.

I guess a lot of people are slagging it off due to the popularity of the cd with all ages and genders. Same thing happened with Metallica when they 'sold out'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmm.....new cd is....not bad!","review":"I had never bought a limp bizkit cd before but i had heard their two previous albums. They had some good songs on them but they also had their not-so-good ones. Their new cd, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, is quite similar in that respect. It has a few really good songs, like Rollin', My Generation, etc. (the ones heard on the radio...) but there are also those songs where, after lisining to them, you ask yourself, \\"hmmmm...that was strange....\\" There is also a much more prominent rap presence on this cd. So I'd have to say, overall, this cd is definately worth buying, even if it is only just for the good songs....."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really not good.","review":"This album was a huge seller before people actually heard it.

Unoriginal and uninspiring songs fill this album. If you do end up buying this album, at least you can feel good about knowing you can use it as a frisbee or a coffee coaster.

Both are pretty good cds. This one is crap. They recorded the whole thing in 2 weeks. His rapping was the best on 3 Dollers, and has gone downhill. Fred's rapping tracks are horrible, none nearly as good as N2Gether Now (by the way, what is that title supposed to mean?) And his mellow tracks are the only high point of the cd, even though they arent very good, and they all sound exactly the same. And all of you who say that this is a good cd, you guys probably just think Fred is hot or are impressed with his excessive cursing. If you like Limp Bizkit for their rapping, get the first one, if you like their hard rock side, get their 2nd one. If you like crappy Limp Bizkit stuff, get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I heard this cd and i thought it was a total piece of trash i gave it to a friend.

Even if you dont fit this description and you are looking to expand your horizons, do it here!

The albums lyrics are nonsense. This is pure mtv fodder and I know that millions will be sold but what does that say about the state of music. Most critics agreee that the last half of the ninties musically was weak and that's when this rap metal thing began.

The songs all sound the same. The profanity is there because Fred thinks it makes him respectable. Guess what? It proves all the more that he is a immature whiner. His rage is cliched and the music behind it is loud and obnoxious. I think the best part of the album is when he tries to make fun of Nine Inch Nails. I guess Fred figured he was SOOOO far behind Trent Reznor, musically and lyrically that he had to fight back with petty insults. So if you're a 15 year old guy out there looking to get a rage-filled record that will make you \\"cool\\" or whatever, do yourself a favor and buy \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or \\"Broken\\" by NIN.

If you like Limp atall, you owe it to yourself to get this CD, really good! It's also cool that they have two versions of Rollin' (Both are good). My Generation is the same song, you all know and love, same with Take a Look Around. Hotdog is kinda cool, Full Nelson has a good beat, My Way is straight up cool.

There are only three good songs on this album, namely \\"My Generation\\", \\"Take A Look Around\\" and perhaps \\"Rollin'\\". Fred Durst's rhymes are very weak, half of the lyrics consist of the f-word. I only listened three times to this album, and after that never ever again. That's how fast it becomes boring.You'd expect an album that is by far better than this. If you don't own it already buy \\"Significant Other\\" instead. It's loaded with great tracks and more intelligent lyrics. I really hope their next album will be totally different from this. The band has great potential, especially DJ Lethal and Wes Borland. So, get a grip Fred Durst, and next time don't try to please the MTV-genaration, do what my generation wants to hear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hahahaha","review":"HAHAHAHA!

So-called \\"rock bands\\" are actually reasoning that instead of catchy melodies, hard-edged riffs, original song arrangements, emotional singing and screaming and infectious guitar solos, they'd rather try to fit as many \\"f\\" words into their lyrics as coherence will allow on top of a distorted, mid-tempo beat? This album really does epitomise everything that music should not be.

One of those very skinny fish that look big when you see them from the side, but then when you see them from head-on, they are really skinny.That's more like Fred Durst. That's more like LB.

It is like a \\"coming of age\\" story where a child does not want to grow up but finds it happens anyway. As much as Verdi the young snake tried to seek independence from adults, he learned that he still needed the warmth and security from the adults in his life.Social Development skills could also be learned from Verdi as he began to understand the adult pythons' points of views.

The \\"seed\\" is good; and in the hands of a talented writer, it would come to full blossom. However, Verdi never actually experiences full blossom in Cannon's hands. As a professor of children's literature, I found her writing didactic, the language flat. On the other hand, the book has experienced wild popularity. This no doubt proves that exquisite illustrations (and savvy marketing) can sell a book, even when the story itself leaves children and adults alike yawning. Some people are writers. Some people are illustrators. A very few people are author/illustrators, and Cannon cannot be counted among this elite group.

This is their first album as recorded in Australia. The mixing is completely different and a bit more repressed than the Chrysalis release of the same material. Due to the mixing and style differences, I had to take away a star. Any fan of Icehouse must get this CD. It has been years since the original vinyl was available even as an import. No matter how it is recorded, no song will ever again match the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine 1st effort + cool b sides","review":"\\"It's always cold inside the Icehouse\\"....what a goose pimple experience if you hear the track \\"Icehouse\\". Also includes \\"I' Can't Help Myself\\" , \\"Walls\\", \\"Sister\\" + great b sides, the instrumental \\"Paradise Lost\\" + the pulse pounding \\"not My Kind\\". This would be Icehouse's 1st release, under the name 'Flowers', the name was changed due to another band having the same name at the time (gee what happended to that band??). While there are a couple of singles here, the album is meant to be heard as a whole, which is a dark, moody & ambiet release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers (Icehouse)","review":"This first ever Icehouse venue is more \\"dark coffee house\\" & far less \\"pop\\" than later efforts.

I haven't listened to it in years, but remembered really loving their sound and 80s melodic stylings. Still sounded good after the passage of time. Thanks to the other well informed reviewers for their information about this cheaper imported version than the American release as Icehouse, which would have cost much more. Same great songs with a couple of bonus tracks, which the more expensive American version did not contain. Bought from Fulfillmenticity.

I was verydisappointed in its structure. The book is not so much about Florida (of which I am a 7th generation cracker) but about how important the family was and their \\"great\\" socialization with the \\"upper-crust\\" of the world. It was very hard to stay focused and caused me to skip a lot of the book. I was looking more for history and events in and of Florida and most of the book was about their travels.

The songs on those albums are full of great couplets, and I'd rate each at 4 stars.After that, they evolved on to a harder sound, but somehow it didn't take on me. (For reference, I thought Understanding Jane marked their mediocrity's start. And if you don't like Birds Fly or Hollow Horse, then you probably won't like their first albums the way I do.)I haven't heard any of the songs on disc 2, and having owned a (different release of) disc 1, I'm not tempted to risk any more on their later work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im confused","review":"I dont understand these guys. I remember them as being new-wave romantics, with their most well known songs, Birds Fly, and Love is a Wonderful Color, which are probably their 2 best songs. Their first album, I admit was decent, but after hearing this, Im glad I didnt get anything else by them. I mean, c'mon. They shouldve just stuck to what they did best, instead of trying to do metal, blues, and reggae-ish(!) pop. Im sorry, alot of this comes off as half-baked, mediocre pop/rock at times coming off as a bad REO Speedwagon or some kind of AOR rock, like they lost their way somewhere. The only reason to buy this is for their 2 greatest hits. Its not just one disc, ITS 2. 2 DISCS OF MEDIOCRE MUSIC.

I was given this book as a gift for my birthday and have to admit it was a wasted gift. The first half (3rd actually) of the book is based on pure beginner how to and info, fine. Through out the basic discussion of gear ratios , batteries and electronics are references to the Arobot kit and how it is mentioned later. In the second half (3rd actually) of the book, where Roger starts the high level discussion on robotics, all you do is construct the $235 - $318 robot kit that he sells on his web page. The most helpful information in the whole book came from the list of 10's section (the last 3rd) found in all dummies books.

I live near New Bedford, and I know how powerless and worthless people living there can feel, but her seemingly endless motivation and drive allowed her to reach her goals, double them, and still move up. I bought her book today; I hope it will be as good as seeing her speak about the very successful life she has made for herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unseasoned","review":"Lynn's book wasn't all that great. The plot was fine, as well as the theme, but it was poorly written and I have reread it several times, and it is still the same. It reflects a great image (that women can do anything), but the image is tarnished by poor writing techniques. Geraldine, the woman in the book, was my grandmother. I am sure Lynn is obviously a great and successful masonary, but writing is not an area of expertise for her. Just the first page alone made it hard to go through a chapter, nevertheless the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Guidance and Outdated","review":"I used the Fodors for out trip to Italy in November 2005 and was very dissappointed with it. Since there are no pictures, it was very difficult to identify monuments. The descriptions of the various historical places were vague and unsatisfactory. We had to purchase additional guides while in Italy to help us better understand the sites/monuments. The prices are also outdated: almost all of the admission or ticket prices it quoted were wrong and less than the actual price. As well, the restaurants it recommended were dissatisfactory. Next time I will pick up a different book (not Fodors), one with pictures and more details."},{"rating":"1","title":"ay jalisco no te rajes!","review":"The DVD quality is good, it has been restored, the negative and sound are good. This movie is a magnificent ranchera movie, a period piece, a master-piece. But I have the movie in video, and I am very unhappy, because the movie has been cut, of many beautifull scenes, many of them with \\"Chaflan\\" (Carlos Lopez) and Angel Garasa (Mala Suerte), how much been delected, probably 20 minutes or more. The quality and good transfer to the DVD are real good. The many, many scenes deleted, made the DVD a dissapoiment. A real pity ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD version of \\"Ay, Jalisco no te Rajes\\" is abridged!","review":"This DVD version is not a complete movie. There are whole scenes missing. Amongst them, the song by Antonio Badu; \\"Fue Casualidad\\" which affects the meaning of the \\"Coplas de Retache\\" scene. Other critical scenes involving dialogue are also missing. There are at least 18 minutes cut from this version of \\"Ay, Jalisco no te rajes!\\". It is a pity and deceptive marketing. Amazon should warn prospective buyers that they are not buying the original version of the movie, but a badly mutilated one.I don't know if the VHS version advertised here is also abridged, as it is currently unavailable, but the original VHS versions marketed in the 90s were complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more disappointment","review":"I have many tools. I probably enjoy tuning them and making them perform almost as much as making furniture. However, the Jet/Proformax 16/32 drum sander has continued to disappoint at every turn. These extensions are necessary to hope to achieve a smooth sanded surface, however they are clearly not sufficient. For $120 you get two metal shelves that with a great deal of fiddling, but no clear methodology, you can provide some crude, but much needed support on both sides of the sander. However, you now have an even more expensive sander that consumes very overpriced sandpaper rolls, and remains a huge challenge to smooth a panel. I keep trying to make this tool work well, but still find I can do a far better job with a hand plane or belt sander in much less time. Perhaps it is time to give up and sell the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to adjust","review":"This is an extremely important addition to the Performax 16-32 drum sander that doesn't compare to an otherwise well designed machine. The installation is relatively easy, two bolts on either side to mount the side brackets. The trick is to get the tables flat corresponding to the conveyor belt. After raising and lowering the tables and brackets several times I managed to get them close, but not where I wanted them, which is dead on. As a previous reviewer stated, they have a tendency to trail off (down) at the ends away from the machine, which makes them almost useless. Take it from a guy who has owned both the Performax and the Delta: you are still better off with the Performax. This item should be at least close right out of the box, and perfect with a few adjustments, but I'll have to settle for close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and ...","review":"I returned these tables along with the Performax 16-32 sander. (see my review titled \\"Extremely Disappointing\\") The problem with the tables is they can't be mounted to be co-planer with the bed of the sander. Instead, they tilt downward, away from the conveyor. They also don't align evenly with the conveyor from side to side. Aside from giving the illusion they beef up the 16-32, they are of very little use. Save your money and build your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good addition","review":"The Infeed/Outfeed tables provide helpful additional staging space on the 16/32 drum sander. Assembly was simple, but installation would have been enhanced if lockwashers had been included with the kit. I added them to simplify the alignment process - they enable \\"fine\\" adjustments which is not practical with only \\"nut and bolt\\" connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost content free and dangerously misleading","review":"This book can be summarized thus: the reasons to use SSFs are:a. Better leverage [false with portfolio margin]b. Tax avoidance [usually false, since the methods described by the author can be classified as \\"constructive sale\\" by the IRS]Everything else the author says is either exchange-generated boilerplate or would work just as well with \\"SSF\\" replaced by \\"stock\\".As far as I can tell, the main reason for the existence of SSFs in this day and age is that you can essentially do naked shorting with them [no locate is necessary]. Nothing is free, and in the case of SSFs, the spreads are much wider than for the underlying equity, plus you need to roll them, if you want to hold the position for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thorough","review":"I have to say that I found this book very long because the language in which the author writes is very professional.

It's a simple 6-outlet adapter, but having the outlets angled allows me to plug in a couple of \\"wall wart\\" type transformers without blocking all the other outlets. Fantastic!On the downside, the angled design does make this stick out from the wall a bit more than conventional six outlet adapters. It's not a good choice for outlets that are behind furniture. But, for more accessible outlets, it's great. I use it in the bathroom so I can keep my shaver, toothbrush and water pick all plugged in at the same time and still have outlets available for other use.GE also makes a model that is designed the same, but has a breaker at the top that trips if there's an overload.

It is help in place using a single plug (top, which accounts for the entire power draw), and a small plastic tab which fits into the bottom plug. Alone, this is not a secure attachment for the kind of weight and torque this adapter would be subject to, so you need to unscrew the existing center-post outlet plate and screw this into place with an included long screw.

But, I'd thrown away the box (FIRST LESSON: Don't throw packaging away until you are ABSOLUTELY SURE) - and the return window is 30 days or it becomes garbage so I had to eat the cost and toss the item. Stupidly, I bought another Pyramid product - the Pyramid PS15KX 10A 13.8-Volt Power Supply with Cigarette Lighter Adapter. This one wouldn't power the inflator at all.I've since tossed the pump and the first Pyramid power supply. I'm TRYING to return this item. In the end, after WASTING over $120 for this solution, I ended up going with the Slime 40025 ($52).

In my opion,the book was pooly written, no charm, humor or even believable. The setting was Montgomery Alabama, 1900,it could have been LA, Chicago or New York and almost any year with the lack of real reference to the time and place.

I probably made a mistake reading \\"Portnoy\\" first, as I doubt any of his other works (or ANYONE'S other works) will be as consistently hilarious as \\"Portnoy\\" was. However, looked at as an independent work, \\"The Ghost Writer\\" provides a very interesting look at the mind of a writer, the responsiblities of a writer both to him/herself, the people who love him, and to the truth. For those interested in such subjects, \\"The Ghost Writer\\" provides for a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Writer","review":"Roth is smart and savvy, and if you look away he'll blindside you with wry genius and smile beguilingly as soon as you catch his eye again.This book is a gem. Short, spare, enlarged, full of pathos, full of history and humanity, (...).I would almosthave liked it better if he'd kept up the tone of the beginning. Kept it real. Not Anne Frank, but a similar standin. After all these are the travails of Zuckerman, not Roth.Still, it' a bloody amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect as a Self-Contained Novella","review":"As with the rest of the Zuckerman Bound stories, The Ghost Writer is a novella among novellas, set during a very brief period of time but distilling a certain stage in the development of Zuckerman--as well as his creator--and thus capturing something of wider American culture of those same years--at least, the literary and cultural milieus Roth comes from.As always, it's Roth's very style that makes this work a classic. That and Zuckerman's scandalous Anne Frank fantasy, which is certainly one of the most daring stories of postwar fiction I've come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun house at the water park","review":"Put on your bathing suit and expect to get sprayed at every turn. When you think he's serious, he's kitschy. When he's just gone too far, he gets serious, philosophical. Always self-referential. But if you think it's autobiographical, he's just having fun with you. And you with him. At the same time, this is not daytime TV. The quality of imagery and writing is so much better, dark jewels jumping out every few pages. Just one I remember: a character rushes through a conversation, summarizing the Jews who live in Israel as the \\"unmurdered remnant\\". This, in a comedy? Or is it? Jewish humor always goes one step too far, in all directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong beginning...contrived conclusion","review":"As with the second volume of the Zuckerman trilogy (Zuckerman Unbound), Roth begins in fine fashion but gradually loses steam. The result is an ending that seems less a result of the natural actions of his characters and more a testimony to Roth's own boredom or fatigue with his subject. Would have been more effective as a short story--as a novel it seems bloated and a bit flimsy. Roth has done far better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown blanket review","review":"Product seems good, color did not match original picture.

Carrie was a little better but the revenge part is much more grahic and gory the carrie. The movie is about a outcast teen named Rachel who has been moacked one to many times. What people don't know is that she's telicnetic. (can move things with her mind)When a group over over sexed joacks act friendly to Reachel they get her to go there party with only sick intentions. Once they have Rachel himmilated infront of more than half the school the boys think its over. But Rachel wants revenge and with the help over her powers she turns a house party into a gory madhouse inferno. Great acting by Bergl. A great movie for anyone who is made fun off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequels are not as good as first parts","review":"This is a pathetic carrie of the 90's.

You'd better go back to the original movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Thought","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when I took a chance by renting The Rage: Carrie 2. I am an avid Stephen King fan and have seen and read the original Carrie. It was good; much better than I had expected. Don't get me wrong; it's not the best movie ever made. There are pieces of the plot that are a little far-fetched. But in general, I found it to be a very compelling story of teenage life. The lead characters, played by Emily Bergl and Jason London, were very strong in my opinion and the story was gripping. I was so impressed that I actually watched it twice. It's so much more than just a horror story. It's definitely worth seeing if given the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie in a LONG time","review":"When I saw the trailer for THE RAGE I had to go see it.

I definitly recommend this to any Carrie fans. A true must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"2-4-6-8 who do we appreciate?","review":"This sequel to the horror smash 'Carrie', is yet another teen horror flick. However, with one-liners and special effects, this seems to be an improvement. The 'star of the show' Emily Bergl, gives a captivating performance as this year's traumatised teen. The support cast were average, and Amy Irving seemed to be a disapointment this time. Special mention goes to the twin of Alicia Silverstone, Rachel Blanchard (Clueless and Sugar and Spice) and Charlotte Ayanna (Jawbreaker) for playing the 'teen bitches' with a little more class than expected. As Monica (Blanchard) says \\"She should get extra points for being so skanky\\", I would have to give this film extra points for being so daring. It's not easy to follow up on such a hit, but I think they did a pretty alright job. Though good, I have seen better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid sequel to the original classic Carrie....","review":"To start off, I loved the first Carrie. Sissy Spacek was brillant at playing Carrie White and the whole movie was cool. Now the sequel? I give it 1 star. The acting is bad, the plot is a total copy-cat to the original Carrie, and the gore is soo corny. After watching the whole movie, I was very dissapointed. If you're a horror movie fan (or a Stephen King fan) go buy the original Carrie and avoid this garbage sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie 2 is a winner with fans.","review":"I thought the movie was creative in that it just didn't create a completely new plot without using some of the original characters. It may not be the best plot, but the special effects, characters and some of the script was really good. I saw the original carrie and it sort of followed the same plot sequence. Bergl is a good \\"Carrie 2\\" and pleases the audience. This movie really \\"strikes a chord\\" with teen audiences with all the high school type scenes and issues.

But, it plays reasonably well, with Emily Bergl marginally well playing Rachel, Carrie's half-sister. It seems like a watered-down plot of the original \\"Carrie,\\" with lots of gratutious sex, nudity, and gore than the first, but it seems to be a sort of shadow to \\"Carrie,\\" more than a sequel, like Roger Ebert said.The only good thing about this is that it has Amy Irving reviving her '76 character Ms. Snell, the only main character left living at the movie. What happened to Rachel, well, you'll have to see the movie for yourself...This is only a movie for star watching (Mena Suvari \\"American Beauty,\\" Zachary Ty Bryan), die-hard Carrie fans, people who like it because of the nudity and sex in this film and undemanding fans of cheap gore and predictable chills.Rated R for sexuality/nudity, graphic horror violence and gore, and for language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Attempt for a sequal","review":"No one can compare to Stephen King.

Well, I guessed right! I watched it at a sleepover on Halloween night. We were waiting to get scared... that NEVER happened. Rachel wasn't a sympathetic character like Carrie, she wasn't that big of an outcast. High school life was totally stereotyped in this movie. Carrie 2 was like exactly the same as Carrie except for the 90s and ripped of all emotion. There's one football player who's too good to be true. They never really explain Rachel's powers. Then Rachel freaks out at a party and kills mercilessly and they have POINTLESS gore. We HATED that part, we were yelilng at it the whole time. Then Rachel is all kissing her love, but we are mad because she just killed these people in such horrible wayas. It was AWFUL. I HATED Rachel! She had no justice to do that!

Snell and good guy jock Jesse (Jeremy London) attempt to help her while all the other mean kids pounce, but not quickly enough.

The original written by Stephen King was a complete success and this frankly isn't. It is 24 years later and still the scars from that night where everybody met the real Carrie White exists. Now, out of the blue, some producer decides to write a sequel! Why? The plot is very thin. Emily Bergyl plays Rachel, a girl with similiar powers to Carrie (played by Sissy Spacek, her debut movie) and things start to get a little out of control. Amy Irving, one of the only survivors of the first film reprises her role as Sue Snell, something which kept me watching (unfortunately) Very predictable, which should have turned out to be a made for Tv movie. A disgrace to Stephen Kings line of best sellers. Before I go, let me ask this question? Why do people create sequels to King's bestsellers? I've said enough...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Sequel or remake?","review":"Carrie 2 is a good movie about Rachael (Emily Bergl) and how she lives with mean Foster-Parents.

Rachael finds out Lisa did it because of popualar people. Rachael herself is also tormented. The tormenters are Mark(Dylan Brunan)Eric(Zachary Ty Bryan)Tracy(Charlotte Ayanna)Monica(Rachel Blanchard)and Brad(Justin Ulrich). Strangly Rachael is falling in love with Jesse (Jason London)a popualar jock. Amy Irving is also in this as Sue Snell from the origanal. At Prom Rachael is finally made crazy.

But what does that matter? The acting in this tragic/horrific tale is almost just as good as it was in Carrie. Emily Bergl is great as the troubled Rachel Lang. She lives up to the performace Sissy Spacek delivered in the original. The \\"kill the teenagers\\" sequence at the end is much more graphic than it was in Carrie 1.

Where's the hard rock? It ain't here. If the songs intend to rock, Westerberg holds back for some reason.

I had great hopes that this Liebert CD would be inspiring and was disappointed that it was the opposite. Each tune follows the formula of the rhythm section playing a straight-ahead version of whatever song with Liebert playing a totally traditional, single-note melody on top, often co-mingled with a couple of motifs from another Christmas song.

It really was a much more innocent time, as the seekers really do expect they might find a giant, unknown (by western science) reptile that lived in the jungle swamps. They track the beast both by logic (only tribes of the plateau know of this animal, they all describe it the same way, they all describe it as living in a specific place, etc.) and by trekking into the jungles of Northern India.The book is also reminiscent of a less enlightened time, when mighty white hunters foray into the wild with childlike, lazy bearers to seek adventure.While Izzard didn't find a buru, the anticipation that he might is what drives this book.

Kittie is made up of four girls. Fallon, the lead singer, has awesome voice, and she and the three other girls who play the instruments have great musical skills. If you like Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Marylin Manson, Papa Roach or Static X, you'll love Kittie. In their songs, with Lyrics like \\"remember what you sew is what you reap\\", they talk about important issues that teens today need to deal with. The reason I gave them 4 starts instead of 5 is because in some songs, they use very descriptive language, and it it gets very graphic and gory.Some people do not like that music. They talk about suicide and other things like that. If you are okay with listening to stuff like that, then this Cd would probably be OK for you. But otherwise, Kittie is a great group, with great music, and I highly recommend this cd!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great service","review":"Very fast shipping - the items were exactly as advertised.

We have run everything that you can imagine through it, even pvc. No matter what you run through it, it doesn't slow down. The stock-splitter/Anti-kickback teeth are a great feature to insure that you don't end-up with a board in your stomach. It is a left-tilt saw so that your material doesn't bind against the fence. The Accu-Fence is one of the best fences that I have ever used. It is smooth, and insures accuracy. When you set up the fence, Make sure that you set fence tape right, so that you wont have to ever have to use a ruler. This saw is awesome, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to make a quality investment. Out of five stars, I give this saw ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe power switch on Powermatic Model 66","review":"WARNING!!!! The switch on this unit can be turned on by pressing against it with a nail belt or a pair of Carhart Carpenter Overalls. I saw this happen to a 40 year Master Craftsmen.

This CD gives a sample of differently paced songs that showcase the artist's voice.

Needless to say, it struck a resounding chord in me and after nearly five years and several worn-out copies, this cd remains as my favorite of all time and is always in my cd player. Sure, there's lots of swearing, but so does real everyday life, and this cd, like no other I have ever heard, captures the truth about the innate sadness of the human condition. It's a shame these guys never got the attention they deserved, because this cd is truly genius. All the answers to life's riddles can be found in the lyrics, they are truly profound if you're open-minded enough to listen. A true gem.

Rehab is amazing, perfect blending of diffrent styles. These guys are so talented its hard to imagine they had the problems they did.

I nice mix of hard lyrics with great background singing & beats... the pace changes a lot which is something I like. My favorite tunes are #11 \\"Sittin at the bar\\"... #2 & #9 are favorites too. Probably not something you will hear on the radio, but definitely worth spinning in your CD player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you ever think they'd last long? Well me neither!","review":"First off let's get this straight. These guys are NOT Crazy Town. I mean at least Crazy Town had a catchy tune. But if there was one song on the whole album that I could care less about, it would have to be Crazy People. This is the most ignorant song on the entire album: \\"Sittin' on the corner of 33rd and utter hell. You ain't killed nobody today, but I ain't well\\" That is pretty much the extent of their talent. Not all hope is lost though. The one hit that they DID have on the radio, It Dont Matter, is OK yet it's still too poppy for my tastes. Other recommended tracks, Sittin' at a Bar and Storm Chaser. 2 stars for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is your dignity?","review":"How can anyone live with themselves charging $100 for something that doesn't even work.

This study guide not only broke the chapters down like Cliff's Notes do, but also included study questions! And answers! I found that to be immensely helpful, as I am not a trained teacher, and if you have ever tried to have a discussion about literature with a monosyllabic teen, you know how hard it is to determine whether they \\"get it\\" or not.

They were SO helpful! Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing, fab...","review":"This book was amazing. The metaphores were outstanding, and the characters breathtaking. Lee was able to capsure a child's scarace ability to judge as well as her inability to understand the need others feel to judge. It depicts the struggles of children who are more educated than their peers, in addition to the possibility of their elders being below them in some events, and yet they remain real. I would certainly suggest this novel to anyone looking for a good book to read by the fire on a rainy night. It truly makes one think."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Stank","review":"This book was too long and too boring for me to say any good words on it. I did not like the cut-and-dry style of Harper Lee, and i didn't appreciate the way that the first half of the book seems useless after you have completed part 2. all the author had to do was introduce the character of Boo Radley in a paragraph or two and then get on with the trial. i know that some people would argue that part 1 had more substance than simply telling the reader about boo, but i dont think much else mattered, so hate me all you want to. this is just a typical book that they make you read in school : dull. so i didnt expect much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated Melodrama","review":"Madigan was a critical success at the time (late 60's). It was not a box office success. It has the look and feel of another Don Siegel movie ( \\"The Killers\\". Meant to be a TV Movie. Madigan even continued as a series of TV Movies). Over time it has not aged all that well. The Don Costa score is way overblown and very dated. It was considered to be gritty and realistic at the time. After not having seen it for about 30 years, it came as quite a shock to see that it now plays like a parody of the era. The print however is in great condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRE FRENCH CONNECTION","review":"A couple minutes of nyc street scenes look like THE FRENCH CONNECTION, but this movie is very much about a STRAY DOG stolen gun, and not about heroin. This movie is also too polite and liberal, when FRENCH CONNECTION was known for its racist language. And THE FRENCH CONNECTION also had ethnic nyc actors, here swedish meatball Inger Stevens is in the cast.The movie was written by blacklisted very-communist Abraham Polansky, who wrote the John Garfiled movie BODY AND SOUL waay waay back, and it shows with his out-dated dialogue. Polanksy, to his death, hated Elia Kazan for ratting out Stalin fans in the 1950s.Andrew Sarris, of THE VILLAGE VOICE, put this in his top ten list of the year it came out---probably only because of Polanksy being blacklisted, since Sarris never put THE FRENCH CONNECTION, THE GODFATHER, or DIRTY HARRY in the top ten for the year they came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger is not always better...quality counts!","review":"Our guiding philosophy and inspiration. An engaging and intelligent defense of building (and renovating) smarter, not bigger. Sarah Susanke has made a career of promoting traditional design principles in a way that speaks to modern situations (many of us can't afford new, huge houses) and responds to the \\"McMansions\\" craze that continues to sweep the US. She has a wonderful sense of how to maximize space for personal use. She advocates for built-in furniture, design built around daily activities, and open light-filled design. She had us at \\"Most architects are afraid to say...'You don't need an addition, you need a cleaning service.\\" She doesn't want to clean out your bank account. She wants you to make the most of what you have...and if you follow her ideas, you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solutions for the real world","review":"This is the ideal continuation to Sarah Susankas earlier books. Well written and full of ideas for many different lifestyles. Although repeating some of the earlier real life projects, she has developed the themes and showed us how to live better not bigger. If I have any criticism at all, it is that she has based most of her ideas around her cold climate environment and there is very little written about the warmer climates. The theories however are sound and using our own imagination, can be extrapolated to any environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this book!","review":"I think every person who owns or is considering buying a home should read this book first. The concepts presented here will make you rethink the idea that you need more...bigger is NOT better. Utilizing space effectively and making a house your own with personalized touches are much more likely to make one more satisfied than buying bigger. While I have been investigating going smaller for a while now, this book really helped me to focus on the details of actually making that change work in real life. A must read for anyone feeling cramped in their spaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide for Remodelers","review":"This book will be invaluable for anyone looking to build/remodel their home. The author provides creative suggestions for rethinking how we live and ways to reconfigure existing space rather than construct extensive (and expensive) additions to our homes. Susanka admirably supports her ideas with background information, diagrams and case studies. Ultimately, however, few ideas in the book are applicable to anyone not planning a large scale construction project of some kind.

It's Rosie O'Donnel!","review":"As we have all seen, Rosie is a bad mother. Her youngest child recently broke his leg due to neglect from Rosie being off in the other room counting her money. As we have also seen, and unfortunatly heard, she is an incredibly sub-par singer. If she has a thought on something she will not talk about it like the normal people in this world, she will \\"write\\" a song about it and have it go with the same music of one of her many favorite Broadway shows. This CD demonstrates how lazy Rosie is. There are only about half of these tracks that have Rosie on them, not that i am complaining. She also only selects the artists that we all have heard a thousand or more times on the local radio. Why be so superficial? why don't you work with some musical acts that are not as mainstream, and come up with some songs that are actually innovative, not just the same kind of music that we can all hear on the Top 40 countdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Trash Music","review":"I'm sorry, the artists may be good, but anything Rosie is involved with seems to turn into garbage. She has poisoned this otherwise good endeavor with her crash commercialism. If you think you're doing something good, because some of the proceeds go to charity, remember that the bulk of it goes into Rosie's pockets...if you want to do something real this Christmas, help out the homeless directly, like I do every week. Do yourself a favor and get a good Christmas album, like the one by Rik Emmett. Don't forget how hypocritical Rosie is with her \\"charity\\". She is the one that said on national TV at the Million Mom March that she wants all guns banned from everyone...then turns around and hires a bodyguard for her family who carries a handgun. Sorry Rosie, I can't afford to hire an armed gunman, I spend too much time at the homeless shelter. Pass on this masquerade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It!","review":"If you're tired of old, tired Christmas songs, & want something new & *fun!*... this is a wonderful CD. Every single song is a hit, & for those griping about Rosie... no she can't sing, doesn't claim she can... but she knows good music, & knows how to make a delightful CD that causes the listener to feel like they are at a party with old friends. I hope this dear lady continues her efforts both to give us music like this, & her work to raise the thousands of dollars for children's charity.You want to gripe about Rosie?

All the pro tools in the world can't make Rosie O'Donnell sound even mediocre on cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"great songs ruined","review":"Had i known upon buying the CD that Rosie O'Donnell SANG ALONG with every musician, I would have left this on the shelf. There's a reason Rosie O'Donnell is an actress and talk show host, SHE CAN'T SING.

I agree with the other reviewer that said \\"Christmas With The Family\\" ruins the album. It should be called \\"Christmas With the Disfunctional White Trash Family\\". It is kind of funny but definitely not rated PG. You won't want the little ones singing along with this chorus. Rosie should not sing on any of the songs unless she is inaudible. I hate to slam a charity album but I didn't like this very much and my wife and the other moms hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched Refuse!","review":"Rosie O'Donnell recorded the tracks for this CD with other artists at the height of her TV popularity, and the proceeds from the sales went to charity. Kudos on that count, however, as for the quality of selections and performances, skip it. With the exception of a couple of lovely solos from Jewel and Linda Eder, the rest is a waste. Rosie, not much of a singer,joins many performers for bad duets that almost make the listener wish that Christmas would come and go sooner. While the CD banked on the popularity in 2000 of Jessica Simpson, Macy Gray, Smash Mouth, Destiny's Child (Beyonce' still active with her sisters) and other artists, as Christmas selections, the music is painful.For Christmas musc performed by contmporary performers get A Very Special Christmas, and in particular 1 and 2.

Dixie is one lively character and that leads to an entertaining read. I must admit that I was disappointed by the end of the book.

Stick is a chance for the Leonard fan aquainted with his later works-turned-movies (Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Maximum Bob) to watch the genisus of pure genius. The book has several twists that show up, in form, in some of Leonard's later novels, and Ernest Stickley, Jr. seems more like a blue collar worker than an ex-con trying to make a go at it. None of this subtracts from the novel's genuine story; the bad guys are anything but simple and two-dimensional, and the overall undercurrent throughout the book is one of anticipation. Much as I hate to say it, Tarantino has nothing on this kind of stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Stuff from a Master","review":"Some might say that if you've read one Elmore Leonard crime yarn, you've read them all. Maybe there is an element of truth to this- slightly addled but well-meaning guy with a checkered past meets smart, sexy dame and pull a convulted scam on rich ne'er-do-wells. That's the essential plot to a dozen Leonard tomes, right? Well, the pleasure of Leonard's work is in the telling, and in watching the chinese puzzles his characters concoct unfold. Stick is no different than Rum Punch or Tishimongo Blues or Pagan Babies or Get Shorty in this regard. But his prose is so crisp, his plots so breathless and his characters so charming that you are so entertained along the way, the template becomes invisible. In fact, since Leonard fans know where he is going to take us, the template allows us to bask in his endlessly clever inventions and his inimitable tone. No one straddles whimsy and menace like Leonard, and only Hiassen and McBain do Florida sleaze as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick","review":"good read Elmore Leonard is fun & easy to read.

If the point is not Church's voice, but how she dresses, then why bother to listen to her?

I was charmed. When I learned there was a new CD, I didn't hesitate. I wish I had. This collection of mostly familiar Christmas carols brings nothing whatsoever new to the genre, and I'm certain there are far better recordings of each and every song. Remarkably, her voice seems to have diminished, rather than grown."},{"rating":"2","title":"For People who love Charlotte Church, and Christmas as well,","review":"With Charlotte's angel-like voice, the Christmas songs would not have sounded no worse than any other orchestral albums. Although some songs is a tiny disturbing for Charlotte to sing, overall, this album is great. I love this CD. 'Dream a Dream' is good as well as other orchestral music. But I especially love 'O Holy Night'. This music really moved me. If you love orchestral Christmas albums, this is a must buy CD, especially for those who love Charlotte Church.For people who love Charlotte Church, and Christmas as well, this is definitly a CD to buy.

All traditional songs sound excellent. This is one of my favourite cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Most of the songs on this album are either badly over-orchestrated, badly over-produced, or both.

She's missing the one thing that could make the CD even a LITTLE better:feeling. When I listened to this Christmas CD, it was like this. See, she hit the notes perfectly, but she had no feeling behind it. I would suggest you buy another CD, one with more feeling to it. Her cold feelingless voice leaves you blank. I would suggest getting a CD of someone with more feeling in what they are singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced and overhyped","review":"There is a little girl in every church and school choir with just as much voice and talent as Charlotte Church. They would sound just as good or better with the sound equipment and technical expertise of of the sound engineers that work to make her mediocre voice sound like something more than it is.

This is basically what they do to her voice to make it sound like it has more than the girlish, small voice that so many other young children have. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What????","review":"I don't like Charlotte Church's recordings at all. She needs to understand she cannot sing opera right now, and she is but she is singing it the wrong way. I read on her biography she made it because she was singing kareoke just when she sings kareoke doesn't mean she has to be an opera singer right away. She needs to take voice lessons to improve her vibrato and her tone and needs to sing IN TUNE. She needs to be trained for a very long time and she obviously does not have musical backround and therefore people overestimate her.

She performs well, but I miss a touch of personality in all of her songs. The Christmas songs are all the well known once it\`s just too bad that they seem so shallow. Maybe Charlotte Church will learn with age to interpret songs rather than just singing them\\".

I live in Phoenix, where the water is horrible and very hard. So I'm really hoping this helps. Plus all that Chlorine in your shower/bath water is not good for you. One other thing, it did not seem to fit in the holder tight, so I used the one I had from my previous shower massager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two years old - cracked","review":"I think this unit has worked well enough to keep the majority of the rusty water from my hair, however two years on, I rotated the filter and when I turned it on, water sprayed everywhere, the handle had cracked and now will have to be replaced.

Ok, so I'm not that old. Anyways, this book - by Phillip Jose Farmer - didn't catch my intrest ay that tender age; but the movie was very nice. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing really new; but very interesting all the same, and extremely well made. The CGI is great, the acting is at least as good as most big-budget movies these days. The history might be a little slippery (Emperor Nero as a swordfighter fighting a mongol warrior? Um.... ) but the rest of it is a real gem. I enjoyed it and, should a miracle occur and it turn into the series this was intended to be a start to, I would watch that too.Plot: an astronaut dies.

I wasn't disappointed. It was obvious it meant to be a pilot for a series but unfortunately it never got picked up by the networks. Ashame as I think this had potential. Hopefully someday someone may retry to make a series based on the books. In the meantime I suggest you check this movie out. A modern astronaut finds himself on a beach of a strange world. The people he meets are fairly similar to what he has known on Earth but the era seems like a conglomeration of eras from Earth's past and the planet economy is centered on river travel. In order to get around he takes passage on a steam paddlewheeler. My only complaint is this was obviosuly a pilot for a series that never happened.

McGregor portrays Leeson as a charmer white collar criminal who ended up sentenced to six years in a Chinese prison for insider trading and fraud. Diagnosed with cancer, Leeson wrote his memoirs and low and behold it became a film. Ewan McGregor plays the self-absorbed, arrogant Leeson with his usual competence and energy. Anna Friel is his in the dark wife who yearns to be pregnant but can't interest her husband away from the trading floor. This is story of greed, larceny, and speculation on a grand scale. The film was never released in theaters but went straight to Showtime and has now been released for home sale. Skip it and rent it.

However, it is not fimic. This movie focuses on Ewan McGregor as an absurdly photogenic, charming version of Nick Leesson, the man whose improprieties caused that fall. McGregor's natural charm makes Nick seem far less culpable than he really was, despite the actor sleepwalking through an appalling script with some of the worst dialogue I can remember. Inept - or rather TV-movie-clumsy) direction doesn't help. There can be some forgiveness for \\"true\\" movies that invent episodes or make real-life characters to push a story along; there can be none for a movie that tells such a shallow version of the truth via its story's least interesting (if pivotal) character, and over-casts to make a boring futures trader look like a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try to fight the market, and the result....Chapter 11","review":"It really is a great movie.

Finally, a film in which Ewan McGregor can display his phenomenal talent! This film has all the right stuff--great acting, complex characters, and a totally involving story.

I'd recommend \\"Rogue Trader\\" to anyone, whether, they're (like me) a McGregor fan or not.

So my $400.00 was wasted. I used this thing about 5 times. shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew on first start up","review":"I have sent out for a replacement (Thank you amazon). Once it gets here if the new one functions like this one should have I will fix this review. I plugged it in just like the directions said. Set the voltage to 14V. This was intended to power my Hitec X4 battery charger for my Rc Helicopters and planes. Well on the first power up after about 2 mins of being powered on the little light started flashing and the protection module alarm went off. The battery charger hooked up is a 200W 20amp battery charger. This is a 35amp 600w power supply. So I was no where near the limits (did that intentionally). Needless to say they are going to pick it up tomorrow and a new one should be here on Friday. If the new one works properly I will adjust this review, but until then I cant justify it. I was using half its load capacity and it lasted less than 5 mins. (I was actually only using 3 amps on the charger, pulling 5amps from the unit),"},{"rating":"1","title":"no more pyramid","review":"i was really happy with this product.when it worked. i bought it about a year or so ago. i use it to power car audio equipment in my house because i no longer have any desire for the loud speakers in my car anymore. used this product probably less than 50 times and a resistor burnt up inside of it. i emailed amazon about it and they were awesome. no problems or questions asked within a few days i had a response and noticed they had already shipped a new one to me which i recieved in about a week or less. so i sent the old one back in the new ones packaging and hooked up the new one to my car audio equipment. within a couple months the fuse blew so i replaced it with the same size fuse. tried several fuses and everytime as soon as i plug it in and turn it on it blows the fuse. now trying to get ahold of pyramid to resolve my issues and cannot get a response back from them. amazon...Great job. Pyramid...your awful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate But Nothing More","review":"I was disappointed to find that the meters are not illuminated, something I guess I took for granted. I emailed Sound Around's Tech Support department twice to verify that the meters were not lighted and were not, in fact, defective, and have gotten NO REPLY of any sort.The unit has developed a little squeek when I turn it off. It sounds like perhaps the fan bearings need more lube. I have no idea but this does not bode well for a one month old unit.Honestly, I would have returned it but it weighs 18 pounds and UPS shipping back to Amazon would have run $25 or more. (I received it from Amazon with free shipping.)The bottom line: You can do a lot better than this power suppply."},{"rating":"2","title":"PIZZAPOCKET","review":"i THINK THIS ITEM IS A GOOD POWER SUPPLY. I WOULD LIKED TO SEE A STRONGER ONE MAYB CLOSE TO THE SAME PRICE BUT, I M HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT PREFORMS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fan for the price","review":"We bought this fan for our living room -- it is not noisy, and we have had no problems with wobbling. We like the contemporary look, though it certainly does not look terribly expensive -- but it's hard to beat for the price. No problems with it and we're happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miles in a different Light","review":"Been a big fan of Miles since the sixties, and I have to rate this album in his top ten performances.

The background information is very helpful and educational. The ingredients are generally readily available, prep time is reasonable, and instructions are clearly written. Although not necessary, I wouldn't mind if it had more photos in the book or on a website, as some of the appetizers are such appetizing eye candy!These recipes are perfect for serving at more formal \\"theme\\" dinners, and also for serving casual as \\"comfort food\\".The recipes, with simple to complex flavors, are a a great complement to such books as \\"Hors D'Oeuvres by Eric Treuille, which has even simpler recipes, more pictures, with more of an emphasis on bite-sized portions, ideal for fast and good appetizers. Enjoy both books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I found very few recipes I was actually interested in making.

No distortion at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers","review":"I have owned two sets of these speakers and I plan to buy a spare set for when these wear out. Great sound, perfect balance, tone control, and an ear phone jack. These are hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I have a MacBook which does not have much volume on its audio so I was looking for external speakers to get a boost. With these plugged in and both the computer and the speakers at full volume, it is not any louder than the MacBook itself. The quality of the MacBook audio is as good as these speakers and maybe better. All in all, a waste of money in my view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speakers SUCK!!!","review":"I bought these to listen to music on my computer. Needless to say, I am very unhappy with them. They sound very distorted at higher volumes, and that little blue light is very annoying.

But what's so funny about an artist who saw the world in a very emotional light and tried through his thick paint strokes, to convey the emotions of everyday scenes? Van Gogh was an original, and so I am proud to have him in my action figure collection.I will not take the figure or the tiny oil paints out of the box. I will truly treasure this little toy; it shows that heros can come in all shapes and sizes. I am sorry that Van Gogh had the incident with his ear, and it's nice that alot of his life is contained in sensitively written books so that we, the future artists of the world can glean some forethought on a master. God Bless Vincent Van Gogh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to Jesus for a non Christian","review":"I loved this book though I am not a Christian.
