The burping and farting contest not withstanding.The attempts at \\"clever\\" adult jokes (pot smoke? etc) directed at the adults stuck watching this abomination were merely reminders that it is possible to make movies for kids that appeal to adults as well.Usually movies this mindless are teen sex or slasher flicks that at least have nudity or gratuitous violence to keep the attention.(..)Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooby Doo Review","review":"It fails to be both a satire and a homage to the old 1960's cartoon of the same name.

The movie also has a lot of mean-spirited moments like Shaggy wanting to sacrifice his friends in order to save himself. In-fact, none of the cast members act nothing like the ones in the cartoon. Its use of supernatural elements is out of place in the Scooby-Doo World and I'm not counting the 1980's/1990's TV movies. The dumbest part of the movie is finding out that Scrabby-Doo(Scooby-Doo's Nephew) was the villain the whole time mainly because it was poorly handled. The only upside is Matthew Lillard's performance but it still fails to help in the film in the long run.

The thing that is interesting about the Scooby-Doo mysteries, is that there are no such things as ghosts and monsters - there is always some person \\"behind the mask\\". This movie completely turns that upside-down. In this movie, there is a cult of creepy monsters that exist and suck-out people's souls. This act seemed almost violent for kids to watch. I was horrified that they would take the basic premises of the series and turn it supernatural. My 7 year old was terrified - I wish I had previewed it.I will say that it is worth watching just for the performance of the Shaggy and Velma characters - wow! They seemed like the cartoons brought to life.I recommend Scooby-Doo 2 where there is a classic mystery with a real person behind it and the movie is still full of CGI creepy stuff for older kids.There is also a nice message of being happy with yourself and not trying to be someone that your not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love watching Scooby Doo all the time!!!!!!!!

There's very little difference between Scooby-Doo (and most of the other current films of this type) and that classic bomb! Perhaps the only difference is that today this garbage is actually successful and is even considered \\"sequel worthy\\". Also, Just to be fair to Howard the Duck, at least that movie had the visual appeal of Lea Thompson.If your idea of fun is bombastic, poorly produced special effects, a crappy modern soundtrack and a plethora of booger and fart jokes then this is the film for you!

The scene in which Scooby Doo and Fred are having a farting contest (?) is a bit distasteful. Also, unlike the Scooby Doo cartoons on TV, this movie might be a bit frightening to the younger set since it does have some scary stuff in it. So parents have been warned!

For some reason it is doing well at the box office as though the general viewing public wasn't very saavy on fine filmmaking and intelligent writing. Hmm (That was sarcasm by the way). The only bright spots are the dead-on performances of the 'animated' Scooby and Scrappy Doo and Matthew Lillard's portrayal of Shaggy. (Did I just say \\"portrayal of Shaggy? Jeez...)

People that find this type of stuff amuzing must get a real kick every time they go to the bathroom.Scooby DOo is unintelligent, boring, and classless.

My 2 year old is obsessed with Scooby, and she loved the movie, I think almost all the kids in the theater that day did, I've never seen so many little kids glued to a movie like that, if your child loves Scooby Doo then they would probably like the movie.

And this is a fact, I have watched it over 100 times. The cast, music, plot, effects, and everything about it is GREAT! This is my fave movie. Freddie Prinze Jr. (Fred), Matthew Lillard (Shaggy), and Linda Cardellini (Velma) did a superb job! Now, Sarah Michelle Gellar (Daphne) was the best! She was so HOT in this film. She gave Daphne a \\"sexy\\" edge! She was the best person in the film! And the costumes she wore were awesome. She mostly wore short skirts or short dresses. She was so HOT! All in all, this film is great. It has music that rocks, a dog that is da bomb, and a Daphne that make you want to go \\"WOW.\\" SEE YA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like it. Sorry.","review":"I hate to say but I am totally dissapointed with this movie.Let me start that I've never been a really big fan of Scooby Doo but this movie eats the cake as it really does nothing for the original cartoon series from the 1960s.The actings is absolutely clumsy and the script is drab. The whole plot was absolutely ridiculous and forgettable.I'm not saying avoid this at all costs but don't expect anything out of this film.Hopefully the sequel will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a dog returns...","review":"As a kid I loved the Scooby-Doo cartoons. Lots of good, clean, goofy, spooky fun. Unfortunately, the live-action version lost a LOT in the translation. The main problem is that it's not funny. Not even close. My wife and I kept asking each other, \\"Was that supposed to be funny?\\" even though we knew the answer...No. The plodding plot exists to allow the cardboard characters to go through their paces and to give the animators a chance to create the bumbling, larger-than-life Scooby-Doo. But this movie chases its tail, unsure what kind of beast it is: a mindless spoof, a monster flick, or a genuine mystery. Ultimately, and unfortunately, it settles on being an undesignated mess. Best advice to potential viewers: Scooby-Don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie has a real heart","review":"The flick has a real good nature, is kind of simply fun to watch, and truly shaggy & scooby really work. I wish daphne looked more like the cartoon version, but heh, can't have everything.The cast commentary version is kind of nice too. It's an interesting variant which sort of brings the actors down to earth. Maybe it's just me, but whenever I hear actors in semi-normal situations I'm always a bit surprised, in the \\"so that's how they realy behave\\" way.4 stars, instead of 5, because of simple things like daphne didn't look like daphne, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!!!","review":"This film is almost perfect except for one thing...i would say some of the scenes like when the \\"souls\\" come out of people's bodys may be a bit too intense for some younger viewers.

After all, one reads to be entertained and/or educated, right? With that being said....The only reason I finished this book was to see if the story could redeem itself in some way. I found the main character, Nicholas, to be very self-centered (I guess that is were the title of the book comes from). I felt some sympathy for his wife, Etna, since it seemed she tried to be a feminist during a period of time when women were not considered equals. (Example: it was ok for him to have lovers before they were married, even prostitutes, but NOT ok for her to have a lover(s) before him.)This was the first book I have read from Anita Shreve....I hope her other books are not like this one. I might (and that is a big might) try one of her other books just to see. Can someone recommend one or should I just give up on Anita Shreve?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"I don't think you could set out to write something this dull and boring with more unlikeable characters. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly pointless","review":"The characters are not likeable. The story is uneventful. This is not Shreve's best work by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you make someone love you?","review":"No, and to try is not to truly love them. Remember the old story about the butterfly. This is a book I began with excitement as I have been on a feminist literature kick, and this being written from the male's point of view added a nice twist. I like Shreve's work in general, but I soon grew tired of the narrative voice in this work. I continued to read out of loyalty to the author. I grew increasingly unhappy as the novel went on--and maybe that was her intention. It was difficult to sympathize with the main characters, and the setting just didn't strike a chord with me either. Overall, I just didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All He Ever Wanted","review":"I found this book compelling, not least because its protagonist is so unattractive. Shreve shows him first as dull and pedantic, then gradually turns up the heat until she has created a monster. Yet our hearts break for this man who wants only one thing, then allows his obsessive passion to overwhelm his moral sense and destroy what he most cherishes. Shreve's books are always insightful, and her storytelling gifts are superb. This is not one of her very best, but it's more than good enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the tedium and unpleasantness","review":"This is a depressing story, told by an unpleasant narrator. I don't object to such a thing categorically. Obviously the narration was intentionally slow-moving, pompous, and tedious, to demonstrate the character of the narrator. To me, this style just wasn't worth slogging through for the characters, who seemed wooden and one-dimensional, and the story, which lacked impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writer, but not a good book","review":"I've enjoyed several of Anita Shreve's books, and she's obviously a wonderful writer. However, her approach in this novel guarantees a lot of frustration on the reader's part, at least in my case. The story is told by Van Tassel, the oppressive, pompous husband, and his views are cliched, and consequently just not that interesting. I understand what she was trying to illustrate here - that due to the times, Etna was unable to tell her own story, unable to pursue her true love, unable to have any financial or emotional independence, etc., etc. - and her point is well made, but WAY too late in the novel. I actually picked up another novel in the middle of this one, which I never do, because I just couldn't keep reading. I'd suggest reading her other novels rather than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All He Ever Wanted","review":"I complete bore, I continued to read because I thought it would pick up. It didn't. I couldn't find a story that was anything more then a man who fell in love with someone who didn't love him back and never pretended to, he tried to pretend it would come in time, and all he did was loose the daughter that loved him. This isn't a novel, but something that happens all the time in todays reality. I look to a romance novel for fantasy and passion. This had none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Starter","review":"I couldn't really get into this book. I'll try later, to see if the book grabs my attention, like I do with most books I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring!","review":"This has got to be the most boring book I've ever read, it's very drawn out.

The story finally became very captivating and gripping at that point, but it wasn't enough to compensate for the overly long and drawn-out introduction. Overall, I was disappointed with the pacing. But the jealousy and obsessive complusions Nicholas feels are so very real . . . the author's always been adept at realistically portraying our scariest and darkest innermost thoughts. Still, I'd give this one a miss and read her others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring,,,,,","review":"I bought this book back in January because the back of the book makes it sound very interesting. It's now July and I'm still not finished with it. I don't usually mind the first person point of view, but with the Van Tassel character narrating, it seems to weigh down the book and make it so completely boring. I have gone almost half way through the book and I can't see where it's going and I could honestly care less. The characters are very uninteresting and a book with characters that don't engage a reader is really hard to read. I have given up reading this book and it'll sit on my shelf until I can try to find a way to get rid of it, I'm just glad that I only paid $4.99 for it. I recommend staying away from this book but if you must attempt to read, borrow it from the library so you won't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Story","review":"This story was boring without a single character I could identify with. The writing was stilted and the characters one-dimensional. Not Shreve's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"shreve's least successful,novel","review":"This was a trite novel of no substance with a flimsy plot and dreary writing. There was nothing of interest in the first 3/4 of the book, and a mildly interesting fourth 1/4. If Anita Shreve had not written this novel, no intelligent reviewer would have praised it. I found it a waste of time and obviously a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been good, but ...","review":"I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the stilted language was unbearable. I am so tired of books that try to show us how pedantic, boring, etc., the narrator is by attributing a pedantic, boring voice to him or in other cases, her. And inevitably, the narrator will tell the reader how boring, pedantic, and ordinary he is. In that respect, this book did not disappoint! The story could have been intriguing told from a different point of view, but instead it is merely tedious. And please spare us the trite use of correspondence to fill in the blanks. I read this for a book group. Otherwise, I would have put it down after the first couple of pages. If I could give negative stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing; I *hated* the officious jerk who told this story","review":"Man, did I *hate* this book! It's not that it's not well- written, it is, it's being in the presence of the main character. The protagonist, who tells the story in first person, is boorish, arrogant and a monster. Nicholas Van Tassel is an indifferent professor at a small New Hampshire college at the turn of the twentieth century who sees a woman during a fire and cannot conceive of her not wanting him, only she never did, including after agreeing to marry him. Once they are married, this man who can see no further than the end of his nose, nor can he perceive or imagine what people, including his wife whom he professes to love, think or feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best...","review":"Having always had a good opinion of Anita Shreve's writing style (if not all of her stories, for instance, I loved A Wedding in December and Fortune's Rocks but was only mildly pleased by Sea Glass), I thought that this novel looked extremely promising. Unfortunately, I simply could not get into this story. Not one of the characters was likeable and everything was so predictable that I was ready to give up on finishing this book before I reached the halfway point.The one redeeming quality of this novel--and the reason I gave it two stars instead of one--is how well Ms. Shreve was able to write from the perspective of a man, particularly a man such as Nicholas Van Tassel--stuffy, priggish, and a bit of a monster in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita Shreve rocks!","review":"Anita Shreve just can't seem to write a bad book.In All He Ever Wanted, her tale concerns unrequited love, the results of the somewhat unlikely 'love at first sight.' Maybe this was more commn in the early 20th century, the era in which this book is set, but it was the only part of the tale that stretched my credulity. The story covers a lot of ground: anti-Semitism, ... abuse, women's rights, and academia.If you liked Shreves' other books, you won't be disappointed by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All He Ever Wanted","review":"I found it difficult to get into this book. For me, the most important factor in a book is the characters. I didn't really like any of the characters in this book. The narrators actions were deplorable. I didn't understand his obsession with his wife. She does not seem worthy of this kind of devotion and doesn't hide the fact that she's not in love with him. While Shreve is a great writer, I just didn't find the story engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"All He Ever Wanted","review":"Did not like the book. It dragged on and was a poor subject. Anita Shreve has written better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A departure for her","review":"This book was a bit of a departure for Shreve, a little different from her usual novels, but I liked it. I didn't like it as much as Sea Glass or Fortunes Rocks, but it was still a good read. I guess the main thing was that the main character & narrator was a man. Plus, he's from late 1800's, early 1900's.Whatever she writes though, it's a book I pick up and can't put down until I've finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My First Anita Shreve novel-My last","review":"As an avid reader, I have always prided myself on getting through books quickly, thoroughly, and always shutting the final page with a satisfied sigh and a feeling of wonderment. There has been only one exception-this novel. I found it very difficult to get through, as the narrator is a despicable bore. Although Anita Shreve portrays the Victorian era very well, I found the descriptions to be dry and lacking in imagination. The beginning and middle lasted far too long, and the ending was too short,although I was grateful that my misery was finally at an end. This was my first Anita Shreve novel and as other reviewers have described this work as one of her best, it is sure to be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"All He Ever Wanted is a dissapointment","review":"Anita Shreve not at her best. Pilot's Wife and Weight of Water were incredible. I kept expecting All He Ever Wanted to improve but it continued to be depressing despite moments of interest. Sad and depressing story. Not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like the characters or the story!","review":"Typically, I love Anita Shreve. The Pilot's Wife, Fortune's Rocks, and Light on Snow are some of my favorite books from her. But the characters in this book are poorly developed, the story line is slow, and frankly is not interesting. There are so many books that are just more worthy of my time, that I wish I had not picked this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Begged to borrow it--then returned it unread--tiresome book","review":"The stilted language was unbearable. The pace was horrific. I am a big Shreve fan, but this was a disappointment. I read the first 50 or so pages, skimmed the end. On the bright side, I guess Shreve does a very convincing old man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She's written better books","review":"I didn't like this book at all - I found nothing appealing in the main character and never grew to like him nor did I feel bad for the situation he created for himself. That being said, I didn't like the woman he was obsessed with either. I enjoy books that draw you in and make you feel something for at least one of the characters or the story they are telling, but this book didn't do that for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a lifesaver!!!","review":"My son is just about 8 months old now and I figured I would jump online and start reviewing some of the products I have used.

She is far too young to roll by herself. The mesh bottom that supposedly holds up the firm prtable mattress was baggy and saggy, and so the mattress's folds buckled and bulged. Nothing anchors the mesh bottom to the playpen sides, nor is there a center bar of any kind o support the mattress. The whole thing just dangles there in space. Extremely unsafe. Graco said they would send another basinette, but I think it may be a design problem -- in any case, keep a close watch on your child the first time you use this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, must have item!","review":"I love this play pen! It has it all! I didn't want to waste my money on a bassinet for my bedroom when I brought my baby home so I put this in there and it worked great. The changing station is right there so you don't have to leave the room to change diapers. It's easy to take down and put back up. I was originally going to get the one in Colby but then I saw this one and love the colors so much better and it was cheaper. I like that it has the mobile instead of the canopy. Who needs a canopy in the house? But if you take off the canopy, there are no toys for your little one to look at.

I have referred to it many times, and always planned to set up a separate sewing room but never did. I have purchased it for family members who did get to set up their room and they loved it. I have loaned it to frineds and over the years lost it. So I bought it again and am now lucky enough to be able to put all the wonderful tips into the new room we are building now. This book covers everything needed to set up a room that will be tailor made to you with your height and comfort incorporated into everthing. Definitely a must have if you spend much time sewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring!","review":"If you need a little motivation to reorganize your sewing or craft space, this is a great book. The photos are plentiful, and there are lots of good ideas for storage and work surfaces, no matter how much space you can devote to it. Let it inspire you to create your own dream sewing space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice plans","review":"The book had very good diagrams and useful worksheets, the plans were clear and very helpful.There are diagrmatic plans, sketches of ideas and pictures of actual work spaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a dream","review":"I am new to sewing and working to set up sewing area. I thought this would be a guideline book. What it seems to be is the personal sewing rooms of professionals. If I were a publisher of sewing books, I too could have these sewing rooms. I think they have beautiful places to develop their patterns and books they sell to us. I wish they had considered someone who doesn't have the funds to set up these places. The closest they came to my life style was the one under the stairs. Unfortunately, I don't have any stairs. Perhaps they should have gone back to when they did not have a publishing company and think about the closets being used for clothes, not sewing rooms. I will figure out a place to sew, but not with much help from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DREAM OF A BOOK","review":"This book is an invaluable tool for ,not only the person planning a new room ,but also for those of us trying to get the most out of what we already have. She even has some tips and hints for closet arranging and adding sewing antiques to your decor. Her suggestions fits the budget concious homemaker as well as the professional seamstress."},{"rating":"2","title":"E Nomine","review":"This is an unbelievable CD, full of emotion and full of good heavy beats. The mix between low-guthral (Rammstein like) German vocals and choir (Enigma like) chanting, mixed together with a dash of dark-techno, creats a lovely blend. If you buy this CD and it doesn't move you, emotionally, you better check your pulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"An excellent German album. This artist is talented with a large variety of syles of music. If you are into Grimm fairy tales and Dracula you would probably like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still offering top notch Catholic journalism with the typical scholarly Jesuit approach","review":"A popular yet serious magazine with a long history supporting and guiding Catholic America, this magazine continues its historic commitment to excellence, orthodoxy and the full realm of Catholic dogma and beliefs.America is a valuable and intelligent and prayerful addition to any truly Catholic household, offerd here at an affordable price. Great reading for all your family and sustenance for your soul upon our journey as Pilgrim Church. Let us get there all together in peace and in justice.Read America first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Secular","review":"This is another sad endeavor by the Jesuits. Ignatius of Loyola and the early Jesuits were fierce defenders of the Faith and the Holy Father. How times have changed. This magazine is more concerned with the secular realm and appeasing liberals than it is to spreading the Faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heterodox","review":"America magazine is a Jesuit magazine with a liberal Catholic bent. The editors will often give heterodox dissenters room to disseminate their views. If that's your cup of tea, fine, but you have no reason to be a member of the Catholic Church if you can't follow the pope and bishops. Instead, look to the Episcopal church. I do not recommend this publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"With a cat and two dogs, I've used numerous urine removal products on my carpet (Urine Off, Stink Out, Nature's Miracle, Odo-Ban, Eco-88). I read the instructions for Get Serious and followed them. Although it will get pee stains out of carpet, it does not eliminate the odor. A healthy dose of Urine Off will remove the odor, but sometimes leaves behind a greasy yellow-brown spot. Eco-88 will remove odor and stain, but it is expensive. Those are the two products I've come to rely on. Get Serious is too expensive for as little as it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enormous wisdom in few words","review":"This is a small book, but it says volumes. I read it in two short settings, there's just so much content that I had to allow it time to digest.I don't think I would have picked it up on my own, simply because I've had my fill of the tragic events of 9/11 and the aftermath. I received it as a gift and it came highly recommended. From the time I opened and perused it, I was captivated.I now feel that my own healing process has begun; not only for the events of 9/11, but for other tragedies in my life as well. I feel obligated to say that the author is Christian and the book is biblically based. There was a time in my life when that may have offended me, and I would have wanted to know. However, there can be no greater love than God's love and this is the message of this wonderful text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent essays","review":"It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a decent, well structured, set of essays. Having recently waded through a relatively pointless Umberto Eco novel and struggling with the light-weight redundancy of the \\"Left Behind\\" series, I found Ravi's carefully wrought essays a refreshing wind of intelligence. For anyone inclined to things multi-cultural this little gem is a must. There are few observations that are particularly prophetic in the light of the more recent blood letting in India. Do your mind a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not clear","review":"I had to read this book for a critical review in a religion class that I took. I thought this book was awful. The author is never really clear on what points he is trying to make throughout the book. He jumps from one subject to another and never gives a good transistion from one subject to another. It appears to me that this author was just saying that God existed and Islam is abusing their religion against us because they dislike the Americans moral system. No, maybe it was that he was glad to be an American, because he ends his book with a story of somebody recognizing that his home was in the United States. I'm not exactly sure is the point I am trying to make. I wouldn't recommend anybody to read this book. I only gave this book two stars because the author gave a good description of how the Islamic people believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lil tuna","review":"I can't think of a worse tuner than this... the only good thing about it is that it fits with the rest of the OK D pedals in their little powered case... this thing has no silent/bypass tuning, the display colors are horrible, can't see anything in the dark AND it has its own mind - useless... need an improved one PLEASE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather pointless","review":"International word lists were an interesting appendix to 1995's \\"The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design,\\" but two years earlier were put together for this book. It presents Windows 3.1 terms translated to 14 languages, sorted both by alphabet and by category. These lists seem a big waste of space, especially as they're also present on an attached diskette. However, first thirty pages slightly redeem the book, containing a condensed round-up of popular and obscure graphical elements of Windows 3.1 -- with a lot of illustrated examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"please do not waste your money on this like I did. poor video quality and all at night...seemed like it was filmed a decade ago by a 16 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"My most memorable book","review":"My Friend the Monster was my first \\"chapter book\\" that I read with little assistance from my parents. It made a huge impact on me. Years later, I realized that this book was the first objective look at prejudice that I had. It made me want to befriend those who were different and helped me realize that if and when I'm the different one, I want people to befriend me. I highly recommend this book. The material sounds \\"too grown up\\" for kids but it isn't. It's on just the right level for them to understand and ask thoughtful questions that will enable them to grow. It could have been better edited for correct syntax."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prine masterpiece","review":"This was a comeback album for John and in my opinion, it's his best ever, and boy oh boy,(no pun intended) that's saying plenty. This guy's responsible for my switch in music genre's some years ago with his early stuff. I never thought he'd top his classic self- titled and \\"Bruised Orange\\" releases, but he did it. The smartest storyteller around. Thanks John, \\"you got gold\\" inside of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"on the road\\" music...","review":"I bought this CD and it has really grown on me. When I'm on a road trip I always bring it with me. Reminds me of Dylan in the way he can tell a story. John Prine is unique and consistant in his style on this record- no bluffing here- he cuts straight to heart of real life in his songwriting and presentation. I really like this music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs about great stories.","review":"Though I initially found this album a bit overproduced (against the folkier likes of his phenomenal debut and Bruised Orange albums), I've grown to find that these songs and their stories more than compensate. What a great album -- I found out about it twelve years late. This man tells a story like no other."},{"rating":"2","title":"My missing years","review":"How could I have missed John Prine all these years. I have always like Kris K. and the resemblance is eerie.

They have very distinguished vocals, and guitars. They do an awesome job at mixing punk, ska, and reggae, and making it sound real \\"popy\\" and \\"serious\\" They have made a music style of their own, and no one has been able to match it yet.

I honestly do not think I need to say anything else except that I just got scammed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Beg to Differ","review":"While this album is just as wonderful as the reviewers below have said, and a classic of the singer-songwriter genre, I want to cast a vote in favor of the cut \\"If You Don't Want My Love\\" which is much-maligned below. While it has none of the whimsy and humor which characterize most of Prine's work, it is in fact a perfect encapsulation of a bitter cast-off lover's state of mind -- and stays on and on in the memory. It is in fact my favorite cut on the album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Euphoria and melancholy and humor and......well, life.","review":"Dynamite. Not immediately as accessible as his debut album but it's folkier edge really grows on you to make it a favorite. All the songs are memorable, but \\"That's the Way the World Goes Around\\" is Prine at his best, marrying melody with a new, yet familiar story from your family or a town near you."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"this is a great record! its got all of johns sides on it from fun country licks to slow folksy love songs if i had to reccomend one jonh prine album this would be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"it rocks","review":"this cd is the best. it has a couple songs i don't like, but thats okay. plankeye, value pac, and the oc supertones are the best groups on this cd. i should've given it 4 stars, but i love the supertones so it earned a 5!!!

A heavy metal singer named Lola Black who was thought dead turns out to have been kidnapped and Gorodish and Alba try to save her to cash in on the reward money. This book has one of the most interesting stories out of the entire series and managed to capture my interest faster than most of the others. Its a bit easier to understand if youve read some of the other book from the series, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"mis-information","review":"Description or product is wrong. There is no quad independent power/charging indicators. They are set up in banks of two. One light for two charging bays. Batteries must be charged in banks of two. Tried e-mailing Vidpro for additional info on this charger. E-mail came back as undeliverable. Cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy! This Product is DANGEROUS!!","review":"The Power 2000 line of chargers have been woefully awful in my experience. My first one worked for a while, then suddenly the batteries would not hold a charge. This was already a bad sign, since NiMH batteris are supposed to be long-life. Because I liked its compact size for travel, I decided to give this charger one more try. I purchased a current model, the Power 2000 XP-333.Several hours after inserting the batteries properly and plugging the unit in, I noticed a burning electrical smell. When I traced the odor back to the new charger, I of course unplugged it and nearly burnt myself on the batteries, which were scorchingly hot. I fear they might have burst or started a fire had I left them in the charger any longer.There are too many other dependable charger makers -- why take a chance on this unreliable, dangerous product? This product should be rated zero stars -- it's earned a skull & crossbones warning in my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After more than 12 hours, this \\"rapid\\" charger did not charge the batteries that came with it. The charger was also very hot to the touch when it was trying to charge the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless--save your money","review":"I bought the charger, extra AAs and extra AAAs and NEVER used any of them. The batteries NEVER held a charge. Heck, yesterday, before I ditched it all, I had charged the AAAs for a good 24 hours and the flashlight I put them in barely registered a microwatt of power. And the girth of the AAs was too wide to fit any of the devices I tried putting them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This came as a bundle with some camera stuff I bought. At first I thought it was the external flash that I was using these for, but then I tried some alkaline batteries and the flash worked. Other reviewers except the one good one (hmmm) say basically the charger sucks. I'm trying to salvage the batteries with another charger. My order was botched up between Amazon and Adarama so without going into detail I'm screwed. Hope the batteries work. This charger is headed to a U.S. landfill. Thanks for another Chinese made quality item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stonewall Jackson: Hero of America","review":"In reading the book Stonewall Jackson, by Allen Tate, I have furthered my belief that this was a man of piety, heroism, chivallry, and a true champion of American values. That is to say, General Jackson was a fighter for freedom and the homeland: something which is highly regarded in today's day and age. Tate expressed this idea even when he wrote it 76 years ago. Therefore, I strongly reccomend this book to all who value the American ideal: the fight for freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stonewall Jackson: A Hero of America","review":"By reading the book: Stonewall Jackson, by Allen Tate, I have furthered my belief that this was a man of great piety, heroism, chivallry, and freedom. He fought for all these things in his time, yet in our time freedom and the fight to preserve it and the Homeland seem to be of the most importance. The fight for freedom has always been an American ideal, and Tate did an excellent job in depicting how one man committed his whole life to it during the War of Northern Aggression. I stongly reccomend this book to all who desire to reap the truth, and who hold dear the Homeland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I agree with Landess in the preface. This book is poorly researched. It doesn't show us the depth or breath of the man. It would not even be poor historial fiction and is horrid as a biography. It's one strong point is Tate's abilitity to show the Southern feeling on their state rights being violated; along with the comparison of Indian rights being viloent by the North."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for a serious Course Student","review":"This book has now replaced Gary Renard's books for me...... of course, these will always have a place in my heart.......however this writing goes so much deeper for me personally....it opens up my life more and more to understanding what the Couse in Miracles is all about. Had I found it earlier in my life, it would have saved me years of struggling to understand the course. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read.","review":"A perfect follow up to A Course In Miracles which I study. I encourage all seekers to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the source.","review":"Of course this or any other interpretation of ACIM might help. However it is always best to go directly to the source. A kindergarten approach to spirituality might be what the ego wants us to do. Next book will probably be in the series of ACIM for Dummies. Let us kindly beware of simplifying the teachings of Jesus or the Holy Spirit to adapt our own ego's gustos for delusion. Of course it is not an easy approach to reality or truth. So it might be common sense to let the Holy Spirit guide us directly through the Text and the Lessons. I still believe Kenneth Wapnick is the most sane and trusted friend in this journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Supposedly, this is a companion to the workbook of A Course in Miracles; and, supposedly, it's a channeling from Jesus. I have a problem with this because according to A Course in Miracles, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit, has spoken only through this venue and to be suspicious if any other writing says it comes through Jesus. I go along with the latter. Whether or not Journey Beyond Words is bogus, it's a pleasant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the meaning of ACIM (r)","review":"If you are led by your ego, and afraid to trust Jesus as he teaches you in the Course, you will find this book interesting I guess? Personnally when I hunger for the Course, I read the Course, and when I thirst for water I drink water. I admit that I am not looking for a hodge-podge spirituality, so I may be a bit biased. But please understand what you are saying when you say that the words and meanings of Jesus need clarification. Who would do that-The Holy Spirit, or the ego? Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FORMATTED FOR KINDLE!!!","review":"I had to ask for a refund for this kindle book because it was not formatted correctly and the font was way too small and wouldn't allow me to enlarge it. Too bad because many of my ACIM friends had recommended it... but will have to wait for the author to make corrections and adjustments to the format. I'm very grateful to Amazon for the refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A communication from the Holy Spirit","review":"This book records teachings received by the author, much as the Course in Miracles was received. It is of similar inspiration and not all that much easier to read than the Course, actually, although it does complement Course teachings by developing some of them. It is appropriate for those who love the Course and who are thrilled by this type of communication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"The web description REALLY should have CLEARLY stated that this is more of the \\"Jesus channeled through me too!!\\" crap. It has been written in peculiarly awkward style I presume is an attempt to mimic Helen's iambic pentameter to fake authenticity. This fails. A brief review of the book reveals a number of questionable interpretations of ACIM. It's really more of an amalgam of the sappiest pop lyrics of the 60's and 70's bound together with residual new age \\"deep\\" thought. There must be a better way to more clearly identify serious, thoughtful commentary on the astonishingly complex masterpiece of A Course In Miracles than this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good looking, but poor workmanship","review":"This pedal looks great, but the mechanism doesn't move freely (it binds) due to poor workmanship, specifically in the arch mechanism in the bottom of the pedal.

If it exists, I would love to go there and eat all the cake and cookies and ice cream available on the island. Please let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament","review":"This book by Christopher Wright is excellent. I came away with a much greater appreciation of how Jesus is seen throughout the Old Testament, and a sense of how the whole history of God's people was leading up to the coming of the Redeemer."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Much Noise","review":"Tha cassete work fine alone with the Ipod, but when you use the charger the are to much noise.Do no buy this article."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"First off, read the specs on this item before you buy it. Amazon states it's for 1st generation Nanos only. The tight fit into the 12V adapter is good, the arm is stiff enough that it will not move on its own. The cradle holds my iPod well and the audio out at the base has no static. I have a direct line into my headunit (don't need the tape). I think the only option this does not have is to turn the charge on and off. I don't know how constantly charging (even when car is off) will affect the battery life. Most car chargers do not offer this. This product fits my application perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I read negative reviews about this item before purchasing it, and hoped that the negative experiences were a fluke. My experience with this was that the sound quality using the included cassette adapter was horrible. I have one from Sony that I connected to the cradle, and the sound was better, but still distorted. The sound was much better when just using the Sony cassette adapter plugged into the headphone jack on the nano. I returned this item to the seller (subject to a restocking fee)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for 2nd Gen Nano!","review":"The cradle does NOT fix a second generation iPod nano. I bought this for my brand new 8GB black ipod nano, and the curves on the base of the dock keep the nano from seating firmly.

The most ideal would be if my car had a CD player with an auxilary input, but my car only has a cassette player. The FM transmitter thing wouldn't work too well for me becuase I live in a fairly large metropolitan area.The sound quality is better than some other cassette adapters I tried. The fact that it plugs into the cigarette lighter as well seems to boost the volume quite a bit.One of the things that conviced my to try this was the fact that here the price is better by 20.00 than a local big box office store. Also the fact that it has an secondary dock if I want to try an FM transmitter later on that is also an option. But living in a big city with so much of the FM dial already in use I don't see that happening in the near future.Bottom line, it's not perfect, but it's better than nothing and the the price is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrreat!","review":"This is a great watch for anyone looking to both pace and monitor their efforts to get back into shape. Take the time to read the manual and sign on to Polar's online trainer.I've never been a jogger and shunned cardio until I went over 240 pounds back in March 09. I've had to start what is essentially interval training just to stay in the suggested HR zone set by the watch. I've only had the watch a little over a month but it is definitely helping me knock off the last 5-7 pounds en route to my goal of 210.This is goofy but I like getting the little trophy notification on Monday mornings signifying that I completed all my sessions and met goals for the previous week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to complicated","review":"I was really excited about this product, but after getting it, it just didn't work well. First, it won't work without an infared connection to the computer, so I had to buy one. Even holding the watch within 4 inches of the infared device, it wouldn't communicate well with the computer. If you want to monitor your activity throughout the day, you have to wear a strap that goes around your chest, which must be kept wet. It is uncomfortable, and doesn't work very well. If you are larger, the vinyl straps cut into your body. I returned it to Amazon, and they gave me full credit for the watch. The instruction book is long and tedious, and you won't burn many calories during the hours it takes to learn how to use the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome SF PUNK ROCK!","review":"Woah... Finally, finally... I have heard these guys... I've been wanting to check them out for a hell-uv-a longtime now. New Red puts out the best punk rock in North America. If it wasn't for New Red, I don't know what I'd do... (Seriously). This is agressive angry snotty punk from like the early 80's... I \`hear' they have an AVENGERS tinge to them. Not only does Revik Delfin have some of the most amazing female vocals out there, she's also absolutely beautiful, just beautiful. She is a very orginal vocalist, great stuff. All I know is this is going right next to my ANTI-FLAG CD where punk is straight from the heart and not from the wallet.

Must Use via Hole in Battery Cover","review":"I bought this item approx 1 year before actually using it. I initially thought the item was DOA since there is only one way to make connections and my camera(Canon SD850IS) would not power up. I came back to Amazon to check reviews and noticed others reported receiving a DOA item as well. It turns out if the battery cover remains open and the cord is connected directly to the coupler, the camera will not power up. There is a small hole behind the part of the battery/memory card cover labeled \\"Card/Batt. Open\\". This smaller cover needs to be opened with a fingernail or small tool to the right of the arrow beside the word \\"Open\\". Once I connected the cord via this hole to the coupler, the camera powered up. Now I can use the camera for extended hours without worrying about battery life.Gave the product 5 stars but it would have been helpful if the instruction sheet from Canon provided some detail regarding the proper connection of the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not work","review":"Tried two of these for my Canon Powershot SD800 IS Digital Elph and neither would power the camera. Camera works fine on its battery BUT these devices evidently do not work with the camera. Replacing the battery with the ACK-DC30 left the camera dark. Checking the output showed an AC voltage of about 50v AC as the output NOT a DC voltage. Two devices same result. Maybe a bad Chinese import?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after fewer than 10 uses","review":"I had this only 3 or 4 months and had used it fewer than 10 times when it just quit working. Don't know if it was the adapter itself of the DC coupler (which, by the way, does NOT come with the adapter), but both were purchased at the same time. Canon does not post any info (that I could find) on its web site about how to handle warranty repair returns, so it's even more inconvenient than just packaging it up and returning it.Turns out I really don't need this anyway--the camera has plenty of power for downloading photos onto my computer. In my case it's just a $50 accessory that really isn't necessary. UPDATE: Just called Canon to find out about warranty repair, and they said it doesn't even HAVE a warranty! Not even 90 days, let alone a year. Even companies that sell cheap-o products generally have some kind of warranty on their products. Kinda makes you wonder about the quality of Canon products, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic, has contact connection issues","review":"I purchased this item to be able to run on A/C power while viewing pictures and movies on my HDTV. I have tried to hook the adapter to TV and camera and it worked fine until I moved the camera. Then it lost power. It has connection / contact problems. I dont know if it is a A/C (simulated) battery pack to camera body contact or A/C power cord to A/C (simulated) battery pack or and I really tend to doubt that the new cable is defective but it could be.

Those values often stand in the way of more erudite percption of the nature of reality and truth that could be had, were we not bogged down by our, sometimes insistingly, dogmatic views of how things must or should be.In someone else's reality they are rarely exactly as any of us personally perceives. Bartholomew's eye-openers lead you to realise that compassion is a foremost 'must' in understanding. After all compassion makes us care.

They played it straight, simply as a fight story between the two parties.Yes, there were credibility problems with the story but overall, it was good escapist adventure. The dragons were realistic-looking, the scenery dreary but the story interesting and intense in spots.I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a night of adventure on film.

Christian Bale was a very sympathetic character, and Matt McConaughey is at his over-the-top best. This isn't the ... heartthrob I hated in romance movies like THE WEDDING PLANNER; here he's buff, tattooed, bald, and really PO'd. He looks great, and his character is definately someone to cheer for, as you can tell he's playing his machismo down with some sly tongue-in-cheek asides. I also appreciated that this movie was pure action - there was a pretty girl in the cast that could have led to a really cheesy love triangle, but it thankfully never happened.

There are a several reasons this movie is worse then your usual bad action movie, one is that there is nothing to cheer for, sure you want the humans to destroy the monsters, but if the whole world has already been destroyed and there are only a few hundred humans left in existence they can't rebuild the whole world, hehnce there is know point. The other is the action is boring, it's the same thing done over about 4 times in a row, dragon attacks and 4 or 5 nameless humans get killed trying to kill it, who cares??

I hate it when films are over-hyped to appeal to true genre fans but when you turn up you get a super-thin plot, bad acting, awful CGI, characters you really don't care about and 20 seconds of action.Remember, just kill the main dragon and all the others will die too.

Unfortunately, the first few moments told me that I wasn't going to see what I expected. In fact, the most you see of the dragons themselves are often shadows or brief glimpses. When you do see them in full view, the special effects are quite good. But I've seen much better. The story had too many plot-holes. The script was really lousy.

The dragons, and the setting in which they've placed the cast, becomes secondary. I have nothing against character-driven stories, however, this movie failed to convincingly deliver such a story.

Now audiences are presented with something called REIGN OF FIRE starring Christian Bale (who is fine casting) and Matthew McCaughnahay (who seems to chew his lines as much as he enjoys rubbing his bald head and chews his cigar). Too bad for the dragon. He has little to do. While the adds made this film out to be like BLACK HAWK DOWN meets DRAGONSLAYER, the actual plot is a total letdown. The effects are good. The 'castle' is a reject from some old ROAD WARRIOR film. And the supporting cast are simply in the picture to become toasted weenies for the dragon's breath. The lead female is wasted unless you enjoy just watching a pretty face and nothing else. I love a good dragon story. I love dragons. They are the flip side of the unicorn. Bad vs. good.

It's hard to believe how lame the premise of this movie was. Dragons reappear and lay waste to civilization at its peak. But now that there's hardly anybody left, we discover that all you really need to do is kill a single dragon. Because there's only one male. These things have been around since before the dinosaurs, they've outlived everything, and yet there's only ever one male? A single illness or accident would have destroyed the species long long ago. That's such a contrived excuse for a solution I'm embarrassed for the people who wrote, directed, and starred in this. It could have been an interesting story. But that's just pathetic.

That's about the best that can be said for it. If one begins watching the film with that sort of thing in mind, there will be no disappointment. The script? Minimal at best. The acting? Feh. Matthew McConaughey is the absolute worst. Horrible. One can't possibly say enough how annoying his character is, and his over-acting makes Mel Gibson's efforts in other films seem subtle and understated by comparison.

It doesn't have the decency to be bad, just mediocre. You don't leave the theatre discussing how bad it is, you just leave stupefied like you just had a meal from McDonalds. A recent example of this type of film is \\"King Arthur\\". The film basically concerns a recent future where a plague of dragons has laid waste to England and a group of survivors led by Christian Bale. A band of American commandoes led by Matthew McConaughey arrives to assist in the dragonslaying. No pun intended, sparks fly between the Brits and these interloping Yanks. This movie is not so much directed but filmed. The actors here don't embarrass themselves but they don't really distinguish themeselves either. Ho-hum, the special effects are adequate.

Several plot holes easily distract viewers from the (thin) storyline and dialog. Thinking back on it, I'm not sure any emotion was played out until the last minute or two of the film, and much of the action was standard stuff as well ... this movie was more like a D&D Mad Lib than a hollywood movie.

The films begins with the uncovering of the sleeping dragon, then morphs to the post-apocalyptic period with the human race barely surviving in a dragon dominated planet. The script has so many hole in the design, it is very surprising that the script was not mistaken for swiss cheese. So many questions left unanawered ...Why have the dragons so dominated the planet?

I didn't snap out of my daze until 20 minutes to the end when the action finally kicked in instead of mindless babble between the main characters about how they are going to kill the dragon instead of actually trying to do it. Incredibly mediocre and nothing worth your money. Skip it.C-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, beautifully shot","review":"This film has that classic post-apocalyptic look - very dark, burnt-out, broken battlements, etc. It's a nice mix of fantasy and military SF. Christian Bale is fabulous - you feel a lot of sympathy for his character, but you are also frustrated by his (at first) lack of action to change his situation. This is where the charismatic and fun McConaughey character comes in. Matt's unrecognizable from those wussy love interests he's playing in the past - and that's a good thing. He and Christian Bale make perfect eye-candy, especially in those shirtless combat scenes which is a welcome change for me, as a female, from sitting through action movies where girls always get naked.The dragons look great, and yeah there are some big plot holes - but I wasn't expecting Shakespeare. This movie was fun to watch, fast-paced and just plain great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, Great Movie!","review":"I have to admit, I thought that this movie would ....I thought it would just be another monster movie (with dragons).I was surprised by the fact that it was actually good!The plot is actually decent, the acting is good (bale and Mcconaughey are great)and direction and special effects are top notch.Bale and McConaughey are in top physical shape,but look much grungier than their usual \\"pretty boy\\" images.DVD is fun with cool animated windows, and decent bonus features.over all a great movie to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fizzle...","review":"When I saw the previews for this I was interested. It takes something on the order of a \\"Lord of The Rings\\" movie to get me to the theatre so my wife and I waited until Reign of Fire was released on DVD before seeing it.Good thing, too. If I had shelled out theatre admission prices I'd have been truly disappointed.To describe how poorly made this film is would waste your time almost as much as actually viewing it would be.Avoid at all costs. If you're in the mood for a Dragon film, just pull out your copy of \\"Dragonslayer\\" and watch it again. You would be better served by that vastly better film. You still have your old VHS or laser disc copy, yes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE S U C K S!!!!","review":"With all of our technical advances with regards to CGI and robotics this film COULD have been great. Unfortunately for me and my wallet it was not. The build up was slow and not very explanitory then the last 20 minutes picks up a bit like it's going to start being exciting then it ends!Matthew McConaughey who I usually find to be quite a good actor is nothing but a beefed up termanator in this film, there is absolutely no depth to his character, he's just kind of there! The film is really quite pointless and a very big waste of time and money, and not just your's for watching it, the studio's for making it.Even the dragon's in the film aren't really that good, after all they are the \\"big stars\\" in this flick, and you barely get to see then except for a few mostly far away shot's and again there's really no explanation as to why they are even there. Please don't waste your money, wait til it comes out on cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Lets face it, this movie stank!Talk about taking a really excellent idea and just destroying it...The basic plot line is that a dormant dragon has awakened and multiplies to, in effect, create (yet another) post appocalyptic world in which man has to fend for himself in a medieval type setting.When I saw the trailers and clips from this film I thought it was going to be excellent, but what I found was a uninteresting story about a bunch of people arguing about tomatoes and a supposedly highly skilled team of dragon slayers that loose half their crew everytime the kill one dragon..My personal opinion is that this movie has wasted what could have been top notch idea and has prevented any decent dragon movies to be made for a whileStay away"},{"rating":"1","title":"God, what were they THINKING?!","review":"Let's just say, if you've seen Waterworld, you've seen Reign of Fire. Almost identical in the apocalyptic aftermath of a catsastrophic event and trying to right the wrong. This movie was slow and uninteresting. And even the dragons, which I thought could have possibly saved this movie, can't. They have so many holes in their wings, how the Hell can they fly? What would have made this movie better would have been if it had taken place in the PROCESS of the destruction. That would have been a much better movie with much more action. Maybe that's just my take on it. Anyway, this movie is terrible and I wouldn't reccommend it to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea... bad execution","review":"I saw the trailers for Regin of Fire and thought: cool - a movie about dragons and fire! that should be fun.Well, yeah, the concept is great, but the execution was terrible. If they weren't going to make the plot even remotely interesting, the least they could have done was make the movie wall to wall action, ya know? Seriously, kicking dragon butt for an hour and a half would be entertaining when you are in the mood for that sort of thing.Special effects were not all that great. Didn't stink, but not good either. A lot of really interesting ideas and concepts, but none of them explored at all. The movie seemed like one big brainstorming session - a lot of good nuggets, but nobody bothered to pick out the good ones and expand them into a good moive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another missed opportunity!","review":"Throw this one in the same category as PLANET OF THE APES, THE SCORPION KING, GODZILLA, DUNGEONs & DRAGONS and on and on. What category is this? Why, it's the 'blown opportunity' category! True, Mr. McConaghey and Mr. Bale try hard to overcome the script that they've been given, but in the end they fail. Another one who must ultimately succumb to the dreary material is Rob Bowman, who handled the X-FILES big screen outing to admirable effect. Overall? You can wait for the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as you would think...","review":"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was out in the theaters and thinking to myself, \\"oh what a bunch of garbage.\\" I can't remember who finally convinced me to see it, but I did and I was pleasantly surprised. The story is a little more believable than you would think and the characters are great. Matthew McConaughey plays a great character. You'll never forget him in this role, I promise you. It's a good flick for a light night's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than Some Reviews Here Would Indicate","review":"This is the type of film I take out of my DVD library to watch whenever I'm bored and don't want to watch a movie that requires too much thinking. I do prefer smart movies over mindless action with no plot, but \\"Reign of Fire\\" is an exception to that rule. The story is pretty cool (writing could be better though) and the acting is above average thanks to Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey (I thought he was wildly entertaining here). The best thing about this film is of course the look of the dragons themselves. The CGI creatures are up there with anything ILM has done of late, with the only downside being that they are not shown on screen as often as one might think. So ignore the plot holes (if dragons feed on tons of ash, why chase and eat a few pesky humans running around?) and just enjoy this one for what it is, brainless fun that will achieve what movies are suppose to do...entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for life-like special effects.

The lyrics are incredible in almost every song but the best songs are You'd Do The Same, Die For The Government, Red White and Brainwashed, F*** Police Brutality and my personal favorite Punk By The Book. Also Drink Drank Punk is a funny one and She's My Little Go-go Dancer is a good song but the lyrics are kind of dumb. Most of the other songs are also good for a listen except for a few like Your Daddy Was A Rich Man Your Daddy's F***ing Dead which to me just get annoying. Overall this is a great PUNK album but I personally prefer albums such as Underground Network and The Terror State"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anti-Flag is awesome...","review":"Anti-Flag is a great band with a great message. Anti-Flag doesnt hate america, and they dont urge violence or support it at all. Anti-Flag is about peace and while many think that they are a violent band and put out an anti-peace message, you obviously dont listen to the lyrics. this CD along with most other anti-flag's work has very thought provoking lyrics and also has a great musical aspect to it. The bass work on many songs is INSAIN! and so is the guitar work..i dont know much about drums, but they sound awesome too! If you got into punk via blink, then you are not into punk at all..im guessing you would be listening to Sum 41 or other bands of that nature..If you are a fan of rancid or other bands similar to them then you would love this CD. try underground network also.

In it, the talk about government denial of secret tests on our soldiers, the de-unification of punks, the effects of alcohol, and several other subjects. There sound is different in almost each song, and even the vocals seem different, though they're done by the same guy. I didn't give the cd a five, however, because some of the songs seem very mundane, something that i don't associate with Anti-Flag. I still concider this there best cd, though i haven't heard \\"They're System Doesn't Work For You\\" yet. When and if you do by this cd, listen the the second song, You Gotta Die FOr Your Government, first, not that there's anything wrong with track one, i just think it's the best song up there. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, bad lyrics","review":"Ok, the music is really good... but the lyrics are so lame.

First off, the music is terrible. It's soft and wimpy and lacks any musical credibility. I'm not just saying this because I hate punk. I don't see how anyone can like this. The singer (or singers) have no excuse to BE singing. Don't believe me? Check out \\"Daddy Was a Rich Man\\". Or pretty much any of their songs. The lyrics are so ridiculous. I appreciate anti-political manifesto very much. The reason they are ridiculous is because they couldn't have made it more obvious that they don't know what they're talking about. All they do is whine. What's the matter, guys? Didn't mommy and daddy give you whatever you wanted? They wouldn't let you take the car out last night? What a joke!

I being the opened minded Indivudual I am listened to this track several times. After the several listenings I concluded that anti-flag were a bunch of fashion punks who read some chomsky and decided to make a album. The song is terrible and insults my intelligence and my belief as a socialist. I can see it now Republicans are going to point there crooked fingers at this albums lyric sheet and laugh at the modern liberal youth.In final words.

Punk bands dont write about sadness and death nor sing in beautifully clear voices. #2 IMO The Misfits werent punk either. They were raw, but they had a melodic side to them & Glenns Vocals are too professional(This isnt an insult) to be punk(along with the lyrics and music he wrote/made too).

Thanks the war gods for Steven Hartov. I've been reading his work from the beginning, and it just keeps getting better and better. His newest book, The Devil's Shepherd, is the best so far, which is saying something, considering the quality of the previous two. With his work, you can share the danger, understand both sides of the conflict, and practically feel the heat of the location, not to mention the battle. For fans of international thriller fiction, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will captivate you unlike any other","review":"From the very first page on, Steve Hartov exposes his reader to the fascinating world of espionage and terrorism unlike any author I have ever encountered. Only somebody who has experienced the Israeli intelligence service himself could have written such a breathtaking book. This might be Hartov's finest work yet, very closely followed by The Heat of Ramadan and The Nylon Hand of God, which are magnificantely written as well. The only problem one might have with this novel is to decide whether an intriguing character such as Eckstein, or the beautifully described locations around the world are the reason one is not able to put the book down. The Devil's Shepard is a true must for anybody who is interested in espionage, or who simply wishes to be completely captivated by a breathtaking story until the very last page of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Dissapointment","review":"I normaly love books of this genre, and had heard a good thing about this book from AMAZON.com.BUT, I did not enjoy this read one bit.

The characters all have thier endearing ticks and habits, which play into the story.We have lent it to neighbors who also purchased it, and gave it to their friends.

The basic storyline centers around a kidnapping, and there are numerous images of death, decay, imprisonment, and wholesale mayhem sprinkled throughout. This is definitely not a kiddie show!

What a mix this is - adoring and uncompromising love by a parent for a child, sentimentality, and abundant social commentary in a very amusing and at times very obscure way, often directed at an obsession with body shapes and eating habits. The imagery is beyond description - my favorite scene is the dog lying at the foot of the stairs and the shadows of the raindrops on the window upstairs make the dog look wet.

If you like things that make sense and are slightly less French, then I would not recommend it. It was just too purposely art-sy for my taste.

These are probably the same people who find the music of Philip Glass \\"boring\\"!

Even a half hour into it, you're still not quite sure what is happening. The pacing, characterization, and minimalist dialogue lay a strong foundation of intrigue - and I was hooked.Enough couldn't be said about the creativity - pushing limits and boundaries are what animation is about. If it were merely painted live action, why bother? The inventiveness, the quirks of the characters (dog vs. train is consistent to the end), the catchy music (Jazzy Bach is hard to hear, but worth it)...it all adds up to a great film.

The statue of liberty wasn't voluptious, she was fat to represent \\"Bellville?\\" The sound effexts were interesting, the story obviouse, the animation was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Teacher LOVES This Movie!!!","review":"My English teacher says this movie is great, and what he says must be true because he uses big words that I don't understand and can't spell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well&#65533;","review":"Lordy, I read all these reviews and wonder what I missed. This clever little thingie just didn't hold my attention, and I stopped watching after about 35 minutes. Sorry, folks, but whatever is so allfire wonderful about this, um, movie-cartoon-animated whatchimacallit just sailed right over my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain odd.","review":"I wanted to like this movie. I'd read good reviews on it. I watched it twice to make sure that I wasn't missing something. I didn't miss anything. It is just plain odd, and I don't mean that in a good way. I was perhaps slightly amused by it, but never laughed, and it drug on and on. If you buy it, don't blame me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Crap-ola!","review":"This is one of the very WORST films I have seen in my entire lifetime!!! None of the characters talk, the animation is a ripoff of Ralph Bakshi's work, and it was very SLOW-MOVING!!!! Don't bother wasting your time and your money renting or buying this God-awful waste-of-film movie! You'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring!","review":"So boring I couldn't finish it! How could a cartoon be so slow...?! One good point - the cartoon has some nice moments like seeing the dog bark in slow motion at the train & passengers going by. But really, I rented it and couldn't bring myself to watch the rest of it. I finally returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no French audio?","review":"Disappointed here. Thought I was buying an English-subtitled, French-audio disc, but the audio is mostly in English. Probably safer to buy a disc entitled \\"Les Triplettes de Belleville.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"I love this film. Animation is beautiful and beats the socks off any type of typical 'cartoon'."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE","review":"THIS MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT. I CAN SEE WHY IT RECEIVED THE AWARDSTHAT IT DID. YOU HAVE TO WATCH 2 - 3 TIMES TO REALLY APPRECIATETHE CONTENT. A MUST FOR YOUR COLLECTION. MY HUSBAND AND I LOVEDIT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Original! Very Imaginative!!!","review":"The movie is generally about a cyclist who is kidnapped by these strange box looking characters from a bicycle race. His grandmother and dog start an adventure looking for him, who meets unusual characters. This movie is not for every one!! The first time I watched the movie I fell asleep. Not because I was bored but there is virtually no dialogue and it is similar to Fantasia, where the movie is mostly visual and musically appealing with 20s-40s era gypsy jazz and other interesting scores. Character development is unbelievably good considering the lack of script. Expressions in the animation says it all. The dog was my favorite character, barking at every train that goes by and having surreal dreams. Not for every one, if you have an open mind and appreciate animation, you must see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slight Correction","review":"One reviewer said, \\"The commentary tracks and 'making of' featurette described on the DVD case and on Amazon are not actually included in the DVD.\\" That is not true. Granted, the commentary track is limited to three scenes, but it is quite informative, and the featurettes are equally good. The trick is in finding these special features; you have to go past the first features page, but they are there if you know where to look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimalist Plot and Characters","review":"Mr. Bernabo's spotlighted review does an excellent job of describing what the film is about and what it looks like. So if you are interested primarily in eclectic, hand-drawn animation that references old movies and cartoons and French pop culture from two generations ago, you'll really dig this one. Unfortunately, for those of us who also want a compelling story, interesting characters, and some kind of point to it all, we are sh*t out of luck on this one. Ultimately I must agree with the one- and two-star reviews here: The cumulative effect of watching Triplets is one of excruciating tedium. And grotesque, offensive stereotypes don't become charming simply because they happen to be showcased in a \\"hip\\" format. In this instance, at least, context doesn't subvert them, or even sanitize them. I'm afraid we will have to keep waiting for a decent alternative to the pervasive Disney-style cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't Americans make interesting animated films?","review":"It's an odd, quirky, and diverting film. The animation is breathtaking, the story is peculiar and engaging, and the music is terrific. At a time when real animation--the hand drawn art that eschews realism in favor of the surreal or ideosyncratic--appears to be a dying art, this film tells us why \\"Finding Nemo\\" and similar slick schlock is hardly worth the celluloid. No, Triplets isn't a masterpiece. It's simply very, very good. There's virtually no dialogue, and none is needed since the story is told in masterful rich illustration.Bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent the movie before you buy it.","review":"Ok, I watched this movie again and again to try to understand it. I guess after watching this movie three times it's ranked as an \\"ok\\" movie. The movie was very racist and the animation was just grotesque and the plot was very, very, hard to follow. The movie just seemed too unrealistic. But, I guess it was just ok nothing special. The only part I really did find entertaining was the song. I guess this is a movie you would only want to rent, not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feh!","review":"This cartoon gets my vote for Most Overrated Film of the Year. The other 1-star reviews have got it right. The movie is EXTREMELY boring and irritating. I forced myself to sit and watch it all the way through, hoping to find out what everyone else was so ecstatic about. That's 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I'd rather have my teeth drilled than sit through this animated torture again. Feh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When it sucks, it blows.","review":"No plot, gawdawful ugly traumitizing character designs, the sound needs work (the crashing cars sound like tinfoil) & it's rather irritating. Sadly, the 1st 5 minutes were the best part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I could not finish this film. The pacing is tediously slow. The best character is the dog and they treat him poorly. The art style is neither visually appealing nor unique enough to be intriguing despite its ugliness. Having a weak plot to tie together vignettes is not original. A few grotesquely stylized characters is not that original either. Watching this was a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Get It.","review":"Note to pretentious snobs: It's entirely possible to \\"get\\" all the references in a movie, to grasp the director's point, and still not like it, still remain unimpressed. Cut the patronizing crap already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaclyn","review":"Not what had expected. Not for children, pretty dark and confusing. I would not recommend this to anyone. Watched with a friend who was appalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torturous!","review":"My God! This movie hurts so bad! While the movie is gorgeous visually, it tries too hard to be different. I do love art movies. It almost had an Eraserhead feel to it, but believe me, if you liked Eraserhead, you might as well watch that for the hundreth time. It's funny when five people say it's the best movie they've seen, then everyone thinks it great. Thank heavens I'm smart enough not to sit through this disaster again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch this rare gem if you can","review":"Triplettes de Belleville is a charming animated adventure not to be missed. In its celebration of parochial French life and simple pleasures, and its disdain for crass Americanization, it pays homage to Jacques Tati, whose films -- in particular Jour de Fete -- are given nods here and there.This is a joint French-Belgian-Canadian-British effort (forgive me if I missed anyone out), and there is a calculated appeal to an international audience -- little dialogue, and some English in there (perhaps specially recorded alongside a French soundtrack, another homage to Tati?).The animation is impressive, full of ingenious touches. It is a delight to see this type of old-fashioned cartoonery again in this post-Toy Story cinematic era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd but embraceable","review":"Its a real odd conceptfor the most part, a \\"silent\\" cartoon but I thought it wasnt bad. I really like cartoons so I dont mind buying it. For most people I doubt they would want to spend money on this...children would not enjoy this one because its probaly not as entertaining as what their used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Hoot","review":"An animated feature. Lots of weird, far out fun. Some brief, relatively harmless, nudity at beginning. For those with a ridiculous sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bomb!","review":"This is the worst movie I have seen since \\"The Black Pirates.\\" That goers back 60 years. It was dull, badly put together and pretentious in the extreme. I should have known the French never produce anything worthwhile. Any people who had a 75 year old love affair with Edith Piaf, \\"The Singing Waif,\\" (lousy voice, stupid songs), could only produce something like this; that makes an \\"in thing\\" out of ugly pictures, disgusting scenes and lousy music. What a bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird to enjoy","review":"Ok, maybe I'm not the most sophisticated movie-goer, but I did not enjoy this movie. I had heard that it was fantastic, and I had high expectations, but I was very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend unless they were the type who say they like strange things just to prove how unique they are.The grandmother and the dog were appealing and interesting characters, but the rest of them were incomprehensible. The music was annoying, as were the garbly French voices. The plot was simple, yet it didn't make any sense - even in a cartoon land - especially the chase scene at the end.If you go to see it, just be prepared for an odd, unusual movie - in all respects. If that's your bag, you just might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated, & that purportedly brilliant musical score is just plain annoying","review":"a big disappointment. perhaps i just wasnt in the mood for as highly stylized a piece of animation that night, but i just couldnt bring myself to give a hoot about the characters or the art work. and i found that highly vaunted musical score to be nothing less than annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe I just don't get French humor","review":"OK, the first ten minutes is some of the finest you'll ever see in animation. Great music, characters, atmosphere...but then something odd happens. The director runs out of things to do. I realize the director cut his teeth on animated \\"shorts\\" and I believe this is his first full length feature. I think he should have stayed with the shorts. The lack of dialogue was intreging and the animation was fine but the lack of story really hurt. It was slow in too many places and I had absolutely no feeling toward the grandson, turned bicyclist. Fat dog barking at trains; who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the triplets of Belleville","review":"This is visually stunning and has a most engaging story.The scenes express life-like situations sprinkled with humor.The music track enhances the story and brings vitality to the animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I believe that this DVD won the Academy Award for Best Cartoon or Best Short in 2006. It is superbly done. I first saw it in the movie theatre and could hardly believe how this incredible work was done. It was at turns hysterical, and at others quite dark. The creators must be genius to make the characters so detailed. I have watched it at least 10 times and continue to show it to friends everywhere. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Film","review":"I was lucky enough to see this film in theaters at a local indie movie house that, sadly, is no longer open. However, this film hung around in the back of my mind for years before I finally gave in and bought it.I personally love this movie to death but some might tire of it after a while as it has very little dialogue. I'm an animation freak so it's right up my alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Movie, Bad DVD","review":"I got this item from Amazon, their info says the aspect ratio is 1.78:1 (widescreen) and the DVD case says so as well but when I pop in the DVD it informs me that the film has been formatted to fit my (a 4:3) screen. Which means the sides are cut off, you're missing part of the film. I don't know if this was a fluke or if they packaged it that way (DVD companies have done stupid things in the past) but I passed the refund date on my purchase before I watched so make sure to put in the disk and check the aspect ratio if that matters to you before watching it. That said, it's a fantastic film, gets a lot of story across with only 2 lines of dialogue, and just amazing visuals and sound design. Again, wonderful film, bad DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must see for any animator!","review":"This film is brilliant!It's a modern classic, the style is unique and a welcome break from todays cookie cutter retro-retro look. Granted it's from '03. But it's still new to so many people.If you're unsure about whether or not you should pick this flick up,rent it. In French please. Once you've seen it once, you'll be convinced of your need to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Non-Disney","review":"If you are tired of the Disney animations that all look the same, be sure to see the \\"Triplets of Belleville.\\" It's an example of a movie that has created a new kind of animation that soars above any other I've ever seen. The animation is detailed from the mother's two uneven feet to the dog barking at the train out the window. It's full of laughs but also shows the dark part of life through symbols and irony. I highly reccommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive review","review":"Please do not listen to the \\"American\\" that reviewed the movie. His comments were embarrassing. The movie was excellent. It sounds as though he has a case of \\"Americanitus\\"...always thinking they are better than anyone else. I've been around many Europeans and find them to be the most creative people! This movie is a testament to that!!!!Please see the movie. The soundtrack is GREAT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart pop.","review":"MCS has released a fairly solid- if inconsistant - first album. The record kicks off with the lukewarm 'Cambridge', before melting into the excelent new-wave 'Shiver', but the movie is far from over. We are treated to several other gems before the disc is done spinning, and when 'a-ok' crackles off into silence, you'll be left wishing it hadn't. The dirty secret behind MCS's appeal is something that we've been listening to for years- pop. MCS takes classic new wave (The Future Freaks Me Out), throws in a dash of Indie (Modern Chemistry), And smooths it out with moog keyboards and crunching post-hardcore guitars (Don't Call It A Comeback). The only marks against this album are it's flat tracks (Capital H, namingly) and it's occasional lack of consistancy. All in all, however, it's a very determined effort an a certified success as a first album. The future make freak them out, but it should be one smooth ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not like this music much","review":"was recommended to me by roommate but i did not enjoy this. sounds too emo i think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motion City Sountrack - I am the Movie.......does it!","review":"Motion City Soundtrack, a band containing the most rockin keyboardist ever, a balding guitarist *he's only 26*, amazing vocals, hot bassist and rad drummer, blows up with there debut album \\"I am the Movie\\", signed to Epitaph Records.

I liked the Rejects alright, but i had no desire to see them in concert. The opening act, I had never heard of, and they just so happened to be Motion City Soundtrack. I fell in love almost immediately. Finally a band with a keyboard player, i found myself thinking. Anyhow, Motion City's debut album is nothing short of excellent, with great sing-alongs, awesome production, and an all-around fun vibe, they accomplished the rare feat of duplicating their live show. Everything is there, the hooks (\\"The Future Freaks Me Out\\", \\"Capital H\\"), the big riffs and driving synth sounds (\\"Don't Call It A Comeback\\", \\"My Favorite Accident\\"), even the sentimental moments (\\"Mary Without Sound\\"). It's accessible, but not sell-out, it's easy to listen to, but not unintelligent. Like I said, just an awesome, awesome record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've bought in a while..","review":"Epitaph sure knows how to pick them. I read about them on their website and rushed out to get the CD the day it came out. I couldn't have been more excited when I popped it into my car.

I first came across their music when I heard My favorite accident on the Burnout 3 soundtrack (an excellent game btw!), and it immediately caught my interest. When I heard the whole album I fell in love. The combination of catchy melodies, great involving lyrics but still a bit rough is was appeals to me. I am very glad that this band exists. Their music sets me in a good mood and makes me see the good things in life and see things from a distance. One of the best 10 albums ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"This is one of the better debut albums i have heard in a long time. The vocals are catchy yet still intense at times. Most of the songs are pop based but keep a rock edge, some great sing-a-longs.

It's everything that I've wanted from every almost amazing CD I've heard. This CD, its a whole new sound. It's completely different, and yet even more totally scrumptulesent. Its hooks are dynamic, its voice is determined. It is, in every true sense of the word, complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack for rockin' out","review":"So I too went to a concert, the AAR if you must know, and MCS was playing. Although at first we didn't know they were a band, they took the stage and rocked hard core. Then, saw them at Warped Tour, they rocked even harder. Bought the album, and guess what? It too, rocks. Each song is different so when you listen to it, it's not the same regurgitated [stuff] other bands put out. 'The Future Freaks Me Out' should be hitting the charts, as I honestly believe it to be the best song on the album. This cd is for anyone looking for new music just to rock out or sing in the car, so get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On!","review":"First I would say that this album is killer! I would say if you like bands like Matchbook Romance, Home Grown, and Yellowcard, then this is for you.

Buy It NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"This album is great, i first heard the band when they supported sugarcult in the UK on the 27th of this month. THEY RULED. the vocals sounded rather decent and similar to 'my chemical romance' and they are very bouncy so all round good here, i recommend this is you are into the whole pop-punk scene, they are very good and not to be missed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect hardcore","review":"The first 7 or so songs on this cd are among the best American Punk I have ever heard. The music is extremely raw like punk should always be, yet somehow Social Unrest can combine the catchiest twists in their songs that only adds to the intensity. I like the second vocalist on the second half of the cd less, but its still really good. This album is a must-buy for the first seven songs. Social Unrest definetly needs to be appreciated by more people who are into punk...the first 7 songs are at least as good or better than early Black Flag and Circle Jerks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work on my 2002 GMC Sierra as they say","review":"Actually ordered 2 kits, 6313, and 6314.

Joan Jett's acting consists of reading her lines with a face fixed in a snarling sneer. or is it a sneering snarl? No matter. Michael Fox will try to fix it all with his unwavering look of quiet concern and a few bobs of the head.There is, I'm sure, a good movie waiting to be made about bar bands in gritty rock and roll clubs. Unlike Light of Day, it will have characters we can care about, acting that we can believe in and some development that makes a difference in the characters' lives.A man ten rows behind me in the theatre where I saw Light of Day fell asleep and snored through the last half of the movie. No one bothered to wake him. Just jealous, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased","review":"This item was advertised at very good which is the reason I ordered this particular one.

I was sitting in the theater next to my first really embarrassing crush in all his mulleted, feathered haired, acne ridden, Member's Only jacket wearing glory, and I was frozen solid. The movie, however, was poor, but I remembered it for that experience.The story took place in Cleveland, Joan Jett and Michael J Fox were a brother and sister rock n' roll duo who were about as threatening as the 7 Dwarves. They were rebels without clues, and the movie's plot (as it were) was hinging on who the father of Joan Jett's son was. It was lousy at best, reuniting the family when mom is dying. But I gave it one star because there is a glimpse of a young Trent Reznor soon to emerge to his Nine Inch Nails fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most terrible movies I've ever seen","review":"I originally saw this in a double-feature with \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" and would have left the theatre had I not wanted to see the other film.

I had been looking for this movie everywhere and was excited to find it here on Amazon. It's a great movie for anyone and definitely a must-see for all Joan Jett fans out there! She does a wonderful job as her character, Patti and you could tell she really enjoyed acting the part. I loved hearing the soundtrack, all the Barbusters songs are great, I'll have to purchase the CD later. Also, I'm not sure why everyone was saying that Michael J.

I have tried to read it 2 or 3 times, and I can never follow the plot close enough to understand what's going on. The beginning sections show great promise (as story line goes), but as I read on, it became less and less interesting. Asimov himself tells his readers in the preface that this book is an oddity for him, in terms of style.If you've read Asimov before and really enjoy his writing technique, I would caution you about this book. Some may be able to enjoy it. However, I doubt anyone who has a taste for his other books could really enjoy reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nemesis is Brilliant","review":"Nemesis is often looked down upon in the world of science-fiction, and fans, as you can tell by the other reviews posted here, find it to be rather weak. And so it was only with reluctance that I picked up a copy of Nemesis, and again it was only with reluctance that I began to read. I had come expecting trash and the worst of Asimov but what I got was a surprise, a rather pleasant one actually. Despite what you may hear, Nemesis is great. It features many artistically crafted characters and a fine blend of science and adventure. If you've heard that Nemesis was no good, just take my advice, don't believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, the worst Asimov","review":"FWIW, I love Asimov particularly the Foundation and Robot series, but really anything I've read of his including non-fiction--until now. This is a particularly plodding tale with wooden characters, little action, and repetitive exposition.I finished it just for closure and the ending was particularly disappointing.If you want to read good Asimov, start with the Foundation series and you'll be hooked, but for goodness sake do not judge his work by this mess. I fully understand that tastes differ, but I have to really wonder about those reviewers who have given this a 5 star rating. That is just wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits With The Rest","review":"This is my favorite Asimov book that doesn't belong to the Foundation or three Crime Mysteries. I feel that this was well written and develops character well unlike most of Isaac's books. He's known more for plot than character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This was, in fact, the first Science Fiction work of Mr. Asimov I read. It is a very interesting book, and although it moves a little slowly, I was more interested in this book than many others I've read. I thought the whole plot came together well in the end although it was perhaps a little unfinished. A wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Asimov, but this one's a bore","review":"If you're looking for a good science fiction book, Isaac Asimov has a LOT of great ones. Unfortunately this is isn't one of them. Nobody can be expected to get it right every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring novel","review":"I really love Asimov, but i didn't like this story at all. There are many superfluous dialogs and situations, The impact between the two stars, became at the end of the novel, absolutely marginal. Perhaps it dipends on the fact that this book can't be connected to the others, arrangig Asimov's future history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This book is a gigantic waste of time. The plot is nothing particularly new, with relatively few themes. The themes it does have it repeats again, and again, and again, beating you over the head with it. You constantly find yourself wondering \\"Haven't I read this before\\", only to realize that the same idea had been 2 chapters earlier.The characters are all wooden, and completely one dimensional. Their obsessions remain their obsessions throughout, regardless of how the plot moves forward.There is much better Asimov out there. This has to be amongst his worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triple \\"D\\".","review":"The title says it all. This book was \\"Dull\\", \\"Dull\\", and \\"Dull\\". I loved the Foundation series, as millions of readers do. However, this book was painful to get through. I read the excerpts in the front of the book, heaping praise on what a great book this was. I wonder if the praise was for the author himself, or the book? Reviewers should review a book by first tearing off the front cover, so as not be influenced by the author. This book had no, notta, zero action in it. The story just plodded along to a painfully slow conclusion. Great sci-fi...I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Nightmare","review":"If you expeceted Asimov books like Robot, Empire and Foundation series, never mind about this book. This book don't worth the money and time. I am very sorry to say this, but this is the worst Asimov book i have ever read(I read all the Robot,Empire and Foundation series and i found them very well written) and more over, this is one of the worst sci-fi book i've ever read. This book doesn' have the logic that other Asimov books have shown, and the story is too plain, boring and very,very strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"This was the first Asimov book I've read and will most likely be the last. I was very dissapointed to say the least, especially with all the hype and notoriety behind Asimov's name. The first 3/4 of the book is basically just boring with no action or excitement. There's a few sparks in the last quarter of the book but they never turn into anything exciting. If your looking for a mildly interesting story about colonization, space exploration, and ethics then maybe this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I personally believe it's way better than Gods Themselves and a must-read!I MEAN IT WAS LIKE OUAOU!!! Dont get discouraged at the beggining it might seem alittle boring but it gets better page after page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asimov Has Done Better","review":"Nemesis is far from Aismov's best work. In fact, it is one of the weakest, which is surprising since it was written late in his career when he was well-established as a mature, accomplished author. The \\"secret\\" of the key plot element--the strange bond between the planet Erythro and a 15-year-old character--is so obvious every reader will certainly have figured it out almost as soon as it is introduced. Perhaps the weakest element of the book is the characters. Not one is truly likable. In fact, it's hard to care what happens to any of them, except, possibly, for the arrogant, manipulative chairman of the runaway Rotor colony. For him we hope for a slow, painful death, or at least that one of the other characters will deliver a much-deserved punch in the nose by the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a Good collection","review":"glad to see Rick as a Artist,writer,Producer,&the Other Proteges he had brought to the Forefront here. the stone City Band had some cool jams.\\"little Runaway\\" is cool.Val Young \\"seduction(Make note of where Mary J.Bliege got her whole Game from) is still banging.Process&the doo Rags whose Debut Album came out on Sony Music because Motown didn't Green Light Rick's \\"Mary Jane Records\\" label back in 85 when it was due.Teena Marie&the Mary Jane Girls are Represented here as well.this is a Cool Tribute to the Musical Genius of Rick James.a Very Versatile Soul Brother RIP."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST IMAGINE","review":"CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING A PERCUSSION RHYTHM SECTION POWERED BY TITO PUENTE, MONGO SANTAMARIA AND CANDIDO CAMERA?

These storys although in some cases dull enlighten the average american on the hopes and plights of other working class americans. It is a book that has real relivance in todays society. We tend to get caught up in the glamorous and not so glamorous lives of media stars and forget that the country is really kept running by the american worker. This book shows in more ways then one, that the guy who runs the ice cream stand down the street is just as relivant and important in todays society as the bank teller that puts your pay check in your account every month. This is an important book to read if you feel you are starting to loose touch with america and americans today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kersten Memoirs 1040-1945","review":"This one of the most remarkable factual documents to emerge from World War II. It is not only accurate history, but it is eminently fascinating--a truly exciting story of a man leading a double life in Nazi Germany. So far as I know, this is the only story of its kind to present an intimate portrait of Himmler--who formed an odd affection for his \\"doctor,\\" who reluctantly treated him, but was able to rescue hundreds of imprisoned Jews who were released by Himmler under the persuasive powers of Kersten. Reads like a classic mystery story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"This little volume would make a handy travel dictionary, but only if you want to read the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in the original. The title is misleading since this is not a dictionary of modern Hebrew, but of classical, biblical Hebrew. There is a world of difference between the two. The listing on-line is quite misleading. The actual volume on the other hand is clearly labeled as biblical Hebrew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"The title of this item is: \\"Langenscheidt Pocket Hebrew Dictionary: Modern Hebrew-English (Langenscheidt Pocket Dictionary)\\"It is not at all modern. In fact, it appears to be based on Masoretic/ancient/biblical Hebrew. It does state on the back of the cover that is is for biblical studies, but as a student of modern Hebrew it is almost useless.It may of course be a great dictionary for Biblical studies, but I wouldn't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treason!","review":"Gryphon's pseudo-medieval exercises are of the same nature as the experiments with classical music of such groups as ELP, Deep Purple, Egg and, to a lesser degree, Yes. It was fashionable to borrow from the past, and if there were Roman or ancient Egyptian scores, someone would have put them to work too. Not to confuse with another genre influence - classical (and medieval in case of Gentle Giant) influences of Yes, Banco and other prog bands reflect their commendable learning efforts. Writing like Mozart or Henry VIII would be vanity and futility; why would anyone need an imitation if a genuine thing exists? Troubadours and minstrels in the 20th century -- it's a certain fake. Actually Treason has the least of it but is weak nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product...Hard to keep clean","review":"This is my very first review on Amazon, So here goes..

For better or worse, textbooks are judged by content and this one is lacking. The book itself is really a collection of articles on ER related topics from a variety of authors.

I manage the symptoms by eating healthy, exercising and living a healthy lifestyle. Sometimes that's not always enough to help. I'm not a big fan of medication either. I was watching Dr. Oz and saw this as an idea for stress releif. Honestly I didn't have any expectations because I'm a skeptic. The first few times I took one of the capsules I had forgot i had taken them but felt noticeably more relaxed. It was a major shift but noteworthy.

After the title sequence, this movie has no respect for the old television show and never approaches its waggish sense of humor.

It would be OK to make it tame enough for kids to enjoy too. Instead, we get a weird reinvention of the old classic cartoon. First off having Jason Lee voice Under Dog was not the best decision as he is so well know from his ' My Name Is Earl' series that I couldn't get the show out of my mind and I expected Crab-Man to pop in at any minute and say \\"Hey Earl\\"!.The FX are done well, but it's a pretty bland movie. It's also a very short film well under an hour an a half.....this is probably a good thing, but I would have felt cheated if I paid $10.00 to see an hour an 10 minute movie(if you don't count the credits)! If you have kids I'm sure they will like it, but if you're an adult looking for some sort of nostalgia....forget it. ;-b"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Beagle","review":"If you saw the original three season of 1960s cartoon show you might enjoy Underdog the Movie.

In it, after Adam was created, he went around looking at everything and was bored in a very short time. So God said He would look around and try to find Adam something FUN to do. And then He told Adam that He thought that naming the animals would be something fun. Excuse me, but the story of Adam in the garden and the story of him naming the animals was BEFORE sin entered the world. There would have been no boredom before sin. This book is a \\"dumbing down\\" of God's word and makes a mockery out of it. Almost makes it seem as though people can order God around and so forth.

With three kids under 5, we always have a mess in our main living/kitchen area. At night after they are in bed, we pick everything up off the floor and put the chairs up, and let the little guy go to town. For us, it is quiet enough to watch TV in the same room, and we don't worry about waking up the kids (although ours are pretty sound sleepers). We often will finish cleaning up and let him do the same at the same time. It is great to always have a freshly vacuumed home. It has worked so well, that when our friend brought over her Dyson to see what we might be missing, she was surprised to not find much at all.The Roomba does require some periodic fine tuning and it will need to be emptied every time, but totally worth it as far as we are concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roomba 4210","review":"I had purchased two of the IRobot Roomba 4210s over a month ago.One was a present and the other was mine.

The only problem I encountered was on of the units was a present and I ordered it via 3 day faster shipping. I had paid an extra $10.00 shipping to make sure I had it here in time for a birthday. The other unit I ordered it the same day with free shipping. They both showed up on the same day. Should have stayed with free shipping.

It kept getting stuck in the same corner over and over again - and it left black tire marks on the white carpet. I wish I had a video!It should work OK if you remove all your area rugs and move the furniture to accomodate its artificial unintelligence. BTW, make sure the room is clean beforehand.

There are so many more little \\"what if's\\" that could have changed the outcome of that game, long before Torre's decision to play the infield in for Luis Gonzalez's last at bat. You'll also understand why the \\"winning the World Series is the only goal\\" attitude worked so well for the 1998-2001 teams, as opposed to the post-2001 Yankee rosters of All-Stars.You might want to wait until closer to the release of the 2001 World Series boxset however... you will DEFINITELY want to see Game 7 again after reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remainder Mark","review":"Book has a remainder mark.

The loveliest rock album of the past five years at least.

The songs are fairly indistinguishable, with the exception of the Lee Ranaldo vocal. Thurston Moore should realize that his singing is tuneless and monotonous.

Unfortunately, the album comes across as a series of lifeless cliches of their own style, like some sort of phoned-in caricature. And it's not very melodic; in fact it's really quite flat. Could it be that they've exhausted the genre which they created? I hope not, but at least they left about a dozen great records in their wake!Maybe they're just getting old, I mean Kim is turning 50 this year! I don't blame them.

First, I am a Presbyterian. There are no virgin Mary statues in my church. However, my religion instructs me to have faith. This book has is the encouraging story of a person who started out with little faith , but developed a great deal through trial and error. Second, it is a rather universal story of a person who makes mistakes, learns from them and becomes better and more at peace. Instead of just meditating on her mistakes, she learns to understand herself better as she grows in her faith. Third, the author is so easy to read and enjoyably weaves her life experiences into her search for Mary. Fourth, it was educational to learn about the role of Mary in Catholicism. This was a good book with an empathetic narrator.This book reminded me a little of Anne Lamott, who also writes about spirituality.

I found this book accidently and Beverly would suggest that maybe I was led to it. I wouldn't argue with her.Between the de-emphasis on Mary in the current US Catholic Church and the criticism of my Prostestant friends, I had lost a commitment to Mary. The rosary was passe and praying to her constituted icon worship. Though I am still grappling with the likelihood of the Assumption, Beverly's experiences have opened my heart to the love and support that Mary can provide.

Another reviewer was being generous when he likened it to a bad dub of a VHS tape. It's more like someone copied it from a TV movie with a VHS video camera, then burned it to a disk using a very old PC. Don't waste your money!

Reading all the reviews was kind of split as to quality with a slight edge to bad rather than good. So I decided to take a chance. Without question the movie itself is a classic and one that can be watched over and over. But....this DVD copy is so bad it is unbelievable. The color is washed out with a red tint and very blurry as if it was recorded with a camera that was out of focus, at least that's the case of the copy I got. However, all is not lost. I discovered the VCR version that I have is not copy protected. So if you have one of those duel DVD/VCR player recorders, then I suggest you buy the VCR copy and record you own private movie. Quality will be the same as the VCR but it is still a good copy that you can enjoy. Don't waste your money on the DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"good overall, you can buy region free from Australia","review":"Other reviews have gone into more detail so I won't repeat them.

The DVD itself is a good, clean copy with no unwanted digitizing artifacts. As is common with releases of older films, there are no extras on the DVD.The film itself was a joy for me to watch. I knew the outlines of the story, in which a secret, innovative weapon was developed to attack the Ruhr dams during World War II. What made it special was that this is one of a SMALL handful of films in which the engineering process is dramatized well. Not only is the engineer the lead of the story, but he does not work miracles; the weapon progresses from idea, through concept, subscale models, and full scale use, with problems and setbacks at each stage.The acting style is a little dated now, and one distracting (but historically true) element is that one character's black dog is named \\"nigger\\", which I found distracting. Still, this is a movie I will enjoy watching many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A landmark War-movie!","review":"Michael Anderson made to my view, his finest work; a true masterpiece about the epic of a scientist who dared, faced and fought against the time, around a fabulous device. Michael Redgrave - one of the most respected British actors ever born - really stole the show, giving us an exciting, tense and absorbing drama of epic feature.In case you have not watched it, do it because we are talking about one of the most reminded, celebrated and renowned movies in this genre.

The story is very interesting, historically important, and well acted. I saw it not very long after its original release and enjoyed it then, and still do.Given the very high regard the British have for Wing Commander Gibson, who was awarded Britain's highest military honor (Victoria Cross) for this raid and died in action just over a year later, I'm sure that - in 1954 - they were being very careful about accuracy, and left in historically accurate details which some will find offensive.By \\"modern\\" (pre computer graphic animation) standards, the special effects are a bit primitive, but quite well done for 1954. Unlike the Congress Entertainment DVD, the audio and video quality are excellent, and the presentation is quite professional.

With a script entirely devoid of situational tension or even tittilation, the viewer is left wondering why this film was made. When I first saw this movie, in a theater in the year of its release, I would've walked out had I been the one to drive. (I later had the misfortune of producing a cut-down trailer for TV.) I hadn't walked out on a movie since \\"Juggernaut\\" in 1974 or 1975. The only recommendable thing about this movie is the fact that you'll be watching it on video and will have something (the tape itself) upon which to vent your rage. You will be in a rage when you've wasted time on what could possible be the most boring movie of all time. Don't believe me?

After murdering another thief, he decides to prepare the big punch but the things will be out of context; you know even the most intelligent and clever of the gangster cannot be faster than the speed of life.What I love in the most of Noir films of this French Master is the inexorable cycle of guilty without redemption, visible clues of the modern tragedy that seem to breathe with astonishing intensity and superb realism.Despite the fact the picture is inspired and even nourished for many Noir films of the forties, retains its individual profile and maintains with enviable freshness the vigency through the years.Absolutely recommended, without reserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Wow! my two girls ages 6 & 4 love this movie.

There is not much narrating so the movie truly captures everything from thoughts to feelings in a realistic way with just few words and the music.

First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie. Second the simple story, and the drama of Spirit gets your attention. One thing I like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now do they?

The Brilliant Score of Hans Zimmer, the Exceptional Songs of Bryan Adams and the Superb Narration from Matt Damon is very Dazzaling. I can't say nothing bad about this movie because there really isn't anything to say.For a 15 year old guy, like me, I was very Satisfied to see that Dreamworks also thought of the Adults, with the story being strong, as it is, but also giving us the normal humor that we expect from a kids film.From the Opening Scene to the Final Jump, Spirit is a film that Everyone should go out and see, because it will bring people closer together.

Several sections were offensive, such as the scene where Spirit is the hero for killing people and setting the forest on fire when he sabatoges a railroad camp.

I couldn't disagree more with the first point, and will only partially concede the second. The primary character is in dire agony 99% of the time. I don't watch animated children's movies to become depressed or angry. For my taste, these films should be light and fun, with just enough dread and hardship to stir empathy for the characters. This film goes way overboard with the pain and suffering element. I felt the same about \\"Lion King\\". If you liked L.K., this might be your cup of tea. The color and images are gorgeous, and the realism of expressing the horses' interactions in gestures and natural sounds rather than dialog is appealing.

However, this is the first time I have ever fallen asleep in a movie (and believe me, I've seen Jimmy Neutron). The only time I woke up was when my sister got bored and crawled in my lap to rest.

When I watched it for the first time I couldn't get through to the end. The DVD constantly stopped and froze, because it was in very POOR condition although the person who sold it to me claimed that it was in Very Good condition. They were obviously being dishonest. I suppose there is no way for me to get my money back, because how is Amazon supposed to know that I didn't just scratch the DVD myself so I could get my money back. I don't even want my money back, I just want a Good copy of the movie! It's one of my favorites. Oh, I am so disappointed. I suppose I should never trust the sellers on Amazon anymore, since there was apparently no accountability whatsoever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Empty Schmaltz!!!","review":"I hated this movie! I went to see it expecting it to be a nice story. So, a horse gets kidnapped and gets back home-BIG WHOOP! It wouldn't happen. The plot was bland and too politically correct for my taste. Horses aren't that smart, either. They wouldn't know that railroads would be built in their territory. And what is Spirit? A super horse? Horses are strong, but they're not James Bond. Besides, these horses had eyebrows and they whinnied too much. The \\"wild and free\\" thing is sentimental and insipid junk! WORST MOVIE EVER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Reason This Is A One Star Review Is Because There IS NO Zero","review":"Okay, let's bite the bullet and start off with the basic truth--this is, quite possibly, THE worst animated movie. Ever.I haven't seen one worse!The reasons? Well, several:1)STORY-ridiculous lies. I don't even want to discuss it.2)ANIMATION-horrible. In trying to make the characters both horses and people, they succeed in doing neither.3)MUSIC-you know, it's insulting to call what they put into this movie \\"MUSIC\\".That pretty much sums it up. For those of you who want it clearer:Disney pwn-zors this junk!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Movie","review":"I think Spirit is a very good movie! It had a good plot, I thought, and had memorable charecters. I cried the first time I saw this movie, it was so sad. I will say that I was surprised to find that unlike most animated movies about animals, the animals didn't talk. Spirit narrarated, but that was all.Here is basically what the movie is about:Spirit is a headstrong mustang leading a herd of wild horses. All is well until he is captured by men and taken to a fort. The men make an attempt to train him, but Spirit refuses to be tamed. He finally gets a chance to escape, but with the men following close behind, exactly how long will Spirit's freedom last?I would recommend this movie to anyone, although it might disturb little kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it","review":"I can not count the number of times my daughter has watched this movie since we bought it...the disc was in perfect condition and has outlasted my sisters store bought version.

The trailers for this film made it look stunning. And the western landscapes are the one positive thing about the movie. But I was flabergasted as the scenes shifted from Yosemite to Yellowstone to Monument Arch as if these were all in the same neighbhorhood. I found it annoying.Byran Adams has written some good songs . . . elsewhere. The tunes in this film are insipid and all sound alike.The concept of having the animals not speak was an interesting one. Except that then Spirit speaks to the camera in voice over. What were they thinking?!!!! And as some one with a little experience with horses, the horse sounds were ludicrous.The minimalist plot will bore children and adults alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"bombed...for a REASON","review":"Lets see here,there were good things and bad things about the movie.The Good:As soon as I saw the \\"kind-native american and evil-white-man\\" s*** I turned it off.The Bad:Well,the stupid reverse racism,the laughable new-age,the excuse for \\"political correctness\\" that the media has adopted.Who needs any of this?Buy neither this,nor Brother Bear,if you voted for Bush in either 2000 or 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"horse manure...","review":"Whiny stupid tree huggers may be happy,or any jerk who wants to make europeans feel bad,Well this movie just ticks them off.Reverse-racism????What's up with that???And \\"animal rights\\"?What moron really believes that animals are good as native americans,or BETTER than white men??I don't buy it.Brother bear is even worse.Political correctness makes good movies utter CRAP.And don't even get me started on the new age mumbo-jumbo.I hope a lot of liberals view my review and begin whining about how politically incorrect this review.But we all know nobody really believes any of this(except for a few of those Los Angeles wackos...who I guess directed the movie anyway).Buy something less politically correct,even if you are a liberal."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk like the french's...oh,wait,they don't have any...","review":"I got this movie on DVD and now realize that it should have been spent on 'Bush Won!Hahaha!Liberals!'.This is such a traditionally liberal Hollywood new-age PC reverse-racist pile of pink dreck.What a stupid way to spend your time croboys when you could be thinking about the end of John Kerry forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"We rented this DVD a couple of months ago expecting a great movie (as we have enjoyed many other Dreamworks films.) However, this was really disappointing, and a disgusting, depressing, and even sappy flim.First, there's the thing with no talking except for the narration. You have to be a real horse lover to enjoy that. I myself don't speak \\"horse.\\"And then there's the old \\"poor little animals, big bad humans\\" idea, which is just sickening. Don't get me wrong, I like animals. But this kind of tear-jerker animal rights kind of film is nauseating.Even worse, there's the \\"Kind Smart Native Americans\\" and the \\"Bad Stupid White Men.\\" I mean, all throughout the movie, when the Indian boy got hurt, it was obviously meant to be a matter of concern. But when on the white men got hurt it was supposed to be funny.Overall, a terrible film, and definately not suitable for little children. It's basically just about a stallion who is a hero because he kills people and causes forest fires."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still watching this!","review":"I'm a 16 year old guy and I still watch this! This is by far the best animated movie ever! Bryan Adams did amazing with the soundtrack, and Matt Damin did good as the voice over as Spirit. The storyline is simple enough for a young kid, but has enough heart for an older person. Great for that Horse Lover in you! It made me laugh, get angry, and cry. If you get this, it will not disapoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for all ages and great music!","review":"I first watched this movie with a friend's young son, Shawn, because it was his favorite movie.

Highly recommend for anyone from young children to oldsters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"My 3 year old daughter loves this movie and often asks to see the \\"horse\\" movie again. It is very well done and presented the mustang point of view. The movement of the horses as well as the interactions amoung the animals and the people are believable. The story is interesting from the beginning right to the end for all ages, and for younger ones, it does not have any scary 'witches' that exist in many of the disney movies. My daughter is very concerned for the horses during the movie, but I am not worried that she will have nightmares afterwards. We definitely got our money's worth with this purchase due to its enjoyment level and number of times it has been watched already. I am sure it won't be the last time she asks to watch the horses."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Animated Films Ever!!!!","review":"I watched this movie over and over again!

He loves animals and I picked this film based upon its G-rating. G-rated films, by definition , are to have minimal violence. While the film was beautifully produced, the violence was extreme. The stallion was brutalized at every turn. The attack on the Indian village was reminiscent of a Sam Peckinpah film. We had to leave before the end of the film and we were not the only filmgoers to leave early during the showing we attended.My problem is not with the film but with the rating. If this were not an animated film it easily would have been rated a PG. Should this make any difference? Shame on those whose job it is to rate these films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Sue? *OR* A Godawful Waste of Time","review":"If I could, I would sue the heck out of the studio for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. Could this poor horse possibly HAVE any more bad luck? We've got a wrenching \\"Spirit taken from his Mommy\\" scene. We've got the Evil White Men torturing the horse by denying it water in summer heat. We've got the horse crying and missing his family. We've got the Nice Indians being tormented. We've got the moment when you think Spirit's girlfriend-horse is killed. In addition to the excessive drama, we have fun for the adults, too! We've got Bryan Adams singing every three and a half seconds, which could make any adult cry. We've got awful PC revisionist history, which could make any adult feel ill. I would rather be poked in the eye with a hot sharp stick than watch this movie again. I need to sue the studio for the hour and a half of my life that I can never get back. Buy the Lion King instead. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"The liberal PC guy Matt Damon fits this movie perfectly...

Now as an adult I still enjoy watching it on days that I just want to watch something that has no violence in it like most movies in this day and age. The story is told from the horses point of view and the music that accompanies the story is quite enjoyable. Loved everything about this movie and would recommend it to anybody who wants to enjoy a good family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute movie","review":"Bought this movie as a gift for my niece. She likes horses so she enjoyed it. Nice gift for a little one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One's Got Spirit","review":"When I saw a preview for this movie, it bugged me that the horses had eyebrows. I've been a horse lover my entire life, and that just bothered me! When I sat down in that cushy theatre seat, I was expecting to see horses dance, sing and talk like most animated movies. Boy was I wrong. The music is beautifully done, so subtle and moving that sometimes you forget there is music. The way the story is told, from the view point of Spirit WITHOUT him talking, is done so artistically and sensitively! It has great morals and lessons that we all can learn from. Not to give up in the face of doubt, not to let society change us from who we are. It's a beautifully mastered film and will be cherished for years to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't take the Bryan Adams soundtrack!","review":"Really, past about the hour mark, it became apparent that this was not a traditionally scripted animation film as much as it was a series of animated music videos, featuring Bryan Adams. Granted, one is to expect musicalisms in an animated feature aimed at children, but Adams' style and voice are not to my liking, and since my daughter eventually got bored and left the room, I popped the DVD out of our player and put it back in its case before it had the chance to finish.I was also annoyed by the \\"White people = bad, Native Americans = good!\\" meme. Thanks a lot for that. As if my daughter won't eventually get an earful of that sort of thing from her so-called Social Studies teachers when she hits school. We wanted something fun and entertaining to watch, not a postmodernized history sermon.Having said all this, the blended computer and traditional animation was professional and impressive.If only the soundtrack and story could have been likewise."},{"rating":"1","title":"White man bad, everything else good...","review":"Despite the great animation, I was disappointed that I took my three-year-old to see Spirit. I thought even the \\"white man bad\\" theme of political correctness had run its course in modern media, but I was wrong. I am still explaining to my son that I (a white man) am not bad and have never hurt horses.The movie was a little bland, with none of the originality and charm of Shrek. Perhaps Dreamworks had to offer Spirit to the Hollywood politically correct crowd as some sort of token of kinship. If you miss this movie, don't loose sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Pleased","review":"I bought two sets of these so that I would have a backup set to put into my Canon S3 IS when the first set ran dry.

The acting, cinematography, and capture of the novels' essence were simply exquisite. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, on the other hand, left out too much of the latter to be enjoyable. Erika Berger's leaving for and harassment at SMP, the investigation by the Constitutional Protection Unit, and Mikael Blomkvist's affair with Monica Figuerola, were too much part of the story to be deleted. Perhaps a two-part movie was necessary. I hope the American film of this novel, if there is one, addresses this shortcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down, best way to see this movie","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen -- if you are lucky enough to read this, you now have no excuse to go back and watch the shortened, dubbed version.

Lisbeth finally receives justice but that's not all. For no apparent reason, she's no longer the extraordinarily unlucky person who manages nothing more than survival. This time, nearly everything goes her way, which is great but a little hard to believe. The other thing that never quite translated for me is why Mikael the reporter never seems scared. By now, he knows what he has gotten himself into and still he plods along as if he and his staff are untouchable. Then again, I suppose there wouldn't be much of a story otherwise. This all leads up to a thoroughly enjoyable, but less than explosive conclusion. Without giving too much away, Lizbeth does have a final showdown with Big Whitey but after 3 installments I expected no less than a re-staging of James Bond's fight with Oddjob, not just some fancy footwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"the dubing was aweful","review":"Truthfully, I only watched the entire thing because I paid for it.

The trilogy had widespread positive reviews. The actual movie adaptationsof all three novels were released in Sweden in 2009 and stil being box-office hits.I don't need to detail each of the trilogy movies but it is a MUST for Thriller & Suspence Lovers; so Ihighly recommend that you do get this trilogy either in movies (Blu-ray is best), books or other readable formatsfrom Amazon.com into your collection as an investment for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect transition from print to film!","review":"Sometimes the films do not do the books justice. After reading the books, I was anxious to see the trilogy played out on screen, but apprehensive that the DVD's would not live up to my expectations. I was not disappointed. The DVD was the perfect depiction of what I envisioned. I wanted to see the Swedish version of the film and I'm glad I did. I can't imagine anyone in Hollywood being better suited for the parts of Lisbeth or Mikael. Unlike Hollywood which always turns everything into an overly glamorized and implausible blockbuster, this was the perfect interpretation of what I believe was intended. At first it was a little disconcerting with the voice-overs not precisely matching the closed captions, but ignoring the text eliminated that confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the bunch","review":"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was an addictive and suspenseful thriller. I enjoyed it a lot. The Girl Who Played with Fire was much more convoluted, much less tense, and kind of..melodrama-ish.And then this...this was just a bad movie.It feels like the last two movies should have been made into mini series rather than a 2 hour film because its clear they are disjointed and difficult to get emotionally involved in."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Ain't gonna spend any money buying short version of any films released this way by majors when we know there's a long version.

No action to speak of, really, until the closing minutes. Most of it is a convoluted exposition of why this punk goth chick is so mad at the world. I got tired of her expressionless looks. And what's up with the 1980 Goth hair and outfits? Silly. Maybe that looks tough these days in Sweden. As usual, we have the more than normal coincidences here to help the plot along. If the third film in this series is any slower than this, it will be glacial. Needed a good haircut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging","review":"Like the previous two installments, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is flat, unimaginative and pedestrian- three things the novels never came close to being. It's discouraging to see that the Swedish film adaptations of such unique novels would translate so bluntly to the screen. While all the major plot points are there, this third and final part of the trilogy refuses to have the sizzle that the novel had. Granted, there is an enormous amount of exposition and while it was fascinating in the novel, the film consists of bunch of people sitting around and talking. There was plenty of opportunity to improve on the story and making it just as riveting as the novel (and this can be said for \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\") but unfortunately it never happens. The filmmakers were too concerned with such a literal adaptation of Stieg Larsson's words that they forgot all the possibilities the medium of film had to offer this incredible story."},{"rating":"1","title":"English dubbed is HORRIBLE","review":"This is an amazing movie.

I must admit to fast forwarding through a few scenes of this one, but I'm so glad to have seen all 3. While I knew where it was headed (unlike the first two), and at times I was thinking, \\"C'mon, already, and just do it!\\" this is the one that ties up all the loose ends. A definite must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent wrap-up","review":"I've thoroughly enjoyed reading the trilogy and thought the first 2 adaptations into movies were great. This one is just as good. In the third book, there was A LOT of detail on the secret society and its players. Some people really like that, but I thought it dragged the story and the action did not pick up until about 70% into the book. This movie, thank goodness, deftly left out those details without getting us lost. I also appreciated that they left out the majority of Erika Berger's story. In doing this, the movie moved at an excellent pace.I've said it in my other reviews of the first two movies, but I cannot emphasize enough about Noomi Rapace's depiction of Salander. She makes the films!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitd Gold Earrings","review":"I was not happy with the earrings because the backs were too loose and the first time I wore them I lost one.

Think of a cabbage soup for comparison if you are not familiar with the context.

Kim Chi Soup is good, love the noodles, but it's too hot for my taste (even for my husband's, who loves spicy food). I didn't like Teriyaki at all, and Miso was so-so.

But was I wrong or what..! It took exactly 3 onions for the thing to break from the corner. The glass container just chipped off from where it is connected to the top part.

We threw the peppers away, puzzling over the cause. I decided to experiment today. I chopped a couple of pieces of celery, put it in a microwave safe bowl, and set the microwave to defrost.

First, it was one of the arms that held the pusher to the metal broke off when trying to disassemble for cleaning.Second, the metal grate bent on the edge, catching the pushing plastic part and cutting it. I had to put about 200lb of weight into it to cut an onion after a while.Then, I had to forcefully hit the top to get it to actually chop. As a result, the bottom piece cracked and its almost impossible to use.

The angled action means all the force concentrates on two cheap plastic knobs on the corners, which break. Plus, the top's underside is hard to clean, and the blades can bend. I've had two of these because I do love the results when they work -- nice, evenly sized bits of onion -- but they just breaks too easily. Back to chopping by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"great concept but can be better","review":"This is a great product if you cut lot of vegetables, especially onions. You can cut them with a snap of a motion. It is a snap if you know the technique. Use your palms to press this down with one palm on the top of each other.However, you need to cut the vegetables into small pieces to cover approximately half the surface of the blade. If you try to cut a bigger piece, the product will break at the hinge. I bought three in the past and all of them broke and I this is the 4th one that I am buying. Why I am still buying if they break? It makes my job of cutting onions and vegetables easy and they all are the same size. If you are making salsa, or salad where you care how the pieces look, this product is great. I tried slap chop and other products but don't like any of them. I wish they make this product with something other than plastic that wouldn't break or they can sell just the bottom container."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product. Will take away your onion tears :)","review":"Good product and will take away your onion tears as you are able to make equal small pieces of onion with this one. Make sure you dont put too big pieces as it will break this little machine. I broke mine and then had to order another one from Amazon. Amazon gave me some discount too as the previous one was broken so high stars for Amazon.Product concept it good and is a solid product but bigger onions will take its strudiness away and it will break so be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegetable Chopper","review":"These vege choppers are wonderful...

My recommendation would to be to spend the extra money to purchase one with both size cutting grates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you are careful","review":"It cuts the pieces small and evenly. Keep in mind that you are cutting up a quarter or half an onion in one push, so it takes a bit of effort. In addition to the paper thin layers of the onion you normally peel, you might want to take a couple more to make it easier to cut.If you are not careful, the base will break. Each of the two that I bought lasted several months for me, but I have given up on this one an am using a small food processor instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful","review":"this is the second of these choppers i've bought. plusses: a very quick efficient way to produce chopped onion in a small, uniform size. if you have good knife skills you don't need it, but for more casual cooks it's a very good way to speed up and refine your cooking. minuses: takes up a lot of storage space, and isn't that long-lived; the hinge is made of plastic--thick, sturdy plastic, but plastic--and using the chopper puts a lot of stress on it, it eventually cracks. still, i liked this device enough to get another when that happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical","review":"This is a very good product; it works great! But it was not that reliable. This is my third unit. The first one lasted for about 8 months, then cracked at the corners. The second one also cracked at the same place in 6 months.

A great time saver, but won't do a lot at a time. Takes a lot of force to actually close the lid which forces the onion through the cutting grates. Use smaller pieces instead of the whole onion.

It works nothing like what you might see on TV.The second problem is this - Note the hinge in the picture. Its clear plastic.

I find the Progressive International Onion Chopper easy to clean (it comes with a small tool to help clean the grate)and extremely efficient. I have always disliked chopping onions, apples, mushrooms, tomatoes and the like but this has made this tedious (and sometimes odious)task quick and easy plus the base measures the amount you have chopped so you know when you have reached your goal. Just place a slice of onion, or whatever, on the metal grate and push down on the lid (I will admit, sometimes it takes a bit more effort than others when you are attacking a thick slice of something but it is not too difficult) and your onion is chopped with a minimum of tears and no nicked fingers from cutting too close to your digits.

Its hard plastic construction feels as through it's going to break when you attempt to apply the amount of pressure necessary to force the onion through the metal dicing insert.

I doubt that the combination lock would hinder an expert thief for long, but I'm satisfied that it's secure enough to stop anybody that's foolish enough to look for wealth in our modest home.

The only thing I didn't like about the product, hence the 4 stars, is the packaging. Like others have noted the safe comes in a regular corrugated box. The box was torn on the side and caused the sides of the safe to be dented. It's still structurally stable, but who wants a dented safe when you buy new. Amazon was nice enough to refund me 20% price of the cost. One other negative factor is that the hinge is exposed. Break the hinge and you can open the safe.

Admittedly, the first one broke the first time my wife tried to use it (operator error) but that is also why I bought this product. I purchased two more. I didn't have to do anything more than remove the screw in the adjuatable knuckle and reuse the portion that is mounted to the dash.

The hardest rockers here are \\"Silver Dollar Forger\\" and \\"Shanghai'd In Shanghai\\", but many of the songs seem to experiment with new structures while betraying signs of road-weariness. Some people have claimed that this album was not as good as their first two, but their kids should be forced to pay for their sins through school volunteerism programs, because this is a wonderful experimentation with new sounds and styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider that 4.5 stars","review":"Though I don't know or remember the other Nazareth albums, by the sheer quality of this record, Rampant MUST be one of their best.There is no weak song here! Most hit compilations contain only\\"Shanghai'd in Shanghai\\" from Rampant, though I like the fast paced \\"Glad when you're gone\\" and \\"Jet Lag\\" even more. I own the vinyl record since 25 years and didn't play it for a long time due to the more comfortable CD-player.

In some ways, this is a terrible movie. Some of the dialogue is awful, and characters are often more like caricatures. (There are a few great one-liners, though, you have to admit.) But it's funny and fun to watch and sends up some issues that nobody else in film has ever seemed to want to talk about or acknowledge. I've never seen anything like it.

Marisa Tomei demonstrates wonderful comic gifts. The biggest surprise is Heather Graham, whose porn-star-with-a-heart-of-gold love interest is clever, smart and sincere.

Actually, it's more like an alternate timeline, since \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" takes place in the late 80s and this one takes place in 2002. But no matter. This film is deliciously good with all the propor Clancy elements in tact. Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) is an up-and-coming CIA analyst who stumbles on a plot to nuke Baltimore all too late. Morgan Freeman plays Cabot, Ryan's mentor and friend. The film never loses itself with technical jargon, something the Clancy novel does. Instead, it gives a good story about characters, governments, and mayhem on the verge of World War III. \\"The Sum of All Fears\\" is a fun movie for the military buff or Clancy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"This movie is not like the book. At first i found the movie to be moving a little slow in terms of action,but towards the middle things started to pick up.The movie started to get intense.It's one of those movies where you don't know whats going to happen next. At one point it seems like America and Russia are going to go to war,but then the whole movie turns.

Well not too bad. Somethings are diffrent from the book but for me nothing really major. Such as a different bad guy, younger Jack Ryan, etc.I was worried intially with Ben Affleck taking over Harrison Ford but he did fine. He convinced me as a young Jack Ryan. I also liked Liev Schrieber being the new John Clark very convincing. Morgan Freeman as always was great. The rest of the cast was also excellent.The film started slow but in the middle picks up when the bomb goes off. Very powerful image. Something I hope we will only see in film.The tension that now begins with Russia and the US is also very accurate and very scary. The way one action causes another escalation in the conflict is pretty realistic.The film was very good and the suspense excellent. My only complaint is that it is slow at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good intrepretation, not even a good movie","review":"If you liked the book, don't watch this movie. I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Most of the other Clancy novels that have been adapted to film have been disappointing. This one was awful. Ben Afflek does a good job of portraying Jack Ryan, and Morgan Freeman is as always spot on, but the script was so bad that they could not save this film. So many important aspects of this story were lost in the screenplay that it was changed from a story that could still be relevant in today's world to one that seems like it is an outdated dinosaur. I understand that a good novel is often difficult to translate to a good movie, but this goes beyond that. There are just so many scenes that don't make any sense at all and don't really help the plot along. While other scenes that were critical to the point of the story, were left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"Tom Clancy's techno thriller is missing from this very disappointing film. Not worth your time, unless you're a die-hard Clancy fan that has to see the portrayal of all his novels in film.The plot's been substantially altered AND dumbed down, and all the wonderful technical details Clancy researched and explained in fascinating detail are gone, just gone.Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman do the best they can with the material given, yet they seem limited by the direction.

It is very good, but I would like to encourage you to read the book as well, as it takes place at a very different time in Ryan's life and has much more suspense than the movie.

Amazing that this wooden lightweight doesn't burst into flames like a balsa Doomtown shack when the nuclear bomb explodes nearby. Maybe the disaster itself was understated on screen to get a PG13 or in light of 9/11, but the thousands of people in the stadium seem treated too lightly, and the horror of a nuclear weapon used in a densely populated city is never made vivid. One star for a couple of charming performances, players of the CIA director and the longsuffering brick agent whose scenes with Affleck create a painful talent contrast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it on the shelf","review":"I love Tom Clancy books. They are a great read and quite an adventure. I also like all the actors in this movie. They are all quality actors with great bodies of work however this is not a film that will shine in anyone's resume. The script, what little there is , bears little resemblence to the great book that it is based upon.The movie loses crediblity in the very beginning and never regains it. I certainly wasn't expecting it to be a documentary but some common sense in dealing with nuclear fallout and radioactive materials would have been helpful. I like Affleck and feel that he would be a good Jack Ryan but he doesn't get a chance in this movie. Poor character development, poor plot line and all you have left is action scenes which just don't add up.If you truly want to see this movie, just rent it and save your money for better movies to buy. Shame on the screenwriters. They certainly could do better work than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mess","review":"there's not much more to say about how badly every aspect of this film sucks. other reviewers have pretty much said it all. i'll just say this: i hated Sum Of All Fears and I never even read the book. To me, an adapted films correlation to its source material is irrelevent. If the movie was an exact replication of the book that would not make it any better. the movie sucks on its own merit. from the acting (cumulatively, the worst i have EVER SEEN), to the dialogue (often painful and generall obvious), to the action (as in the complete lack thereof), this movie is a complete failure.

Even the typically reticent Clancy would approve.\\"I beg to differ.The real downfall of this movie lay not in the theatrical performances of Ben Affleck or Morgan Freeman but instead comes from the pre-production studio politics and the implausible, if not laughable, script changes. Making the antagonists of the film Neo-Nazis seems not implausible but infact makes the film disingenuous and smacks of derivative 1980's film schlock.(In all seriousness, why would Nazi's really want to blow up the Super Bowl?)I presume this was done as an attempt to pacify Arab or Muslim defense organizations.Whomever adapted this scripted turned a respectable peace of Clancy's trademark political science fiction into a piece Clive Cussler pulp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Affleck has a range of expressions from A to B","review":"In the spirit of full disclosure, I'm a Clancy fan so I spent the $8 to see this movie in the theatre in order to get the full effect, despite no Alec Baldwin, no Harrison Ford, no James Earl Jones.Ben Affleck's expression A is a slack-jawed \\"Duh!\\" I'm glad he found a use for his greatest asset, his jaw. His expression B is a \\"Deer in the Headlights\\" stare. He had no physical assets to back this one up. This is NOT the Jack Ryan I spent money to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sum of a Good Movie","review":"The Sum of all Fears was a very good movie, even though it strayed from Clany's book. If the movie line of Jack Ryan novels is ever to continue , the aging Ford and Baldwin need to be replaced by a younger actor, which Ben Affleck fits nicely (I myself would like to see another 3 or 4 Clany book made into movies). As for the people who reviewed the movie to be bad, I disagree and say to get a life and America needs to grow up from Spetember 11th and is tough enough to handle what this movie has to offer. If a war does ever start between Russia and the United States, it will happen similar to the events portrayed in this movie. What if Sept 11th has been blamed on the Russians or China, yet carried out by a few radical members of those govts? Things might have turned out differently, much like The Sum of all Fears. Bottom line, good movie and a good tool to learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"Nobody writes military thrillers like Tom Clancy. A handful of the movies made from his novels are worthy of the original manuscript. \\"Hunt for Red October\\" is my key example.If I had to sum up the problems for \\"The Sum of All Fears\\", I'd first mention acting. I really like Ben Affleck, but he simply doesn't define the role like either Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford. Perhaps if he were cast in an earlier portion of Jack Ryan's life, he might have worked, but Affleck simply lacks the authority and competence inherent in Ford's manner--and being a MUCH younger man following Ford just seems out of sync.This was also one of the rare roles where I saw Morgan Freeman as Morgan Freeman. Usually, he transports me to the place and time he's inhabiting in the character--not in this film.The plot is interesting--but nowhere near as well done as the book. Just read the book. It's available here on Amazon and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Jack Ryan","review":"The only reason to have this collection is because someone loves the novels and character of Jack Ryan (as I do). All 4 movies have their ups and downs, being Harrisond Ford my personal favorite to play Jack Ryan. But it is certainly worth mention the performance of such great actors as James Earl Jones, Sean Connery, Morgan Freeman and Willem Dafoe. What I also like of these movies is there is no pretension to become anything else but stories very well written and remaining true to the original novels by Tom Clancy.If you love thrillers, you'll not be dissapointed and will probably have a great time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy? Not exactly","review":"Tom Clancy should have taken his name off this dreck. I don't mind Affleck, but a franchise is no reason to take a good story and trash it with political correctness.

Plain and simple. It was a tremendous failure in the careers of Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman.There was nothing special about the camera work and the music wasn't all that great either.And it didn't make sense! It dropped to huge cliches that you could predict even before the movie started. The filmmakers obviously weren't going for freshness here.The explosion scene lasted for about 30 seconds. It left me wanting for more, and they never gave it to me. Very disappointing.To sum it all up, the movie was totally off base and not done the way a good movie would be.

The changing of the \\"bad guys\\" from Islamic extremists to Neo-Nazis was unbelievable, and detracted from the message of the story to such a degree as to make the film, in the mind of this reviewer, not worth much at all.Call me a purist, but I really dislike this sort of revisionism.Read the book; give the movie a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct Tom Clancy","review":"I watched this the other night, and can't believe how politically correct it is. The bad guys are Austrians, Isrealis, and, indirectly, the U.S. military-industrial complex. I wonder what Tom Clancy thinks about that. Muslims are just innocent bystanders, and the liberals save the day, because war is all just a misunderstanding, or is caused by European nazis. This movie is shameless political correctness. The film is actually excellent, but I give it only two stars for the tired leftwing cliches. If they had filmed it based on Clancy's novel, it would have been great. I think Hollywood just copped out and got scared of portraying the Muslims as \\"the enemy\\", and so did what they always do: just turn the bad guys into white nazis. South Africans are no longer available, so they went to the \\"default\\": Austrians (guys, World War II is over)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!

Everyone heed my words, BOOK GOOD, MOVIE BAD. First off, when I went to see this I said if you have never read any of Clancy's books or seen any of the previous movies the it was ok. If you have then you will know what I am talking about when I say it is a bad movie. Once I saw the movie I then went to see why it was so bad. Just as I thought. They produced [messed] up everything just to fit Ben Affleck in. Let's see what they did wrong. They didn't use Alec Baldwin (Best Jack Ryan) or Harrison Ford. In the book Ryan is older than in the previous movies. Ryan is no longer married. Ryan is now just a CIA worker and not Deputy Director CIA like he is in the book. Willem Dafoe did not play Clark and they left out Chavez. They left out the Islamic extremists. Finally they left out half the plot that made The Sum Of All Fears what it was meant to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sreen Adaptation of a Clancy novel yet","review":"I don't begrudge Tom Clancy creating further wealth from turning his stories into films. He was the Executive Producer of this movie after all. But this film is so politically correct, poorly cast and the screenplay so far removed from the actual story line of the novel, the DVD cover should have some type of disclaimer to warn Clancy purists. Either that or give it some other title so it can't be confused with the real item. About the only redeeming feature is the decent soundtrack music written by Jerry Goldsmith. The Sum of All Fears novel is one of my favorite Clancy books. This film adaptation was the worst of his works that have been made into a movie so far. Hollywood, being Hollywood screws up again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Ryan and the meaning of life","review":"What's not to like about the character of Jack Ryan?

What the..... ?Everything is very anticlimactic, uninspired, and the story was unorganized and senseless in a lot of areas.Good action, good camera angles, just horrible chops in the movie.Whoever says this is a well made thriller or a good suspenseful film, I really don't know what to say to you. To each their own.By the way, NEVER....EVER....believe in a movie trailer again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It ain't over yet","review":"Even in this new era of Russian and American friendshipinto which this film came, there are still atomic bombs on both sides.Technically the handling of people in the bomb area in this film is very wrong : at the hospital and on the streets.Everyone is taught that the ashes from the bomb are as deadly as the bomb itself. No one was doing decontaminations here.The brinkmanship here was classic and the Jack Ryan as good as ever.Tom Clancy is a very good spy/ suspense writer, he just doesn't seem to know that much about atomic bombs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Clancy book fans","review":"If you enjoy the Tom Clancy series, this is an excellent book. However, the movie was so different as to be almost unrecognizable as a Jack Ryan story, except in name. The timeline was changed, the characters are all wrong and out of place, and the locations were different. Not sure why all of this was changed, but don't expect it to be true to the book in very many ways. But there are good special effects, and it's an entertaining movie if you haven't read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"You know when whenever Neo-Nazis are the focus of a contemporary world threat, you're going to have a premise that is absurd. That's what happened here. Tom Clancy must be losing it since he was involved with this film and yet allowed the bad guys to be Nazis even though in the book the terrrorists were from the mid east. Why this change? Perhaps it was political correctness but regardless of the reason, it makes the film's premise cheap and lame.Ben Affleck's performance in this film was weak. He was certainly no leading man and could not fit Alec Baldwin's or even Harrison Ford's shoes.I think this could have been a good film but sadly the casting and the premise were not very well considered thus leading to an overall disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite lacking","review":"Ben Affleck, Morgan Freeman, and Tom Clancy. How can you go wrong? If you want to know, see this movie. I am simply giving it a star because I see no reason to give it anything higher than that.

Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave me a helpful/not helpful feedback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed......again","review":"I saw this movie at the theatre in 2002 and was sorely disappointed. I rented it again the other night just to see if I might have been wrong about it the first time. I wasnt.The film critic calls this the best of the Jack Ryan series. He must have been high when he wrote it. This was the absolute worse.I was really ticked off that they strayed so far from the original story on this one. The writers and director were obviously trying to make a buck instead of listening to the fans and keeping with both the original storyline and the series continuity.I mean Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan? Come on!I heard that Tom Clancy was so mad about this film that he wouldnt allow any more of his work to be made into movies. That's too bad, but considering how this one went, I dont much blame him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"That is pretty much all I can say.

There are many MANY scenes (specially the ones containing color gradients) that are heavily pixelated. YouTube videos look better than this!!If you want to have a copy of this movie, either wait until the price is really low, or just get the DVD and save yourself the pixels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disapointment","review":"I thought that this movie was going to be awesome, because it really did look cool on the previews, but it turns out that this was one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. The main character of this movie is terrible, and emotionless. The guy is a very bad actor and has a very dull personality. The whole movie was pretty boring and they don't even really show you the ending parts. the only exciting parts were The beginning part of the movie and the part where the Russian planes attack the aircraft carrier(that part was cool.)The beginning was really cool when it showed the Israeli aircraft carrying a nuclear bomb(they presented it in a way that made it emotional aned sad when he reached for the photo of his family). I'm honestly very glad that they shot down the airplane though because they were going to drop it and kill many innocent Arabs, so the pilot deserved what he got:)...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another mediocre HD release from Paramount","review":"The PQ is average compared to other HD releases. Paramount is recalling it because it contains no extras even though the package said so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really following the story","review":"If you have not read the book ,then this review will not really pertain to you. This movie followed the book in only one sense. A nuclear bomb went off. It wasn't even in the right city. Jack Ryan isn't a rookie in the book, he the Deputy Director. Tom, the book was good, you didn't really need to change it. You lost a lot of plot twists like the reports of missing nukes and the whole affair thing. The lack of all of this really messed up on the story in the book. Just a note if you have read the book, haven't seen the movie, and don't want to be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy sold out","review":"I read in the WSJ today (\\"How to Market Movie About the Bomb So It Won't Be One,\\" May 30, 2002) that Clancy changed the bad guys from Arabs to neo-Nazis for the movie because he wanted to be \\"sensitive to stereotypes.\\" Pathetic, absolutely pathetic. Is it a stereotype to say that the biggest terrorist attack in the history of the world was carried out by Arab men?The one group that Hollywood still feels it can beat up on is neo-Nazis, even if it's completely ridiculous. I guarantee you, most neo-Nazis are more interested in getting enough money together to buy a six-pack or some crystal meth, than trying to get their hands on a nuke to blow up their own country.On the other hand, if Clancy (who's an executive producer, so he's got NO excuse) had had the integrity to keep the Arabs as the bad guys, we could have had an ultra-realistic, hardhitting and thought-provoking movie. Shame on you Mr. Clancy, shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"book better than movie","review":"I'm reading the book and decide to checkout dvd, boy what a waste!

The climax never came, or at least was so miniscule I was left wondering, was that it? I was very disappointed that they had Morgan Freeman bow out so early too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"It's not easy replacing Harrison Ford as a beloved screen hero, but Ben Affleck brings fresh vitality to The Sum of All Fears, reviving Paramount's Tom Clancy franchise in the role Ford made famous. As CIA agent Jack Ryan, Affleck is a rookie in the covert ranks, unraveling a plot that lures Russian and American superpowers into a nuclear standoff, while a neofascist faction turns most of Baltimore into an atomic wasteland and holds the world in the grip of a terrorist nightmare. Unfortuneately this film doesn't succeed at anything besides putting the viewer to sleep. There is very little character developement in this 2 hour long movie, and the A-BOMB sequence only lasts for about 5 seconds! Don't see this, it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unwanted gift","review":"Someone bought this movie for me as a gift but I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this movie. It isn't that the premise is absurd, it's that the reactions are and the logistics of how the event is handled are insulting to anyone with a memory of Sept. 11. Little things, like Ben Affleck running around a ruined city, talking on a cell phone. Doesn't anyone remember that after the attacks on Sept. 11, phone lines were jammed. Getting through on them was next to impossible, but Affleck pretty much runs through most of the movie with a phone glued to his ear. There's more, but overall, this was a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Affleck, the wooden face.","review":"Affleck is simply one of the worst actors of his generation. His pal Matt Damon is miles and miles ahead of him in terms of acting capability.Add this to a book that was not translated into the screen: it was \\"butchered\\" into the screen!Clancy's novels are always seven hundred pages or more of highly technical details and hundreds of subplots: it's almost impossible to adapt them properly (that's why some of Stephen King's novels are adpated to mini-series; that's why Peter Jackson adapted The Lord Of The RIngs into three films).A waste of time, but you can still rent it for a laugh. Just don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good supporting cast, lead man is lost","review":"Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies. Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way. The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action. Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?). This is going to go down as the \\"Star Wars Prequel\\" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Affleck wrong for this part","review":"Although this movie improved about three quarters of the way through, I found it a little slow at first. I had a hard time with Ben Affleck in the part of Jack Ryan. He just didn't pull it off, in my opinion. I think I've been spoiled by the great plot and great acting in Fox's show, 24."},{"rating":"1","title":"The botched up sum of all fears","review":"I read my first Tom Clancy book 13 years ago and wait every two years for his new book to come out. I decided to rent The Sum of All Fears. The facts for the most part were correct. The movie did not follow the book very well. The movie would be 10 hours long if it was told correctly. I think Tom Clancy did not have very much creative input into this movie because an f-16 cannot drop a gbu paveway smart bomb. I thought that in general Ben Affleck is a great Jack Ryan, But again in all the movies his wife has blonde hair and it is short.. And in the book they were working on their third child. I think it was a great movie but as the story goes (with the exception of jaws) the book was better than the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"A B-flick masquerading as an A-flick.","review":"For me, there is really just one problem with this film. Even if a film is illogical, I am still able to suspend judgement and enjoy a film for what it's worth. The problem with this film is Affleck who is just horrible in the role of Jack Ryan. This guy (the character that is) has a PhD?! Get serious! In my opinion Liev Schreiber (John Clark in the film) should have been cast as Ryan. He has great physical and mental presence and is by-far a better actor than the wimpy Affleck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I know that this had to change from the book to be a film that took less than 6 hours, but they killed it. It changed from a suspense filled thinkers novel with interweaving plot lines, to a poor mans James Bond.Ryan should be 40ish using his knowledge and strength of character to deal with an unervingly 9/11 like disaster, instead a teenage Ryan runs round looking heroic and likely getting a fatal dose of radiation foiling a plot by the new villans of Hollywood the Nazis (now that they can't pick on Arabs anymore), I'm just surprised they didn't all have English accents!A star vehicle for Affleck it isn't worth of the Clancy title; Clancy shouldn't have sold out one of his best novels.The worst book adaptation I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"This movie made me suddenly realize, Ben Affleck is not a good actor.Part of my disappointment is that I recently read the novel by Tom Clancy, and it's sooooo much better.

BOY was i wrong!!! BEN AFFLECK does an admirable job looking good for the camera. Huh? plot? We all know that the Jack Ryan character is always in the right place at the right time, and holds all the cards, and fights doggedly against impossible odds and unknown opponents, but this movie was such an obvious reaction to the attacks of 9/11 in such a patriotic and ignorant sense that only the recent COLLATERAL DAMAGE, TEARS OF THE SUN or AIR MARSHALL are more offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"killed the series","review":"If they had just named it something else.This movie p*ssed on all Clancy fans and that was the problem.Please!

So let me just add my two cents. The movie is awful. It is not anywhere in the same league as the other Tom Clancy novel films. It's boring, poorly paced, not true to the book, cliche, and all together lacking any depth or originality. I never felt on the edge of my seat or worried about any of the characters. The actors are excellent in other films (esp. Morgan Freeman) but in this film cardboard cut outs. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally different then the book","review":"I didn't like this movie because it didn't follow the book. I didn't like the idea of Jack Ryan being younger. If you read the book do not go see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"If you're a fan of the novels written by Tom Clancy you'll start to wonder what planet he was on when he approved the screenplay for this movie. The most disappointing movie of the year is how I'd characterise this. First of all, the oft discussed time warp factor that Jack Ryan is put through. Its 2002 (29 years after 1973 when the Israeli jet carrying the nuke crashes) and Jack Ryan is a young sprightly CIA analyst with bad hair. He's dating Cathy Muller who has also mysteriously gotten younger. He meets John Clark, whom every fan of the novels knows he never set eyes on until Clear and Present Danger and goes into the field with him. I mean what was Clark thinking???The only similarity with the book is that a nuclear weapon goes off in the United States. My advice, ignore the movie unless you've NEVER read the novels and focus on Clancy's writing..its far far better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as the trailer hinted it would be","review":"I only watched this movie because I was bored tonight. The trailer let me know 10 years ago how bad it would be, so I never bothered to see it. I figured I would get a few laughs out of the parts of the book they mangled, as Hollywood has done to every Clancy book they adapted to film, but I was denied even that, as the writers jettisoned about 95% of the original story and politically airbrushed the rest. However, like most train wrecks, I could not look away. By the end of the movie, it was clear that with a bit more trimming and a change of title, Hollywood could have promoted this as a unique story in it's own right, but then they would not have had Clancys name to sell it with. I'm sure T.C. winces every time he realizes what a joke this film is to anyone who has read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sum of All Fears","review":"I never thought that anyone could replace Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan but Ben Affleck nails the character. Of course as always, Morgan Freeman gave a sterling performance. This movie has a lot of action and as always Tom Clancy, author of the book, makes the whole situation come alive. This is a definete must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sum of All Fears","review":"Are you kidding? Ben Affleck a worthy successor to Harrison Ford? You should be writing jokes for Leno & Letterman. Affleck makes a horrible Jack Ryan. He does not show the mental acuity that is necessary in order to play Clancy's protagonist. Affleck is simply too dull.Morgan Freeman performs well as always and Bridget Moynahan is fabulous in a small role --- but they can't save this film. Between the casting of Affleck as Ryan and the screenwriters politically-correct rewrite of Clancy's story (so as not to offend Arab Americans I suppose), \\"Sum of All Fears\\" is a fearsome flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood is a criminal","review":"This movie does not even deserve 1 star. This movie is long, boring and predictable AND unbelievable. It was such a waste of my time to try and sit through this unproductive mess. Ironically this film is a classic reason to support and venture to see more independent films that are actually worth watching and paying for.

The book made much more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaahhhh!!!!!","review":"What a disappointment. After having viewed other Tom Clancy movies and comparing them to his novels, this movie is an insult to his work. Even more disappointing is that Tom Clancy had a hand in having his excellent novel of the same name brought to such a dismal screen production. It must have been the money because no self-respecting author would let his work be butchered so.

I would recommend both."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complete deal with extras","review":"If you are a fan of the the Jack Ryan series then this is the set to get starting with the one that started the franchise to the climatic prequel that to this point concludes the series. The price is right too conidering what trilogy and movie sets go for these days, and you don't feel empty handed due to the fact that each film is a special edition so if you are a movie freak and enjoy all of the behind the scenes stuff then you get to enjoy all of that as well. Overall it's the best choice for the price in looking for the films featuring Jack Ryan."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked \\"Pearl Harbor\\" you'll love this movie!","review":"What I liked about this movie was Morgan Freeman's acting and that's where it ends. Unfortunately he's not around very long. Besides the laundry list of technically inaccurate scenes (much unlike Clancey's well researched novels) the bad acting, the President and his Laural & Hardy cabinet members, the sad affair between Jack & his girlfriend? Fiancee? girl he just met 3 days ago?, the extremely bad special affects of the nuclear explosion, and the rediculous \\"politically correct\\" plot where the mean evil \\"white guys\\" want to blow up the world and take over; the movie was a total failure. After Europe, Russia, and America have been annilated how many \\"white guys\\" are going to be left to rule the world? This movie should have been left at the bottom of Pearl Harbor.

Like We Aren't Scared Enough Already.","review":"I was deeply offended when this movie was released so soon after 9-11. I don't understand how anyone could enjoy watching a nuclear bomb explode in the U.S. right now. That said the explosion is the only dramatic part of this film. The message that Israel having nuclear weapons is as dangerous as the breakaway former Soviet states having them will surely be lost on the masses of fools who ran to the theaters to see this .... The nuclear explosion is frightening because of the time we are living in. But the film will put you right back to sleep within 15 minutes of it's detonation. Ben Affleck is ridiculous as this forgettable \\"Jack Ryan\\" character that keeps popping up in these stupid Tom Clancy movies. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"sum of all stars? zero!","review":"Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled \\"reapeat\\". On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough. Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is unconvincing. The rest of the characters, Morgan Freeman in particular, badly hampered by Affleck, carry the movie to mediocrity at best. Comments in the special features praising Affleck's performance are just as unbelievable as Affleck's pathetic attempts to be Ryan. Please, Mr. Clancy, don't let movietown and Affleck ruin Ryan in your next blockbuster. Glad I didn't buy the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"I'm a big Tom Clancy fan and the Sum is one of his best books. So it was a huge disappointment seeing this film. There were two drawbacks at the outset: Affleck (whom I like) playing Ryan, not Harrison Ford, and the modifications compared to the book.Apart from these (not important for those who don't know Clancy) the suspense and action of the book is totally missing from the movie. The story is very slow and predictable, the characters not convincing. All Clancy movies, even the rather bad Clear and Present Danger were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best","review":"Well Ben Affleck isn't nearly as bad in this movie than in the turkey-film Gigli, but this movie is pretty lame. It is a Tom Clancy-based thriller about nuclear threat. You know what it's like.Altogether, it was not as \\"heart-pounding\\" or \\"edge of your seat\\" thriller. It was actually quite boring. No superb or dramatic acting here."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"When I first saw commercials for this movie, I thought, \\"Wow, I have to go see this movie now.\\" But when I did see it, it didn't live up to my expectations. First Ben Affleck's character is racing to find out about a bomb being built, but he's too late and there goes Baltimore. Then Affleck is trying to prevent a full scale war between Russia and the US. The guy who is thought to be the enemy by the US, the Russian President, does not seem very innocent in the movie. He just looks evil. Also, I never really understood why the villain wants to cause war between the super powers, and what's with the Nazi connection? That did not make much sense. Don't even bother seeing this movie, it will only disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The product was great but it took too long to ship.

Now if you can sit through the first hour and make it to the second (just like Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones was) you'll be entertained from hat point forward.The action in the second half is imaginative and interesting. Considering the September 11th attacks - this movie hits home how serious the terrorist threats have the potential of being. Our technology can certainly be the death of us. The special effects sequences are good in this one however.Morgan Freeman is really good as the FBI advisor to the president. I can certainly live without Ben Aflect. He is no Harrison Ford (who played Jack Ryan in two other movies). Overall the movie is something I would wait to rent on DVD. I hope the extras are good on it when it does come out.I'd wait on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as a stand alone!!","review":"The movie itself is not too bad and would probably be absolutely a great movie if you'd never read the book or any other novel by Tom Clancy. I truly understand the need to slightly change the events in a novel to make a movie, but this was only a glimmer of the novel at best. Ben Affleck being a good actor, he's still no Jack Ryan. This also pretty much rewrites Debt of Honor and Executive Orders down the road if they're to be made into movies as well. As stated above, a good movie, but definitely \\"Sum of All Fear's\\" in name only, not in substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurt by political correctness and unoriginality.","review":"The film disappoints by trying not to offend middle eastern sensibilities. Thus the terrorist become Nazis ( a laughable premise). When the terrorism occurs, the Americans want to blame the Russians.

That said, his presence alone can't save this movie. Ben Affleck looks as if he somehow wandered into the wrong production and isn't sure what to do about it. Aside from everything else, he lacks the gravitas that Harrison Ford brought to his roles in the Clancy films.It's a manipulative effort that tries to play upon everyone's worst fear: that of nuclear war, but succeeds only in being silly. The climax relies upon computer communications that could never possibly happen; the plot is so thin you can see daylight through it. There are some decent special effects but even combining the few positive aspects there are do not make this worth seeing.Don't waste your money. Go see The Bourne Identity instead; it, at least, is entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst of the Jack Ryan films","review":"This film is a major disapointment to the previous Jack Ryan movies.

It tackles the question: What is good?It is true and useful, in that it contains actual reality and gives the viewer the benefit of lessons learned without having to live the process (in this case, 2 horrible processes).Other reviews talked about it's slow pace - fascinating.

Roger Michell has crafted a superb film in every respect, from its brilliant acting turns by both Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Affleck in this character-driven story by Michael Tolkin (of \\"The Player\\") and Chap Taylor, to its technical aspects, such as cinematography, editing, and score. Rather than merely being a suspenseful chase film with a villain and a hero, the story goes far beyond that formula and makes each character complex; there are no true villains in \\"Changing Lanes.\\" So much depth and symbolism was given to every aspect of this film to capture the mature audience's mind from beginning to end that I find it pathetic that this film was a sleeper when released in theaters; nowadays, films like \\"Jackass: The Movie\\" will probably win the number one weekly-earnings spot. Oh well, I shouldn't get impatient. Great films take time to be appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very disappointing","review":"I had read so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to rent it out as soon as available on DVD.I was extremely disappointed by a story that made no sense and a pathetic \\"happy\\" ending.What really puzzled me was the serie of unbelievable events from the first accident scene to the second accident, where Gavin (Ben Affleck) ends up a few yards from Doyle's (Samuel L. Jackson) car, and Gavin recognizing Doyle in the streets of New York on a rainy day with Doyle all bundled up, etc... etc...This movie is so unplausible that I felt insulted as if the director (Roger Michell) considers all his viewers as utterly stupid.This is a movie you do not want in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't we all just get along?","review":"Storyline: morally repugnant Wall Street lawyer gets into a contest of tit-for-tat with morally repugnant blue collar drunk. After repeatedly messing with each other they make up at the end and agree to be better men.Actors: Samuel L. Jackson carries the movie. Ben Affleck proves once again that \\"Chasing Amy\\" was a fluke and that he really is [...]. William H. Macy shines in his role as a morally-neutral enabler. Sydney Pollack as the high-powered New York law partner acts just like a Hollywood writer thinks a high-powered New York lawyer would act.Most interesting revelation: many conservatives believe that liberals take the positions they do on moral issues to salve their consciences, and not because of the issue's intrinsic moral worth. Changing Lanes confirms that hypothesis, turning death penalty appellate work into moral therapy. My, it must be so wonderful to be both rich *and* morally superior!"},{"rating":"1","title":"See!! Look what I can do to you!!! ....... I can bore you!!!","review":"Despite the fact that Ben Affleck is the most overated actor in the last 10 years, I gave this movie a chance. My time would have been better spent giving myself shock treatments. At least then I would have gotten something out of the experience.Samuel L. Jackson did a good job portraying a desperate man who has been [done] over by Affleck. But Affleck's performance is absolutely horrible. They spend the entire film out to get each other only to feel guilty when they mess up the others' lives.Do yourself a favor, and try the shock treatments instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could two people be any more stupid?!!","review":"This is a ridiculous story about two idiots who refuse to do the right thing from the start. This kind of idiocy works in a comedy, but it clearly does not work here. There was nothing humorous about this movie, especially SLJ's little story about Tiger Woods. Every event is blown way out of proportion and escalated way beyond reason. Time after time I was shaking my head in disbelief, wondering why these two characters were doing what they were doing. After watching half of this movie I left to go do something more productive with my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collision of character","review":"As the title suggests, drivers change lanes.

It's not that thought provoking movies arent my scene as i'm into many a movie like that it's just changing lanes never seems to end (i even prefer long movies aswell). The story line is easy to grasp just through one listen and is very lucid it's just there seems little development in this film and what development there is is not hard hitting it's subtle and when i say subtle i mean pretty much non exsistant. I love the idea of this movie of how these two strangers meet as if by fate but that is the only high point of this stale film, i dont like to abate films that have this kind of rare plot changing lanes is just poor it's not poor in quality nor is it poor in ability it's just poor in the way it seems to be in a constant state of discretion throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staying Lame","review":"A better title for this cheap-budget film is \\"Staying Lame,\\" since it is nothing more than a shell of a plot featuring two well-known actors. When I say actors, I may be stretching it a bit, since Samuel L. gives a wooden performance every time, while Ben \\"Good Will Hunting\\" Affleck performed best as J Lo's arm candy.But the movie is a pitiful back-and-forth revenge saga, unbelievable, reminiscent of a ping-pong match. It is a \\"The Firm\\" wannabe, a Bruce Willis entendre copy and not worth the $4 it cost to rent from your local video rental store.Hopefully, one day, both main actors will go to acting school, or better yet, stop making movies altogether. But then, there is always the remake of \\"Gone Fishin'\\" starring Danny Glover and Joe Pesci that would be perfect for Sammy and Benny. That, or both could act together inside the Jaba the Hutt costume in the final prequel of Star Wars.Just don't expect me to rent it when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This computer says I'm broke?

It's not even a real movie -- it's douche, PRETENDING to be a movie. Masquereding, if you will.Ben Affleck and Sam Jackson are fine enough actors. Why did they have to stoop so low as to partake in a movie filled with such crappity? People will say it's a \\"morality tale.\\" Guess what? The moral is this: Don't make dumbass movies like this anymore. Shame, Paramount. Finger of shame to each and every one of you. SHAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good human texture spoiled by stupid hollywood screenplay","review":"This movie is marvelously directed -- lots of good micro-moments. But the larger story is completely contrived. The driving forces were cartoonish, and, in true hollywood fashion, the characters became puppets to the plot. Because of this, over and over again, the movie relies on nonsense. For example: Jackson's character tells Affleck's character \\"I threw it away\\", and Affleck just walks away, even though their meeting was a miraculous coincidence, instead of asking: \\"where?\\" Emotions flip-flop on a dime (\\"I'm gonna kill him\\", \\"I'm gonna help him\\") invalidating the very real work done to make the small-scale stuff in the movie seem human. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Affleck and Jackson... Pile One More On The Garbage Heap.","review":"How Ben Affleck has ever gotten to be a 'star' in Hollywood is beyond me. I did like him as George Reeves in the Superman movie but for god sake... this guy is like a piece of notty pine. He is just plain horrible as an actor. He should stick to kissing Kevin Smiths butt and being in his stupid movies because he is a bad actor.Samuel L. Jackson was funny at first.

It bears the normal staying-in-tune issues common to all twelve-string guitars, but the tonality, the action and the response of the electronics is good. I like that the built in pickup also has a three-slide EQ and that the switching includes a battery test button if you set this guitar aside for a while.

You have to already know the lyrics, but the version on this album blows you away. The instruments mimic Hollis Brown's brain pounding; his desparation; his kaos.

But this one has a more upbeat tempo, with the exception of my favorite song on the album, a cover of a Bob Dylan song, The Ballad of Hollis Brown. That song has fantastic drive, heavy metal intensities, just bad ass bass and a hell of a powerful dirge.

The price point is a bit high, you can easily find glitter liners of the same quality and size at the drugstore but Urban Decay's colors are quite unique which made this worth the purchase. My only warning is that it burns the lids, at first I thought it was me but i've heard of others having the same issue. At first it feels like a cooling sensation then a sudden intense burning, like fire, occurs for about 30 seconds. I have no idea why it does this, I've tried asking those at Urban Decay and they had no clue.

There is not one track I skip through eventhough there are several versions of the same songs. Incidentally, the brothers Treadaway provide the vocals throughout and one pens a track that stands up to those of uber-producer Clive Langer.

I have heard people rant about not being able to wait until the series came to DVD. While watching the 20 mins it felt like some sort of joke that I didn't get. Now after trying to give it a second and third chance and watching different parts of the movie and hoping it would get better I now am done.

In Lonesome Dove, you see true men and women of the West with the mannerisms and habits of genuine Texans. I was constantly reminded of men long gone that I had had the honor of knowing back in Texas. Men who were the real article as a cowman, rancher, or peace officer. They were men of my grandfather's and his father's time. Men who held their honor and courage in the most sacred place. Lonesome Dove illuminates brilliantly these character traits and the script certainly follows McMurtry's vision. It is Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall though that help us see these authentic characters function in the real, basic, and heart-stopping beauty of the West. Whatever you do, do not deprive yourself of this experience. Tighten your cinch and come with grit teeth! It is a once in a lifetime event!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Picture","review":"This is one of our favoraite movies and seeing it in bluray is even better.

As one of the other reviews mentions below, if you compare this with the DVD, it's evident that nobody would ever composeThat being said the BD is otherwise spectacular -- but why couldn't they have just given us the original, intended framing?

A grand tour of the old west as it really was. Desolate, forbidden, dangerous and a challenge to all of your senses , this recreation of history in the late 19th century is as good as it gets. Superb performances by Duvall and Jones are nearly topped by those of Diane Lane, Robert Urich and Danny Glover, oh and I shouldn't forget Newt.... I also own Streets of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk and intend to purchase Return To Lonesome Dove in the near future.

This is the same problem I found in the new DVD, Les Mis (see my review)VERY grainey, particularly on interior shots and night scenes. Go cheap on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurie darling","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time. I think the human conflicts are timeless. I originally bought a VHS version but it had cut out aboout 18 minutes for the series. For me, Those 18 minutes were/are VERY important to some nuances in the meaning of the movie. So, I make sure when I give it as a gift that I get the whole thing. People nowadays don't have much patience, so I find I have to \\"force\\" them to watch episode 1, but after that, they are \\"hooked\\". I think this is one of the best most \\"human\\" movies ever made. I NEVER get tired of seeing it and it never ceases to bring up a tear or two thousand. In my opinion, this movie is a TRUE classic about the human spirit. ...getting ready to order it again for another friend.

This is the best video transfer of a movie that I have ever seen - period ! If you like the series do not hestitate to buy it. It is in two words . . . absolutely phenomenal. As far as content is concerned, it is exactly like the standard definition DVD that was released some time ago. That was the technical description of it, but as a western movie it also ranks high on my list. This is one of those rare movies that draws you into the story and never lets go.

I watch Lonesome Dove about once a year and it still moves me every time. Duvall's Gus McCrae and Jones' Captain Call are two of the most compelling fictional characters in television history.

The movie follows the book very closely which of course is highly recommended as well. Duvall and Jones were both perfect for their parts in the movie.

That's over two hours difference from the original film, and no, we're not talking about commercials.So unless Amazon has their listed time wrong and it is actually a full 6.4 hours, you've been duped.

Shame on Amazon for not letting us know that this isn't the complete film.For those of you who had never seen the film and bought this DVD, I'm sorry to tell you that you've been snubbed out of 1/4 of the story. For those of you who loved the film and bought this DVD, don't you feel cheated?This isn't the first time a studio has decided what is best for the viewing public.

I can't believe someone with a brain put this on blu-ray! I never thought I'd even see it in anamorphic widescreen, so this is a major bonus.

The filming is relatively good considering it was done some 20 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie","review":"I love this movie.

The supporting cast is superb...but.This is simply a very bad transfer to DVD. Everything is a little pink. At first I thought Duval was a little sunburned, then I thought, sure maybe Tommy Lee Jones too. Then when Danny Glover looked sunburned I got a little suspicious. Then I noticed the buildings and horses and trees looked a little sunburned.The result is very, very distracting. This disc should be recalled and a new correct transfer should be redistributed. Don't order this DVD until you know that the problem's been fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try for the \\"Cabin Fever\\" version","review":"I have the original four-tape, 172 minute version of this five-star miniseries.

If you locate the version on Cabin Fever Video, grab it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the West","review":"This was presented first as a tv show and I couldn't wait until the next show came on.

If you like action, a good story and want to be throughly entertained, this the video for you. Follows the book very well.Jim Muratet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Old West Entertainment","review":"The greatest gift of this 1992 masterpiece made for television series is the development of the relationships of the main characters. They did a superior job in casting Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Duval, Diane Lane, Danny Glover and Robert Urich in the lead roles. I don't even like Anjelica Huston but in this movie she is great. The dialogue is clever, insightful and reveals the pioneer way of life. You truly fall for the characters in this heart-felt western drama. And don't forget Rick Shroeder!

Romance,drama,learning about life comedy and heart ache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Movie but audio suffers from TV original","review":"The video transfer from the film original on the blu-ray version of Lonesome Dove is very well done. However, if you have a good audio system, you will find that the multichannel blu-ray audio suffers because it was created from the (apparently monaural) original TV sound track. This is particularly noticeable when you contrast the sound on the main menu (apparently re-recorded in state-of-the-art stereo) with the sound track on the movie itself; high frequency response is definitely reduced and there is little channel separation. There is some surround channel content where appropriate. All in all, however, this is an still an outstanding movie, well worth the price on blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grainy noisey nighttime shots take away too much.","review":"Wonderful book, a good made for tv mini-series, a badly made blu-ray. The nighttime shots have so much video noise in them that those scenes make the blu-ray nearly unwatchable at times. There was also quite a bit of edge blurriness which completely takes away from the beautiful vistas and grand landscapes. Truly a shame that the company made such a poor transfer and didn't bother cleaning up the material afterwords. Wait until they re-release it if you care at all how the transfer looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality tape, and shortened version!","review":"\\"Lonesome Dove\\" is surely one of the GREATEST of GREAT mini-series (and books)...BUT...I wish I had listened to the viewer from Missouri City, TX. before buying this tape! In this version from Hallmark Entertainment, not only has the original 6 hours been edited down to only 4 hours, the quality is no better than taping it off of television. Anyone interested in experiencing (and owning) this perfectly magnificent mini-series, do yourself a favor and do not purchase this particular tape...find a full-length version of good quality. \\"Lonesome Dove\\" deserves no less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A severe case of editing","review":"I saw the original Lonesome Dove series on TV and fortunalely was able to tape it. After buying a DVD player I bought the DVD because of the supposedly better picture quality and no commercials.Was I ever dissapointed. Parts of the program were edited out as the story went along. The unforgiveable sin was the abrupt ending of the story leaving out atleast a third of the story and the conclusion.I want my money back.Bob Glover"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible video transfer","review":"For a movie of this caliber, Hallmark and Artisan showed no respect in transferring this western epic to DVD. The movie looks like it was copied from an EP version of the videotape.The picture quality was grainy and dark. Much of the movie is blurry. You can actually see the scenes getting lighter and darker as the movie progressed. It was so bad, I could not watch the movie after the first hour. The Cabin Fever version on video tape was so much better.I am going to try and get my money back for this poor effort. Please, do NOT buy this version. If you have to, rent it first. Hallmark and Artisan have managed to make the worst DVD I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE FULL LENGTH ORIGINAL VERSION","review":"This version is only 2/3's the original. While I don't consider Lonesome Dove to be as great a film as The Unforgiven, consider The Unforgiven being cut down to 2/3's it's original length. Would you consider it to be worth considering over the original. I doubt it. Major character development and plotlines would have to be cut.Lonesome Dove, in my opinion, is one of the greatest, if not the greatest mini-series to ever play on television. Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones give Academy Award deserving (if it was on the big screen) performances.However, everyone should wait for the original, full length version to come out on DVD. I know I will.If this DVD had been the original, it would recieve 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain Jane","review":"Great movie..allstar cast....a must have if you love westerns.

If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it. I cannot think of any way that it could be improved. The casting couldn't be better and Robert Duvall pretty much placed his signature to the role of \\"Gus\\" McRae.

I've been watching the video tape version off my TV since this movie came out. The BluRay version is so much better, although not perfect. The night scenes do not look like BluRay at all, and seemed like they had a much lesser quality to them. Not many night scenes though. Overall this is so much better to watch then the version I had. The scene I remember most is the picnic scene with Angelica Houston & Robert Duvall sitting there talking. The detail of everything in that scene was incredible. The food looked like you could reach over & grab it & the flowers & leaves & grass were all so lifelike, as was the quilt, & the detail in their clothing was unreal. The movie I rate as a 5, The BluRay quality a 4 only because I feel the whole thing wasn't true BluRay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonesome Dove in widescreen","review":"The widescreen, remastered, 5.1 version is terrific. Over the years I have owned the VHS, 4:3 DVD, and now the 16:9 DVD with 5.1 surround sound.

It's one of the films they watch at the movie theater. If you are a fan of early film or a history buff into pre-Nazi Germany movies... or a collector of homosexual or feminist films... then this is definitely worth purchasing. An interesting fact is that this film is pieced together in parts because the original was destroyed by the Nazis. It was reformatted from various copies, so you will see some sections with different types of subtitles.. and different levels of quality. My only complaint is that some of the subtitles are impossible to read because they are white... and there is a great deal of white clothing etc that interferes with reading. Still, a great collectors item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb gem of the German filmography!","review":"This is -under any perspective you analyze it- the bravest and boldest film around the lesbianism.

The second ballast actually melted the plug, and still no response from Marineland. Enter the BBB and low and behold a complete refund for the system. I have since replaced the light fixture with a led system and it fits nicely under the hood. The hood is a good looking and functional filter hood, it is a shame that they would not stand by their product.Buyer Beware"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Inovation","review":"This band pushes the envelope and explores a new hybrid genre of music which is far from the mainstream, musically sophisticated and completely palatable to a mainstream audience (so long as you ease them into it).

An outstanding story about duty and honor that will be a real treat to anyone who was part of the war or is interested in military fiction. Navy Lt. Stuart, on assignment with the Army as a land-based \\"spotter\\" for Naval gunfire, is a rich character through whose eyes one sees the drama, intrigue, and emotional anguish experienced by those who served with honor and dinstinction in this unpopular conflict. This is remarkable and serious book -- not simply an \\"action\\" novel -- a book that will fill the reader with many of the same emotions as experienced by Lt. Stewert. Although the novel apparently was not commercially successful, Mr. Leib has done a great service to those who served by writing this book. I have not been as moved by anything I have read in the past decade, and regard my mint condition, hard-cover copy as a prize possession."},{"rating":"2","title":"A noble effort at \\"The Epic Novel of Vietnam\\"","review":"Like the protagonist, I was a Naval line officer who served first on a ship off the Vietnam coast, then attended Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape training, and then served an extended tour in-country, all at almost the same time as Lieb's LT Stuart. I was completely absorbed in this book, and it brought back a hundred memories.I thought I was part of a very narrow audience who would appreciate it. I see that all 15 prior reviewers gave it the full five stars. I salute those who got so much satisfaction out of it, and I have no quarrel with their high rating.The reason I give it only four stars is that I don't think the literary quality quite lives up that of classics like \\"Fields of Fire\\", \\"The Things They Carried\\" and \\"Dispatches\\". The plotting is a little too formulaic and the writing is all on the nose.But for anyone on the fence, do by all means read it.

It takes a large bath towel to clean up the mess.Mr. Coffee, why did you change from the old design which had a open and close toggle on the steeping basket??Mr. Coffee does have a new design out where the steeping basket is on the pitcher, not the unit, but I am hesitant to buy this version. I haven't been able to find it anywhere except through their website and a local grocery store.

So, I bought this one without doing any due diligence or giving it much thought. One problem, I've had with Mr. Coffees in the past is that the pitchers crack and eventually leak. I forgot about that when I bought this one. I assume this one will eventually crack also.The two things I really don't like about it, though, are that the pitcher is to tall and you have to manually control the brew strength. Controlling the brew strength requires that you experiment with the length of time you leave the tea floating in the water after it gets through brewing. Then you turn a control knob to dump the last bit of tea out when you think it's been in there long enough. With my old one you merely set a dial to set the desired strength.The other problem is that the pitcher is much to tall. It's difficult to get in and out of the fridge without spilling the tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitcher has cracks - only months old!","review":"Our first tea maker was a West Bend and we had it for 12 years but we started making tea so often that I decided to upgrade to a 3qt and gave the old one away. This pitcher is an acrylic type like our old one but this has started cracking at the spout where the tea drips down into the pitcher and it started within the first month. The tea is too hot and I believe that is what is causing it to crack. We have been filling it up with ice even so high as not to be able to put the lid on but it's no use as the tea comes in contact with this area first no matter what. We will be replacing it with a version we saw at Wal-Mart that has the plastic pitcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Coffee Iced Tea Maker a disappointment","review":"I've had this same iced tea maker for years until the pitcher finally broke, couldn't find a replacement pitcher, so threw the unit away also. Saw what looked to be the same setup at Amazon and purchased 2 sets. What a disappointment! The unit appeared to be lighter in weight, but the worst was the pitcher. It was cheapened beyond belief. The handle would only support the weight of iced tea if you used 2 hands and the flap that covers the spout when not in use would not stay open when pouring, allowing iced tea to spill outside the glass. I sent them back. Shame on Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"really poor product","review":"When I purchased this product, the lady at the store said \\"be sure you keep your receipt\\". That should have been my first clue. After a month now of tea leaking all over the counter even though I try carefully to seat the pitcher near the brewing part of the machine and a couple of burns when I tried to fix it while it was brewing and leaking, I have thrown the piece of junk away.

It Stinks!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pitcher will crack after first few uses","review":"I have bought 3 of these tea makers and although they make good tea, the only ones in your house that will enjoy it is your kitchen counter or the bottom of your refrigerator. The pitcher will crack after only a few uses. I originally thought that it was because I put it in the dishwasher, so the next one I bought I washed only by hand. It also cracked and flooded my produce drawer and meat drawer of my fridge. I wrote to mr coffee and they did send replacement pitchers.....They all cracked after a few uses. I later bought a tm75 because the plastic was not supposed to be so brittle and cheap. this one was designed so poorly that it still leaks everywhere. The drip from the brewing basket is supposed to drip onto the spout of the pitcher, but it doesn't line up correctly and instead drips between the pitcher and the brewer. It ruined the grout of my floor tile. Wrote to Mr Coffee and waiting for a response. Either way, DO NOT waste your money on this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price!","review":"With most items you get what you pay for and for around ~$20 I was wary.

Made of a hard plastic that cracks no matter how much you baby it. After the first one cracked ordered a new complete maker due to cost of pitcher. Only used their pitcher to make the tea, no sugar or stirring in this delicate pitcher and hand washed. Purchased a nice rubber maid pitcher for $3 and used this one for stirring and storage. Mr Coffee pitcher still cracked less than 1 year. You can not use another pitcher to make the tea due to the way unit is specifically made for their pitcher. I have emailed Mr Coffee no word from them yet due to heavy volume. This could be a great appliance with a rubber maid pitcher.

It would be great if a quality replacement pitcher was available. Then I would give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find the Original","review":"As a southerner who drinks tea with every meal and often in-between, I love the convenience of having a machine that makes the process of brewing ice tea easy. When the machine first came out, my mother was one of the first to purchase one, and we used it on an almost daily basis. So, when I moved out on my own after college, the first purchase I made was this iced tea maker; however it wasn't the same as my mother's. The new one leaked while brewing, wasn't dishwasher safe, was a pain to clean, and overall a very cheap design. The lid is flimsy and warps very easily. That is why the moment that I went into a thrift store and found the original model, I purchased that one and threw out the new one.If only Mr. Coffee would return to making the original, dishwasher-safe model that was easy to use and to clean, then maybe I could give this a five star rating; but for this model and others like it, I can only give it a two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but 1 flaw","review":"This makes the best iced tea, hands down, in ten minutes. I'm on my third maker, but 12th pitcher. They know that the pitcher is flawed, but fail to change it. The front seam, as everyone who has one knows, cracks after a while. I use super glue down the seam to extend the life of mine. It works for only so long, though. I guess if the tea maker never fails, they have to make money on the replacement pitchers. The only reason I buy new makers is that it's almost as cheap as buying replacement pitchers and they usually come with two. Shouldn't be that way. Lets get creative, Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best appliance in my house","review":"*** Do not wash the pitcher in the dishwasher, the heat will warp, and/or crack the pitcher**Other then the pitcher being cheap plastic..... we drink a ton of iced tea in my house, and make about 120 pitchers per year. After 2 years, I just purchased my second one. The first one didn't even die, the white plastic was just dirty looking because it was stained by black/fruit teas. If anyone came out with a version that used a glass pitcher, I'd buy it in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks everytime you pour","review":"I am sad to say I hate this model. While we have not had any problem while making the tea, everytime we go to pour the tea in our cups, it just does not pour smoothly, it leaks all over the place - 97% of the time. I am ready to throw in the trash as soon as I find a replacement which will hopefully be this week. At first (we have had the model now for a few months) I thought it was just operator error, but we have tried to pour very carefully or tried to figure out if there was a \\"certain\\" way to pour, but to no avail, still leaks all over the floor while filling our cups. Such a PAIN! I have owned previous models that are no longer available...sigh...they never leaked, but one of the pitchers did crack and then eventually the second pitcher cracked (after 5 years) so I thought I was \\"upgrading\\" to a new model. Boy, was I wrong. I would NOT recommend this product to ANYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the iced tea fan","review":"I have this tea maker and have used it weekly for the past year.

One time we had a nice warranty lady that sent us a replacement for free since it happened after 2 months of getting a new one.The plastic is very cheap and it breaks down there the hot tea goes in. My latest one cracked at the bottom though, which means the quality must be getting worse. Today I was told pitchers are not covered under warranty.

He purchased the exact model and amazingly it is already broken; with the same problems my old one had which had cracked right down the pour spout. Ive tried contacting the company about the pitchers before but was told they were out of them and to contact them again in 6 weeks...whats the point when with shipping it will cost the same as a new one? you cant even find the pitchers in regular stores like Wal-Mart which sold my husband the tea maker in the 1st place.

The squeeze mechanism worked smoothly. But after 20-30 squeezes, the sifter shape shifted (say THAT three times!) and the screens popped off track, making the whole thing useless. I think part of the problem is that the screens fit snugly down into the sifter, but since the metal is so thin, it is very easy to use it enough to slightly bend the outside out of shape, thus sending the screens off track. I tried and tried to pop them back in, but it just wouldn't happen---the metal had gotten oh so slightly bent and those boogars wouldn't go back in the same way.I didn't give it 1 star because the handle squeezing mechanism does work well and smoothly.Long story short...spend more for a better sifter."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good online, but....ouch!","review":"Caution: the inside edges of the sifter's handle are \\"unfinished,\\" meaning they're very sharp edges--as if the manufacturer just took a strip of tin, folded over the sides to form a handle, and didn't bother to polish or cover the edges. I almost cut my fingers just pulling the sifter out of its plastic shipping bag; I couldn't imagine using it without accidentally touching the sharp edges. And there's no way this small, cheap-looking sifter can hold 5 cups of flour.

This sifter seems to jam as others have mentioned and somehow clumps of baking soda and sugar get stuck between the screens. I find myself whacking the side of the sifter to get the clumps broken up.

It's a dark tale, but the characters are fairly believable. The acting is excellent and the mood of the film is captured very well.

They may very well be the best folk rock band going. They combine melodies from Celtic and Scandanavian sources with rhythms from all over the world, rock 'n' roll muscle and a sense of humor. This CD covers over ten years of Bil music, with different lead singers, fiddlers, etc., but it's always consistently good, no matter what the era. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Folk rock that really rocks!","review":"You wouldn't really think that something called \\"folk rock\\" could possibly be cool. Until, of course, you listen to Boiled In Lead. This band is made of obviously extremely skilled musicians who are not afraid to try any instruments nor lyrics. The result? Songs such as \\"The Microorganism\\" or \\"Rasputin\\" - I mean, can YOUR rock music make beautiful music while singing about \\"vicious flying llamas\\"?This CD is a compilation of music by Boiled In Lead - not really the best of, because all their music is superb. I recommend it for everyone who's a bit tired of the mainstream rock and wants to expand their musical horizons. Make sure you turn on your sense of humor before you pop in a Boiled in Lead cd.

After seeing him live, I thought why not get a CD and it was worth. Each song on there is of the same great class but still all different. PCIL is one great song (PCIL is the name of the band Dean Magraw used to play in) and the 7th One, which is dedicated to his nephew also gets me grooving on a kind of music that I have just now discovered. Thanks to Dean for that great album and thanks for being such a nice and also funny guy. Buy that CD, you won'rt regret it, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong defense of fantasy","review":"Tolkien's \\"Monster and the Critics\\" lecture/essay is easily the professor's most famous piece of scholarship. In it, he argues that readers should appreciate the poem Beowulf as a work of art rather than simply a historical document. Of particular note he defends the prominent role of monsters and dragons in the poem. Of course, more broadly - and of particular note for Tolkien's own Middle-Earth works - Tolkien justifies appreciating fantasy as a worthy genre of literature. The essay is somewhat academic, but still largely accessible to lay readers. It's interesting food for thought. However, of course, it does require some knowledge of the poem Beowulf as Tolkien follows the poem quite closely (it's not a general argument but rather tied closely to a debate over Beowulf)."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating, difficult to follow","review":"I found the dialog in this movie often hard to understand - the sound seemed unevenly recorded. I also had trouble following parts of the plot - i.e. how various characters related to each other, and what they wanted.

I will not recommend this flick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but beautiful","review":"I just ordered this for my sweetheart. It's beautiful and it made for a nice anytime gift.

Both editions include all the tales collected by Deloria, and give her polished English translations, her cultural notes and her introduction. The Nebraska edition includes all this plus the Lakhota language originals and Deloria's literal word-by-word translations. Those interested in the ethnological and story-telling aspects of the tales will find either edition to be a masterly rendition into English by one of the first native American anthropologists of her culture's literature. Those interested in the linguistic aspects of the Lakhota/Dakota language should get the Nebraska edition. (Since Amazon's computers apply the same rating and review to both editions, I have removed one star for the Dakota Press version.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"New edition with old orthography","review":"This is a great collection of our traditional stories and legends. My only wish is that someone would re-write the Lakota text using the standard orthography that is now used for Lakota. The orthography is used in theNew Lakota Dictionary. That writing system makes Lakota so much easier to read and pronounce."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Aint How It Is.","review":"I have years of courtroom experiences. There was a time when I had a high opinion of attorneys and judges. But now I'm convinced anyone can be a lawyer because so darn many of them are stupid. And lawyers become judges because they cant make an honest income lawyering. Over the years I have witnessed some incredible performances by lawyers and judges. I recall one judge who came down from the bench and gave the defendant a big hug just before the trial started. Other judges are clueless about the law. And some make it up as they go, issuing orders that cannot be obeyed because theyre illegal. Lawyers are terrified of judges and the harm a judge can do to their careers, so lawyers tend to take care of themselves before they worry too much about you. Feinman doesnt address any of this.

The time travel repercussions are as realistically proposed as in any sci-fi writer, if not better, yet with the clarity and honor you expect from a true Christian fiction author. Honestly, the author pushes the story and not his Christian values, yet you know under the surface those Christian values are there.I have completed the trilogy (so far a trilogy) and loved the series. I waited to write this review till after reading all three. I will suggest you read all three and you will love the first on as we meet Garrison Fitch, you will be challenged to keep up in Book 2 and I challenge you to complete book three before you judge it (it starts different, but ends true to the main character)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"Received quickly and in the condition described.

The first thing that happened, was after using up the 1 pound spool of wire, and replacing it with a new larger spool, to have the wire hang in the feed tube, and I was not able to get it dislodged. That was the first trip to a service center. The next thing that happened was that I found that, even though the amperage was high enough-in fact more than high enough, the Hobart does not like generator power. I had to re-weld a part back on a deer stand, and the welder seemed to want to spit and sputter while working off of a generator. I was able to get the job done, but that was due to the fact that I had access to a gas rig.In short this is my first-and last such product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.","review":"As a Western lover from way back, I have to say that Elmer Kelton is a very good writer of Western novels.

The characters from season one grow and develop in many ways - and some new characters spice it up! It was hard not to have a Treme' Marathon and watch them all in one night! I shure could go for some Gumbo! The deeper commentary on our nation and our society is very important - there are so many layers to all of the stories that are woven into the whole series. It is really interesting to try to discern the nuances that the different writing and directing collaborations bring to each episode. I particularly love the culinary aspects of the story line - and find them to be very realistic and true to life - this allows me to infer that the whole story must also have similar truths and be directly and accurately tied to the real New Orleans of today - unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to return post Katrina. Seeing the show absolutely makes me want to return though. Until then - I will watch again, and look forward to season three."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"Season 1 crashed and burned near the end. Was hoping the writers would do something to recover in season 2. It was a nice concept but really they didn't do justice to the reality of the aftermath of Katrina.

Disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treme just keeps gettin better","review":"I've never enjoyed a television series more... everything about Treme is amazing, but it's the music that I love the most.

There are a lot of quality people involved with its production. But the bottom line is this show is boring. There is very little plot development. There is no story. The actors are predictable and play the part of people in New Orleans, but I haven't met any characters as boring or as eccentric as the ones played in Treme. Treme is at its best an outsider's romantic view of New Orleans. At its worst it is pity television, trying to make a case for how tough New Orleans is and how vital the traditions here are. Through it all, it perpetuates the victim mentality that is pervasive in the city. I tried getting through the entire season, but gave up around the eighth episode because it was so extraordinarily boring and plotless.The only thing that works in the show is the cinematography. It is simply beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charity Case","review":"A wag at the New York Observer called Treme a \\"charity case\\" and I can't agree more. Between this pathetic excuse for a television show, junk like John From Cincinatti, and now Luck, HBO is waning fast. Looking for real entertainment on premium cable? Try Starz' Spartacus: Vengeance. Excitement, adventure, violence and sex--but most importantly, entertainment. FYI: Throne of Kings looks cheap and shoddy compared to Spartacus, and that's all you need to know about the Hobo Network."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm buying the 3rd season,too.","review":"We really enjoyed this season. When the female character who owns the bar had some bad stuff going down, I was all shouting out to the tv. I can't get enough of the music! Just thinking about it makes me want to go to Jazzfest! The music for the second line and New Orleans style funerals is just amazing! We really enjoyed the beautiful Mardi Gras Indian regalia. Just love the show, the music, makes me want to start playing the fiddle. Love that they have all the musical credits. I want to eat some beignets and go to New Orleans!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has become one of my all-time favorite shows","review":"The actors seems to BE the characters they play, because they're so well-cast. And in some cases, musicians are playing themselves. I love all aspects, especially the music, and it gives you insight into how rich and deep New Orleans culture really is. I watch as much as I can through streaming media, but it's best to get the DVD or Blu-Ray for this, because there are special features that you can activate for during the show or to browse after. In a review in The New Yorker, Emily Nussbaum said, \\"If you find jazz snobs annoying, or foodies annoying, or quietly dignified people who go 'mmm-hmm' annoying, there will be parts of Treme that you'll find annoying.\\" That only made me think \\"my kind of show!\\" And it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intersting and entertaining.","review":"Treme is a very interesting look at post Katrina New Orleans.

On both albums, the Ventures teach how to play four instrumental classics. Lead guitar, bass guitar and rhythm guitar are each seperately taught. They play each part slowly, with an instructor saying what chords to play, and then at regular speed. Each section ends with the Ventures playing the song three times, first with rhythm guitar missing, then with bass guitar missing, then with lead guitar missing. The idea behind that is that you at home will play the missing part yourself. You might actually be able to learn to play guitar from this, but it's pretty boring to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't smell like Catnip","review":"Prior to trying this product I had been using From the Field catnip spray for my three cats. They all love that product and go bonkers when I spray their toys. I tried this spray instead last time because it was less expensive. They don't react to this spray at all. When I opened the bottle and smelled it I noticed that it smells sort of minty, like it's been scented. In my experience catnip should smell sort of like overbrewed tea - not mint. I don't think this product is 'pure' catnip, or maybe I got an 'off' bottle. I wish I had spent the extra money on a higher quality product which works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"My cat, who absolutely adores dried catnip, has not been attracted to anthing I've sprayed with this spray.

Chuck Norris and David Carradine are both capable of terrific feats but they insist on making every aspect of their performance a disgrace to their names and ranks. I boo them both.

Not only do you lose free roam but the biggest thing I noticed and didn't like right away was the controls. R2 is your acceleration... What?????? Not only is it R2, but its so ridiculously uncomfortable to hold down R2 which is meant to be a trigger, not something held down continuously. Your ONLY other option is the right analog which you hold up for acceleration and down for brake/reverse.There are no more challenges outside of the actual racing part of the game... The game is slow and boring, you race, go to menu, race, go to menu, maybe buy a part for your car, race...

Need for Speed: Carbon is superior in every way and I still play it to this day. It's a shame that EA refused to green light a sequel to the best game in the series, (yes, I know many will disagree). NFS Carbon had a sense of style, a great storyline, but most importantly was quite fun and diverse. Prostreet suffers from many of the issues that bogs down many racer clones; namely, the crippling lack of tight controls and no sense of speed. The night-time races are also absent which is quite disappointing, as they really added to the atmosphere of street racing. EA has lost its way with this title, and I recommend that you explore the other titles in the series and pretend that this one doesn't exist; as it has tarnished a once great game series."},{"rating":"2","title":"need for speed: prostreet","review":"it is a good game graphics are good gameplay is good it is a little slow getting into the game but then it picks up and is good from there on out I am only about 20 percent though the game but over all I think this a good game"},{"rating":"1","title":"this game sucks","review":"please don't buy this game. i played the demo and it sucked. there will be plenty of racing games soon enough"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, don't spend too much","review":"It's a pretty typical racing game.

Gone are the races through the city streets and the chases by the police. Instead, what EA has given us is an uninspired track racing game with a racing announcer whose voice and repetitiveness begins to grate on one's nerve like fingernails on a chalkboard. I found myself bored after only an hour of play and eventually lost all interest in playing this game.Everyone makes mistakes, and EA is no exception. Hopefully they will return to what works and the next Need For Speed installment will make us all forget about the nightmare known as Need For Speed Pro Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the NFS series?","review":"Need For Speed used to be one of the greatest racing series back in the day of the PSone, I could spend hours at a time with a single track. Fast forward to 2007 and the release of NFS ProStreet, there isn't a single enjoyable moment in this game. Sure it looks kinda pretty, except for the hundreds of in-game adds everywhere.I give this game 1 star because of the fact that the game has been brought back to the outdoors and away from the cities, its such a breath of fresh air to be driving in the desert. The different modes are interesting for a few minutes until you play them for the umpteenth time, there is a constant feeling of deja vu about this game and i never felt as though this was a next generation installment of NFS.This could have been any racing game, definitely not one worthy of the Need For Speed title."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong","review":"Need for speed has been dependable for a long long time. Sure it was generic and we got one every year. This time, it took a big U turn. Every thing we liked in the past games are gone.

The feel of the game is not to the same high standard of NFS Underground 2, NFS Most Wanted and NFS Carbon and even the later NFS Shift. I think it's fun to drive around the city streets and all of that in the earlier games but the poor game play is why I'm rating this so LOW.

This was very frustrating and amonst other bugs I would not recommend anyone to play this game and put your time and effort into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"freezes like no other","review":"For about the first hour and a half of playing time the game was awesome, after that though, they game freezes after a race...which also happens to be right before the save...which means you have the race over...which doesn't work because I have figured out (from getting extremely frustrated with the game) that no matter how many times you do the race, it will freeze. So, I have now encountered about 8 races that you cannot complete because the game freezes after you finish.

Some of the scenes were rather shocking, and probably inappropriate to share in this review.

For people who enjoy plot twists at the very end of the film go ahead rent this. If you like looking at a young beautiful woman go topless for much of the film, go ahead and rent this. But if you want something interesting and compelling to watch rent a different film. The acting is so, so. The plot is actually predictable, even given the twisted ending. And the stucture of the film needs a lot of work.

The psychology never develops, and the \\"surprise ending\\" makes it clear that these characters (or their creator) are just as immature and shallow as they seem. As a result, there simply is no dramatic tension. I suppose that, in the right mood and context, on a big screen, this movie could cast a spell with its fairly good music and good production values. Still, one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a long time--the only thing worse than the movie itself is watching the deleted scenes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sensuality and nudity!! (poor)","review":"This film has no major plot line or story theme except major frontal nudity and the main character (Julie) frequently having sex and loudly moaning with many different men....boooring!! I thought it was a pornographic English movie that tries to satisfy people's sinful fetishes. Also I was really turned off by the characters constantly smoking cigarettes throughout the film. I mean come on, this isn't the 1960's when smoking is considered sexy!! Don't we all know that smoking can KILL you and makes your breath stink?

The portrayal of characters was only so-so, Rampling is not very convincing in her role and the dregs that are brought about for partners in sex scenes do not match the characters. I learned little about film enjoyment, was not thrilled at the snail's pace of the story and found the overall story and film quite boring.

I don't see what was so good about it that people are giving five stars. It's about a writer who goes to her publisher's villa to relax and work on her next novel only to find that his sexually liberated daughter is also living there. Most of the movie is just about the writer's life in this villa and how the daughter always comes home with a different man every night. It's not until about 1 hour and 20 minutes into it that it gets interesting and the end makes no sense at all. There is a lot of nudity in the unrated version, but nothing that good.

What in God's name made some idiot producer think that we want to view trailers to other films once, let alone every time the DVD is loaded? My fairly good DVD player (no problems with any other DVD I have) will not skip straight to menu with this DVD. Generously, the DVD advises us that we can Fast Forward through these crappy trailers. Most DVD players do not Fast Forward very quickly, and getting more than 5 minutes in gives me a sore finger muscle, and a blind hatred of moronic marketers.I suggest all buyers should punish such DVD producers by not buying, or protesting very loudly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and disappointing","review":"I heard this was a great erotic thriller. Maybe my expectations were too high. I found it rather dull and disappointing. I found nothing really suspenseful about the film at all. I never once thought either woman was in any danger from anyone or for what they did. The dialog and acting were good, I liked both leads, but nothing really captured me as being interesting or scary, or even that mysterious. I was disappointed at the end because I expected more. It never came. There is a load of nudity in this and some fairly bordering on hard-core sex scenes. That kept it a little more interesting. It was ok to watch once, but not something I'd watch again. I was more interested in how nice that house in France looked and how it would be nice to live there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good,,but,,,what just happened?","review":"This movie was good but what just happened?

I thought and thought about what the ending might 'mean'--my thoughts led me to this conclusion: This movie is just rambling and boring by the end. Like other reviewers, I kept waiting for the suspense to happen. Nothing. By the end I was just glad to tune out. Perhaps this film is apt to please those with wild imaginations (one person assumed Julie was a product of an incestuous affair...blah, blah). I am glad I rented it, in that I know that it was over-hyped. I also think it was well-cast. I like Charlotte Rampling-- and Ludivine Sangnier is stunning. I suppose it's worth a watch if you enjoy copious nudity--though I didn't find it particularly offensive, just ample."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly tepid ...","review":"I took a chance on this and was disappointed that I did. The problem with this film is that it promises much yet delivers very little. For the most part, it's a slow burner: there seems to be a great deal going on under the surface and it's initially enjoyable trying to guess which direction it's going. Sadly, the direction is does go in is one of tired cliche. Everything built previously is left unexplored and the last 20 minutes collapses into a dull, predictable mess. A waste of time and talent. See this one before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swimming Pool","review":"A wonderful movie in many ways.If it was not for an uneven plot, it would earn 5 stars.The stars Charlotte Rampling and Ludivine are superb, but the plot lets them down.Nevertheless, the superb acting, cinematography, score and the dramatic tension lead to a wonderful movie exprience. There is typical, but benign French type nudity & eroticism, but this is handled superbly (not like the uptight Hollywood type).Many woman would identify with the middle-aged lonliness of the star, and her longings. There is much left unsaid in the movie, that could have been developed to an even better movie.The movie is a fine introduction to American audiences of how a movie should be made.Do yourself a favor - see or buy this movie. It is in my top 25 of all movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing for most people","review":"The movie had promise, and it certainly was artistic. Ludivine is gorgeous and naturally beautiful. But the ending was just too obtuse. Who was the other girl? Was she a con artist? Was she a figment of the author's imagination? Was the other manuscript real or part of the new novel? The movie, while cinematic and unique, left me with too many questions. Did she write the sexy waiter into the murder plot of her novel? Or did he really die? It was just too strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy and Surprising","review":"I only saw this movie on DVD so I cannot say whether the scenes deleted in the theatrical release harmed or help this latest version. However, if these additional scenes caused harm I wouldn't know it. This was a fascinating, sexy, mysterious movie that kept my attention throughout. The relationship between the older and younger women was hard to predict, but compelling to watch. There is much to say about this film, but I do not want to spoil it for anyone. Even after seeing it, I am still not sure that I understand all that happened. It's the type of movie to watch again and notice things that you missed the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning, Not Waving","review":"This is a much over rated film. Two stars is probably being generous.Throughout the film, I kept waiting for something to happen. Yes, sure there was some build up in sexual tension but the key dramatic event came late in the film when a murder occurred. However, this does not seem to fit in well. It almost seemed pointless from the point of view of the plot.Overall, the acting was passable but the plot was meandering. It was a long hour and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"you put a bunch of twists and nudity and you gotSwimmingPool","review":"Swimming Pool is a thriller about a book writer (Charlotte Rampling) who goes to her friends house for a while and is at peace when her friends daughter (Ludivine Sagnier) comes and spices things up and then you get a bushel of nudity from Sagnier which is not bad by the way and the ranting and raving of Rampling. I just wanted to reach in the screen and strangle Rampling's chracter cuz she was a biatch. Rampling then gets interested in Sagnier and starts to write a book different from the detective novels she usually writes and the book is intitled Swimming Pool, hence the movie title of course. Then there is a murder and yada yada yada, Rampling gets naked and it was horrifying and the end twist was lame. IT came off to me as one of those dirty movies that play late at night on digital cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evanescencing of Sexual Security","review":"\\"Swimming Pool\\" is a bold and daring film. Not for the prudish viewer, the film is a complex look and sexuality and identity. However, this is not a genre film. The film is something of a phsycho-drama, something of an erotic narrative. From cinematography to acting, the production quality was absolutely first rate. Above all, though, the film was intelligent, provocative, and insightful. The plot works more on the intellect of the viewer than the characters... Additionally, the psychology of the film, though socially controversial, hits to the heart of what it is to be a woman subject to time as a writer struggles to cohere the various desideratum of a fragmented female identities. Most poignantly, the film forwards the problem of sexuality versus intellectual identity and ellucidates the anxiety born of wanting both equally. A must see for anyone, male or female, interested in a thrilling and provocative examination of sex, society, and maturing identity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I only rented this!!!","review":"I'm not sure if this the work of a David Lynch wannabe or what have you.

The way I see it, if it takes you hours to come up with a reasonable explanation of a movie, it isn't very good. This movie was far to unclear to be understood and used nudity in a totally useless way.

Didn't really think this film had anything to offer in ways of originality. It was slow movie with no high points other than the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rampling fan.","review":"I am a huge Charlotte Rampling fan so i liked this movie because of her. It's very slow paced. There are some sex scenes and nudity but nothing special. What i loved was watching Rampling and her reactions toward this annoying bubbly young girl who kept interrupting her writings during the day and disturbing her beauty sleep by bumpin'-n-grindin' every night with a diferent guy , old man, young boy, middle aged man, older man and basicaly any male who came to her door.This movie is a little sexy with a bit of mystery, some sex and nudity, taking place in beautiful surroundings and not violent or gross at all. It's a very pleasant movie to watch and what it does in the end is make you think...... about youth, aging, life, who you are, etc.Rampling's great so i bought it, but if she wasn't in it i probably wouldnt've even given it a second thought.Thank you for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swimming Pool Drowns in Mediocrity","review":"The only thing I can think of that would be a larger waste of time than watching this stunningly boring, simply pedestrian piece of haughty, psuedo-intellectual Eurotrash would be settling down in front of the tube for seventy three minutes of static. There were far too few sexual encounters to balance the mind numbing \\"follow Sarah down the hall, follow Sarah into the kitchen, follow Sarah into the bedroom\\" camera work and during the steamiest of them, the only emotion I could muster was an overwhelming desire to get up and make myself a ham sandwich.This film would be a lot more interesting if it were cut down to several still photographs of the young French beauty, Ludivine Sagnier, sunbathing in the nude and would have saved the film's financial backers the entire cost of production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I found the movie to be painfully slow and boring, I actually fell asleep. Ludivine Sagnier is a beautiful young woman, but that isn't enough to carry this one. The two primary characters are so extreme and unbelievable, it really is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things that make you go Hmmm, after 103 minutes.","review":"I think this movie is more straight forward than people are making it out to be. Sagnier's character (Julie) was really one of the publisher's daughters not just a character in a new novel or a delusion. There are too many scenes that make me think so (decide for yourself). I have to admit the movie left me with the feeling of, what the hell. I didn't find myself thinking much while watching it (more of a voyeuristic experience), but I did find myself thinking about it a lot afterwards and I'm still not quite sure.If you like movies that make you ponder what you've just seen and It won't bother you to know that you may never know the answers to your questions. Then this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dive in!","review":"A writer goes on retreat in France for some inspiration & finds her publisher's daughter who has a new man in bed with her every night. However, the publisher's daughter & the writer find themselves in a mystery of their own"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, would-be psychological thriller.","review":"Swimming pool is a much hyped film that is reputed to be both original and enigmatic. The truth is, the film is neither original nor enigmatic, instead it is passable and definitely not captivating. Despite starting promisingly with an assured performance by Charlotte Rampling and an indeed atmospheric mood, the film goes down hill after twenty minutes or so as director Francois Ozone indulges in long takes and lethargic pacing while keeping the non-existent mystery at bay. So fans of Rampling, indeed give it a watch, her performance is commendable, but that is the only thing that is commendable about this pretentious and meandering thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, classy thriller","review":"Not only is this thriller mesmerizing and erotic, but I found it intensely human, thanks to the acting of Charlotte Rampling. As the centerpiece and life-force of the film, she puts an at once compassionate but also desperate face on the events that unfold around her.The film is wonderfully shot and well edited. The ending will have you and your friends talking for quite a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shameful reviewers are skewing this film for sins of the distributors.","review":"Swimming pool is a startling mystery thriller from Franois Ozon. It's not the best film ever, but it has a lot of merits. I found it delightful.What I find less than delightful are the nitwits who come here to complain about something that has nothing to do with this really, really good film. Apparently (I streamed it from Netflix, before Amazon videos debuted) the DVD has some trailers these people didn't care to watch. As much as I commiserate, this is not the place to voice those grievances.It was lazy of them not to email the distributor with their complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"mysterious","review":"Unfortunately as I watched this movie, I was too tired. As a result, the subtlety and understatement of the film were lost on me. Nevertheless I can always appreciate a great film when I see one. The perfect picture of repression, tension and sexual jealousy and guilt as embodied by the eminently talented Charlotte Rampling. Ludivine Sagnier, whom I had only seen before in 8 Women, was convincing in her role as a young temptress, who brings out a voyeuristic, more daring and more creative Rampling, who portrays a writer who has fallen into a kind of rut of writing the same things again and again. She is pulled more and more into a world of intrigue that the younger woman drags her into. I found myself spellbound when I was actually awake, but because it was arresting and subtly suspenseful, it is most definitely something I will watch again. The unfolding story and its conclusion leave you with more questions than answers, but the journey is the reward here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"When the movie ended with the much anticipated \\"twist\\" - you're left so confused you have to read reviews like this to make heads or tails of the whole thing.

I still don't like it and my feelings can be pretty much summed up above in my review title. I found out from another Amazon reader that the writer-director Francis Ozon is actually an out-of-the-closet gay male. I was surprised because I felt his film screamed \\"heterosexual male wet dream\\". I honestly didn't find much in this film that was homo-erotic. Did I miss something? I suppose there may have been some sexual tension between Rampling & the actress who played the daughter. And of course the filmmakers even go so far as to equate themselves with \\"straight porn\\" by making the male at the center of the film an unattractive mess. I may have to give this film another chance but it won't be any time soon. And I frankly don't know why Ms. Rampling receives so much critical acclaim. I've always found her acting wanting. But that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I was really excited to see this DVD after reading all the praise it got.

I thought that there could have been much more done with the actors and gorgeous setting the director/writer had to work with. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wet T-Shirt Film","review":"This is a wet T-Shirt film, ie the only reason to see it is the female nudity. The plot is ridiculess, even laughable. Photography and editing is home movie quality. The female lead seems talented, and lovely. A rewrite into a story of a teen with a father complex would be workable.Note: Father Complex: a teen raised without her real father and trading sex for the hope of love from older men as father substitutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swimming Fool(new name)","review":"The box fools you into thinking that there is a lot of erotica going on.

Dont be a Swimming Fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"France is getting a bill for the time I lost watching this!","review":"If this were an American or British film made by an American or British director it would have been panned. Instead it is getting kudos? If I were French I would be insulted. The bar is apparently much lower for the many French directors. Much better stuff has come from there. The Red, White and Blue trilogy were great! It's the same feeling I had after watching Brotherhood of the Wolf. Although BOTW was not bad, it was not worth all of the praise heaped upon it. Swimming Pool was terrible! Sure there were a few well composed shots, but the movie itself was boring and pointless and at times very pretentious. Unless you are the type who goes for \\"snob appeal\\" stay away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expect","review":"Another example of a European \\"Art\\" film that shows a half way decent looking teen age girl in the buff and her sex life.

It has a twist all right. Throughout the movie you see these two women interacting, often in ways that make you wonder about their motives. What happened in their past to make them this way? Why are they responding to each other the way they do? Where will this take them and what will be the outcome? All the makings of a great suspense movie. Except none of the questions are every answered. I feel like I read the Lady and the Tiger except at the end I chose the door and it said \\"write your own ending.\\" Very unsatisfying.

The closure is a magnetic button, not velcro, as some others have pointed out. Velcro would make it easier to close, and the button on the flap could scratch the camera if you are not careful, but it is much less likely to scratch than a zippered case.

Each one lasted about a year, then the belt loop started to tear. I wore it on my belt almost every day - so I am a heavy user but I expected it to last longer. The 890IS was a little too long for the PSC-55, but otherwise fit well (and snug.)In addition to the belt-loop wear, the side seam also started splitting (about 2\\") on the one I just threw away.I guess $[...] bucks for the case is not too much, but plan on spending about $[...] each year to replace it.I just ordered and received a Lowepro case that fits my 890IS very well with a pouch for SD cards and spare battery!

It is listed as compatible, however, the closure flap will not even fit around the top of the camera. Maybe the dimensions of the case vary from different manufacturing runs so some find its 'fits' - the case I got does not fit the camera. The sides are tight, like a glove as some have said, the issue is with the top flap - it does not close. Also, the metal on the flap closure could possible scratch the screen. Great case, just not for the SD870. I'd rate it at a 4 to 5 if it fit! Amazon, as usual is very good at handling this sort of problem - one of the main reasons I shop with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits well","review":"I have a Canon SD500. This case fits well and looks good. I like to keep things simple and fit as much as possible, and this one works. The leather is soft and the inside is soft too to keep the camera from getting scratched. Good price from Amazon. It might be a little bit soft that it doesn't keep its shape very well, but with the camera in, it's not a problem. I just wish they did something to attach the camera strap to the case so I don't lose it. When I tried to tie the longer strap that came with the camera, it didn't work and it looked very ackward. Tried with the leather strap that came with the carema, it's not even appliable. In general, this is the best case for my camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SMALL!!","review":"Product desciption said it would fit my camera (Canon SD950), however the case was too tight, the flap wouldn't even close.

It takes a little more effort to snap it shut, but overall, it's a good camera case and will protect my camera from scratches and dents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case, but needs a side pocket","review":"I bought one of these for my Canon SD-800 and can recommend it. For many years now, I've carried Canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the Canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose. My only criticism of the Canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media. I was hoping that with the tiny size of SD cards Canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases, but they haven't. On the plus side, the case retains the superior leather construction, uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of Velcro or a snap, and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body. The package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera. Incidentally, the SD-800 is well matched to the case, fitting quite securely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case","review":"The case was a perfect fit for my SD630. It didn't have that puffiness near the silver canon brand label on the top, like some pictures showed. The only thing was that it was a snap on cover, which is not bad, but you have to take a couple extra seconds if you want to make sure it snaps close. It would have been nice if it were the magnetic close top. But it's definitely a great case for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This product came in a timely matter, in excellent condition.

Frustrating! But this is not the camera case's fault!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Leather Camera Case","review":"This leather camera case is great for the Cannon compact cameras. I received the camera case for Christmas and then I ordered this case. The camera fits perfectly inside and comes with a matching strap.

So far, it has done the job. My only concern is the magnet closure used on the flap. I am always leery of magnets as they can demagnetize credit cards, etc. Not that that has happened, but that concern is always in my head when I put the case near other things. That is the only reason I did not give the case 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space saving case","review":"I like to carry my Canon Digital Elph in my pocket and this case adds protection without bulk.

Fits my Canon PowerShot SD750 well. The only thing I would change is the \\"poofiness\\" of the case itself. It would be cool if the leather looked tighter and not as poofy. For example, the metal emblem on the flap makes the rest of the leather dimple in around the logo. Other than that, the case looks ok and works as promised.Edit 1/18/11: This case has a leathery strap that began to split apart after several months of use. The strap was made of 2 or 3 layers of cloth and leather glued or sewed together but it fell apart and looked pretty ugly. I had to cut off the excess layers to dwindle it down to one thicker layer.

Has some thick padding on the interior which is a pro and a con. It provides nice protection, but gives way to an overall thicker case.

My telescoping mechanism got all scratched up and stuck because the case let in some sand or something, and I had to take the camera apart on three occasions to clean it and get it working again.The steel logo on the front is annoying. It has sharp corners and scratches things, so I can't put the camera in the same pocket as my phone.

Also to add-this movie is what a real indi film is...a really great-well acted story that just happened to be shot on a low budget. It doesn't need be anything other than what it just is-a cool movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parker Posey is a True Diva","review":"A very witty urban comedy, this movie follows the misadventures of Mary. As an organizer of parties at her place, Mary refuses to work a real job, however after the law steps into the picture, mary is forced to choose a more stable, respectable career. With the help of her godmother, Mary the club-hopper becomes Mary the librarian, and through this career she discovers talents she never had before. Parker Posey is perfect as Mary, and her wit and attitude are the true gem of this film. Directed by Daisy Von Schulenberg (\\"Madeline\\") \\"Party Girl\\" also stars Guillermo Diaz and Schulenberg's real-life mother as Mary's godmother. If you loved \\"Clueless\\" you'll love \\"Party Girl\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Party, Party,","review":"I really love this movie. It is very hilarious, and has a lot of on-liners, that never go old. I don't remember this movie from 1995, but that's alright.

I'd recommend this to any college student who is struggling to get a degree, and prepare for the future. As well as any Parker Posey fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and balanced reporting: patient and doc collaborate","review":"This book is a very good example of how patient and doctor can and must collaborate; in this case on a book about a specific disorder, but in a bigger sense, too: patients and doctors must learn to work together to solve complex, tricky medical conditions caused by autoimmunity, to come up with customized treatment packages which enhance quality of life without threatening it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Circle","review":"Definitely worth owning.

It's unfortunate that the American Homebrewers Association essentially uses the procedes from this magazine to fund extravagant trips for the staff to the many homebrew competitions and conventions held each year.

This character is poorly drawn by a less than talented writer. The protagonist blames his mother for his woes, and does so for half the book. The inner world of these characters, especially Ichiro's, the protagonist, is so poorly wrought, that at times I almost could not finish the book. This is a preachy book in which the characters only exists so that the author can intrude, get on his soapbox, and yell at the reader about the plight of the Japanese-American. This authorial intrusion is not for the modern reader. In one aspect I believe the book important because it does expose the consequences of the horrible treatment undergone by J-Americans, on the other hand this is not good \\"literature.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh ...","review":"This book stinks, the plot is trivial, the characters suck, and the chapters go on and on and on and on and on about nothing, nothing at all.

The fact that it's similar to the article in the reader, \\" READER ACROSS AMERICA CULTURES.\\" He (Ichiro) was a character who felt like a coward because he didn't believe in himself. He did not know weather he was Americanized or Asianized because he did not join the War and felt like he wasn't a part of any culture. His mother was proud of him because he didn't jion the war, but he felt like he could do something about it, for his country and for himself. SO the novle is based on an indivisual guy with his own opinion about the things that happens around him and why he didn;t joint the war. I give this novel four stars and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No...just no","review":"Very poorly written, Okada attempts to write about something that he did not even experience himself and greatly fails.

This beautiful form is broken down, move by move, with thorough explanations of the individual applications as well as training tips to improve the student's technique. With easy to understand instructions in both English and Chinese, the training is easily accessible, even to those new to Chinese martial arts.Martial arts masters of this caliber are rare (and Wudang masters, rarer still).

Expecting to find out more about his background and family, because we are all the victims or survivors of our past, I learned nothing.

The difference between the sound volume of the narration and the music is so great that you can't hear the narration, even if you try to change the volume between narration and music - the music cuts in and out of the narration so quickly and often that this documentary is worthless in terms of trying to learn anything about GH.

It is a history not taught in schools but should be. Keven Costner does a wonderful job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and heart-breaking...","review":"This most certainly IS NOT a romantic view of Native American history. Whoever thinks that chose either to not watch the entire series, or chooses not to see the truth about what is the greatest tragedy in this country's history. It's a shame more people today don't look upon this long-standing horrific aspect of our history more seriously; for the consequences have been too great and are still in effect today...a shame, in my opinion. I most certainly agree that more \\"anthropological\\"-type media should be made to understand and appreciate so many cultures; for they are interesting at the very least. Nevertheless, that is not the intent here...it's to educate us all on what is our very own \\"American Holocaust\\" and its legacy. Hopefully, it would prompt one to take some sort of action...whether it be simply to spark an interest to read and become more educated on this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well intentioned, to the point of sanctamonius.","review":"If we've heard too much of the white man's slant on the history of Native Americans, this well-intentioned, but hopelessly biased documentary will make up the difference.

Buy or rent \\"The Way West\\" or \\"The West\\" for a more balanced, and much better done, perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as titled","review":"I bought this in the expectation that it would cover the People of the \\"New World\\" as they existed before Columbus. Instead, it was basically a recap of the cruelty of the Europeans to the native populations viewed through the standards and sensibilities of today. I read 'Bury My Heary at Wounded Knee' and 'The Chronicle of the American Indian's Complaint' 30 odd years ago and being part Cherokee there was nothing new in the DVDs. Correction, there were many new things, most of which didn't happen. A good example is the DVD version of the conquering of the Aztec (Actually they were called Mexica but the DVD got that wrong as well). Read 'Conquest' by Hugh Thomas for the best book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Native Americans","review":"This film evoked in me a great deal of emotion about the American Indians, and more especially about how badly they'd been treated by our forefathers, their European invaders. I've learnt a great deal that I didn't know from watching and listening to the commentary. My only criticism (and it's only a small one) is that I heard little mention of some of the more recent tribes including the Comanches, and I always thought that they would have featured rather prominently, however that's only my own opinion. Some of the scenery shots were absolutely brilliant as was the computer generated scenes. All in all, a very enjoyable film, full of information, and lasting over eight hours. Well worth buying, and re-watching time and time again. A must for anyone even remotely interested in The Native American culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required viewing by all, so called, Americans.","review":"I was drawn in, at first, by the title and after a few minutes of viewing the second installment (as I was viewing it on the Discovery Times channel marathon;2-19-05) I devoted the rest of the day to it. So enraptured I was, I inevitably found myself here ordering this series on DVD.The last episode is still playing as I write and I find myself (a 40+ year old man) literally in tears.

The Indians WERE people and this means that they didn't have a utopian society. Aztec's scarified people, Indians torched prisoners. They were not perfect. Not savages but not the noble savage that this documentary describes.

The Tom Yum is a bit pungent (whatever is in the salt has quite a smell to it) but it mixes in beautifully. I could see the flavoring might not be for everyone, though.I've found that rinsing the noodles as per instructions does very little. I can separate them out just as well with my fingers. I've also found microwaving is not required. You can get a nice soup by heating it ramen style. Simply pour hot water in and let sit for about 5 minutes. This works great for me as in the office I have hot water closer to my desk than the microwave, so if I'm busy I can quickly grab a spot to eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I've tried several Annie Chun's noodle varieties and I must say ALL have been very disappointing.

I mean, the NYSTCE publishes sample exams and the authors of this book don't even try to copy the format of the essay question! The review of material will not help much on the exam either, though like I said, it's pretty good.Fortunately, there's a great book out there which focusses completely on how to pass the exam, which I was lucky enough to by in addition. The Kaplan \\"NYSTCE: Complete Preparation for the LAST & ATS-W\\" is what you need if you want to prepare for the exam.As for the LAST, it's mostly reading comprehension.

The 2 big flaws most people seem to bring up are:1. Contradicts the first movie2. Care Bears grow up too fast.The growing up too fast never really bothered me as one can say it's just because their magical. I was really upset at first about the contradiction to the first movie but taken by itself it has a very good story. I thought the songs were really awesome, especially \\"The Fight Song\\". The lamest moment in the movie I thought was the part about the moose - but hey no movie is perfect. Taken as a whole I think the story the characters, especially Darkheart, and the awesome songs outweigh the flaws. And not to forget of course it teaches good morals. Excellent to teach kids about caring and maybe not too bad for adults either - of which I am one of them. Five stars for an excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, educational and entertaining children's movie","review":"When I was little, I could watch this movie over and over without ever getting tired of it. Today, I still think it's a great movie to teach children values(not in a very subtle way, but who cares?) such as the importance of caring for other people and that being the best at everything is not so crucial as long as you stay true to yourself.

The fact they would adpopt and raise such a diverse family makes them great step parents. It is a shame this concept was dumped five episodes into the series.There is some good music too. There is a very tender scene set to the song \\"Forever Young\\". I really enjoyed this movie. I consider itone of the best movies of The Care Bears genre.I would recommend this for anyone of any age. Seeing the Care Bears as cubs and theCare Cousins as babies and then growing up is one of the things that makes this movie special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then the first one","review":"This movie, although it contradicts with the plot of the first movie, is a cute loveable movie. It starts with the first bear, True Heart, and cousin, Noble Heart, with the rest of the bears and cousins when they are cubs. It goes on to tell the story of three kids at summer camp, one who becomes the best athlete at camp in return for helping Dark Heart, the bad guy, capture all the care bears.

It is, of course, geared towards little kids, but the relationship between the human villian-Dark Heart-and the starring human female-Cristy-is sweet and enjoyable. The Care Bears are cute and it teaches little kids about friendship and caring. I also really like one of the songs in this movie. I can't remember the title of it, but my friends and I always clap along to it. This is a very fun movie with a cool bad guy, but it shouldn't scare little kids!

I watched it with them the first time, and was surprised that there was so much emphasis on \\"baddies\\" and \\"evil\\". I don't think that this theme is appropriate for kids this age, even if the baddie turns good in the end. I would much rather have them watch \\"rescue heroes\\" where the bad is not influenced so much. This feeling also goes for the first movie and for the videos that come with the bears. My 3 y.o. won't watch Share Bear's movie as it's too scary and there's a \\"monster\\" in it. Even without this problem, the stories are uninteresting and I think the bears loose a lot of their cuteness factor when they start talking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could care less","review":"This movie stinks like 13 year pizza with giant green molds coming out of it. Don't belive the title. It's the same gereration only a different back story. The animation is wooden & corny.

It is a good buy anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% ADDICTIVE MUSIC !","review":"I've beeng listening to Gogol Bordello for 2 weeks and I can't stop listening to their music, I watched the Non-Stop video 2 times already.

Those are two COMPLETELY different sizes. My son looks like pee wee herman in this costume. I called the company and the only way they will refund my money for the full amount is to exchange it for a different product on their website. Otherwise you only get back half of what you paid for.

That said, I bought a size 4-6x, based on the advice in other reviews. This is waaaay to small. I will need to return it. The jumpsuit/costume is exactly the right length for his height, but it is tight all over. And because the fabric is so flimsy, my son would need to wear street clothes under it, which would make it even tighter. Also, the ears hat is so small the ties wouldn't reach under his chin! It looked ridiculous...Like it was made for a doll. I am not happy with this costume and I will be returning it right away. I advise not even trying it.

My son is an average sized 4 year old, he wears size 5 clothes and we had to squeeze him into the 4-6 when he wore a layer of warm clothes underneath and his pants stuck out the bottom, the ears were similarly small.

There are nice details with the glitter on the tie and 'buttons' on the pants. Although this says it is sized S 4-6x, I would guess it is much closer to a size 3T or 4T. My daughter wears a 6 and there is no way she would ever have been able to get into this costume. My son, who wore it, is a solid 4T and it JUST fit him.

The USB plug and play fucntionality is also another good quality.

However they did not reply when I asked if the next replacement could be expected to work, and that the problem I was reporting was not a common unresolved issue. Obviously they did not have test data to show that these watches perform as specified. I usually cannot get a Heart rate reading when exercising, only if not moving and not sweating.

The 1981 biography offers an in-depth and up-close look at Thackeray's world, including many familiar faces such as Tennyson, Dickens, Carlyle, Ruskin, George Eliot, Charlotte Bronte, Charles Darwin, Virginia Woolf (Anne's niece), and even an eyewitness account of Chopin's last days in Paris.

I was taking pictures with it one morning and then hours later went to turn it on and nothing.Even before that I was kind of upset with myself for giving in and buying it because for the price, it's not really great quality. The noise is far above what is acceptable to me. I understand most cameras will have noise troubles in low light settings, but even in bright sunlight my pictures were not crisp.One feature I loved was the relatively sharp and clear and large-sized videos (though unfortunately the large viewing size also means a large file size).Unfortunately since my camera killed itself inexplicably after so short a time (and conveniently right after the warranty ran out) I cannot say I was pleased.I've much preferred the Sony cameras I have used and I love my Nikon SLR.

The Lumix on the other hand has excellent stabilization; no need for a tripod; but the colors appear fake and noisy without a flash.

You can keep thinking places like Greenup County are backwards and you can even move away from here as fast as you can as some mentioned but some of us moved away and came back. Life here has quality in comparison to the heartless cities of this country.And just for those who think such things are important, you can find the childhood home of one of the most respected persons of high culture just a stone's throw from GC.

The book should have been more on the cheerleaders outstanding wins in Florida. After all they have won the NATIONALS 9 times now. If Mr. McElroy really wanted to focus on how they won so many times he did a very poor job. As to Greenup Co.it does have farm land ,hollows, and probably a few junk cars,but it is quite a nice place to live. That was the worst part of the book. I don't believe he really took the time to look at our county.

Instead it examines nothing less than our society itself by examining issues such as class, race, gender, individualism, competition, success, and how each of these influence and inform our views of the others. It also brings us along as fans and participants, rooting for our side in a kind of competition rarely noted outside its circle of participants. For readers who have only flipped through the cheerleading competitions on ESPN2, appearing betweeen skinny rowboats and frisbee dogs, this book will definitely bring an appreciation to the sport. The amount of athleticism, determination, and talent required of these young women is strikingly portrayed.

Even though I was lucky enough not to have my personal life revealed many of my friends have suffered. I know that controversy sells but he could've found a much more constructive way to use it. I could understand if he had just mentioned things that dealt with Greenup Cheerleading itself but instead he focused to much on their personal lives. I know to someone, somewhere else, this may seem like a good book but when live here and see all the things that were wrong such as; names of cities, Kentucky's capital and many other facts, there's no way you could say that this was a good book. I know some personal things did affect the squad and I'm glad that some truth did come out of this. Cheerleading is a serious sport and there are lots of people who's lives revolve around it.

It says in the book: 'One house, ten contestants, thirty cameras, forty microphones, one murder...and no evidence' - this is the plot. The show invents an artificial world in a reality TV show. The truth often is bent and Ben Elton narrates this very thrilling and obscure. I enjoyed reading \\"Dead Famous\\", because it is a nice book written in colloquial English. Reality TV is a current phenomenon and in this book the plot is genuine.So everyone interested in today's TV confusion should read this honest novel by Ben Elton!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Death in the fast lane","review":"Ben Elton writes as he performs - 100 miles an hour with few stops for breath. Warning - do not start reading this unless you have time to finish it in one sitting. Once you have started you will not stop. The old formula of the whodunnit story bringing together a group of people under one roof is brilliantly translated into a 'Big Brother' house. The whole thing is televised by Peeping Tom Productions, including the murder.The inmates are repulsive in every way. Only the physically repulsive anarchist Woggle is a likeable character although he also has his dark side. Best of all is the portrayal of the cynicism of reality TV.

The design of the boombox is super cute and very durable. I take mine to work, on picnics and anywhere else I need some music and Hello Kitty. I get many compliments and questions, so it makes for a great conversation piece.I have a young daughter that uses it for her read-along storybooks and language CDs, so it certainly can be of educational use. I use it with my iPod so I am never without music. The carrying strap is very durable. The boombox has withstood some minor bumps nicely, but I would not suggest buying it for children under 4 or those that tend to be rough with their toys.

People like to hate on Evoke, which is actually a personal favorite of mine, but I really feel that this is the album he put the least effort and 'love' into and the female vocalist (also on Cannibal Anthem) is a bit over-the-top in the cheesy goth department. Evoke may be a bit sweet and delicate, but at least it has a personality. Body Census is the bland, idiot child of the Wumpscut family. The songs My Dear Ghoul and Adonai My Lord are good, but every other track is just blah.All my other friends that like Wumpscut agree with me on this one.If you are new to Wumpscut, please, DO NOT start with this album.I love every other album equally, but I think good starting points would be Wreath of Barbs, Eevil Young Flesh or Cannibal Anthem."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the biggest wastes of time ever!","review":"I have no idea why they made this movie.

Perhaps the director will be better in a few more projects. I get the sense that Jeffory can act but it was not in the script.

Maybe they were dimwitted people who like fast and furious movies, flashy fast cars, weak story, acting and characters, and extremely unrealistic.

Look, I can't fault the movie itself or the acting, only the trailers and the expectations they set - and the trailers were false advertising. There is certainly a place for this movie.

The story is dull, the main character could have been interesting but he ends up being boring.

The only exciting parts of this movie are the few violent scenes which in my opinion are extremely gruesome and completely over the top much like what happens in a Tarentino film. The difference is here, the scenes don't really even fit, it's as if it just happens randomly.I left this movie with nothing, no feeling or anything.The ending of this movie is brutal.

I guess she's just attracted to those antisocial personality disorder types...The acting was fantastic: I'm a huge fan of Gosling, and his emotional range and depth in this movie was as impressive as ever.

Without going into details about the plot or characters, I will simply say that this film struck me like a thunderbolt with its eerily beautiful camera work, subtly genius performances, and profound explorations of human nature and the perils of loving someone. I had never seen Gosling in anything else and his performance was as close to perfection as I've ever seen from a young actor. Do yourself a favor - just buy this bad boy, put it on, and immerse yourself in it. You will thank me when the credits roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best films of the year","review":"As one of the top five films of 2011, and with its fantastic soundtrack and strong visuals, Drive should be eagerly anticipated on blu-ray. If you are blind-buying this, you should know two things: First, Drive is no Fast/Furious spin-off. That much was obvious when its Danish director won Best Director at Cannes. Car chases and stunts take a back seat to great acting by Ryan Gosling (Blue Valentine, Crazy Stupid Love), Carey Mulligan (An Education, Pride & Prejudice) and Al Brooks (Broadcast News, The Simpsons). Second, the film is at times dark, moody and bloody. The violence is not overly gratuitous, compared to many R-rated films, but may shock some viewers who are watching this because they liked The Notebook. I strongly suggest avoiding the trailers (which reveal too much plot) and instead get a feel for the film by listening to its soundtrack on YouTube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleck","review":"I really don't understand the hype behind this movie.

It's slow, sludgy and it's cleverly disguised as an action film when in reality it's a romance story. No \\"Whiteline Fever\\" scenes, no \\"Live and Die in L.A.\\" commitment to the chase ... even Fast and Furious had better action behind the wheel!

My wife and I picked this because the previews made it look like an innocent enough action movie about a guy who drives for a living and gets mixed up in something that would lead to an action-packed save the day plot. Instead, we're confronted with pointless filth from start to finish. Feel like we were mislead on this one. This is one of the darkest movies I can remember seeing. Frankly, if you like watching people's heads blown off, stomped off with a boot, etc. this is the movie for you. If you're repelled by that kind of thing do not watch it.

If it had been sold as a drama, I wouldn't have been so disappointed because I would have skipped it. Almost no plot, useless dialogue and so many slo-mo shots trying to look like an art film that real art films are probably just as disgusted as I was. I paid to rent it and I feel seriously ripped off. Skip it even if someone offers it to you for free because your time is worth more than that....UNLESS you simply want to look at Ryan Gosling.

BUT ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY IS CRAP!!","review":"I hate it when people 1 star review things before their releases but this is meant as a warning! Ultraviolet digital copy is virtually unusable junk that is now being packaged with a lot of movies. The Ultraviolet Digital Copy doesn't work with iTunes it only works with a streaming service through Flixster and when I say \\"works\\", I mean it can only be used with a streaming service through Flixster that doesn't even work.

Just one chase scene and a really depressing story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A stinker","review":"From the trailer I thought this would an \\"action\\" movie with thrilling car chases, etc, etc.Yes, there is one big car chase scene. BUT most of the rest of the movie is mostly plodding long slow scenes of a very sullen Mr. Gosling.Then there are a few very graphic, gross, bloody, violent beatings, murders, and worse! Yuck!Yes Gosling has made some good movies. This is not one. Any talent is completely hidden.In case you can't stand it to the end, and I sure wish I had had the good sense to stop before...All the lead players and several of minors and extras DIE. Bloody horrible deaths.Except it seems that somehow the Driver lives and the Girl lives. Apart. No they don't even have a sex scene.One kissing session which is just a diversion while Driver waits to make his move on Killer/Assasin #4 or was it #5. Who cares.Let me say it again. This movie SUCKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to Love this film. But it was awful.","review":"Drive was a big disappointmentfor me. I was looking forward in seeing this movie ever since I viewed the kick ass trailer. But the movie was flat and boring. If you think you are going to see a action film think again. The movie is slow and uneventful. They try and turn this into a love story but the two characters feel unconnected to each other. Trust me I love films that are like nothing you have ever seen and I give them credit for trying something different but it just did not work. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Depiction For Our Titillating Shallow Society","review":"An ugly pointless, zombie acted, boring movie filled with ultra violence and long gaps of literal silence.I would remind readers that as time goes on, more reviews are being seeded by those who stand to benefit.Always read the critical one and two star reviews first, then decide if what they say is important to you.Ironically I saw this movie while my tire was being repaired and walked out toward the end, as there was nothing good, just cheap violence. Low life, untalented script writers are just so uninteresting and repulsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst movie of 2011","review":"I love movies and have never walked out on one in my life, but I came very close during this show. The plot made no sense, Ryan Gosling acted like a mannequin and the violence was too extreme. My wife also thought it was the worst movie of the year and she likes Ryan. I guess I \\"didn't get it\\" but what was there to get? I thought the marketing was deceitful, making you think you were going to see an action movie, but instead some \\"Film Noir\\". Whatever that means. I know I'm swimming upstream here with this review but I couldn't in good conscience not say something and have someone buy this thing without knowing how I felt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"I despise this movie, it was so boring, so needlessly gory. This whole movie was just a bore, and it was very aggravating. I wanted to walk out, but I didn't want to make the person I was with have to suffer through it alone. I would highly discourage watching this movie, unless you enjoy seeing \\"actors\\" stare at a camera for minutes at a time, with horrible background music playing, and then suddenly having blood splattering everywhere, and then having people stare at the camera again not saying anything until the next violent scene starts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie i have seen in at least the last decade.","review":"To remember a movie this bad, you would have to go back to Con Air staring Nicolas Cage.There were so many ackward silences, and weird cinematics...

I would rather have watched 2 hours of CSPAN looking an a empty conference room...You would not want to be friends with anyone who liked this movie as there would be something seriously wrong with them.If i could, i would banish the producer, the writer, etc.. everyone involved in this movie from ever releasing another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictiable","review":"I'm not impressed because this movie was very predictable.

It has NO PLOT, it has 80's disco music that plays as the sound track every 5 minutes! There is almost no dialog and honestly, when there is it almost reminds you of people talking in slow motion..words spoken seem to last forever just to say one sentence. My fiance and I love movies but this was a serious FAIL. Again, hardly worth it, even if it is free. Don't believe me and rent it but how someone here can muster up any positive words about this movie AND come close to being worthy for any award is beyond me. How bad is it really? My first movie review is this very review and I only decided to review because of how terrible it was. It actually makes me angry I wasted about 2hrs of my life when I think about it. I had to do something to let everyone know any positive review is pure insanity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.

It's Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible.","review":"not worth the $3 to rent. 3/4 of the movie is a close up profile view of ryan gosling's face while he's in his car. music sucks, AND only 1 chase scene. not worth 2 hours of your time. the little blonde chick is very hot though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diapointing!","review":"Well, um, the story itself was decent. Gosling and Mulligan can act, but were'nt allowed to Because the film must have had an extreamely low budget!! The movie sometimes awkward, very long and drawn out. Very boring. With a better Director and better budget (god i hope they didnt spend alot on it!!!) and some tweeks with the writeing it could have been alot better of a movie.The sound track Sucked, sounded like 70's music really Lousey. The driveing scenes were decent. I was just very disapointed after seeing the trailer then the movie. I really would not recomend this movie to anyone, it was very dissapointing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily one of the worst movies ever","review":"This is easily one of the worst and most disgusting movies that I have ever seen in my life.

If you're thinking about watching this one I recommend that you skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I've seen in a long time...","review":"a real long time. Sure, it is violent but it's done well. My only complaint was the cheesy song during the final scene, something about being a hero. Other than that, fine filmmaking in full effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"The movie was very disappointing for me. I am a car nut and one of the car chases was excellent but the remainder of the movie was either boring or very bloody.

A big flop if ever I seen one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The downfall of Ryan Gosling","review":"What an awful movie. The lead character has no personality and nothing to say. Graphic violence and topless nudity show up in one scene each just to earn an \\"R\\" rating, but add no value to character development or the plot. Pass on this one even when it's in the $1.99 bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 1 Star because Amazon won't do zero","review":"The first 15 minutes was not too bad, but that was only the 7 ads for other movies, then the 5 minutes of junk telling us who produced this tripe, the movie went downhill after that. Really, this isn't arthouse, its just mind dead trash that is just a waste of time that you would wish to get back. And these people wonder why Hollywood is in trouble.Cliched dialog, boring music, terrible driving, flat characters, UGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"An stylized art film.","review":"If you're a fan of this filmmaker, chances are you've seen Bronson, and recognize the amount of style this filmmaker can mass into his movies. It's an art film, not the action blockbuster that the trailer makes it out to be, so don't be upset when you realize what kind of movie it is. Regardless, this is textbook suspense and tension, my heart was racing during many of the scenes, Albert Brooks performance was grand, Ron Perlman on key, and Brian Cranston excellent as well. Great score, great style, you'll be haunted by the character of Driver long after the credits roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for those who appreciate nuance and an attention span.","review":"Not you typical, predictable, Michael Bay type action film. Definitely more of a highly stylized art film that makes use of perfectly done visuals to tell the story rather than a lot of dialogue. This is the kind of movie I would not have liked much when I was 16 years old, but at 27 and a lover of film now I can appreciate why this movie is really good. I give it four stars because in the end I didn't feel as invested in the characters as I would've liked. That being said, all around great movie-making here. NOT RECOMMENDED for those who enjoy like Fast and The Furious, Gone in 60 Seconds, or any movie that stars Vin Diesel or The Rock. Your attention spans will wear out within five minutes and you'll have to reboot by needlessly checking you iPhone many times throughout the movie. My movie Grade: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie and I received it very fast!","review":"Great movie! A little slow at the beginning but the intensity and suspense in the silence was great! Also a bit violent so if you dont like that sort of thing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dialogue, very surprising","review":"This one will surprise you with the story and the dialogue is good throughout. One thing that will turn me off of a movie very quick is stupid dialogue--people saying things that don't make sense, that are just dumb, and that nobody would say in any real situation. But the people who wrote this one were talented and probably put a lot of work into making the movie solid. They might have overdone it a little bit with him being all quiet and smiling at the girl, but it wasn't tedious. Also, the director put some extra art into it. The music, the cars, and some of the lighting is reminiscent of an 80's movie. It's good. There is graphic violence but there's no sex, which I appreciate; the movie was good enough that they didn't feel they had to resort to making it a cheap peep show like a lot of them will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never purchase a blu-ray or dvd with ultraviolet digital copy","review":"I have had nothing with problems with them, I have itunes have loaded all their crap contacted them on 2 different dvds and they still don't work and they don't want to help. Their product is garbage do not buy their product if at all possible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting.","review":"The main reason for the low score was the dialogue and that it was extremely slow in the beginning. It did end pretty well and the pace picked up well in the end but the first half was so incredibly slow that I couldn't give this a good review even with the improvement towards the end. I wouldn't really recommend this movie to others although I do know a couple people who enjoyed it so it could be that it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"If you can handle the blood and guts, then you'll love this movie.

Unbelievable performance by Albert Brooks who always plays a sweet funny man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"I wish I could give it no stars, but that wasn't an option.

I was so so disapointed the movie was basically about a guy who drives likes married girl helps her husband rob a pawn store which circles back to 2 mobsters, that was the movie.

You have to sit through 2/3 to get there, and it is not worth it. Most of the time you are witness to two or more humans defined by their taciturnicity and propensity to lingering non-blinking stares.

To get there you have to wade through an hour of wooden romantic narrative and lots of Ryan Gosling's stares. They can be intense, or fond, but that's about the limit of his acting. Christina Hendricks is only there for about 10 minutes. There was no character development, lousy music, and no motivation. Looked like a film school project by somebody important's girlfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent, don't buy!","review":"I was anticipating a really good movie after reading all the glowing critical reviews of this film. I was really disappointed and find it hard to believe so many top critics felt this movie was a winner. The dialogue was either spartan or excessively verbose, feast or famine according to who was onscreen. The scene where he drives the getaway car was enjoyable, but the remainder of the the film was senseless over the top violence or uncomfortable silence. Not at all what I expected, and I am thankful I only rented the movie rather than buying it as I had originally planned.

The movie trailers and advertisements were very misleading. Like some, I was under the impression that this was going to be a fast paced, non-stop, action packed movie. Instead, it was the total opposite. The movie moved at such a lumbering pace that it was annoying. The movie had very little to almost no dialogue. They could have written the script on a \\"post-it.\\" There is absolutely no emotional expression from the main characters, with the exception of the characters: Shannon, Bernie, and Niño. It was like watching Lt.

The director likes to do this thing where an actor will say a line and then wait far too long before the other actor responds. That is if they respond at all. There is one scene in a car that has only one sentence! It's hard to relate this in a written review. Some might call this technique \\"art\\" which would be fine if it wasn't the entire movie.

I find it hilarious that \\"Abduction\\" got a lower Rotten Tomatoes score (4%) than this (93%) - and those were the critics' votes, not the audience - and Abduction was ridiculously more entertaining than this.This is the same type of movie as Pulp Fiction, where people say it's great and artsy and hipster, but they really only think that because they don't understand what was going on. This movie was absolutely terrible, and if you're looking for a way to spend your evening, please don't waste it watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth watching once","review":"I did enjoy the slow burn of this film, the understated, almost leisurely approach to tension.But I checked out emotionally for the same reason that I check out emotionally from most films: when the behavior of the characters on the screen resembles in no way human behavior as I recognize it. In the case of this film, that happened when the guy was kissing the girl in the elevator, while the assassin was standing right there.Yeah, right."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST WORK RYAN GOSLING HAS DONE","review":"I can say a lot of things about this film, but nothing I can say will adequately describe how beautiful and provocative the film is. The directing deserves an Oscar nod, period. The use of imagery is astounding. The film is has graphic violence but even the violent scenes are weirdly beautiful. I could say so very much but I will only say this: Two films this year deserve special recognition for their use of light and color and those films are Drive and Melancholia, respectively. The music score and sound for Drive also deserves distinct recognition. Christina Hendricks of Mad Men has a cameo in this movie and she shows she has serious acting chops underneath that beautiful veneer. Lastly, Ryan Gosling, you have earned the accolades you are receiving for this movie because this movie would not have been what it is without you, specifically, and I personally believe the torch has been passed to you from a young James Dean or Steve McQueen. Congratulations to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"This coulda been a really cool movie had they changed a few things slightly.

I watch mainly old films, but from the reviews I read this seemed interesting. The film started well, the chase after the pawn shop robbery was very well done, and Ryan Gosling was good in the role.I have several problems with the movie though..............The film is too long..................this is an 85 minute story told in 100 minutes.The violence is cartoonish..............too bad Peckinpah is not around to helm films like this.I cannot see Albert Brooks as a gangster lol............does not work for me.Who picked those songs.......just terrible! LOL A Bernard Hermann score is what this film needed. Too bad he ain't around.I hate films that pretend to be art films when they are actually genre films...............great genre films are great art...see Hawks, Wilder, and Ford.I hate opaque endings to a basic crime film!! Dead or Alive?? Please. Not Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst yet","review":"I could not believe that Amazon gave this movie a 3.5 stars. It was the slowest movie ever produced.

It's just wrong to have trailers and publicity that mislead people into thinking the movie would have some good car chases or anything of the sort.

It's just a horrible Film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Trailer","review":"The trailer presented Drive as more of an action film but only a few scenes are. Mostly it is filled with the Director's overly long pauses and overall It feels like the proverbial barge being dragged across the sand. Nothing much is given to understand the main character and the others are flat. We found it strange and meaningless."},{"rating":"1","title":"drive","review":"very dull movie. took for ever for it to get going few action scenes here and there . bad quality sound for being a blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"Here is the deal, maybe I just didn't get it or it was really a bad movie. I LOVE Ryan Gosling and normally he can do no wrong. One person described his character well, little to say and no personality. SPOILER ALERT: He has no name in the movie, I kid you not. It is very slow, violent, dark and somewhat depressing. The love interest part of the movie has no spark and doesn't leave you feeling that there is a point to it. There are some good car chase scenes but that is about all I can say that was good. After the movie ended I was left wondering why I had wasted two hours of my life. This movie is not for everyone; if you like it dark, like it violent and like being left with an uneasy feeling at the end, then this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie to get a wide release in a while...","review":"Seriously when I first saw Drive I couldn't believe a movie this outside the box and out of touch with current trends could have been given a major release...and that's a helluva good thing! One of the best examples of \\"show it, don't tell it\\" in a long time. Bloody, thought provoking and ultimately heartbreakingly satisfying, Drive is not for you if you are looking for just a quick dumb badass driving fast movie. Someone actually told me that they didn't like it because they, \\"thought it was going to be more like Transporter 3.\\" This is NOT an action movie, it is a drama with some really cool action pieces in it...just as Taxi Driver is not an action movie but has some incredibly intense action moments in it. Gosling is incredible as The Driver and is one of the best anti-heroes since Travis Bickle...and if you don't know who Travis Bickle is just go a head and rent Transporter 3 instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylized, 80's-like thriller. Violent but very cool.","review":"Not everyone's cup of tea, but I found this one really interesting and very cool. Deliberate pacing with explosions of violence that catch you off guard. It took me a while to get used the Refn's stylized, 80's like directing choices but then I found myself really digging it. In summary, a stunt driver moonlights as a \\"getaway\\" driver for lowlifes. He gets tangled up with one of his neighbors and ultimately dragged into a robbery gone bad. It puts him on the run from some mean thugs lead by Books. Gosling is good playing the quiet, minimalist, but deadly (scorpion) driver for hire. Brooks got an Oscar nod for his role as a likable but dark mobster. Violent to some extremes but very cool. Definitely check it out but make sure your data is ready to cover their eyes during a few scenes...."},{"rating":"2","title":"What did I just watch?!","review":"This movie was out of control. It was nothing like I expected and I mean that in a good way. I was pretty high when I watched it so it was kind of hard to follow the plot but I was very entertained. The ultra violence freaked me out a bit, but that's OK too. Is he some kind of autistic guardian angel?I'm convinced that they didn't shoot enough footage of Ryan Gosling. Maybe he had to fun off to shoot Ides of March or something. So, they created a reason for his character to wear that mask. Then the used slow-mo in many scenes to extend the existing footage.4/5 because they didn't utilized Christina Henrick's boobage to a great enough degree. Also, clean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern day Steve McQueen","review":"I wanted to like this movie. But man it was sloooow. Scenes took forever to get anywhere. Throughout Gosling just stares expressionlessly and says nothing more than a couple words at a time. I guess he was going for a modern day Steve McQueen. But it just comes off as wooden and uninteresting. (As did McQueen often times.) The graphic violence, when it comes, is almost welcome -- waking Gosling out of his funk and gives him something to do. The story didn't exactly track either -- it depends on a pretty major coincidence. I respect movie makers who don't go the easy, predictable route, and here I commend them for the effort -- but not so much for the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"UltraScam","review":"Don't get suckered by this product.

I kept watching but it just totally failed after the beginning scene. The plot to this movie is stupid. It's basically a bunch of scenes strung together trying create a story. Unfortunately it made no sense. Very little acting was done by the main character, just repeating lines. In several scenes the main character had long pauses where he just stared off into space and the camera just stayed on his face(Wow, great acting). Of course maybe that was better than him saying lines because in some scenes he mumbled his lines so bad I couldn't hear or understand what he said.

To say it is a \\"deep\\" \\"layered\\" film is absurd. It is a painfully slow paced, attempt at a movie along the lines of Pulp Fiction but it never gets close. Ryan Gosling is void of any acting talent or facial expressions. I have seen reviews that say his eyes tell the story...uhhh..no. The lead actress is simply boring.

A 70s-style comeback to cinema.

While cold/distant and off-key at parts, Gosling makes a star with a deeply involved character that is more than head-smashing and little dialogue.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a plain, good film. NO SPOILERS.","review":"I'm not a movie snob or a wannabe film critic, but I really liked this film. A feel from the 1970's, a soundtrack like it came out of the 80's, and a modern \\"noir\\" vibe. Just let the movie unfold. If you're one of those that likes to try to predict the outcome of movies, you won't like it...go watch the latest Hollywood blockbuster drivel. Lots of thought and emotion in this one, exactly what I like. I can't help but sort-of compare to the British \\"angry young man\\" genre, which is one of my favorites. It's similar in many ways, but also different. I did find it odd that Christina Hendricks (of Mad Men fame) was so hyped up when she only had about a 10-minute part. She's still very cute, though. Also, the Mustang/Mopar car chase was a nice touch! Kudos to whoever threw that in there...I really like enigmatic references to films of the past!

They spend more time shooting his morbid facial expressions than they do on the action scenes. The movie dragged on with a few hightlighted scenes. The best was probably the hotel scene and the car chase where he kills Ron Perlman's character. I was hoping for more car stunts or chases, but it didn't happen. There was no explanation why Gosling was so withdrawn. The plot was interesting but between the lack of dialog and the wierd music, the movie seemed out of place.

The first scene is quite refreshing and entertaining, but the whole thing just goes downhill from there. The next half hour is useless. After that the pace slowly picks up as there are a couple scenes of disturbing and graphic violence. But I wanted to see some chase scenes. There were none.

It looks like it is an action flick, with maybe some drama and romance mixed in. In reality, it is 1 hour and 30 minutes of awkward silences with 10 minutes of completely unexpected, random and senseless violence. There are huge stretches of the movie where no one says anything, and there is no music whatsoever. The few lines of dialogue in the movie are stilted, awkward, and completely without context. What little music there is, is completely inappropriate for the moment. There is no background ever given, and the characters say and do so little it is extremely hard to feel anything for them.

I kept thinking it would get better at some point and it never did. Granted, I'm not the artsy, read-between-the-lines kind of person. In fact there were hardly enough lines of dialogue for me to read between, I think it took Gosling all of 20 minutes to memorize the 10 or so lines he has in this movie. Apparently there must be some kind of deeper meaning to this one that escaped my limited intelligence if people are rating it 5 stars.

I just found the violence, more so the gore, a little too jarring when juxtaposed to the pace and tone of the majority of the movie.I appreciate the intention behind showing the ugliness of violence but I feel like it was inconsistent with the rest of the film.

Fifth Business is a challenging, thought-provoking novel that will compel you to read on until the very last page.Do yourself a favour and read Fifth Business; it will be a novel you won't regret reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning for the Trilogy","review":"Robertson Davies' Fifth Business is the beginning of a trilogy that has become legendary in Canadian literary life. It took moving to America for me to finally begin these novels and I am glad that I have done so. This first book begins the series of novels off on a strong note. Dunstan Ramsay weaves a wonderful narrative as he explores the life lived below the surface of this staid history professor at a boys' school. The novel moves through geography and chronology as the various people in his life become twice born, dropping one identity and taking another (demonstrated by the creation of a new name). Things are never quite so simple as the past lives come crashing in at odd times into their new lives. It is a wonderfully magical and mystical (in many senses) journey and will be a delight to the reader. I look forward to the other two books in the Deptford trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a story of Dunstan Ramsay and his search for self.","review":"Fifth business is rather a story with a confusing plot.

A meticulous and astonishing vivid creation of one man's journey from a kind of hell into a life among whited skinned aristocratic men into a kind of pleading dream. A graceful and moving memoir. if you will. poignant recollection, lyrical and evocative. more than a record of unusual events, it shows how in a matter of survival, the courageous reffusal to abandon the fifth as it truely and always will be. the reader is left in awe of the bravery, endurance and solidarity of which humans are capable, as well as the brutality, evil and devisiveness they can inflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"This book is definitely one of the best I've ever read. The plot is stunning, mature, unique, and sophisticated. I couldn't put the book down!! The characters were wonderfully contrived, and the way Davies wove them into one plot was beautifully done. It was amusing at times too, and interesting to see how Dunstan Ramsay and his friends matured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank saints there are 2 more in the series","review":"In this mature and subtle book, Davies sets out to expore the crisis that takes grip when one must justify a life lived. But like the plot itself, the reader is left with perhaps more questions than anwers. Why do we value acheivement more than deapth of spirit? Is the life of one dragged by events any less valuable that that of the successful showman, businessman or politician? Isn't success just an illusion that covers the emptiness of spirit that is its inevitable companion?Along the way, the reader meets colorful characters - priests and sinners - the enliven the story.A book that is therapy bound by leather."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic novel that grips the intellectual mind","review":"I found this book amazing once i got into it.

From the cover of looking, I thought it is a boring book because it looks boring. When I start this book, it seemed to me it's boring. I did not like it part of because English is not my first language. Later, after I tried to put myself harder in this book.... Hmm.... I love it!! I love it a lot is not because my teacher forced me to read, i like it it's because things happened in this book can affect our life, too. I will toward to enjoy this book and re-read again when I have free time.

But anyone looking for a thriller should read Tom Clancy. This book grips you in a different way. It gives you a respect for life and forces you to review your own life; and in a totally different way than say, As I Lay Dying.

His rendition of the Arts, are therefore basic yet illuminating in not suffering from any preconcieved ideas or values of the arts. When taken at the informative value of introducing a foriegn concept to the western mind, we arrive at an original discription of the Martail Arts and of their merit to the practioner. This book introduces the reader to the base of understanding and refreshes the practioner with the uncalloused viewpoint.

This is the book that originaly inspired me to start my study of martial arts almost twenty years ago,I have learned much since than. This book is a bit over-zealous on some points, but it is a good reference work for most martial artists, and a good read for the laymen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and written in a florid style","review":"Gluck gets many things wrong. I cannot even figure out why this book has been reprinted. His account of Persian martial arts is so wrong that it borders on being fanatically racist. What this \\"reprint\\" really looks like is two separate books: Somebody took Gluck's original colorful nincompoopery from 1962 and overlaid it around a serious chapter and some serious passages about ki, breathing, and meditation.It would have been less expensive and more compassionate to simply print the good stuff on ki in a slim, separate volume and leave Gluck's work back in the oblivion of the 1960's pop view of martial arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandingo","review":"Great movie.

This really is an excellent film. The story line was great. It titillates you with sex and sadism. It's the first film I have ever seen to show full male frontal nudity. To me, that made it more accurate. Perry King was great as the master's son. It shows the brutality of how dehumanizing slavery really was. I feel it was probably pretty accurate as well.The quality of the print is not optimal, but it is adequate to enjoy the movie. If it is ever re-done, I will buy it again, because I love this movie. It takes a lot of money to restore and digitally remaster an old film nearly 40 years old. They would spend that kind of money to re-do the Godfather, but would never make their money back remastering a film like this.

FORGET about finding something educational in this. However, one cannot help but laugh at the scene where the German widow \\"examines\\" Ken Norton's \\"lower anatomy\\" during the slave sale (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one).

It's all EXTREMELY boring and quite insulting and depressing.Please don't think for a moment that \\"Mandingo\\" is a serious look at slavery.

Most option books spend too much time on how to price an option. Unless you are active in thinly traded options, the market will dictate the current market price. This book gets right into why you are interested in options. Each option situation is broken down so anybody with a basic understanding will understand. For each situation, he discusses the Greeks (the new hip way of talking about options), risks, pros and cons, as well as an example. The only subject this book seems to fall short is what to do when your position is not going your way and how to minimize your loss.I have a coworker that is interested in options and this was the only book I suggested he read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible of Option Strategies","review":"The perfect How, when & Why of defineing option strategies.

As the book progresses, the reader watches as Hilton matures in spite of herself.Bennett has created some interesting and likable characters, including the secondary characters. Bennett also provides the reader with some laugh-out-loud scenes such as the all-out search for the kidnapped teddy bear.

As 5'10\\" woman with a long lower torso and a sway back, fitting pants is difficult to say the least. For an all-encompassing book that addresses fitting issue, see Singer Sewing's \\"Perfect Fit\\", which has lots of pictures, clear directions for both major and minor alterations, before and after shots, and deals with all subjects.

When they say it's how to fit clothes using any pattern for any body type, they left mine out. The patterns and styles were extremely outdated (try things my mom wore in the 80s) and the end product didn't appear to fit the \\"real life person\\" it was intended for. One of the women they used to model was a plus size who needed something to wear to her wedding, so they made her this large, unflattering dress with an ugly jacket. The alteration instructions were confusing and hard to understand. I'm a sewist, mostly dealing in children's clothing and quilts, but I can read a pattern easily enough.

Tony Curtis comes to her aid and jumps to the discovery that an ancient Indian shaman has possessed her. After seeking the help of an Indain spiritualist, there is an \\"Exorcist\\"-like showdown between good and evil where the initially decent effects go downhill quickly.Tony Curtis was once a respectable player, but because of substance problems in the late 70s he appeared in Bad News Bears sequels and clunkers like this.

Best of all, no batteries to keep charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"why can't they test this thing?","review":"I had bought this opener, assuming the price will give quality over the usual rinky-dink junk that fails because it is made of simple punched sheet metal. Wrong. I liked the ratchet feature, and it worked well. Well, just for a month. Now it won't ratchet any more and is stuck.I don't understand that after making the plastic mold and the sheet metal moving parts there is no life testing done. Shame on the Progressive makers.

Save yourself the money and frustration and try another product. I should have read the reviews more carefully. I've had this a month now and am resolved to buy something else. I liked the look of this design. It looks like it should work, but alas, not true!This thing slips off the cans 9 times out of 10 uses. Something a simple as a can opener should work every time it's used, without any adjustments. It will open a can, but only after resetting it 2 to 5 times on a single can! Ridiculous! I will end up throwing it in the trash, a waste. I would donate it to a charity, but I would feel bad about someone else ending up with this dumb, poorly made tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for even light use","review":"My wife and I have terrible luck with can openers. Every single one we have purchased in our 5 years of being together has broke in a matter of months.This can opener was no exception. After only 5 months of very light use (5-10 cans a month) it broke. One day while opening some cans the lever just stopped working. Instead of it engaging the gears inside the can opener it became very loose. I gave it a once over to see if it could be fixed but it was trashed.Now, I'm sure that this can opener was dropped a couple of times but when it comes to these types of equipment they should have both durability and longevity.I remember the small metal can openers that my mom used to have. They worked but they were uncomfortable to use. I prayed they would break so she could buy something I considered better, but they never did lasting years.I think I might just have to go to a yard sale to find me one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed piece of garbage!","review":"In less than one month, the PLASTIC lever snapped off.

However, one whole panel of red fabric (the panel on the back left leg) was a different shade of red! They also cut that piece of fabric against the grain so it's very, very obvious that there's something wrong. I also had the same problems as everyone else: I ordered a medium but it was too short at the ankle, the diamonds were painted on but as soon as you wear the costume the paint cracks, the gloves are too big and not even finished with a proper hem, the neckpiece is flimsy and cheap looking, the eye mask doesn't sit right on your face and is constantly in your eyes... the whole thing is just a waste of money even if you ARE a confident, experienced sewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Short in the Torso","review":"I am 5'4, size 6-8 and the medium was way too short.

Otherwise it's not worth it.You'll probably learn something from this book, but since the author has a bad attitude towards grammar (many things are given as \\"you'll learn this eventually, don't worry\\" and nothing more), the book doesn't give you that much. For a traveller it might give the required knowledge, but it is certainly NOT a \\"complete course\\" to Slovene.Fortunately I have a friend that is native in Slovene and can help me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The poor man's guide","review":"This book is poorly organized, full of misspellings (both in English and Slovene) and poorly executed in general.

Nor does it serve as an index so you can turn back to the lesson(s) where that word appears. The index is one page and basically useless.I've been using the book for the past month and while it is inexpensive and better than nothing, it is NOT GOOD. Slovene is a very intricate language and there are very important grammatical rules that stand between you and effective communication, Albretti only makes the slightest gestures to them rather than giving a good useful introduction to their use.I've only been working with the language for a few months and I could do a better job than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic tasting easy to prepare meal","review":"Originally bought this to be quick lunch but realized it's more of a dinner kit than lunch.

I've learned a lot of other really useful stuff than just the PHP content, things that I now realise I should have been taught by the official Dreamweaver 8 book, but weren't. The PHP content for which I bought this book is fantastic - much better than another generic PHP/MySQL I have read, as this is tailored to the Dreamweaver 8 environment which takes a lot of the guessing out of the equation. This book is written by and for people who use Dreamweaver 8 in a practical situation. I'm still less than half way through my book and already feel like I've learned much more than I expected.

Ann Margret relegated a part that could been played by any amateur, was also in need of a job and money to play in this stinker. But again, if you don't have studios calling for you as much as they were when you were young; this is what happens. (yeah, yeah - Grumpy Old Men 1983. Grumpier Old Men 1995)No thrills.

If the reception has not changed (it seems that it has based on an initial test), I will adjust this review as necessary but, at this point, it seems my particular clock has transformed into a great little atomic clock!Complete conjecture but the only explanation I can think of is that the clock was having trouble getting a signal due to some interference.

Meatballs is a perfect reflection of this, it's fun and Bill Murray never lets us down being the true comic genius, he talks to the campers on their level instead of talking down to them, he is basically a kid at heart himself. My favorite part was the summer olympics.Who can forget those at the end of camp? This movie never gets to out of hand, the scenes of competition are hilarious, the campers, though some are bratty, make a lot of people identify with them when they were young. I am not going to even acknowledge the following sequels they made to this film, Meatballs 2,3 and 4? Whatever, after the first one the rest became just a bunch of idiotic raunchy sophmoric teen flicks.

It's a lovable, low-budget flick about summer camp, shot in Canada. The camp counselors have sex, but no slasher comes out of the lake to chop them up. Instead, Bill Murray takes Chris Makepeace (that kid from \\"My Bodyguard\\") under his wing and teaches him how to belch and talk at the same time, which brings the little guy out of his shell and makes him the most popular camper in Camp Northstar history.There are some obligatory heart-string tugs, but mostly this is just amiable, low-brow fun for the whole family.

I'm 30. This movie was a great family movie with classic one liners and a brand of comedy you had to pay attention to, to get. It made you think about the little guy and feel sorry for him.

It was fairly easy to set up as long as you do not follow the instructions as they are not well organized. The instructions jump around. The only thing that helped me was someone once shared his MIG welder so I had a general idea of how to set it up.With flux core wire one can weld right out of the box. I purchased a gas cylinder and this cost can be off set very quickly if one welds quite frequently versus buying flux core wire.I was able to weld 1/4-inch steel very easily. I made repairs to a five foot mower deck for a tractor. This in itself paid for the welder versus buying a new finishing mower for the tractor. Now I have a welder for life.There are some very well written reviews with good advice- heed their experience and comments.For a \\"hobbyist\\" I would recommend this welder.

Not only did he have no recollection of what he'd been doing when he was within a stone's throw of the spot where Sarah Cherry was killed, but his documentation was found in her driveway. Come on now! Dechaine was \\"railroaded\\" like OJ Simpson was railroaded-- which is to say, not at all. I think Maine is populated by a lot of bleeding-heart hippies who hate The Man and are paranoid that The State is out to get them; thus, their willingness to sympathize with Dechaine and doubt his culpability. It's too bad, really, because all that emotional energy used by Dechaine's advocates could be better used to protect the rights of children like Sarah Cherry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Sacrifice","review":"This is not the type of book I normally read.

Here it is, at last, finally! Thank you to James Moore, who's thoughtful, conscience thoroughness helped bring the evidence in this case to light.

I mean, even Dylan signed with Columbia. Pink Floyd, who sold a ga-jillion records, was always bashing record company executives and the music business(Animals, Have A Cigar, Comfortably Numb).

The production value is high and made even better by a absolutely perfect performance by Angel Corella. I can not say enough about his acting; every change in gesture speaks volumes and his dancing abilities are without challenge.

Sad because is an enormous amount of talent, Marcelo Gomez, Murphy and Corella to name a few are probably some of the best dancers of their generation in the planet today, but their coaches, their stagers, and teachers seems to they have no idea about tradition, musicality, style. Seems that they have no idea who Petipa or Ivanov or even Tchaikovsky was. So sad a company with so much money and access do things so bad.

I thought the prologue was interesting and innovative and really wondered why no one thought of doing that before.The individual performances were first rate though, for me Gillian Murphy and Marcelo Gomes stood out.One reviewer asked why it was necessary to use two performers in the role of Rothbart and his evil alter-ego. In the live performance there was no way one person would have been able to change so fast.The only thing I would have changed was the length of the last scene at the lake. It was too short for me. Moving straight from the Palace celebration to the lake puts a real strain on the lead who has just danced her own alter ego. Though Gillian Murphy handled it well,it wouldn't have hurt to give her a little lead time by having the corps step in.But I give it a good review.

Liberation seems such a romantic idea that one can hardly resist it, and yet here we can easily read and understand that true liberation takes a lot more than military objectives and shouting in congress.Lewis's eye was remarkable in one so young. I hope that both these books have found their way to the library at West Point. It is perhaps too much to ask that they should be read anywhere inside the beltway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great","review":"This is the man who made me put down the Hemmingway books. He does the same globetrotting here during WW1 without the macho stuff that may have been cool in Hemmingways days but is old news now. I am on my 4th Lewis book and have not been dissapointed yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"historical snapshot","review":"Normann Lewis is best known as a travel writer, but this book is more of a memoir of the time he spent in Naples, Italy as a soldier during World War II. As always, Lewis graces the pages with very descriptive prose, giving the reader a real feel for place and time. And his fondness for the kind but beleaguered Italian people that he meets during his time in the city comes pouring off the pages of this book. His time in Italy, even during this turbulent period in history, obviously left a lasting impression on him. Amidst the horrors of war, Lewis manages to find grace and perseverance among the suffering populace. This is an illuminating view of a period of history that has been written about often, but rarely with from a perspective of someone like Norman Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Repetitive","review":"By the time I was half-way through the book, I was longing for it to be finished. This British author set a negative tone for me with what came across as British arrogance and a very anti-American viewpoint in the first third of the book. The remainder of the book, focusing on the sordid details of prostitution and destitution, was, as another reviewer pointed out, both a bit depressing and quite obvious. The diary format was tedious and did not lend itself to a well-told story. I don't know what I was expecting, but this certainly wasn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick review for USMLE Step 3","review":"Crush Step 3 is an excellent book for rapid, high yield review of material commonly tested on the exam. The material is presented in a nicely organized semi-textbook format which makes for easy reading. This is in contrast to the material in First Aid for Step 3 where the material is poorly presented although high yield as well. In summary, Crush Step 3 is an ideal book for last minute review for the USMLE Step 3 and a great add on to more substantial preparatory material."},{"rating":"1","title":"good material but not enough","review":"with such great reviews i was so happy to have found this book but once i opened it... it was all down ill after that. i think if ur really freash with step 2 then its a useful book. but i was a 3rd year resident when i decided to take it and i needed far more indeth recall and studying for step 3. even failed step 3. so finally took kaplan live lectures. brilliant. after 10 days i was ready to take the exam. fastest prep of all time are the kaplan live lecture ones.. but my case was different.. just get over ur step3 real quick. as fast as u can. for the early birds im sure this is a great book. for me way too superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why people are afraid of clowns, now","review":"I read this book a few weeks back, and the fact that I'm having difficulty remembering much about it, or forming much of an opinion at all, is telling. The characters didn't stick with me, the plot is a vague memory of Lincoln Canes and my most vivid recollection is the scary clown face on the cover. There's nothing about this book that really stands out, other than an overwhelming sense of being heaped with a bit too much history and culture for me to enjoy the book as a work of fiction. I don't like reading fiction where I feel I have to learn a lot to understand it, and I know that's just me. If you know a lot about or are very interested in Indian culture and customs, you'd probably get a lot more out of this book. History buffs might also find bits to enjoy. Cozy mystery readers and those that enjoy more 'fluffy' reads probably won't enjoy it as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sacred Clowns","review":"This book, like most of Hillerman's books weaves a good mystery while presenting a good appreciation for Navaho spiritual beliefs and tribal culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual New Mexico at its Best","review":"This book proves once again that Tony Hillerman is a Master when it comes to the beauty of New Meico and the Spiritual values of the Navajo.

A much better \\"bang for the buck\\" and the bonus tracks are pretty decent (compared to Judas Priest, Blue Oyster Cult, & Motorhead releases where the bonus tracks are virtually unlistenable). But man, can ya get much better on a intro than the title track, \\"Hair Of The Dog\\"? \\"The Dog\\" is a \\"bona fide\\" classic, right up there with Montrose's \\"Rock The Nation\\" for top hard rock intro of the 70's.This album is a must have for any fan of 70's hard rock. So if you ain't got it yet, add to cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Rock-Heavy Metal","review":"When I first started to like hard music, like hard rock and some heavy metal, I was trying to look for some artists that I would like. After getting recomendations and searching on web sites, I found out about Nazareth. Once I started to listen to some of their music online, I right away said to myself, \\"I'm deffinetly going for this.\\" After getting some other artists, such as Armored Saint, Extreme II, and Monster Magnet, I actually satrted liking Nazareth more than a few others. So those are some artists that I would recomend if you like Nazareth. I love this hard stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best hard rock album ever recorded......","review":"You must get it but get remaster import Sound is incredible ! First time I heard this album in 1975 in Europe and believe me its still real hard rock classic !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are people critiquing the music?","review":"Seriously? You're given a music review on Amazon? Obviously that is not what everyone is looking for. Some people already have listened to the songs and now want to buy them.For those who people who have I would not recommend buying them here. They just don't sound the same as they do even on other MP3s that I've heard and personally I liked the way it sounded in that addition better.The music just sounded to clean and tame in comparison and that is not a complement for rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DRUNK'S TALE","review":"I can remember a time in my life when I thought AC/DC did this, pathetic huh?%#@$ Well it makes somewhat sense I was young and 'Hair Of The Dog' came on the radio and that's who I thought it was, well anyways 15 years go by and I picked this up on vinyl, boy I wore a groove thru this album, so to CD I went, I got, superb, encore, bravo. The whole album jams, if you like Sabbath, AC/DC, or even Motorhead this might be a good album to grasp, which includes 'Miss Misery' 'Love Hurts' Changin' Times' Beggars Day, hell even Whisky Drinkin' Woman, which doesn't sound like anything else really on this track but still sounds good. And of course 'Don't Judas Me', like I said everything on this album registers. This is a good album to hang out and drink with, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid album of 1975.","review":"This album, along with a lot of bands in the mid 70's, is a good solid hard rock album. Noithing that you wouldn't expect. But it has really good tunes from the boys. The title track is a great motorcycle song, and Miss Misery's is a classic. I like Rose In The Heather, even thouh a lot of people don't. Begges Day is a great cover, and it's got cool leads. the only song I can't stand is Love Hurts. Ugh, a power ballad. However, this makes it up with Please Don't Judas Me. A beatiful song with beatiful music. Check out the tablas. Incredible. It's a good album from 1975, and.. well that's it. Bye!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nazareth Has Aged Better Than Most","review":"Regardless of what some people might say, this album has aged very well. Like all of Nazareth's best work, there is more diversity here than on alot of releases from that time period and certainly more than you hear on hardrock and metal discs today. The title track still hits as hard today as it did then and though even some die-hard fans may take shots at \\"Love Hurts\\", we all know no one's ever done a better song of this nature. The reality is Nazareth pretty much created the \\"power ballad\\", but don't hold that against them, it's not thier fault that most everyone else has done them so badly. Looking back , I realize now more than I did then what a great album this is. Nazareth's music sounds a lot less dated than alot of the giants of the time that so many still worship today. Led Zeppelin and many others can only wish they aged so well. Anyone who wants to debate that fact needs to go back and listen to Zep's \\"In though the Out Door\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Classics!!!","review":"If your in your 40's like I am, this will bring back memories, if your younger, then you owe it to yourself to give this a listen. Nazereth had several hits during their career, but really hit it big with Love hurts, which is included on this cd. The song hair of the dog is another hit from the album, and is a great song. What most people don't realize is that the entire album is just as good as those two songs. Check it out for the first time, or drift back in time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Classic!","review":"The title track is incredilble. The whole album is great. I remember how big this album was because I was a teenager in the 70's. A lot of reviewers have said they didn't like \\"Love Hurts\\", but I suspect if it weren't for the fact that AM radio played this to death for many years and the probability that a lot of the reviewers here weren't even around when this ablum was released, this song would be much more appreciated. It was played at all the Jr, High and High School dances from 76' until I graduated in '79. How I remember! And my classic rock band I'm currently in includes it in our playlist when we need a classic slow song for the couples to reminisce thier youths by. And to all you 80's kids, this was NOT what you would call a power ballad! On the downside, CW is correct, it could use a bit more cowbell...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaviest Metal from the 70s","review":"This heavy metal band from the 70s is my favorite.

Instead, this book starts with the premise that the Gospels are all to be taken at face value (even though they were written 100 to 500 years after events) and fails to address the fact that there were at least sixteen prior real or mythical individuals that had almost the identical major life events attributed to Jesus. The book does not address the creation of many of Jesus' life events as agreed by a political committee at the Council of Nicea (~324). Thus, the book is a major disappointment.

But the extras are merely some stills and the trailer, there's not even a paper insert! That's a pity, I would have loved an hour of interviews from those still around (or maybe in the can already).

Supposedly the guilty party will then identify himself/herself by leaving the room. Instead, all the murderers are identified at once (so fast one can't follow or make sense of the dialogue) as the various parties accuse each other, then run outside into a car that has been wired to explode, intending to kill Clouseau. So, all the suspects are dead, and we reach the end of a boring movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a lot of fun","review":"Peter Sellers' characterisation of Inspector Clouzou is rightly famous and in this film, he is surrounded by a caste of great character actors.

I was impressed with the fact that Angelina does most of her own stunt work (they actually imply that she does it all, but I am not sure if that is the case), and with the demonstrations of just how it is done. Interviews with Angie and the stunt directors/coordinators on this are very informative. A little more about the plot aside from the stunt work might have been good, but sometimes there is a fine line there between teasing and completely giving the story away, which the producers cannot afford to cross also. I's say probably watch the movie first, then this featurette, to appreciate some of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review!

A quick, fun read and an interesting commentary on environmentalism and terrorism, considering that it was written in '88.

Instead of Rolling Stone Mag paying all the bills, it's a \\"environmental\\" organization. There is some cool science explained for the non-major.

The narrator is Sangamon Taylor, an eco-warrior whose goals in life seems to be eating vietnamese food, getting the girl, and getting the big chemical corporations to pay for their dirty deeds.ST hilariously tells his story in the first person, and he does so in a way that keeps you turning page after page, rooting for the little guy and wondering what he'll get into next.If you were dissappointed by Stephenson's other books (The Diamond Age and Cryptonomicon), you'll want to forget about those and dive right into this.

There's excitement, danger, hard science, bad guys, cool dudes, geekboys/girls and Vietnamese food. I enjoy NS's writing, but I feel he still needs to refine his craft. He tends to take a long time to \\"start\\" his plot and/or gets caught up in setting the scene so there's the risk of either boring the reader or overwhelming the reader with too many details and too many characters.But I must say that Zodiac was the most fun, lighthearted even, of the NS books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leftism Militarism at it's best!","review":"Neal Stephenson, in _Zodiac_, gives his readers one heck of a tale. The proganist, not necessarily hero, is likable in his sheer audacity and the amazing ways he finds to \\"rock the boat\\". Stephenson has turned this book into both a commentary on the environmental crisis of our day and a suspense thriller worthy of any mystery writer. This book takes the reader for a ride around modern-day Boston and details all of the good and the bad that goes along with our modern-day cities. Natives of the Boston area and visitors to the region will recognize many of the sites in the book. This serves to ground the book in just enough reality for it to be believable. Fans of science fiction and thrillers, readers of modern fiction, environmentalists, and anyone looking for a good read should pick this up. I would say it's Neal Stephenson's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Fun Read","review":"The plot kind of sneaks up you.

Stephenson Fan","review":"After reading all his recent books, I went back to read this early Neal Stephenson work. I didn't mind that it was not Science-Fiction and appeared to take place in the 1960's or 1970's, I still enjoyed it. If I wasn't already a Stephenson fan, this book would have made me want to read more. It was a fast paced eco-detective story, and dealt with a serious subject (water pollution) with wry, tongue in cheek humor (thanks to it's likeable main character, Sangamon Taylor). Being a Chemical Engineer I appreciated his extraordinarily clear and easy to follow explanations of chemistry. The book could have easily bogged down there, but did not.

Zodiac isn't nearly as intellectual as Snow Crash, nor does it have nearly the same depth, but it's tons of fun nonetheless. The protagonist, S.T., is wonderfully realistic, especially if you've ever moved within activist circles. I enjoyed the off-handed instruction in toxic monkeywrenching (how to block pipes, etc.) that echoes so well the eco-classic \\"The Monkeywrench Gang.\\" Stephenson is a brilliant storyteller, and S.T. is a compelling hero. It's not the most intellectual of books, but great for vicarious revenge against polluting corporations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time Reading This Book.....","review":"If you have read Stephenson's the Diamond Age, you won't find what you're looking for in this novel. The full title of Zodiac:The Eco-Thrilller does not do this novel justice. I read halfway through the novel and I was still wondering where the thriller part was. The main character Sangamon Taylor does not make me want to like him and halfway through the book I started wondering when something would happen to him.

Stephenson's _Snow_Crash_, I very excitedly bought and started reading this book. The enthuiasm was short-lived. This book quickly turns into an environmentalist whacko's sermon. At points it is about as interesting as an Al Gore speech. The main character is a drug abusing eco-warrior. Forget the techno-savvy and future thinking found in Snow Crash.

It is easier to use than my older water bag version device and it ratchets once for each pound, making it extremely easy to use.

One thing I would like to have is an indicator of the amount of pressure that you're applying, but I do okay without it. Delivery, though free, was extremely fast. That was a nice surprise. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I had pain in my right shoulder, radiating down my arm; then my left, chest pain and pain under my jaw. I thought I was taking a heart attack. Turned out being a pinched nerve. So imagine feeling like your having a heart attack every day, all day for weeks. I thought about getting an inversion table to decompress my spine. But the reviews all seemed to be saying the tables worked well for lower back pain. Mine was in the upper back and neck. The package arrived Friday. The instructions for the NeckPro say to use the device for 10 minutes in the morning and 10 in the evening until the problem is corrected. By Monday I didn't need to use it. I feel like a new person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Traction part is fine, but the pressure on the jaws, oh my","review":"I bought this after reading all the reviews and by the recommendation of my physical therapist, and thought I would be able to deal with the discomfort mentioned by others, but found that I could only tolerate it for a few minutes at a time. That is not enough time to allow the traction process to work its magic. The pressure on my jaws was too much to tolerate, and they would ache for some time afterwards.I am trying the inflatable pillow device (4 compartment) also advertised here on Amazon and see if its more comfortable. If not, then I will try to fashion the spreader bar mentioned by the other reviewer.Its a shame that Neckpro hasn't dealt with this comfort issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"This item works very well.","review":"I used it every day for a week, and now every other day for maintenance. It's worked wonders for my neck pain. I highly recommend this. Be sure that decompression is an appropriate treatment for your condition before you start. For some issues, this can make it worse. A chiropractor offered to let me use a similar device daily at his office... for about $30 per visit. Way better to do it at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and works well for me","review":"Out of the blue, I had an episode of neck pain for several months in mid-2010. An MRI revealed multilevel cervical spondylosis with mild central spinal stenosis C5-C6, and possible impingement of the exiting C5 and C6 nerve roots bilaterally.I began several months of physical therapy, including traction at the therapist's office. My therapist recommended several exercises and stretches that I continue to do at home. He also recommended that I continue neck traction at home. I bought the Neckpro device about 6 months ago, in September 2010. At first, I used it twice a day for several weeks. Then, as my pain gradually receded, I have since used it 3 or 4 times a week, and I will continue to use it.I am mostly pain-free now. I think the Neckpro traction, together with the other physical therapy, contributed to this improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for neck pain","review":"I've suffered with chronic neck pain for years.

Instead of pulling on the back of my head or upper neck, all of the resistence seems to be aimed around my jaw and chin.

My wife tried it and said the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight Modification needed","review":"This is a really easy to use device but I think 1 modification is in order and you can do it for about $2.00. The device tends to squeeze the sides of your head but I corrected this very easily. All you need is a piece of 1/2\\" plastic PVC (2 feet at the most) and 4 1/2\\" elbows all purchased at Lowes. Cut 2 pieces at 5\\" and 2 at 1\\".Place the 1\\"piece in to 2 elbows then insert both 5\\"pieces into the elbows. Now put that piece on the inside of the double strap on top. Place the other elbow piece in the other side of the strap and now connect the elbows to the 5\\" pieces. Finished and you now have the pressure removed. Inventor should have done this for the sake of $2.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Losing a pain in the neck","review":"The NeckPro Cervical traction device is easy to use, effective at relieving pain and discomfort, portable and relatively petite.

Better late than never."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helps, good neck stretch.","review":"I suffer from neck pain/stiffness from time to time.

This device puts so much pressure on your chin/jaw that I was afraid that I may have done damage to my jaw. My whole lower jaw and teeth actually hurt due to the compression on them.

God knows when you have one thing wrong with you, you don't need to damage something else. Use caution with this...there are other devices to consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not adequate for foraminal N. compression","review":"The head harness mostly pulls on the mandible causing TMJ pain and extending the neck too much, which exacerbates foraminal compression. To be useful for foraminal stenosis and nerve root pain,it should pull mostly on the occiput and thus allow for neck flexion (facilitated by facing the door rather than the recommended position). The harness isn't designed to do this effectively. It needs to be re-designed to traction mostly on the occiput. Also, he rolled seam at the chin could be avoided at manufacture. The seam is irritating at full traction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promises I Can Keep","review":"Very interesting from a social perspective. Not alot is written about this subject for the lay person.

I guess I had a lot of gunk on my hair and this shampoo made it super clean but I am now afraid to try it on my newly colored hair.

A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reader in San Francisco","review":"One of the dumbest books I have ever read. I stayed with the book because it fascinated me how such a poorly written book would make the best seller's list. The author must have contacts. This author has lost touch with reality - how often do mourners to a funeral bring red wine, goat cheese and crackers (I suppose this was humor - who knows). I did enjoy observing endless stream of inappropriate cliches. To this end, the book was interesting. If you are contemplating buying this book, do yourself a favor and read the first chapter - it does not get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No surprises here","review":"When looking for a good mystery I know I'm not going to get great literature. There are only three things I ask of a mystery. 1)a challenging whodunit, 2)a little escape from everyday life and 3)some wit. I'm afraid that this mystery by Susan Isaacs didn't measure up. In the first place it was way too predictable. I knew who and why before I was a quarter of the way through the book which means the clues were a little heavy handed. In the second place - Was the petty, political vitriol supponsed to be witty? I found it unnecessary to the plot and frankly mean spirited. Third, I can get all the politics I want on the evening news. The characters were detailed but stereotypical and all the husbands were shallow, self centered louts. True, our heroine is spunky, resourceful and cute but this mystery left me feeling irritated and dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for everyone...","review":"I had my doubts about Susan Issacs, but I will definitely read more of her books. Rosie Meyers is delightful and witty, and never loses her dignity no matter what is thrown at her. I kept seeing the cast:Sela Ward as Rosie Meyers, David Boreanz as Danny Meese, S.Epatha Merkerson as Cass, maybe James Brolin as Tom Driscoll, Ed Begley as Carter Tillotson. As for Jessica and Stephanie, you'd have to find some bimbos to play them, but maybe you could put in Rebecca Mornay as one of them.If you need light entertainment, have a long train ride, or need to while away a rainy weekend, this is the best for what it is . There are other \\"pulpy\\" writers but they are often insulting to women and just downright awful. This was a lot of fun and you couldn't help but be on Rosie's side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for the Ex-Wife!","review":"This is a jolly page-turner. Isaac's one-liners and down-home quips are great.As usual, the protagonist is a middle-aged woman who finds real ecstasy andhappiness after being dumped by her jerk of an ex.Tired of self-pity and crying, she becomes a sleuth. Interestingly, she is tryingto find the murderer of her soon-to-be ex-husband. The police think she isthe murderer so she must first escape from them as she investigates her hus-band's seamy side which she appears to not have known about when they weretogether.Despite the spectacular assumptions and leaps of faith that the reader mustmake, this book is lots of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Traditional school-at-home only","review":"I purchased this book as a new homeschooler because it seemed to have a lot of practical information on the nuts and bolts of homeschooling. I have since gotten rid of the book, as it is only useful for those who want to do traditional school-at-home, complete with a simulated classroom, desks, reports, etc. I know some people are most comfortable with this model of homeschool, but for many people traditional school-at-home merely replicates many of the problems with traditional school, but now in a different setting. Homeschoolers of a different style -- Classical, Charlotte Mason, Montessori, Waldorf, eclectic, and obviously unschooling -- would be much better served with another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to get you started","review":"I liked this book to get me started with homeschooling. I pulled my 2nd & 4th graders (at the time) out 3 years ago. It was the first thing I read about homeschooling. I thought it was practical and had good advice about when your kids have been in a traditional school. I don't remember it pushing \\"school at home\\" in fact, I thought it talked about not doing that. It's been about 4 years since I've read the book so don't quote me on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it elsewhere...","review":"The album itself is great; the one star is meant for Citadel Records, and only because I'm not allowed to choose a negative rating. Citadel (and this means you, Kris Grey) has absolutely no license to sell this album.

This might have been a guiding light for the blossoming of the Incredible String Bands thought, words and deeds. And although this album falls short of the work that followed it, it's a worthy of notice for the daring, novelty and prism of musical thought it contains. For young Scots to have traveled so far and drank so deeply of the pool international folk literature is itself worthy of note. The (almost) mystical insight of Hangman's is born of this bumpy ride and is testament to the resilience of an art/culture/genre in decline and dying even at that(1968) late date. Oh, what a great light to cast such a dark shadow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks.","review":"One star for the awesome King Diamond song, he really can make something out of nothing. I guess a second star for the cast of characters assembled. It's just not that good at all, and it's really not really even a great idea to put this \\"all-star\\" session cast together. I guess I should not complain, my local library had a copy of this, so I ripped the King Diamond song onto my computer and washed my hands of this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL metal fans cannot pass this one up","review":"This is the ultimate record for those that truly appreciate metal, it's warts and all. David Grohl (Who is a great musician but admittedly not the first person you think of when you think of heavy music) has assembled some of the greatest vocalists in all of metal, from the grindcore scream of Lee Dorrian (Napalm Death) to the catchy growl of Lemmy Kilminster (Motorhead). Everything about the album harkens back to the glory days of underground metal...the inspired artwork, the \\"dirty\\" production quality, and the nonstop intensity of all involved. Personal highlights are \\"Centuries of Sin\\" (featurinng Cronos from Venom,) \\"Shake Your Blood\\" (with Lemmy) and \\"Red War\\" (with Max Cavelera of Sepultura/Soulfly...In short, this album is for aficinados of thrash/metal/death metal/grindcore....people who think Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit are \\"heavy\\" will be in for a shock if they give this one a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alrighty then","review":"The album starts out with real black metalVenom- nice choice. Secondly, never been a big fan of Max or Sepultura or his other tripe. Very disappointed in the Tom Warrior of Celtic Frost track \\"Big Sky\\". I am one of their biggest fans. Their albums \\"Morbid Tales\\",\\"To Mega Therion\\" and the unbelievable \\"Into the Pandemonium\\" -Brilliant-Top 5 All-time, are all wondrful. Never mind Sepultura- 8 years too late- the next Slayer- wrong. The intro to \\"Centuries or Sin\\" sounded like \\"Intro\\" from \\"Morbid Tales\\". The Snake track \\"Dictatosaurus\\" is excellent. In Dave's own word's \\"KIng Diamond\\" exactly. I enjoyed the album. I do not think it is the greatest thing since \\"Master of Puppets\\" - GREATEST ALBUM EVER ,or \\"Reign in Blood\\" #2 or \\"Among the Living\\" for that matter, but it is better than any new stuff-let them prove me wrong- some have- Shadows Fall,Lamb of God , Iced Earth- until someone puts out something in the same universe as \\"Master of Puppets\\", I will never be impressed. Good Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More","review":"Honestly I bought this album kinda on a lark. I was at the music store looking around, and saw this album, used for like $6...saw that it was Dave Grohl and thought sure, I'll bite. Got in my car, popped it in and I was amazed. The songs sound like they could be good, but the mixing on this album is abysmal. Simply, I expect more out of Grohl, he's too good of an artist to let this happen, but he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Amateur-Bot\\"","review":"Sorry to say, but Grohl is way out of his element here. It's almost as if he is overwhelmed and ovematched by the \\"metal\\" genre. Whether it be the \\"doom\\", \\"grind\\" or \\"speed\\" metal style, his timing behind the drum kit just seems to be off. I'm no drum \\"tech\\", but I believe Grohl usually plays a single bass drum while many top metal drummers use a double bass; Grohl just can't seem to keep up. It makes one appreciate metal drummers like Mickey Dee & Scott Travis even more. Plus, the songs are just flat out mediocre at best. In the liner notes of the album, Grohl professing his love of \\"the riff\\"; ironically there is not one decent riff on the entire album.Don't ask me why, but while listening to this album I kept having visions of Sting fronting Motorhead. One listen was enough for me. If you need to get your \\"Wino\\" fix, opt for his latest release \\"Divine Propaganda\\" by his new band \\"The Hidden Hand\\". Pass on this one until it hits the cut-out bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but could have been a little better","review":"First let me begin by saying that I love metal, its the best. Probot overall is a good metal cd with a lot of great artists, not to mention the legend Dave Grohl on drums. Grohl seems to do almost a 180 from his earlier works with Nirvana and currently the Foo Fighters to put out a \\"raw\\" metal album with the help of some friends, including Lemmy from Motorhead and Max Cavalera from Sepultura and Soulfly to name a couple.However I was a little sad not to see a few figures on this cd whom I consider to be the faces and voices that made metal what it is today. I would have liked to have seen Ozzy, James Hetfield of Metallica, Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, and or Phil Anselmo formerly of Pantera. Any or all of these guys on this cd would have given it a 5 star rating in my book.But overall a pretty damn good cd with some great songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock's Saviour Revives Real Metal!","review":"If you can't tell by looking at the cover (art by Voivod's Away) that this is not a Foo Fighter's album, you lose--turn in all your music and listen to emo for the rest of your life.Dave Grohl has recruited some of metal's greatest talents (among which he is now counted) and made a CD that's both nostalgic and fresh. The songs--all written or co-written by Grohl and played mostly by Grohl--avoid old metal cliches like muddy production, double bass drums and overindulgent guitar solos. Instead, we get music that's heavier than Nu Metal but not as repetetive as old metal, with a different vocalist/lyricist on each track.My favorite track is \\"Dictosaurus,\\" featuring Voivod's raw-throated and lyrically incomprehensible Snake. There's not a bad track on this CD, unless you're a gutless wimp who runs to mommy when the volume goes over 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Ha, I feel sorry for all you suckers who bought this album expecting a lame Foo Fighters album. This cd is not very good at all and if they didnt have all the good singers I wouldnt give this cd the time of day. Grohl is an amazing musician, but he is out of his element here and it shows.

Probably because of the genre of music in general, but not even the track w/ max from soulfly was good. this cd is just crap, and a huge waste of money.

I guess it still works for that, but it looses its suction after a min. I'm not sure why. It starts out with strong suction. I can actually turn the glass upside down & nothing spills. But that is only after its first put on. A min later its just sitting on top of it without any suction at all. I am very disappointed in this product considering the price I paid. I will keep them, but for a cover that just sits instead of suctioning on, its not worth the price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Producing and Marketing Prints: The Artists Complete Guide","review":"First of all, this book is seriously out of date.

What is worse, is that the 7 pages of information are so general it can not provide any value to anyone. The author provides 2 sentences of material for most of the PeopleSoft Modules that a formal PS training class would dedicate 200-500+ pages on. The selling of this as the complete coverage of everything PeopleSoft is very, very, very dissapointing. 0-stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defines a segment of the Baby Boomer Generation","review":"To me this defines the so called \\"Baby Boomers\\" to a tee. A bunch of coddled, selfish, \\"educated\\", self absorbed, hedonistic, psuedo hipster, pseudo intellectual, liberal, upper middle class adults that more or less behave like teenagers 24-7. Everything I hate about the liberal Yuppie Baby Boomer demographic is expressed vividly here. I was cringing throughout because it reminded me of these types that I thought I had escaped.

There is no cool nostalgic soundtrack just a ukalele and a barroom trio. The humor is sublte and charming. The plot focuses on what is rather than what was. It is as intimate as helping polish off as many eggs as possible around the small formica table and hoping that Katie and Mike invite you to stay one more night.That is where Sayles came from and check out other movies like \\"Brother from Another Planet\\" and \\"Lone Star\\" to see where he is going as a very independent filmmaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put-put Film Making at Best","review":"Often compared with \\"The Big Chill\\", and getting numerous stars in many reviews, this film simply isn't even in the same universe with Kasdan's.

The vocals are typically robotic. Every note is hit with the exact same level of vocal projection and sustained for the exact same amount of time. There is almost never more than a 1 step note change from one syllable to the next, which makes for some coma-inducingly boring attempts at melody. If the singer wasn't intent on sounding like every other Saves The Day/New Found Glory wannabe, this band might almost be listenable. The music is still pretty boring, but it could be worse. The track Intermission is actually pretty good. Maybe these guys would be better off making an album of new-agey post-rock in that vein. At least it would give them an excuse to silence the singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing epic alternative rock","review":"Wow, this Cd is mindblowing and without a doubt one of the best cds yet this year. This music is so good and so well written that it pisses me off that this band isn't huge. WOW the next big thing is definetly the receiving end of sirens. This is the epic rock album i've been waiting for for a long time. Every song is beautifully composed while still rocking hard and being energetic. Any fan of new punk such as senses fail would probably also like this cd. Simply put, these guys are the real deal. I hope to see them popping up all over tv and radio soon. They deserve credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, great product","review":"I was a little concerned when I ordered based on some reviewers saying that the product had an expiration date of shortly after it was received. However, I ordered anyway and am happy to say that mine came with an expiration of March 2014, so I have a good year to use this - although it won't last that long with my two dogs getting a tablespoon each per day. It seems very fresh and seems richer/more concentrated than another brand I tried first (that went rancid before I could use it all). My dogs love it and their fur is soft and shiny. My only (minor) complaint is that the cap is very messy - it is a twist on and off top and the oil just gets on the outside of the bottle where the cap goes and ends up running down the sides. I find myself cleaning the bottle and cap area every time I use it to try to keep it from running down the sides and pooling under the bottle in the fridge.

I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Danielle Steel read ever","review":"Normally I can't put a book down that she's writeen, this was the exception. I almost didn't even finish it because I was so disgusted by Meredith and Cal. The author kept trying to portray Cal as an honest man wanting only what was best for Meredith. Yeah right, only if it included them being together. I should have known just by the reaction from Cal's children just how I would loath Meredith. They ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to force myself to finish this book","review":"I am a collector of Danielle Steel's books. Until recently I have loved all of them; however, lately they are just not as good as they used to be. This book is repetitive.

Maybe she is just pushing too many out and not concentrating on the quality they used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steels done it again","review":"Yeah she has.....she has managed to come up with YET another reader's nightmare. The book was a total disaster, from beginning to end. It was, as is so typical of ms. steel, boring repetitive, and monotonous. Not only did the 300 plus pages keep circling around just four characters, each one of these was as predictable as they come. After reading just a few of her books, i've begun to understand the author's writing style. Everything that she stresses in the beginning (by repeating it about a million times) is contradicted somewhere later in the story....in this case the perfect marriage Steve and Meredith share, and how faithful they are to each other. The mere fact that she talks about it twenty times in a single paragraph makes you wonder. Just like how she keeps insisting that Meredith and Cal are 'just friends and business acquaintances.' Keeping in view that the author is Danielle Steel, I would've been shocked if the two HADN'T gotten involved romantically...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary Disaster","review":"For Danielle Steele to publish this book, let alone put her name on the cover, is shameful. It was redundant, pointless, and lacked a plot. When I was reading this book, I would finding myself looking at a paragraph and thinking, \\"wait...didn't I read this a few moments ago?\\" In the past, Danielle Steele has written books that at times might have seemed overly dramatic, but her forte has always been her intricate plot. Her books were considered to be \\"page-turners\\" because she was always adding to the story. However, she fails to do so in this book because there is hardly a story being told. When I finished this book, instead of sitting there considering what I had just finished reading; I was left thinking, \\"Surely it wasn't Danielle Steele who actually wrote this.\\" That is my final though in this review: If you're looking for one of Danielle Steele's captivating and romantic stories, look for one that was written at least five years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill","review":"I hated this book, thankfully I received it as a gift and didn't waste my own money. Danielle Steel's writing has gone downhill. This book was predictable, and boring. In my opinion, adultery shouldn't be considered romance. I think Danielle needs to take a break from writing for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really wrote this?","review":"Did Danielle Steel really write this book? It seems like it was written by an amature. It was quite repetetive -- How many times did she have to tell us that Steve and Merrie were in love and devoted to each other. I couldn't wait to finish it just so I wouldn't have to read it any more. She needs to go for quality in her books, not quantity, seeing how many she can write in one year. I have read every one of her books, but they have really been going down-hill, and I hesitate to read any future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of her worst","review":"I am a huge Danielle Steel fan, however this story could have been told in 75 pages.

And Danielle Steel is not the only one of my favorite authors that has pulled this recently (by favorite authors I mean that as soon as they have a new book out, I go and buy it). Same story with John Grisham and \\"The Brethren\\" and Robin Cook and \\"Abduction\\". All three were books nothing like their earlier books: Not well written, uninteresting plots or if interesting in the beginning deteriorated quickly, no or terrible endings. I do hope these books are not the way of the future for these authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING (The worst of her books)","review":"I have read all of DS's books except 2 and this was BY FAR the most boring. I normally enjoy her books but this was too repetetive. Many times I lost my place and picked up the book to seem like I was reading the same thing over & over. Most of the book is about her job which is boring, and if you don't know anything about her line of work, you lose interest (he as a doctor could have more exciting info put into the book). Not enough going on in the book to keep it exciting like the others. I was very disappointed. She isn't caring about her readers anymore, just pumping the books out. I hope her next 2 I have are better reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is rather boring...","review":"I picked up this book at the airport and carried it with from US to Europe, then to Asia and back to US. I couldn't stand reading this book for more than 15 minutes during my numerous long flights. The plot is old, conversations repetitive, totally predictable story line and ending.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Danielle Steel book-","review":"This book was my first book I have read by Danielle Steel, so I had an open mind when I started it. I liked how she brought forth the \\"today\\" relationship- each one is involved in their own occupation and then they rarly have time for each other, which lead to problems for them too.There were a few twists and turns in this book but not too many that are unnexpected. It was your basic love story and many books have been written in this fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissappointment!","review":"It was fairly obvious as I started this book that the main female and male characters weren't getting along well.

I found this one irritatingly slow and dispointing I knew what what going to happen from the first 2 pages and had to get though the whole book to get there, the best part of the book was the last 10 pages.

My favorite being Mirror Image and Klone and I. But Irrrestible Forces was completely boring and lazy book writing.

It just the characters were either too unbelievable or not balance. Don't get this book get Mirror Image instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point is...","review":"I really thought I was buying a book about a strong, committed couple who could handle anything. Instead, its about a nasty, conniving millionaire who breaks into a marraige and convinces the heroine she can have even more if she leaves her husband and marries him. The characters are mostly very shallow and their love and committment are a sham. What exactly is the message? Pack up and leave the first time you're tempted? Always go for the big paycheck? Lie, cheat and steal? This book will make you drop your diet, get drunk, and sleep with your neighbor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresistible Forces","review":"This is one of the worst books I'v ever had the misfortune of picking up. It is boring, it seems like Danielle Steele took a 20 page short story and lengthened it by telling you the same thing over and over and over and over. It is also predictible, right from the beginning I had figured out the couple would split up, I know that and I still haven't managed to finish the book. I am a person who can usually finish a fiction novel of this length in two days, I have been reading this one of and on for four months because I can't stomach more than two pages at a time.

Boring, predictable, repetitive, yes. But most of all, no matter how you look at it, she is saying that adultery is O.K. if you desire someone else, wrong!

There was some repetitiveness to the storyline but how many times can we write about any single topic without getting something similar to a previous story?The drama in the book, as always with Danielle Steel, kept me reading straight through. Maybe rather than looking at the ending as \\"sad\\" the readers would be more interested and understanding if they looked a little deeper into the marriage - was it really all that spectacular from the beginning? Any couple that indulges themselves so completely in work so as not to produce any real quality time with their partner can't be \\"THAT\\" much in love. Anything that breaks that easily was broken deeper inside than you can tell from the surface.Enjoy the book - you may find it as interesting as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steele Is Slipping","review":"Ok, now I know my own limitations and I cannot even write one book, let alone as many as Ms. Steele has. However, in \\"Irresistible Forces\\", we get standard Steele fare. One wife, Meredith, an investment banker, married to an up and coming physician, Steven. The plot revolves around Meredith being offered the dream job by Cal Dow--a sneaky, successful character. A bi-coastal marriage turns into maudlin melodrama.As I have mentioned in other reviews, I like Danielle Steel. I prefer her earlier works which have more research and history propelling the story. Such as \\"The Ghost\\".other reading suggestions: \\"The Long Road Home\\" by Danielle Steel and \\"Grand Passions\\" by Jayne KrentzThanks for your interest & comment votes--CDS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresistible Forces","review":"Danielle Steel's book Irresistible Forces was the slowest moving, most boring book I have ever read. I have been a fan of Danielle Steel for many years and have read approximately thirty-five of her books. Usually they move along and keep me enthused. This book did not do that. I felt like it was a chore for me to have to finish it. Danielle Steel continuously repeated the same information over and over again. She could have saved much time, space and paper by simply getting to the point. The book was far too predictable and for the two main characters, boy did they crash and burn! I would recommend The Long Road Home or perhaps Family Album if you want to read some of her better works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"I have read all of Danielle's books and this book is by far theworst one I have read.

Haven't all of you heard she has a slew of writers penning these books for her? How in heavens name can you write and publish 2-3 books a year and expect them to be of any quality. The story was a big disappointment. Meredith and Steve were married, BUT they didn't have a marriage. I can't say Meredith got much out of her life with Steve except to say that she had a warm bed to come home to whenever she wanted too. Purely a selfish woman. Steve at least cared for humanity and truly loved and wanted Meredith to be happy as you can tell, when he encouraged her to take the job in California. He is better off with Anna, and Meredith and Cal deserve each other! Danielle Steel used to be a pretty good author."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's going on?","review":"I thhink her books are getting worse, she seems to be spilling them out far too quickly qithout giving much thought to the plot.

If you are reading this Danielle, be more creative, otherwise you will lose a lot more readers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say no","review":"I used to be a big fan of Danielle Steel, eagerly awaiting every new release. Well, now there are too many new books and not enough good ones, capped most recently by this very boring book. It seems to the reader as though Ms. Steel has used up all her ideas and keeps regurgitating them over and over (and OVER) again. She either doesn't give her readers enough credit for being able to see where the story is going, or, more likely, she keeps repeating herself, CONSTANTLY, so that it fills up space and she can meet her page quota. Not one of these characters was remotely sympathetic, and no good reason ever came along for breaking up Steve and Meredith. Conveniently, they each had someone to go to so I guess that makes it OK? I don't know -- I don't care either. Next time she writes a book, I will NOT be the first one at the store to buy it -- I'll wait and read the reviews here before I waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snooze!","review":"I'm not a big Danielle Steel fan, but I have read a few of her novels and found them interesting. Unfortunately, \\"Irresistible Forces\\" was not one of those novels.

Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical of Steel's Most Recent Work","review":"Although the storyline was readable, Irresistible Forces is very typical of Danielle Steel's latest work: unsophisticated, repetitive, shallow, barely edited.

Please, publish less and give your fans MORE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"More than anything, I was disturbed by the message that this book conveys, that fleeting feelings are more important than a 15 year marriage.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste the Money or the Time","review":"Danielle Steele's latest is a superficial story about an incredibly selfish woman. Ms. Steele attempts to create the \\"Perfect Woman\\" for her character in the blonde, successful, rich, etc. (ad nauseum) personna of Meredith, a/k/a \\"Merrie\\", who unceremoniously dumps her brilliant but rumpled-looking husband of more than fourteen years for her California-style, tan, rich and famous new boss. After an unsuccessful attempt at a coast-to-coast marriage interrupted by a totally unbelievable number of coincidental disasters which prevent Merrie from spending the weekend with her husband, she ends up in bed with her boss. Please Ms. Steele - try to imagine that your readers have at least the sense of a flea and come up with more believable characters and plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot and repetitive","review":"What a waste of money! I've read all of Danielle Steels books and this was soooo disappointing. I thought \\"Merrie\\" was a selfish, cold, unfeeling career woman and Steve was a fool! I kept expecting some great event to occur but it never did! The book was one big repetition."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I'm only halfway through this book and am not at all sure I'll finish it. Yes, Steve and Meredith are in love, and yes, they work hard, and yes, they enjoy it when they both have a couple hours off. But no, please don't tell me these 3 things on every single page! This book is one big yawn. I used to be a Steele fan, but I don't plan to read any more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this?","review":"I am not sure who wrote this, but, I only kept reading this book because I have read many of Danielle's books, and just knew it had to get better. The first 66 pages could have been cut back to 5 and gave me as much information describing Meredith and Steve as I could stomach. I wonder how many times I read about how professional and good looking they are. I felt it was just an attempt to get as many pages out of the book as possible and the readers would not notice. From the other reviews here, Danielle was wrong. Come on, Danielle, you are not writing for 10 year olds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Irresistibly Predictable'!!","review":"A true Danielle Steel, full of predictable storylines with unimaginative characters. Too like Steel's other novels, which led to a very boring night's reading! An excellent book for the unfunctional brains amongst us! Not worth the paper it's written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was having a nightmare...","review":"until I realized I actually read this piece of fluff. Danielle, just because you're been divorced several times, doesn't mean the rest of the world can't have success and love also. I have every hardback written by her and this one is one for the circular (trash can). Very boring, repetitive, and not her usual style. She must be financing another divorce. Save your cash, borrow it from the library if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresistible Forces","review":"As with all of Steele's books there seems to be no content or copy editors involved-what a mess this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me When It's Over","review":"I was really disappointed in this book...it was redundant, drawn-out, predictable, BORING. It should've been a short story due to lack of plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real scream:","review":"On the second page, so many things screamed: the kids, the sirens, the mom, the crowds--then it was my turn. I screamed and, by some irresistible force, was compelled to throw this book out the window. Baaaaaaaaaad."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the most horrible book! Please don't waste your time. I kept hoping it will get better and it never did. It was making me angry most of the time. I wish I could give no stars, but it wasn't an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it","review":"I really enjoyed how the beginning and ending tied together, but I will agree with some of the other reviews in that the book was somewhat predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first AND LAST Danielle Steele book","review":"Wow! This is hands down the worst book I have wasted time on in years. I picked it up at the library, figuring I'd give Danielle Steele a try and couldn't be more unimpressed. This book was repetitive, slow, and appears to be headed toward a climax of adulterous affairs (nope, I haven't finished it...yet...or maybe ever). About the only positive I can give it is that I really like the character Steve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresistible Forces","review":"Being a first time reader of Danielle Steel, I was very disappointed. The main characters \\"Steve\\" and \\"Merrie\\" protrayed the role of two lovers with complicated lives. The same plot continued throughout the book, leaving the ending predictable. Steel talked about the same idea over and over all through the book. Steve and Merrie are constantly telling people how much they love each other although they never have a free minute to be together. It was easy to tell what would happen in the end just by reading the middle of the novel. Steel needs to add a good twist to the end also adding some originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be Danielle Steel!","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read by Danielle Steel. I kept looking at the author's name to be sure it was hers. So boring, so repetitive, I got so frustrated with reading the same information over & over just arranged differently. She has some wonderful books out but pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Twist on Typical Steel","review":"Not one of Steel's best written novels, but a page turner ~ I found myself unable to put it down. It has a more realistic tone than many of her previous potboilers. I'd give it three stars if not for the fact that I found the protagonist (Meredith) completely self-absorbed and unsympathetic. Loved her husband Steven though ~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like it used to be","review":"Danielle Steel was one of the first romance authors I read as a teenager. My mother, gradnmother, and I would eagerly pass the new books around. No more...I didn't finish this book and discourage my mother and grandmother from even starting it. I felt nothing for the characters, not even pity. If you want to read a truly outstanding Danielle Steel book try The Ring or Remembrance."},{"rating":"1","title":"my review","review":"This book is about the story of two people who have been married for 14 years and who under incredible stress and circumstances find themselves being separated and losing their marriage.I don't think the story holds very well, you can predict the end a lot sooner than it takes the author to do it. The characters are very predictable.All in all, I don't think this is Danielle Steel's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"What can I said, that hasn't already been said. I agree with most of the other reviews here. This book was boring beyond belief. It was very repetitive and I felt no sympathy for any of the characters. Not one of her best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive and boring","review":"She has definitely lost her touch. Better turn off the computer and find something else to do. I cannot believe how many times she wrote how the main characters missed each other because they were apart. For heavens sake, take out the fluff and give us something good to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 7 cents...","review":"I agree with many of the reviews I read on this page. This book is just the most aweful Danielle Steel book I have ever read-and I have read a lot! I pretty much abhored the main character and her rationalizations for cheating on her husband. I felt as if D. Steel was approving adultery. Usually I can't put down a D. Steel book...but, with IF, I wanted to throw it down and step on it repeatedly! If I could give it negative stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"And, and, and, and, and, and......","review":"I have only read an excerpt of this book and based on it I will not buy the book. The increasing use of the word \\"and\\" is really getting to me. Where is the editor! Am I the only person who has noticed how many sentences are started with \\"And\\" in Ms. Steele's books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGGGGH","review":"this is absolutely the last steel book i EVER buy. this was just SO predictable and she just repeats the same things over and over. i read this in 24 hours, mostly because i just skipped page after page. how this got to be a bestseller is beyond me, although i guess i contributed by buying the dumb thing. no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Danielle Steele has once again supurbly woven reality in with fantasy. The story is one that could happen to any married \\"career-oriented\\" couple. It reminds us that marriage is hard work and has to be put above all else. Ms. Steele makes it fun to sit down and read...and not be able to put the book down. Great Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun, relaxing read","review":"This was a relaxing book to read and typical of Danielle Steel's style. The ending was as expected, but it was fun getting there. I read it on a weekend vacation and it was perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's got my vote!","review":"I found this book to be one of Danielle Steele's best; however, I don't like how she was so vague on the characters' descriptions. If you're looking for a book that makes you laugh and makes you cry then this is the book for you. If you are looking for a book with an unexpecting ending then I suggest you read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"They finally reach Oregon.","review":"Well they finally reached Oregon and Whip Holt of course didn't marry the woman he thought he would but a different one. That's okay I liked the way the story went. I have to say I enjoyed how Dana Fuller Ross made women capable people throughout his books. Every books always has some bad person that eventually gets it in the end even if you have to wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagon's West Series","review":"this series is a well written, historical outlook of all the states in the union.

This is not the type of book I generally read but I found it after I searched for a book on the Amazon and an authentic book on what it's like to be there.I'm almost done with the book, and it's one I don't want to put down, and certainly don't want to end. It's been very real, has made me feel what it was like to be on a real Amazon adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-cultural travelers down an amazing wild river","review":"I am not a regular reader of outdoor adventure stories, but having just been in Peru, this one held my interest. Joe Kane brings the reader along on the adventure, not only describing the trials and triumphs on the river, but also the look of the land and graphic descriptions of the people of the Amazon.I was amazed that Joe Kane ended up being one of the people who completed the whole trip, not that he didn't want to quit many times. Many excellent pictures are included thanks to Zbigniew Bzdak.To learn more about the wonderous tropical biology of this region, I recommend the book \\"Tropical Nature\\" by Adrian Forsyth and Ken Miyata."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to read","review":"I have been trying to get into this book, seem to read a few pages and then put it down and read another book.

I have been reading travel/adventure books for a few months now, all have been so exciting except this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy locks!","review":"Very nice combo dead-bolt and entrance door locks. The finish is a nice oiled bronze with a hint of reddishness. All hardware is included regardless of your current door's dimensions - extra spacers, rings and adapters are supplied so these locks will almost certainly fit.Installation was much easier than expected with the supplied instructions being very complete - almost too much info in there! As always when changing locks you have to jig things; make holes bigger, sand a little here and there etc. Despite the fact that this package comes with a variety of shaped returns none of them fit my door's situation so I had to improvise.A nice feature is that you don't have to unlock the door from the inside to open it, just turn the handle regardless of whether it's locked or not. Keep in mind though that should you leave and pull the door to, it will still be locked!You get the deadbolt and entrance lock, keys and all hardware. Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality Lock","review":"I have had these locks installed on all my exterior doors on my house for almost two years now. They work very well and I have had no issues other than getting locked out.From what I read on the internet, its now a standard that even though the door is locked you can still open the door from the inside. This is really annoying, especially when relatives are over and they constantly lock the bottom lock and then when I go outside I get locked out.I searched high and low to figure out how to disable this so that when the door handle is locked the inside knob won't turn. No such luck.The solution I found was to put a Schlage link keypad lock on one door. Then I can just enter in my pin number which will unlock one door without a key. If someone can figure out how to lock the bottom lock and dis-engage the interior knob I would give this lock set 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schlage lock review","review":"Schlage builds excellent locks.

I loved Whitney, I still love Whitney, I WANT to be Whitney! It is such an incredible adventure to read this book. BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall I enjoyed it","review":"I have to say that I both loved and was disappointed with WHITNEY, MY LOVE. I like Clayton's character but I thought he may have been too arrogant for Whitney. He just jumped to too many conclusions about Whitney even after declaring that he loved her so much. And I was really confused with their constant misunderstandings with one another. Either Whitney or Clayton should have just gone to the other and say, \\"We must be thinking two different things here,\\" because after a while, it just became annoying. But overall, I really liked the book and could hardly put it down. WHITNEY, MY LOVE is just one of those books that you just have to read for yourself and not take someone else's opinon for. But if you're a Judith McNaught fan, I think you'll find this book's strengths and weakenesses; moreover, its strenghts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clayton's endearing appeal....","review":"'Whitney, My Love' was the first romance novel I ever read and has in fact made my expectations so high, that I feel no novel will live up to its magnitude. But perhaps the most endearing quality of the entire story was the character of Clayton Westmoreland. For some reason which I will never be able to explain, Clayton became the ideal image that all the other romance heroes I have read about have been forced to live up to. Is it dominating personality? His way of playing mind games while flashing his ever memorable sardonic smirk or his lazy handsome smile? Perhaps those of more brutish tastes, such as myself, are the ones who find Clayton so erotically perfect. Strong, fierce, noble, and captivating; only a few of the endearing qualities Clayton forever posesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful stunning book. Could not put it down","review":"This is one of those books that you just cannot put down. A book that makes you smile and makes you feel good! Absolutely amazing. And it was quite amazing that my husband did not divorce me! But they just have to understand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU!","review":"What a wonderful surprise! I didn't expect additional chapters and scenes! It was a wonderful surprise! Not only in hardback, but also some extra treats! A wonderful read by a wonderful author! I simply loved the book! Many thanks to Judith McNaught and the publisher for re-issueing a hard cover edition! My book collection appreciates it! A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I was going to add my opinion but found there was no need. One only has to read the review written by a lady from Texas, Nov.12.02.It says it all, certainly echos my sentiments exactly.I do normally love this author, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously lacking Romance Well Defined Rounded Characters","review":"Whitney, My Love, Judith McNaught's alleged all time Romance is anything but that. It is a story of domination, cruelty, violence and a foolish heroine. Clayton, the supposed hero, is controlling, violent and without depth. The heroine is foolish, forgiving even rape because she loves this man. Even with the time and location difference, one cannot begin to misconstrue this book as a romance. It is not. I would heartily recommend that anyone looking for a real hero and heroine and to lose oneself in romance, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I honestly don't understand the appeal of this book...","review":"I have been trying to get through this book for over a week and I have given up. I just can't bring myself to finish reading it. I am about half-way through. And I have not even gotten to any of the \\"disturbing\\" scenes yet that other reviewers allude to. Both of the lead characters are unlikeable and exhausting to read about. Whitney is spoiled and annoying and the Duke is basically a creepy stalker. I don't understand their attraction and both characters are not sympathetic at all.I am a huge McNaught fan and count A Kingdom of Dreams, Paradise, Perfect, Something Wonderful, Almost Heaven and Once and Always as fantastic novels. I was sadly disappointed in Whitney My Love. Do read one of her other novels first if you have not read her work yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think about it","review":"First he buys her, then he \\"welts\\" her behind with a riding crop, then he rapes her, then he makes her apologize for not fogiving him fast enough for the rape thing, then he verbally abuses her, then he decided to take their child away from her-but only after she has become attached to it of course, then they live happily ever after. Hmm.. I wonder if Whitney ever got to take Clayton over Her knee for his mistakes. I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney needs a restraining order","review":"This is an absolutely horrible book. The writing is awful and the so-called \\"hero\\" has a narcassistic personality, in addition to being physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive to his wife. At one point in the story he even rapes her! Why the heroine stays with such a person defies any rational person's belief. I've read several reviews of this book and many readers defend the \\"hero's\\" behavior stating that he would never have done such rotten things if he didn't love her so much. Please try to understand that rape and abuse are NOT about love, they are about power. Whitney needs protective custody and Clayton needs to go to jail for spousal abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experience","review":"This is an outstanding book! Whitney, Clayton, Stephen and Nikki are well defined characters. This is not an \\"I know what's going to happen\\" by any means. It teaches a lesson as well. Sometimes what we want isn't what we think we want and people aren't what they seem to be.Only problem I had with this book is this NEW version actually drags on. The author adds about 75 pages of fuller. Though she sets up her other two books, 'Kingdom of Dreams' and 'Until You' she took away from the main characters. What was the message you wre trying to make with \\"the Stephen pages\\".Judith McNaught is an excellent storyteller I love her historical and modern romances but the Classics should be left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not McNaught's Best Effort...","review":"Whitney, My Love is a well-written book, but I just couldn't get into the romance of the main characters. They fought way too much and were down right mean to each other most of the time. I like my romances to have some soft, tender moments, and this novel had very few. Whitney and Clayton were always at odds and it wore thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too irritating.","review":"I found the characters unsympathetic. They both loved to be surrounded by adoring crowds of the opposite sex, but they never saw them as people with feelings. They constantly used and discarded other people without any qualms.The tension from the repeated misunderstandings was overdone. It was just too much. When Clayton and Whitney finally got married, that should have been the end of the story. Instead, a whole new misunderstanding pops up. By this point, I was tired of it. Why haven't these two learned their lesson yet? Why don't they just talk to each other instead of jumping to ridiculous conclusions?In the end I was left with the impression these two self-absorbed, annoying people deserve each other and the rest of us deserve to be spared any further glimpses into their shallow, narcissistic lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid LG bluray","review":"First, I ordered the Bd550 as a Christmas present for my mother-in-law. I went to her house to set her up with Netflix, only to discover it is WAN only and did not include Netflix. So, I returned it, spent a hundred extra dollars for the bd570.First of all, this thing is slow. I could rewind a VHS and watch it before this one even recognizes the disc. Second, it wouldn't let me access any of the internet or setup functions without putting in a disc first.The real problem was its failure to recognize several full strength networks, then when it finally found my router (less than 10 feet away), it wouldn't access the internet. This is for both push button and manual setup.LG support was no help at all. They blamed it on ATT. When ATT could not help with it, (4 hours later), I went to Costco and bought the 3d ready sony.The Sony plugged right in, started up in about three seconds, went straight to easy setup.

Re-read at least twice yearly. Pulls at the heart strings in the same manner as Scalett and Rhett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Classic","review":"McNaught's writing is captivating. So emotionally touching yet light and humorous at times. I fell in love with the characters and soon after finishing the book the day I began it, I told everyone I knew about the book. I encouraged a lot of my friends to read it and they all enjoyed it. It's always fun to read about a head-strong heroine and a dashing, devilishly-handsome duke. But McNaught did not only make the book a fun read but emotionally stirring and completely satisfying as well. I enjoyed every word and greatly enjoyed her sequels to this story as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY","review":"This book is not worth the money.After spending one hour on it I was already regretting it.First of all the the main character Whitney is not the type of herione that you would think of in this story.She is flighty,childish, and wild.The man she is supposed to marry is much older and is supposed to fall in love with her and she doesnt even know him.This story has too many twists and events that are not even logical,and sometimes makes you hate the hroes charecter,insteading of liking our hero.All in all the book is not worth the effort,the time,or the money either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be love??","review":"I hated this book. This is a story about two people treating each other badly, then having lots of sex, and suddenly living happily ever after. The end. This book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney My Love","review":"This is a grand historical. McNaught manages to touch on every emotion in this book. I laughed, I cried, fell in love, and laughed again. She is a master of emotions and quirky characters that you really relate to. If you like this one try the second Until You, but it's not as good as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"After reading this book, I personally felt: sorry for Nicky, pity for Whitney, and disgust for Clayton. Their story is disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clayton not a model character","review":"I read this book a second time around and I found some problems. Frankly I think Clayton was too controlling and a little deranged. I couldn't see the love between Whitney and Clayton. Why would she fall in love with this character. I cannot understand why Whitney would fall for this man. Forget for now the fact that he rapes her, but he doesn't trust her after their marriage. The ending didn't leave me feeling warm and cozy. Frankly I couldn't see a \\"they lived happily ever after\\" all I could see was more stupid misunderstandings that aren't discussed and assumptionss are made. And the rape scene does bother me. It wasn't necessary and it further adds to my disgust of Clayton. I wish McNaught would stop writing about characters that arre tall dark handsome and rich and stopped using the misunderstanding formula over and over again. There is so much readers can bare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, One dimensional ...Hero??","review":"After reading the reviews of Whitney, My Love, I eagerly awaited my copy. Sadly, this book was by far the worst I have read by Judith McNaught. Clayton Westmoreland, is supposed to be the hero of this story, but he is anything but that. He is manipulative, and dark. McNaught wrote him as one dimensional...a man who believes anyone and everything can be bought and owned. He is violent as evidenced by the rape of Whitney and subsequent dismissal of her with a large check. This is romance???? This is a hero???? I think not!! Thank goodness McNaught got so much better the more books she turned out. If you are interested in McNaught's books, let me recommend \\"Almost Heaven\\" or \\"Until you\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"thirty-something","review":"I've never written a review on the thousands of books I've read, but feel compelled to send a message to anyone listening: I find this story unacceptable! I first read this book in my twenties and have reread a couple times since. I really, really wanted these two people to have a happy story. But you know what? They didn't. I can try to rewrite it in my mind, have Clayton grow some morals, have Whitney bail and marry Nikki or Stephen...but that's not the way the book was written (or rewritten). Despite the engaging characters, well written and dramatic scenes, and wonderful author, I feel very strongly that this was a \\"bad\\" book. Abuse and more abuse is not romantic at all. More disturbing than the book itself is its seeming popularity. As readers of the romantic genre, we are the WORLDS largest book buying audience. If you agree that abuse should not be condoned, let your voice be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Duke is a Misogynist","review":"It's taken me a long time to write a review of this book. The first time I read \\"Whitney\\" I was won over by the seeming romance between the main characters; it was also my first book by McNaught and her writing style was unfamiliar. Then, sometime later, I read it again and began to see the unmistakable ugliness of this story. There's something of a romance factor here but the cruelty, and yes, the rape, condemn this book to the trash bin. I also read the two sister books to \\"Whitney\\" and feel the same about them, especially \\"Until You.\\" Stephen was something of a sympathetic character in \\"Whitney;\\" in his story, he's nothing short of a beast with no redeeming beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment!!","review":"Judith McNaught is one of my favorite authors. However, I do not recommend this book to anyone. What I don't understand is why there are so many people that love this book. The central character \\"Clayton\\" is a spoiled, selfish man. I didn't care for the relationship between the two central characters. Not to mention that Clayton rapes Whitney. Skip this book. Any of McNaught's other books are far superior to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"rotten","review":"I was appalled by this book. Clayton treats Whitney like dirt throughout about 3/4 of it. I couldn't believe he actually rapes her! And then through a ridiculous and frustrating misunderstanding, feels justified to behave badly to her in the last quarter. If they actually communicated they may have had an easier life. He should have been made to suffer, long and hard, the arrogant so and so. This one has been consigned to the dustbin."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite romance novel of all time","review":"I loved this book--McNaught nailed the romance formula with getting you to love and hate the Duke of Claymore. Wanting him when you knew you should loath him. Loved the up and down turmoil, just enough misunderstanding that you didn't get frustrated. I kept picturing Rhett Butler as Clayton Westmoreland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching for another just like this one!","review":"This book was fabulous! I have yet to find another book with this writing style. Judith McNaught writes so descriptively about the beautiful scenery. it is like u are there. I love stories about ugly ducklings and the guy is mesmerized when he finally sees her years later. I also loved how Whitney went to Paris. It is my favorite book next to Kingdom of Dreams. I am still searching for another author who writes like Judith - a real page turner like Judith's books. With beautiful scenery and you are into the book as soon as you read the first few pages. This book and Kingdom of Dreams- I can still remember the stories years later. THE BEST!If anyone out there understands what I am saying and you were lucky enough to find another book or author with this similar storyline (only historical romances) and descriptive scenery, I'd LOVE to here from u: barebones@worldnet.att.netThanks alot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Exiting","review":"Whitney,My Love was a very entertaining read.How can a young girl get into so much trouble!She in the end finds out the true meaning of love not just infatuation.I recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about romance in England in the time of Lords and Ladies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Love Story","review":"I have now read Whitney My Love twice within a 3 week period. I find it so utterly romantic. It took my breath away. The characters are so real, they practically jump off the pages. I find it the best love story I have ever read. I immediately bought more of Judith McNaughts novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Defense of the Novel","review":"I have noticed while reading the reviews that many people were concerned with the rape scene within the novel. Be warned, it is there and if it bothers you, don't read the novel. However, I don't believe that anyone could disagree that Judish McNaught has a writing style all her own and completely incredible. The usage of dialogue in the novel is so tear-wrenching, hilarious, and dramatic that it helps the novel and the writer's style out incredibly. The rape scene, although I don't condone it, added to the book. It made the story only that much more... the word to use would be suspenseful. It really makes you wonder whether they'll end up together in the end..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clayton= wife beater","review":"Judith Mcnaught went very wrong when she wrote the character of Clayton. I cant understand how people could like his character, he is abusive and controlling, and treats Whitney like dirt. Of course, Whitney doesnt seem to notice this... At one point Clayton actually beats Whitney with a horsewhip, later he seduce/rapes her, and then accuses her of adultery. If Whitney had any brains she would have married Paul! Now if Clayton had been the villian of the story, i think this might have been a pretty good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUSTANDING","review":"My friend had been telling me for months that I needed to read this book, and I finally did. My only regret is that I waited so long. Emotions simply radiate from the pages, and I found myself reading for hours on end, until I physically couldn't read any longer! A truly entertainig and refreshing love story, balanced with humor and tears, and a few unexpected twists. I was surprised to see how many people were angry with the rape scene. However, I'd like to point out that you can turn on the TV or go to the movies and see far worse. Not that this excuses the rape, but it is fiction, and should be taken as part of the story, nothing more. You will fall in love with Clayton and Whitney, just like the rest of us! A classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent Rape does not Equal Romance","review":"This book was great until the hero hauled the heroine off to brutally and violently rape her. Definitely not my idea of a romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"From abusive father to abusive husband","review":"I read this book in my early teen years.I remember that I hated the hero Clayton for his cruel treatment of Whitney.The heroine Whitney got on my nerves for letting him get away with alot of crap and generally behaving like someone with battered woman's syndrome which in hindsight I think she was a battered woman.It started off very promising but went downhill before too long.I was terrified to read A kingdom of Dreams by JM because of this book,it tells the story of Clay's ancestors Royce and Jennifer the first duke and duchess of Westmoreland.In comparison to this loutish brute Royce is a gentleman.I gave this book two stars because it had a promising start. If you want to read about a husband mistreating and constantly berating and humiliating his wife and the wife taking all this abuse as if it is her due then buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is unsettling","review":"I finished this book last night and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I found Clayton's treatment of Whitney to be unforgiveable. On both occasions he never once gave her a chance to defend herself. I find it completely unbelieveable that she would forgive him after his horrible treatment. I actually liked Clayton's character until he abused Whitney. I am surprised the author would choose to make her leading man such a Jeykl and Hyde personality midway through the novel. I really wanted to like this book, but is has left a bitter taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I just loved the first part of this book. McNaught's writing is superb. Her historical descriptions are vividly constructed, and the characters seem to jump right off the page. However, when I reached the rape scene, I was disturbed. I was rooting for the Duke to win Whitney's heart until that part. It's a shame that such a lovely book was ruined (at least for me) by just one scene. Perhaps if the Duke were some sort of barbarian character, it could be understandable in the plot, but considering his rank and his feelings toward Whitney prior to this scene, it just didn't fit. Of course, opinions may differ. This is just a book. I'll be glad to try some of McNaught's other books as she is a masterful writer and does an excellent job drawing the reader into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This is a classic! Judith McNaught is such a talented writer. This is one of those books you just can't put down!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops in Romance","review":"Whitney My Love has me now hooked on Romance novels. I have read 4 other Judith McNaught books, but this one is by far my Favorite. I love her style of hard times, to bliss. Whitney is such a strong character, as is Clayton Westmoreland. Both of these characters are very misunderstood, until the end. It reminds me of Pride and Prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best developed characters in all of McNaughts novels.","review":"In this book, Judith McNaught develops her main characters well and weaves an intricate series of plots that keep the reader enthralled. I wish she would spend more time on her newer books to regain this wonderful blend of character and blot which characterize this, her first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I read Once and Always and I am hooked. I loved the new version of Whitney, My Love. I loved the fact that it is in hardcover. It made me think that I was reading it for the first time. I am so happy that she ended it differently. It couldn't have been a more perfect ending. Readers should diffently read both versions of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mass of contradictions","review":"It's so wishy washy how both characters are.First he realizes that she's untouched when she wouldn't let him get to second base. Fast forward 6 chapters where he's furious when he hears a rumor she's slept with dozens of men.Second, she loves Paul. No Nicholas. No Paul. No Claremont. NO Paul. No Claremont. Hate Claremont. No love him. Hate him again. Then Marry him. Then hate him again. Then Love him. UGH.Then there's this back and forth of will they and won't they after he basically rapes her, that really is a mess of a time.Then he thinks she's pregnant with a bastard child. And figures out that 8 months was the engagement time she asked for and she wouldn't be THAT much of an idiot if she was pregnant. So he runs to her begging for forgiveness which she gives easily.If this was a real couple, they would die by murder suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"should i be happy for them?!","review":"I don't generally tend towards romance novels, but I read this one out of a need for something fluffy...and came away from the experience quite disturbed. Here's a sample of why: in the course of this book, the \\"hero\\" spanks the girl, all but rapes her, then (when they finally marry) puts her through further emotional torture with his suspicion that he is not the father of the baby she's carrying. And during this mess, we are to root for this couple? Clayton has serious anger-management and communication issues; Whitney is a wilfull heroine at the beginning, but becomes overly submissive toward the middle. Some of her actions made me want to shake her for being so stupid! Their eventual happiness is unbelievable, and I doubt long-lasting, judging by the pattern of their relationship as depicted in this book.One last thought: I agree with all the reviewers who said she should have married Nicki...I know I would have."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"This is one of my top 5 romance favorites. I loved the characters and had withdrawal when I finished. It is definitely one I will read over and over again.That said, I do have a major issue with how the hero refers to the heroine as \\"little one\\"????? I just cringed every time I had to read this. It made the story feel a little perverted in such a bad way! What is McNaught's thing about child brides and little ones? I bought my own copy of the book and put a black marker through every single \\"little one\\" I could find. Now it is the great book worthy of the 5+ stars I gave it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the best","review":"This is the book that started it all. This was the first time I had heard of Judith McNaught and I fell so hard for Whitney and Clayton that I have eagerly awaited McNaught's every book. Her characters are unique -- believable, funny, charming and this story, in particular, makes you want to fall in love all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This is a wonderful historical novel. I loved it and always seem to go back and reread it time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney is JM's strongest female character.","review":"Whitney Stone is my favorite female JM character. She is strong-willed, opinionated, and unafraid of anything. No matter what is thrown in her way, she rises above it. I love the fact that she stands up to Clayton Westmoreland in each of their encounters. Clayton, however, is not a favorite of mine. Twice, he tries and convicts Whitney of something in his mind, without going to her and telling her of what she is accused of. At the end, Clayton is less arrogant, but the things he does throughout the book kept me from liking him much. I like his brother, Stephen, much better, and I enjoyed Until You much more. Stephen is more likeable than his brother, even when he is being less than likeable. And Stephen is a sweetheart in Whitney, My Love, especially because he helps his brother and Whitney find their way back to each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I am very disappointed in this book I have read nearly all of Judith McNaught's books and have loved them all I have read Until You and Miracles - the two sequals to Whitney my Love and I thoroughly enjoyed them.I do not know what happened to this one, first of all - there is no need at all for rape even if it is committed by an act of love, the book seemed to be more about lust and sex than love. I think it was rather stupid to have them breaking up again after they had declared their love for each other. I actually don't think Clayton would have skipped to that conclusion after reading the letter. It was rather far fetched and it made the story drag on too long.certainly not one of her best!! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS EVERYONE SO EXCITED ABOUT?","review":"I have read some of McNaught books and I have to say that I am generally okay with the characters and the plot; this book, however, was just stupid. Whitney is an idiotic doormat who let Clayton verbally and physically abuse her and yet she still loves the man! They have therapy available for someone like her. Usually the heroines in McNaught's books forgive the heros much too easily. The hero always jumps to some sort of conclusion and misunderstanding, insults the heroine terribly, then says sorry when he finds her. Just like that and she melts. This book is not any different. I generally give her books a 3 star, but the hero in this book is far more creepy than her usual ones. Save your money and take a pass on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read more reviews before buying it!","review":"I wish I had read Dr W. Richards \\"wmr-uk\\"'s review before I bought the book. The beginning of the novel was OK--not great, but OK. Then came \\"that scene.\\" I was so disgusted, disturbed, disillusioned that I wanted to throw the book across the room. The problem is that I was almost as disgusted with the victim as with her rapist! I couldn't read beyond that scene, but from other reviews, I gather that Clayton doesn't improve much--nor does Whitney. Good heavens, ladies, haven't we come further than to \\"adore\\" a book about rape? to weep with joy when the victim \\"pardons\\" her rapist? If you had asked me yesterday, I would have said that I wasn't really a feminist! But I've discovered that on this issue I am. I plan on throwing my copy of the book away--I wouldn't want any other woman to read it! And what sane woman today would take the chance that a teenage girl (my daughter!) might read this book and think it's romantic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in Dallas","review":"I had heard about this book and decided to give it a try. I was sorely disappointed. The hero,Clayton, has serious anger and power issues. He actually rapes the heroine and after their marriage moves out of their room because he believes she slept with someone before they were even engaged. What a double standard!! He has a reputation for being the biggest seducer in Europe and he (incorrectly) assumes she has slept with someone and feels righteously justified in leaving her, verbally abusing her, and humiliating her. Several times in the book he grabs her and it talks about her being in pain from how he roughly treats her. We're supposed to believe that he loves her soooo much he is driven by jealousy to do these things. I'm sorry, but rape and calling someone a b**ch is NOT love. I can't believe all these people that gave this book such high ratings. What a farse!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing.","review":"I found this book exhausting and disturbing. I kept reading because I knew it was going to be worth it, and then Clayton raped Whitney. After he did that I hated him, and when she wanted him back I hated her. I kept reading though, thinking maybe there was going to be some clever resolution...but then he accused her of being an immoral slut who get herself pregnant with another man's child. I have never wanted a heroine to run away from the hero of a romance novel before, but I found myself mentally pleading with Whitney to run.Clayton has no business in a romance novel. He was abusive, controlling, manipulative and selfish. I can't believe this book got so many glowing reviews. I will never base my book buying on five star reviews again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the thing...","review":"I'm not a picky person, truly. This plot has many flaws, evaluated in great detail by other reviews here, so I shall not reiterate them. These are tolerable in a book in which you are able to form an emotional connection to the main characters and root for their best interests. In this case, I would not have minded a bit if this book had ended with Clayton's carriage going up in a giant fireball, with him in it. This is a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best book!","review":"I can't even begin to put into words how much this book means to me. I'm now working on my third reading copy of it. I can only go a few months and then I'm there picking it up once again for another read. It's a breathtakingly beautiful story. I've loved all of Judith McNaught's books. But Whitney holds a special place in my heart. You won't regret giving it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney","review":"I can only think of one word that actually describes this book,\\"WOW\\". This is the second book I have read by JM, but it is much better than the first(Remember When). This has to be the best historical romance novel I have ever read and I am looking forward to reading all of her novels. I received her name when one of the reviewers held Susan Elizabeth Phillips up to her standards. I must say that she was not mistaken. I have a soft touch for historical novels and this book was absolutely wonderful. I wish only that I could give it more stars. The heroine was great, zesty and full of life. I loved her stubborness and uniqueness. The hero was rugged but gentle, and became a reformed rake. I have only one suggestion. Don't start the book thinking that you can easily put it down because you will scarcely do anything else until you finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Rape scene.","review":"I have been enthralled by all of the Judith McNaught romances I have read so far. Her characters are lively, and the romantic tension is fantastic. But for one not so little thing, I would have given this book 10 stars. The hero rapes the heroine. The rape is base, violent, humiliating. If a man pinning a woman down and raping her makes you as ill as it does me, do not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing but hero gets too mean for my taste","review":"This book is definitely worth reading and sweeps you away. However, in the beginining the hero is devoted beyond all reason and then toward the end he is way too mean -- so be forwarned. . . But still a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy","review":"Judith McNaught, used the write combination on this book, each character was carefully webbed and analize so it would fit perfectly, giving you a book to enjoy. A book that can be enjoy over and over , making you live it every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Although I enjoyed the other Judith McNaught books, Whitney, My Love really disappointed me. Clayton's physical abuse of Whitney was the biggest turn-off. What a brute! I really wanted to like the characters, but with their lack of emotional maturity, I just couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Gentle Reader","review":"This was my first Judith McNaught book and I'm afraid it will be my last. Though the characters were vivid and many parts of the scenery were lovely to imagine, the warped relationship between Whitney and Clayton really turned me off. For instance soon after they met Clayton whipped her with a riding crop and then comforted her while he made his advances. The worse part was when he raped her and she still wanted him. Their relationship was very dysfunctional and consisted of repeated false accusations between them that were unbelievable. The hero in this book was impossible for me to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to put down","review":"From the moment i picked it up, 'whitney, my love' was hard to put down, I even spent most of the night up readin it saying one more chapter and then going to bed.A story of obsession, devotion, hatered, distrust and love all roled into one. This is the story of Clayton Westmoreland and Whitney Stone. From the moment Clayton met Whitney, he was drawn to her, and she had nothing but contempt for him. She arrives home to england to home, father and and unknown of betothel.In this book it is a battle of wills between Clayton and Whitney, neither wanting to give in to the other, and yet both loving eachother (albeit more than they would like to admit). Overall, this was an excelllent read, and one of McNaughts finest that I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"Excellent book... it seems you can't relax until the end. The last few pages were a bit slow but I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HAVE NEVER READ A ROMANCE NOVEL TWICE....","review":"UNTIL I GOT MY HANDS ON \\"WHITNEY MY LOVE\\". The story camptured my attention from the beginning. It took me 5 hours to read. I had so much fun.Have you ever read a book and go through the five seasons of emotions before? I was lauging, I was crying, I was triumphant and I was really attracted to the hero so much so I wanted to kill him, then I love him painfully. My hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strenght in characters without unrealistic abilities.","review":"This was the first Romance novel I read. A co-worker gave me the book and told me to stop laughing at her reading material and give Romance novels a chance. As my co-worker suspected, I enjoyed this book. However, I am sorely disappointed when I look for new McNaught titles; they are few and far between. I am pleased that Ms. McNaught doesn't mass produce so-so books. This is a rare treat. Give me qualilty over quantity. I have passed this book along to several other people to enjoy, and like me, they were enthralled. I hope that Ms. McNaught has a new book on the horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been really really good...","review":"I first read this book when I was about fourteen years old and seriously getting into a marathon romance novel read-a-thon, that as yet hasn't abated (though it's tapered off a bit). At the time, I thought this book was great--had sex, had good writing, some humor, etc. The rape and whipping scenes struck a slightly discordant note, but I ignored them and read and reread the book. My copy of the book was mislaid, but then I saw it in some superstore and started reading it again. The humor was still there, the overall quality of the writing was still there, but the overwhelming darkness of the codependent and abusive relationship between Whitney and Clayton was too much to ignore or overlook once again. Rape is NOT romance or a \\"crime of passion.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely ridiculous...","review":"I admit that most romance novels are not very realistic, (that's probably why they are so popular) but this book took it to the extreme. I don't care what time period you're living in, it is virtually impossible to fall in love and care for a man who beats you, is verbally abusive, and who sexually violates you! What good qualities did Clayton possess that made Whitney fall in love with him? None, if you ask me, which is why this book is ridiculous. It is simply unbelievable. I hated Clayton from the beginning. He treated Whitney horribly and the fact that she still fell in love with him after all his ill-treatment made me hate her almost as much. It is scary how many people liked this rubbish. Take my advice and skip this infuriating book, unless of course you enjoy reading about violent, controlling, and abusive relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"scary and sad","review":"Whitney My Love was the first book I had to set aside for a day or two before I could actually finish reading it. I was extremely disturbed by the violence in the book. When Clayton spanked Whitney ( who was his love interest, not his child!) it completely turned me off the character. I have read many books where the hero is arrogant and rude and although irritating at times, I've never thrown a book across the room in disgust. The rape scene was very real and left me with my mouth open. I couldn't bleive that Whitney tried to comfort him afterwards because she felt bad he was feeling guilty. This story left me feeling completely outraged that I, as a woman was essentially being told that out of being spanked with a riding crop, and ruthlessly raped, some kind of love could actually exist. I also find it very scary and sad that so many women aren't bothered in the least by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip the Rape Scene (But The Book Was Really Good!)","review":"I simply loved this book! It was so passionate and loving and you really feel for the characters. I would recommend that when it comes to the rape scene, skip pages. But overall, it was very, very good. This ranks as one of my favorite novels of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its make you laugh and cry at the same time.","review":"This is my all time favorite book. I own every McNaught, Balogh, Garwood, and Dodd book, but I have to admit that Judith McNaught is my all time favorite writer. Whitney, My Love is the first book I've ever read of hers. Her writing style is absolutely captivating. It made my laugh with joy- my heart clench with sorrow. I've read many historical romances, and I can say that not many, if any at all, ever made me cry. Some readers with strong feminist views would object to this book, but keep in mind that the setting is in the regency era. This book was worth every minute of read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Romance of All Time!!","review":"Judith McNaught's Whitney, My Love is one of the Best Books I have read if not the best romance I have read. It actually amazes me that this book does not have five stars. This is one book that I have read over and over againa and it feels like I am reading it for the first time again. Whenever I am looking for a romance book that can give me the emotion and intensity that Whitney, My Love gave me I look for something that reviews and writers say can compare to this book. It is just that good. You will fall in love with Clayton. I recommend this book to anyone who asks me for a awsome book they can read. Read this Book, you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW......I LOVED this book!","review":"This is the best book I've read in a while. I didn't know what to expect. It is a long book and I thought the other Judith McNaught book that I've read had over a hundered of unnecessary pages so I was a bit wary but I'm glad I took the plunge. It was worth reading every page. I loved the characters, especially the heroine. McNaught made her so real and I felt as though I knew her character so well. It was heart-wrenching and took a lot of turns, and I liked all of the characters and was never bored. We all encounter and make mistakes in life in some way or another...this book reflects that aspect of life. That's what makes it more real and more appealing to me as a reader. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story that you will remember.","review":"If you want a book to remember and ponder on after you read it \\"Whitney My Love\\" is for you. The story takes place during \\"the regency\\" period. All the characters are well developed allowing you to detest some of them, fall in love with others, and even want to throttle or cry for the ones you do like. In this story characters have flaws, make mistakes, accidentally hurt people they care about which makes it even more realistic bringing you closer to them. There is more than one amazing character to fall in love with the heroine again making the story that much more life like and special. The author definately knows how to the reader and their emotions. Lots of humor and whitty dialogue too. I enjoyed the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape Has No Place In Romance","review":"This is the very first book I ever wanted to destroy after reading it. I read and enjoyed both Almost Heaven and Something Wonderful before I picked up Whitney My Love. However, I was shocked and gravely disappointed by this book. This book would be laughable if it weren't so hurtful. Clayton first rapes Whitney then blames her when she gets pregnant after the encounter. How could anyone love a man like that. How could anyone feel anything but discust for such violent scum. Unfortunatly, Whitney not only continues to love him, but welcomes him back and apologizes. Clayton eventually sees the error of his ways but as far as I'm concerned it was far too little, far too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"After hearing praises of McNaught's work, and several recommendations to start with Whitney, My Love, I expected this would be at least bearable. Instead, I have it as one of the few labeled \\"BAD\\" on my personal list. Hard to make it to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but slightly degrading to women.","review":"I recently started reading Judith McNaught a few months ago when recommended by a friend. I began with Until You and so, when I realized there was a prequel, went back to read Whitney, My Love. Well, I absolutely loved the charming hero and very quick-minded heroine, but I must say I was upset at the role of Whitney. After Clayton practically rapes her, she believes she has done him wrong, pitys him, and runs to him to grovel and beg for his forgiveness. I would have been happy to see a little more effort on his part. But I was happy with the ending. A must read for all McNaught fans! Other JM favorites include Almost Heaven and Once and Always."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't give it any stars, but you can't go lower","review":"This novel glorifies the abuse of women -- physical and emotional -- and is disgusting in its portrayal of the devastation and humiliation of a woman as \\"love.\\" Not a love story. Not well written. Not romantic. It's books like this that give the romance genre a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bitter Regency Romance","review":"This is a really good book to read as an example of how NOT to have a relationship. The hero, Clayton, is rude and abusive to the herionne, Whitney. He treats her like an object, verbally abuses her, rapes her, and as a grand finale, she has to beg HIM to take her back. WTF? While the writing was decent, the rape scene in this book really turned me off from the book. Clayton was supposed to be the hero, for god's sake! Heroes don't rape the heroinne. I don't care what the era was. It was inappropriate behaviour then, and it certainly is inappropriate behaviour now. The two have a sick relationship based on control. There is no real emotion binding them. This is a better book for psych majors to study than for romance readers to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"urgh...","review":"\\"What do people see in this book?\\" I ask myself.After reading some of the hype about this novel I decided with some enthusiasm to give it a go. And what a disappointment. Whitney was a spineless pain in the neck and the \\"hero\\" (and I use that term very generally) was an arrogant, selfish, loathsome rapist. I managed to get through the book through an act of diabolical masochism.Even the worst of Jude Deveraux smells like roses next to this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"If you enjoy a books about abusive relationships where the hero physically and mentally abuses the heroine throughout (as well as rape her) then this is the book for you. If not, I suggest that you steer well clear of it. The 'hero' Clayton jumps to wild and inaccurate assumptions about the heroine Whitney and then subjects her to his anger without explanation. Whitney on the other hand over looks a perfectly lovely man in France who would have been much better off cast in the hero role in this book. The type of 'love' written about in this book is disturbing, avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't seem to feel as strongly as most about this book...","review":"It seems that most people either loved or hated this book. It could have been a wonderful romance. I did enjoy it, but it was dragged out. And there were just one to many \\"misunderstandings\\". The last one really ruined it for me. After they had been married and so happy for all those months for him to think that she never really loved him and only wanted to marry him because she was pregnant with someone else's child. Then when it started on Stephen's romance I thought that should have been another book altogether. Overall the book was very entertaining and I did not want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a Readable Author but...Wow, Some Big Flaws!","review":"The main problem with this story is the rape scene and that the hero never quite redeems himself. Sometimes I read McNaught's books and I don't think she really likes women very much. Or just has a poor view of them as a whole. Like the heroine can do something small which just sets the hero off on some rage where he does something pretty atrocious. And then the heroine has to apologize or do something to help the hero forgive himself. I don't know; it's a little fishy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I am new to Judith McNaught, but having recently finished \\"Until You\\", which I thoroughly enjoyed, I wanted to read about the characters when they were first introduced. So I went to \\"Whitney, My Love\\". I'm sorry I did. I couldn't even finish it. In \\"Until You\\", Whitney and Clayton are so loving and have such humor and obvious attraction in their marriage - in \\"Whitney\\", I can't see how they arrived there. Looking at the other reviews I guess I have obviously missed the boat. Although some reviewers agree with me. Really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!!!","review":"First of all this was the most boring book ever. it dragged on and on. And when it wasn't boring it made you want to throw up. This book is about an EVIL man who beats rapes and physicologicaly abuses a poor young woman who in the beginning of the book has so much spirit only to be broken by this visious villon. And they live happily ever after...Fa la la la...... WHAT???!!! DONT WAIST YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!! unless your gonna burn it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"At first the book was awesome. Whitney really made me laugh. But towards the end is a huge disappointment. I've never expected Whitney to be so much in love with Clayton that she forgave everything he did to her, including rape. That's hard to believe!!

I thought Clayton and Whitney were perfect for each other. I thought Whitney took a little long to figure this out but eventually she came around and I loved Clayton knowing she was the one for him and going after her.

I found the book was very good to learn from by example. I would recommend it to anyone who has had programming experience before and is just starting out on Python to quickly grasp new areas of the language. I would also recommend this to intermediate Python programmers as a resource for being able to quickly identify common problems and elegant solutions to them. I found the book very easy to understand, despite my lack of prior exposure to the language and I felt like it was a very good learning experience.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of an encylopedia than a cookbook","review":"This book is more like an encyclopedia than a cookbook - each section is introduced and written in a different style and different sections are stronger and more cohesive than others. Some sections are bursting at the hinges and others feel like they are incomplete (like the algorithms section).The introductions to each chapter alone are worth the price of the book. Each introduction is written by a different Pythonic luminari, such as Fredrik Lundh, Tim Peters, Alex Martelli, Guido van Rossum and many others. These literary pieces are insightful, humorous and excellent.I love python, it follows Albert Einstein's principle Everything should be as simple as it is, but not simpler .

Some areas are rambling and uninformative, others are abbreviated to the point of unusability, and most are simply rehashes of what can be found on the web.Compared to the \\"Perl Cookbook\\" or other well-done O'Reilly books, the recipes are not for the Python novice. Maybe not even for the intermediate Python programmer.Rather than have a top-level \\"problem\\" with a simple \\"how-to-do-it\\" example and a discussion of any alternate methods or fine points, most of the entries are rambling discussions of one module or another rather than \\"how-to\\" recipes.Awful, for most of my purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Programming Companion","review":"I had the opportunity to skim through this book before I purchased it and found that it had several very practical, usable and understandable examples (\\"recipes\\").

I really tried, thinking it's bound to get better, but let's just say it's not worth the effort. I read a lot of books and I love courtroom drama, but I was not able to even like this father and daughter lawyer duo at all. The plot is so slow and boring. The only other book I have read by this author was her book \\"The Good Children\\" and it read like something one would read in high school, which is fine if you're in high school,but I am not. I tried one of her legal thrillers as they are all hyped to be so great but I will not waste money on another. Very disappointing.

This is a typical homoerotic film that is nice-looking despite its non-Hollywood budget.Though supposedly based on a real story, the film is purposely anachronistic. For example, two Napoleonesque European soldiers drive a jeep into a scene. The anachronisms are meant to be artsy.I thought this movie would basically say that in a rampantly homophobic time and in a trenchantly racist region, an interracial [...] male couple are true risk takers. However, this film was a lot of very little. I found myself yawning all the way through it.

This is 1000x worse than Mike Jones' cd. They ruined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, middle-aged lonelyhearts","review":"I couldn't wait to be finished with this book. I only continued after the 18th chapter because of the time invested; and there's 44 of them! What a waste of time. The story moves quickly enough; for some characters their lives moved within a matter of sentences, others times you are dragged through the emotional pathos and dysfunction for pages. Every character in the book has had or is having some crisis that steers the course of their lives. These women are all looking for 'love', but will take shallow, self-serving, non-committal sex in it's place, and places the reader in a postion to pity them when it doesn't work out. The weekly 'pity party' these characters have lures you into thinking there is a true commaraderie; only to discover it's pathetic agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did I buy this?","review":"I've watched most of Makoto Shinkai's stuff, from the short She and Her Cat to 5 Centimeters per Second, and I really, really wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, just like the rest, it was a content let down. Visually appealing, yes, but the disjointed and unoriginal story line, unmemorable characters and the ending - a \\"that was it?\\" ending - left me thinking I wish I'd spent my $30 on something else. You shouldn't watch something and think \\"I've seen this done and done better in another movie\\". Say, something Hiyao Miyazaki, perhaps? Save yourself some frustrations and some money. This is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawai'i Place Names","review":"I am very disappointed with this book. I wanted information about the place names, but what I got was nothing more than information about the places. I want meanings, background, and information about the names. The only reason I gave two stars rather than one is that the descriptions of what one finds at each of these places is interesting and may be useful to some people. The title of this book is quite misleading. Not recommended for anyone who actually wants to know about Hawaiian place names."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book well worth the time to read","review":"The book shows the horror an Amish family faces when one of their children, Samuel, is horribly injured. It also shows how the community, no matter what their faith, came together to help the child and his family. It is truly heart-warming to see how everyone came together. If you have never learned anything about the Amish, the book also gives you a bit of insight into their lives. It is a very good read and well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good workout with gloves","review":"The gloves are comfortable and turn swimming into a bigger workout. There are two things that would improve these gloves. 1. Exposed so I could fix my mask or snorkle etc. This way I have to remove the gloves to do that and these gloves are not easy to put on or off. 2. Make them out of a UV material.

Now it's a completely different tea! This new tea is not satisfying at all unless of course you want to feel like you're brushing your teeth instead of drinking tea.Celestial Seasonings really shouldn't claim this to be the same tea because it really isn't. That's too bad considering it got the company started and all.

Anything with hibiscus and especially rosehips is a must for me. Red Zinger tea did not disappoint! It reminds me of an \\"adult fruit punch\\" because it tastes a lot like fruit punch from the wild cherry bark and the rosehips, but the hibiscus and the peppermint give it a nice herbal flair. The reason why I opted to give this four stars rather than five is because, even though it's delicious, I felt that this tea was a little too overpowering for me at first. Then my best friend gave me a really good idea--split one tea bag between two cups of tea. Not only does this make this delicious tea last a little longer, but splitting one bag between two cups gives me just the right amount of flavor that I want. Very nice tea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stores with no product","review":"I live in a very rural area and there are no stores within 40 miles that carry Red Zinger tea.

I have applied this cream to my scars for several weeks now. The skin around the scars has become very supple and soft. The cream absorbs well and is not oily. It does not change the color of the scars (that will fade in time) but it surely makes them more comfortable. Several people have said this cream has a bad smell. I did not think so, just a natural smell. If you are looking for a perfumed product this is not what you want.

It was in an ordinary grocery store, at least, at that time! After using it for several days, I noticed that the light brown spots on my aging hands had faded considerably and, of course, my skin was much smoother and softer. This particular version of the \\"E Creme\\" from Jason contained zero alcohol, so there was nothing that would dry the skin. This product is well worth looking for if at first you don't find it; I had not found anything else that works like this one does. Also, it goes into the skin fairly swiftly, doesn't smell and it's a cream, not a lotion. My dermatologist showed me the difference between a cream and a lotion, educating me about \\"getting more bang for the buck\\" from a cream. A little bit of this product goes a long way. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich--but not for daily use","review":"I prefer the 5,000 IU creme over this 25,000 IU. I have dry skin, but this product is much too heavy to use on my face.

I also mix the two on my hand when I need a heavier application."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I started using this when I was pregnant on my belly to avoid stretch marks.

Big mistake! This video only includes a 4 minutes segment with the baby and it is lame! So, if you are looking for something fun to do with your baby, this is not it. Also, it involves a step portion so if you don't have a step then you will not be able to do the entire cardio portion. It also requires free weights or an xertube which you can get with a different version but I was not aware of this so I could not do the weight portion.

The first part was hard for me to understand, not because it's poorly written, but because the subject is very difficult. The second part I found very flawed. The author seems determined to show that the brain is not just a computer, and gives all benefit of the doubt to this theory, and none to any counterarguments. Much of his argument is based on intuition - the conscious mind *seems* to work a certain way, we *feel* that a certain kind of thinking is non-algorithmic - which is not very persuasive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant physicist, flawed reasoning","review":"The book covers a lot of ground, but the grand tour of physics and mathematics is designed primarily to support the author's argument that machines will never be capable of matching human intelligence. The author's main argument for this is based on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. Unfortunately, this argument is just plain wrong. It assumes (without explanation) that human intelligence bypasses the limitations of the theorem in a way that computer intelligence cannot - as if humans somehow know it's better to be incomplete than inconsistent. The presentation of 'alternative' theories about the physical nature of intelligence seem unnecessary when the central argument falls down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spaguetti writting, weak arguments, mostly physics.","review":"This book was recomended to me and some colleagues when I was in college. I read it after college, tho, and I think it's probably the worse science-divulgation book I've ever read. The writting is messy (\\"check page xxx back there\\", or \\"will be further discussed in chapter yyy\\"), the AI arguments he presents are weak and were long refuted (just search the net), and his \\"insinuation\\" that there are quantic processes involved in out mind is totally without fundament/proof - pure speculation. The book is mostly about physics (with some depth to it), and hard to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verbose, Pretentious and Great","review":"It is probably his use of the Weyl tensor in cosmology that most sets this book apart.

The final conclusion is this: Scientists don't understand consciousness; another area of poorly-understood scientific inquiry is quantum gravity...therefore, the two must be related somehow. As an intellectual exercise this book is extremely disappointing, and I urge readers with even a remote interest in the subject matter to immediately purchase Douglas R.

I picked it up while waiting on line to buy groceries at the supermarket. If the full version is anything like the condensed version, then I am sure that you cannot go wrong with this book. The title caught my attention. I am sure glad that I bought the book because it really gives you some helpful advice about getting the most out of your day. For example, we all know about writing to do lists. But this book takes that idea a step further and tells you to actually schedule the time that you will be doing the tasks and to schedule the time that you will finish the tasks. I found that just by following this one piece of advice I was able to get more things done from my to do list.

The resolution pulls everything together in a very touching ending. The first viewing can be difficult and confusing, almost Hitchcockian; it is definitely a movie that continues to improve on reviewing. Dan Futterman (Charlie) is excellent, hot ... especially in his underware. The use of \\"Urban Legends\\" weaving their way through the movie is a great pleasure. If you view a movie just once, it's a movie worth watching. If you are a movie rewatcher, Urbania grows better with each watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up","review":"I must be dense because I did not get it.

This book is more for people who suspect they might have hyperthyroidism and would like to know more about it or who have been recently diagnosed but know little about it. If you are like me and have had this condition for quite sometime, then you already know the signs, symptoms and typical treatments which can all be found for free on the internet. What I had hoped it would cover were in-depth methods on how to control hyperthyroidism using alternative methods. It barely touches the surface. There is a section on the Johnson Nutritional Protocol and the theory of hyperthyroidism being a nutritional disease. Again, better off going to the ithyroid website for free to read about this.

Following characters is difficult, and much of the book is taken up to boiling close to a dozen names down to two people. Much of the book is devoted to our hero's search for these mythical characters, while dodging occasional asassination attempts. These searches are punctuated by visits to the real villans of the piece, with a slow and confusing unfolding of events leading up to the typical Modesitt climax, best described as \\"Hunting Rabbits With A Howitzer\\". Another peculiarity is his introduction of a second \\"first person\\" individual, and jumping back and forth between the two (it usually took me to the second paragraph of the chapter to find out who I was at the time. I'm a Modesitt fan, but it will take me two or three more readings to settle on who was doing what, to whom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted and Clunky","review":"The plot is murky and convoluted and the prose is exceptionaly clunky. The few scenes of action are bogged down by the weight of the prose.

From the hero's name comes the first clue- think John Donne. Lots of literary references with an emphasis on Donne's work. This book is a sort of \\"time out\\" piece- having fun with English lit history. I think he's just having some fun, but it does create a lot of strain on the story.

Una Merkel is ducky as wisecracking Larraine, and a scene stealing Ginger Rogers is a gem. ALthough I loved her in dramatic roles, stright comedy, and with Fred Astaire, there's something about the way she examplifies a wisecracking-secondlead-chorine that is just so wonderful. I believe that this is one of Ginger's best performances, that goes for the whole cast. A similar film with mostly the same cast, (Ginger, Guy, Ned, Ruby, and Dick Powell, and chorus dancers) and the same famous Busby Berkeley overhead shots, watch Goldiggers of 1933.

It is extremely biased against Poles (the slur \\"Polak\\" is invoked quite often) without even trying to be objective-it even paints the Poles as \\"partners in our destruction\\" (p. 149) which is plain character assasination and not at all based on historic facts.In this way, it contributed to building walls where non should be, it contributes to build obstacles in Jewish-Polish relations. Sheraton knows virtually NOTHING about the rich history of said relationship, she just repeats old stereotyps.So, my advice-save the money You would otherwise spend on this book, go to Poland,visit (if You are Jewish) a synagogue there and get to know some real-life Polish Jews.With the money You have saved through NOT buying this poorly-written book, invite them for dinner.

Would you like to be the control of that study? She hammers that people could get pregnant on their own if they tried longer.

The author brings his teaching experience to present the theory and practice of ICA in a highly accessible form using a duplication of words and straight-forward mathematics.Particular attention is given in the earlier chapters to the description of the linear signal mixing process giving the Reader a good basis for understanding the fundamental assumptions upon which ICA and its application to Blind Source Separation are based.The book is aimed at the Reader with a technical but not necessarily formal mathematics background. Illustrative examples and functional algorithms in MatLab are frequent and references are made to the author's available electronic resources.

While we have only had the chance to use the first stage DVD we can tell you unequivocally that WE ARE CRAZY ABOUT THESE DVD'S!!! Sorry for shouting but these DVD's are awesome. Paul does commentary throughout the whole ride and gives invaluable tips on training for a Century ride, or improving if you've already done a Century. We learned so much on just the first DVD. We love \\"riding with Paul\\" and having him coach us to being better riders. This is unlike any other cycling DVD for your indoor trainer. This is like having your very own coach. We cannot recommend the ERock Rocks DVD's highly enough.Once again, Paul sets the bar and standard for other cycling DVD's. Great job!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I have purchased hundereds of items on Amazon but this is my first review, I'm that passionate about these DVDs. I have tried nearly every spinning/indoor workout DVD out there and these DVDs are by far the best. I get tired of having a guy with a stopwatch yell at me - - these DVDs are so much better; I actually get into the rides. The commentary is helpful and the fact that the narrator is actually doing the workout as well makes a huge difference. After trying Erock Rocks! I bought every one of Paul's DVDs - - I'm ready for Fall and Winter training!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Work-Out, some graphics can be better","review":"I got this item for a gift. It does offer a good work-out and the narration is outstanding. The narrator tells you when you should up your resistance and how it should feel in your pedals. My only complaint is the suggested percentage heart rate number is to small to read from a distance beyond about 7 or 8ft and is in black, while the rpm is in bold red and can be read from 30 feet away. But in all fairness the the narrator does mention what your heart rate percentage should be through-out the video. So, the reason I am only giving this a 4 star is that the some of the graphics are hard to read from a distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Rides","review":"I have bought multiple Paul Gallas videos. This was my first buy and I must say that I do like them. They are definitely challenging, which is one of the key qualities that I like in a cycling video. I like that this comes as a set and if you are crazy or mad, you could technically do all of them one day if you wanted to see if you could survive a century ride. I have survived doing only one of these videos at a time, which was quite challenging since some of them are two hours.If I were to improve these videos, I would want to see more brillant colors. The second thing I value highly in a video is the scenary. Although the scenary is pretty, Paul's Utah videos top these ones. I do like them as an addition to my collection because it mixes it up and by the time I am done, I know that I have knocked it out of the park (TKO)."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet!","review":"I bought these with my trainer and they are one of the better riding DVD's you can buy.

Matthew Lickona writes a very personal and very contemporary set of reflections on his own struggles to live out in his moral life the commitments his faith demands of him.Nothing I have read since Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man so captures the interior life of a practicing Catholic as this.Lickona is not afraid to grow and change before our eyes during this book. It is as rigorous and self-examining as a good confession.Sure it lacks a tight narrative structure and you'll tear through it a couple of days. Think of it as an epistle.People who are close to a Catholic who they don't really understand would also benefit from reading this book. It might all make a little more sense after reading this.Thanks, Matthew."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique, startling, powerful book -- with a real male voice","review":"I am enthralled by this book. The author's a thirty-something dad and remarkable storyteller. He's a smart journalist, but he doesn't wear his erudition on his sleeve. Instead it's caught up in the stories -- of his adolescence, his dealing with a homosexual come-on, his marriage, his bumpy transition to fatherhood, his work, his efforts to control his temper, his discovery of a friend's stash of porn. There's nothing of the pietistic harangue here, nothing syrupy or over-spiritualized, no theological tsk-tsking of an over-clericalized androgynous layperson. Instead, we encounter a real feet-on-the ground, normal-male, living-in-the-word, lay spirituality. This book is so unusal that it's startling. My only caveat, and this is small: If you're the kind of person who's put off by slightly off-color language, you might take occasional offense."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for the effort","review":"Anyone who can spend the time writing a book deserves a star just for the effort, and with this book, that's about it. If your faith doesn't go any deeper than following the rule book and waiting for the next dictate to follow from Rome then this collection of faith based essays is for you. Unfortunately Matthew Lickona seemed to get stuck somewhere along the process of building his spirituality and decided that he needed to take an unquestioning, dogmatic approach to faith. As a former seminarian who has spent years tossing around faith based issues I found this book to be simplistic and reminiscent of my days memorizing the catechism. As for taking us to a level that's even a a little below the dogmatic surface....not in these pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judgmental, harsh, and sad","review":"Christ commanded us to love others, to serve the poor.

It is a bit retro looking (but kind of nice in that way). It must be installed carefully and a bit deliberately (easy on wood and a bit more difficult on metal) to assure that it will work well. In regards to the reviewer who had so much trouble, I belive that there must have been something wrong with the installation, alignment or adjustment -- especially if it resulted in bending the heavy iron hinge unit and pulling out the mounting screws. This item has been manufactured since 1927 and they are widely sold -- so I took the leap even after reading the negative review and I am pleased with the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION - BUYER BEWARE","review":"The first 2 reviews of this product are correct. Although this product has a rugged design, the pivot points are riveted with steel on steel contact. After installing the unit the first problem was that it wouldn't allow the gate to close all the way unless you adjusted the hydraulic cylinder to the point where the gate would slam defeating the whole purpose of the unit.The second problem came after several days of rain, the pivot points which were riveted together began to rust and the unit would not close at all after opened unless forced. A better design would be to at least place some type of nylon washer between the steel links to allow them to pivot easier.So unless you don't mind making modifications to something you just purchased to make it better, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUSTS OUT - INCONSISTENT","review":"I will try not to repeat what is already reviewed here but I just wanted to emphasize a couple of points. First, when it works, it is a thing of beauty, allowing the gate to close gently just like it states.Unfortunately, it does not work all the time, it is very difficult to install and mine only lasted 18 months before it stopped working. When I took it off the fence I could see the tremendous amount of rust throughout. I would not buy this again as I certainly did not wish to spend this amount of money on such a limited time frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Last","review":"At our homeowners association we have 6 pool gates. We have used Kant Slam closers for a few years because we did not know there was anything better and our welding company kept installing them. They have to be replaced about 4-5 times per year and keep blowing hydraulic seals leaking the fluid all over our pool decks. These closers work for the first few days then go out of adjustment, then fall off the gate even though they're welded on. They are pretty much worthless. Try to find soemthing more heavy duty or you will be wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"So far I've gone through three of these. I typically replace them at least once a year now...just outside of warranty. At first what seemed to be the perfect fit for my application has turned into a complete failure.I currently use this product for the facility at work and the \\"closing bar\\" that pushes the gate close as the springs/piston compresses breaks exactly in the same place. It appears that it's a major design flaw given that not enough material or support has been added to the design to keep the stress applied to it from fracturing over time.I don't intend on purchasing this product a 4th time, but actually re-design/re-manufacture what the original OEM has consistently failed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For All Doors","review":"We installed this on a wood frame door and after a few days the wood began to crack on the frame. This product is made well but is not as the package states \\"for all doors\\".I do not doubt that it would work well on an all metal frame door or metal framed gate. The key issue being that the door frame should be able to withstand the compression of the two very powerful springs that the Kant-Slam uses to close the door, upon opening the door these springs compress, and require the frame to be the opposing stress point to push against.Its a little difficult to describe how the Kant Slam functions and the company ([...]) would do well to create a flash video to allow potential users to see it before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly and didn't work reliably","review":"I have a gate to a children's play area in my yard.

My kids struggled to open the gate and it didn't always close all the way. When it did close, its closing motion was not smooth. I finally uninstalled it when ripped the screws holding it out of the wooden gate post. Upon inspection, I found that the mechanism had bent due to the force required to operate the gate with this installed."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"This thing is big, chunky, ugly, and does not work well.

It is a creepy story of a regular boy named Lewis who finds in a steamer trunk, owned by his eccentric neighbor and friend of his uncle, a silver coin. Wearing this coin around his neck he finds that he has summoned an evil presence that seems to be stalking him, and getting closer and closer. A good story, and the characters are very normal, yet in a very eccentric surrounding of wizards, witches, other strange people and objects. While it can get quite creepy in parts, it still is very humorous. I am so sad to find that it is out of print. If anyone out there has children who happen to be lucky enough to own this book, or happen to bring it home from the library, sneak it off their nightstand while they are sleeping and give it a look.

For example, did you know that Anodized Aluminum is 30% harder than Stainless Steel, yet should never be washed in the dishwasher or the hard anodized surface will discolor and fail?Interspersed among cookware facts and suggestions are recipies that will not overwhelm even the fledgeling chef.

After 2 weeks of use, the pot has also started to leak coffee during the brewing process. Something in the lid mechanism appears to get stuck halfway through brewing and the remainder of the coffee just spills all over. Truly not a low-hassle appliance.

If you open it just a little, nothing comes out and if you open it more, make sure you hold onto the top or it will fall off.Today I made coffee and the whole thing backed up on me, ran all over the counter and onto the floor, grounds and water combined.

Also that doesn't work at all if you want to delay brew. I called customer service and they said to try removing carafe from coffee maker after brewing. Apparently, if it sits on the plate ( which doesn't get warm) the top stays open allowing your coffee to cool. This is not mentioned in the instruction book.

The coffee is not too hot in the carafe, but it works. Everything else functioned ok. The carafe is a little difficult to clean as well. But this whole lid thing is disgusting! We noticed that it was hard to pour last week, and was really not functional at all by yesterday.

It is beyond me why the company would continually sell a product with this fundamental flaw. Even basic $20 coffee makers don't do this. Each time it does this I am reminded how much I regret purchasing this product.Do yourself a favor. Save some money and buy a REAL decent coffeemaker.

And the coffee that comes out, even when I pull it out the moment it's done, isn't hot enough! There is no heating element below on the thermal models to keep it warm, and a lot of the heat immediately dissipates into the metal container. But even when I just put my coffee mug underneath and bypass the thermal, it's still not hot enough.Finally, the thermal container could've been designed better so that you have to just tilt it sideways (not upside down!) when you want to pour the last cup of coffee.

We have to remove the top to pour and it still pours badly.Secondly, the so called \\"thermal\\" pot is just stainless steel, there's NO LINER!!! How is stainless going to keep your coffee warm, it doesn't. We brew a pot and then pour it, over the sink, into a airpot.

Interestingly enough, a popular magazine that does food and appliance rating just gave it the exact same review...the bottom of the list, don't buy. If I hadn't thrown out the box, I'd have returned it in a minute. One day, I'll be fed up enough to just throw it out and buy a pot that makes good coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Coffee Maker!","review":"This coffee maker works just fine if you don't mind your coffee on the counter top and floor instead of in the carafe. The little circle that the coffee is supposed to brew into creates bubbles as it brews and blocks the hole. If you watch the entire brew cycle you can stop it when it starts happening, but that is totally ridiculous for the cost. Also the carafe doesn't keep the coffee hot. Complete waste of money. I can't believe they are still making this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe doesn't keep coffee warm","review":"We have owned this coffee maker for nearly a year and it just quit on us. I was about to get a new coffee maker anyway since the thermal carafe didn't keep coffee hot worth a darn. Even after warming the carafe, the coffee wouldn't stay hot for more than 20 minutes max. I did just get a cuisinart and that carafe keeps the coffee HOT for hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of money","review":"This coffee maker is a big waste of money. It lasted less than 6 months, doesn't keep the coffee hot in the thermal carafe, and often over flows all over my counter with grounds and coffee going everywhere. I'm going out to get another coffee pot today and it won't be a Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"gross","review":"I couldn't throw this coffee maker in the trash fast enough when I realized that I was raising a crop of algae in the carafe lid. I was never thrilled by this product (coffee was never piping hot) but it was serviceable for the price. Coffee was OK. But when attempting to clean out the carafe lid I kept getting little brown bits out. I assumed it was coffee grounds so I never paid to much attention fort the first year or so, but one day I decided to REALLY get it cleaned out by repeatedly agitating hot water in it I began to get small sheets of scum out that I can only guess is algae."},{"rating":"1","title":"brews coffee for countertops and floor","review":"If I could give this less than one star - I would. . . My counter top - however - might not. After a couple months - the coffee barely makes it into the decanter - instead, it spills on the counter and floor. I am relieved to realize I am not the only one who has this problem, I was starting to question my ability of placing the decanter on the burner properly. The item should be recalled. It is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke warm coffee","review":"My sister told me to buy this model. She swore it was the best coffee maker ever. She was wrong. After it brewed quickly, the coffee was warm. I drink coffee all day so I was excited to hear it would keep it hot all day. Well she was wrong again. After about 2 hours the coffee was barely warm. I even tried to let hot water sit in the carafe for ten minutes as recommended and it still sucked. I went back to my trusty Bunn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst piece of junk I've ever owned","review":"This has to be the worst coffee maker I've ever had!! Keeps coffee lukewarm, at best!! Plus, it leaks coffee, I've woken many mornings to find coffee leaked down the front of my kitchen cabinents and pooling on the floor!! I got so mad with it, I opened the back door and threw it out onto the deck! It gave me great pleasue to hear the glass shatter! This is the biggest piece of junk coffee maker I've ever had!! GOOD RIDDANCE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible coffee maker!","review":"This thing is terrible. It is ridiculously slow at brewing, pouring the coffee is very cumbersome - leaks out the sides or doesn't come out at all. Coffee is NOT HOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, many flaws, poor value","review":"We purchased this machine about 10 months ago. It looked nice on the counter and initially worked well. I would have given a four star review two weeks into the purchase. Now it is a one star. The \\"metal\\" on the front is actually plastic covered with metal looking foil like stuff. It began to crinkle and peel. The front plate also started turning green. So now it does not not even look good!As far as performance goes, the coffee was warm but never very hot even when we prewarm the carafe. We experienced some big spills and learned that you have to clean the o ring around the lid to keep it working. The pause and serve feature crapped out so now we are in the market for a new maker.I wish I would have spent my money on a maker that would last. I hate to be wasteful...financially and environmentally so I am disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this product and keep looking","review":"This is the worst coffeemaker. All the reviews are true: it doesn't make a hot cup of coffee, nor does it stay even warm in the pot, it uses a lot of coffee and after about a dozen uses it failed to work any longer. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Keep looking for another thermal coffeepot. You will regret wasting your money because you WILL be buying another pot in a very short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I received this as a gift after my beloved Krups gasped it's last breath. The water reservoir is inconvenient to fill, resulting in water on the counter unless you pour it in very carefuly and it is slower than death. As a woman who wants her coffee ASAP, this was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"I'd read a number of reveiws for a number of coffee makers and brands and many of them, even for this item, were negative. I took a chance on this because I found a bargain price on an open box/refurb maker.For two years now it's been making coffee without any troubles.I make and drink a pot a day.Two small items that I'll note.. Brew lights don't seem to shut off automatically but the brew elements do so I'm not concerned for the maker always ON...just the lights. I didn't get the manual with the open box item so I'm not sure if that's supposed to be or not.2nd item...I wiped the steam from the front panel while making coffee and some of the lettering came away. That's annoying but still works fine.Overall the item has worked just fine for me. It brews small and large pots, normal and strong, and has auto settings so you can have a pot ready when you wake up."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICED COFFEE","review":"I deal with this every morning, one of these days its going in the garbage.

Do not lay the top upside down as the little gadget inside sticks and then the next batch goes all over the kitchen. We have had numerous replacements, but no more. It steams all the water away and you are left with not much warm coffee. They told me at the distribution center somewhere down south that we were not cleaning it properly and then we were not doing it often enough. Enough I say, enough.The $20 version will do just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything bad said about this coffee maker is true","review":"Wish I had read these reviews prior to buying this coffee maker. Coffee doesn't stay hot, water all over the counter when you fill it, slow to pour, etc.,etc., Mr Coffee makes better coffee makers, I usually by the cheapest Mr. Coffee I can find and they usually work fine for a year or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiple issues from the start","review":"We have been using this coffee maker for a little over one year. It does make a good cup of coffee when it works. In the beginning the coffee would overflow onto the counter on a weekly basis. We discovered there is a little ball valve in the lid which would stick on occasion. So learned to shake the lid to make sure it wasn't stuck prior to placing the lid on the carafe. Now one year into using, the coffee leaks all over the counter for a different reason. Now it appears that the junction where the plastic on the carafe meets the stainless steel, has slightly separated. When brewing you can see coffee streaming out where these two component materials meet. Definitely a design flaw, as the handle is not anchored to the carafe at both ends, thereby pulling the plastic top away from the stainless steel section when pouring. Time for a different brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the Mr. Coffee FT Series","review":"My husband bought me this coffee maker for Christmas 2009. It worked for one week and just stopped working. The only thing that worked was the light for the clock! The thermal decanter does not keep the coffee hot. I always have to place my coffee in the microwave. What a waste of money. I thanked my husband but said that next time he should consult with me before buying any type of appliance as I always read consumer reports reviews. A Krups or Braun would have been a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and look for a different model","review":"I used this coffee maker twice and both times I got a warm cup of coffee. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do besides \\"pre-warm the carafe\\" per the instructions to make the coffee hotter from the machine. What's the point of a programmable coffee maker if I have to wake up early to manually warm up the carafe? I'll box it up tonight to return it.Do yourself a favor and look for a different model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you living with a controlling man?","review":"This book contains the most comprehensive explaination of what a controlling personality is. If you are having difficulty understanding why and how that person in you life is thinking. Please read this book! I have gained more insight from this one book than any other source. You will learn why your man thinks they way he does, (I say man because most controlling personalities are men) and you will be given methods to deal with him. These methods really work!

I know that book!\\" I think I was about 10 years old when i read it and I absolutely loved it. I read it until it eventually fell apart. Though now the details are a bit sketchy, what I do remember is that i felt sadness, awe, and hope..not just the first time i read it, but EVERY time. It's books like this that started my whole love affair with books at a young age, and that love affair still continues. I'm now 22 years old and think I may buy this book for my own collection. If you have children, i strongly suggest this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"The basic plot of Maniac Magee is a kid who can't find a family, when he thinks he does, either he doesn't want to hurt them or someone dies. I think this book was a great book. One, because after every chapter the book makes the reader ask questions. Two, because it teaches some sort of a leason. The lesson it teaches is that when a kid can't see the difference between black and white, he isn't liked as much. I think the character is believable because he fits into the story, and he has good dialog in the story so you can see a movie of the book in your head. I would recommend this book to just about anybody who likes a humorous book, and a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"student","review":"Jeffery Magee is a boy that dosen't belong anywhere, he has no home and dosen't go to school.

Then Jeffery meets Amanda Beale who is black but segregation splits them apart. So Jeffery leaves to go with his own kind but will the Beale's hunt him down and give him a home.The moral of the story is that everybody deserves a home and a family who loves them. I find this book a touching comedy that makes you want to turn the pages.I would recommend this book to anyone but more towards the ages of eleven through thirteen years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maniac Magee By Jerry Spinelli","review":"Maniac Magee, an award-winning book was written by Jerry Spinelli.It is a book about a boy named Jeffrey who was a normal kid until his parents died. A black family called the Beales took him in. He learns about racism while living with the Beales. A month later he ran away ate dinner with a white family, called the Pickwells , and thought how similar the Pickwells are to the Beales. He thought it was sad because the Pickwells and the Beales would have been good friends if not for racism.This is one of the most wonderful fictional books of all times! My favorite part is when Maniac learns a lesson which is there is racism for no reason. I thought this book would have been even better if there was pictures so I could understand the book even more.I recommend this book to kids ages 8-15.

I liked this book because it was interesting and daring. There was some boring parts but over all this was a good book. During Maniac's time there was a color barrier in Two Mills. He ran 200 miles from Bridgeport to Two Mills. He ended up on the black side known as the East End. The whites were on the West End. Maniac was daring enough to not only stay there but also live on the East End with a family called the Beales. They were a good family but Maniac soon left them in search of another family. Will Maniac ever find a family as good as the Beales or will he not even find a family? Legend has it that since Maniac was fast he once raced a train \\"on one rail\\" and beat the it to the park.

The novel is able to capture the attention of pre-teens using everyday life as its tool. Maniac shares some of the same problems as our youth in America. He is caught up in a world of racism. Mr. Spinelli uses hyperbole to get a laugh or two out of his audience. The book is written in modern language and with the interest of students at heart. There needs to be a video available with this novel. This reading is one of the best teaching tools that I have seen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy's Review","review":"Maniac Magee was a great book.

Jeffrey Lionel Magee wanders into Two Mills, PA and instantly creates a larger than life character who can out run a dog, hit a homerun off the best pitcher in town, and win a race by running backwards. Aside from the unbvelievable physical feats Maniac Magee also helps erase the invisible line drawn between the east and west sides of town.Why is Jeffrey a maniac? Because he can do Houdini-like feats, or because he is willing to confront, albeit unknowingly the status quo of Two Mills?The slight exaggerations of nearly impossible situations are really brought to life as Spinneli examines real issues such as illiteracy, homelessness and racial prejudice...the story is \\"real\\", but it may have been embellished, and I dare say that has made it a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maniac Magee","review":"I recently started a bookclub at my daughter's school.

What?\\"","review":"The Story Maniac Magee was a very confusing book. Some of the reasons that I didn't like the book are that he ran so many places. Just like running to the Beales in the East end, then running to the McNabs in the West end. There was a little to much fighting. For example,when Maniac (Jeffery) messes with the Cobras and Mars Bar. There were too many slang words. Somtimes I had to reread it a couple of times. One time Mars Bar said \\"Gimme my Book!\\" But most of all he loses many people. Once he is very happy, then he has to separate. He finally goes with the Beales and lives there. Overall the story was hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maniac Magee","review":"I do not think Maniac Magee is the best book I have ever read. one reason I do not like the story is he moves from place to place and it is hard to keep track. For exmaple, one day he is in the West End and the next in the East.I do not like the part when Mars Bar meets Maniac because I don't like when people fight.I certainly don't like when Maniac lies to Piper and Russel.I don't like it because it's mean to say something not true.I don't like the ending.The reason is I thought that it was going to end with the blacks and whites playing together in harmony. Next, I do not like the book for these reasons and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you a Maniac for Maniac Magee...(for me it's not joyful)","review":"Maniac was a good book, but, it was a little confusing and hard to keep up with because, he traveled to so many places throught out the whole book. For example, Holidaysburg, Two Mills (*east and west end), Valleyford, and other places in Two Mills. It also was a sad story because, people died for example, Maniacs parents and Grayson. Also his family relationships have died for example, Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan, The Beales, The Pickwells, and the McNabs."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Thoughts on Maniac Magee","review":"The book Maniac Magee was not very good in my opinion. I feel this way because it had so many good details , but so much stuff was happening at the same time that it seemed so confusing for me to follow. For example in the last few chapters Maniac is going through so mant things at the same time, like deciding which family to live with, trying to get blacks and whites to realize that they are all the same, and helping out with Russel and Piper. I also feel that the chapters were too short. For example chapter four is barely a page long. If there were fewer long chapters it would have been much easier to follow. For example if the author seperated the main events and put them into chapters instead of making so many little events, it would have been a much better book. In conclusion Maniac Magee was not a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maniac Magee","review":"Maniac Magee was a pretty good book. I liked it because it was an easy reader.

There were things that I liked and disliked. For example, a part that I liked was when Maniac embarresed Mars Bar by winning the race by running backwards. I liked the ending of the story because Mars Bar becomes nicer, he saves Russell from falling, and he becomes friends with Maniac. A part of Maniac Magee that I disliked was when Grayson died because now Maniac had no one to live with, so he ran away and had to find a new home. Another part I disliked was when the whites got ready for if the blacks ever attacked. I didn't like that part because the whites didn't know for a fact that the blacks were going to attack, but they built a pillbox anyway.

Like one time he wrote that Maniac was running down Hector Street then on the next page hes in a Buffalo pen. I also disliked how he didnt mention anything about his parents.He could have at least wrote a chapter about them(not that it would be anything since the chapters are only 1-2 pages long).The ending really stunk because i thought that the East End and the West End would unite into one town.But he just made it end in 2 sentences.This book wasnt geat at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maniac Was Wacked","review":"I wasen\`t too crazy about this book.

Magee makes many friends in this book and faces many challenages. I encourage middle school students to read this book because Mr. Spinlli uses a child as the main chacter in this stoy and places him in the hardest of situations which develops a great theme. Many of the situations are unlikely to happen to one person but it's still a very interesting story.

This book gets a little boring after a while. I think it was not smart of Jerry Spinelli to make more than 40 chapters, which are about 1 page each, instead of making long but less chapters. This book is about a 11 year old orphan boy who runs away from his uncle's house. Some statements in this book are very detailed and strong, but they are also confusing. I think you should you ask someone who has already read this book about if it is good or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maniac Mageee","review":"Jerry Spennelli has great writing abilities. He uses words that describe in more detail than just saying it. In the book Maniac Magee I really liked lots of things that he wrote, like \\"It was so hot outside that the dogs tounges were rubbing on the sidewalk\\". The story itself was very interesting, but fond of all the deaths and at the same funny.And I wasn't fond about all the deaths in the story. But most of all I liked. I recomend thisbook to older kids scince they have lots of hard words and deaths and very sad parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok book","review":"I like the style of Jerry's writing but there was not enough action in the book.Maniac left his aunt and uncle's house and ran through many towns so how did he know which side of Two Mills town to live in. He got the two sides of the town to join together. I don't understand why the author didn't mention that the Aunt and Uncle didn't try to find Maniac. He met up with a girl and moved in with her. A few weeks later he left and moved in with a man named Grayson. I think he should have gave more background on Grayson. Overall on a scale from one to 5 I would give the book a 2. Because he had too much detail in certain areas and not enough in others where it was neither. So I would not reccomend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maniac Magee a very sad book with ONE star","review":"I disliked Maniac Magee because too many people died. You never know who will die next. Like Maniac's parents, the died in a trolley car accident and horribly drowned. It was very gruesome when they died. Also when Grayson died, you thought he would be his dad, but ended up in a morgue. After that you thought he would go back to the Beales but he ended up going to the McNabs. However I did like one thing in the book. I liked how he always ran. You never knew where he would end up next.

The book didn't explain everything as well as I wanted it to. The book is suitable for people who like reading about fictional characters that make differences. Jeffrey Lionel (Maniac) Magee is that character. He brings the East and West End of Two Mills, Pennsylvania together. This is important because there used to be a color barrier in Two Mills. The East End is where the black live and, the West End is where the white live. I remembered who lives where by remembering the W's in West and white.

I like exciting books and this had no climax. Nothing scary, bad, or suspenseful happened. That made it very boring. Secondly, it is very annoying when Maniac keeps moving to different spots. You can't keep track whether he is in the West or the East End. He goes everywhere every two seconds. It's so confusing! Lastly, they put too much information about Maniac and the borng Knot. I spend 15 minutes reading and all I hear is something about the Knot.I don't care about the Knot!This book was totally boring.

I think he did use creative words though. If he didn't spend so much time describing everything then I think a lot more people would have liked the book. Though a few parts of the book that I read I thought were cool but he has too much deatail. He could have made the plot better and the story longer and kept the same amount of detail and I would have loved the story. Though I would highly suggest the story to little kids, people who love detailed stories, or parents. If I had some more time to read this book then i might have liked it better (one sign this a book the schools read which makes it a good book).

For example it had about 3 pages per chapter, not a true book, Maniac never wanted to brag when he beat Mars Bar in disgrace when Maniac ran backwards to humiliate Mars Bar. And also the West side liked the East Side in which Maniac introduced Mars Bar to the good side before he saw the bad side.What I didn't like about the book was it was confusing, the gangs and that Grayson died.

I will racommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"maniac magee","review":"I really liked this book!this story is about a boy named Jeffery Magee.Jeffery's parents died in a trolly accident so he had to live with his aunt and uncle but they don't like each other and they dont talk to each other.Jeffery ran away because he didn't like it there and he went to a guy named greysons house and went to this girl amanda he met and he got made fun of by a bully and he ended up living with Amanda's house."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book of the Century","review":"Maniac Magee is a phenomenol book about an orphaned boys journey through two ends of a town , one end black, one end white, who can't look past racial differences that have been going on for years. There are many lessons learned in this book but one that stands out in my mind is the classic saying \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\". No matter what color someone is,whether they're black, white, blue, purple or green, you have no right to say your better than him or anybody else.Jerry Spinelli has a way of twisting words that makes you think.He says things without really \\"saying it\\".My opinion of this book this book is as high as Mt. Everest.Out of 10 this book is a 45. I recomend this book to all ages because teachs a lesson that is so important in today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maniac is cool!","review":"Maniac Magee is a story of happiness and tragedy as you will find out when you read. Maniac faces both deaths and some pretty amazing adventures! When he is a baby someone very important is killed,so he gose to live with relatives. He runs away from them because they can't get along and he ends up at the East End of Two Mills,a town divied by racism. There he meets Amanda Beale, a black 12-year-old girl, who is in a rush for grade school."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a great book","review":"Manic Magee was a really cool book. It was about a boy who lived for a while,but then he ran away he ran and ran. Finally,in two mills,pa,he stopped running and strated meeting different people and sleeping in weird places like in the zoo in the buffolo cages were he slept . You could say he is a great athlete in baseball, because he hit the fastest picher ball in little lauge ball. this is one of those stories that has a little bit of everything in it action, drama,feeling,and even outright meanness. Manic Magee gose on a big advenher."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great!","review":"I think Jerry Spinelli wrote the most fabulas book I've ever read,he wrote Maniac Magee. The whole point he tries to get across is that the black and white people in Two Mills could not get along! When maniac,the hero of the story,was born somone very important in his life gets taken away from him forever. As he lives his life he does weird and dangerous things that even grown-ups would never do. In fact maniac amazed me at what he could do!As you travel through Two Mills with Maniac you will find that you will get heartbroken when he loses another special person in his life. But that does not let that stop him,he goes on. He goes on seeing everyone equal no matter how mean or unfair or what color they are and he teaches people along the way a valuble lesson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book for people of all ages!","review":"I read this book in my sixth grade class and I thought it was a wonderful book. The author does a good job describing Maniac's feelings and his life with his foster families. Once I got started, it was hard to put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maniac Magee was a very good book.","review":"I think Maniac Magee was a very good book. I recomend it to good readers and to people that enjoy good books.It was about a boy named Jeffery,but everyone called him Maniac.His parents died and he was orpaned a lot. He was a very,very good athlete and meet a lot of friends on his jorney.I think lots of people would enjoy this Newbery winning book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bigotry within bigotry","review":"Though this story has as a theme a sort of love for one's neighbor, from the beginning of the book I was offended. Within the first few paragraphs, Spinelli, whether intentionally or not, makes a statement about Catholics. The aunt and uncle hate each other but \\"because they were strict Catholics\\" did not believe in divorce. That's it. It seems like an innocuous statement, but for the undescriminating 9 year old, it depicts Catholics as some kind of hard hearted, legalistic religion. If the aunt and uncle were living their faith they would have made an effort to overcome their hatred, a sentiment that is contrary to Catholicism. Instead, their growing hatred is the catalyst for Magee taking off. Pretty ironic start for the peacemaker now isn't it? I would not let my own children read this nor can I recommend this book. A much better book about character development for this age group would be Johnny Tremain."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I will never understand why profanity has to be written in children's books. The author could have written that differently to make his point."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book with a Boring Touch","review":"Maniac Magee is a book all about a boy and his many adventures. Not a lot of main characters. Maybe a lot of supporting characters but only one main character. From him out running the fastest boy in the neighborhood to punting a football from the best football thrower in the neighborhood. He's just a boy looking for a home and trying to find the right one. Overall this book is mostly likely just going to waste your time.Some of the material is not appropriate for kids under the age of 9."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],W={key:0},x={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(O,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-0c5c0b34"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/38.md","filePath":"guide/38.md"}'),H={name:"guide/38.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
