Stylistically brilliant, scintillant, it searches into the nature of love and the obsessions of of eros -- not in daily life, but in life on the edge, life where politics, catastrophe, and the twentieth century converge.Wiggins' protagonist is a journalist -- male -- who covers international events of major magnitude; set alternately in Africa, at the (falling)Berlin wall, and in 'liberated' Eastern Europe, the book is a serious inquiry intot he relations between eros and ethos. The characters are riveting, the settings full of the excitement and confusion of the late twentieth centurty -- and the prose, the prose is a continual joy. Only a slight falling off at the end -- the book gets into so much that it is tough for Wiggins to extract herself and the reader from the fullness -- mars what is otherwise a wondrous book for our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow down..","review":"Looking at the others reviews I sincerely think you were too much generous or you don't know the music of Tito.

But this is terrible. Over a pseudo-Irv Gotti/Swizz Beats beat, the two produce a bland and tired party anthem with \\"Wild Out 2K\\". The two who used to preach against violence and stereotypes resort to gun references and overly-simplistic lyrics. The weed anthem \\"The Nerve\\" is nowhere near the classic \\"Mad Izm\\".

The taste approcimates a candy bar without actually trying to emulate one. In other words, it is as healthy as it is supposed to be without concessions to people's sweet tooth. The Chocolate Chip Brownie versions are the best, don't bother with any of the other flavors.And if your balking at the price per bar (1.80ea), consider that you could spend a buck on a bagel or a couple bucks on a breakfast sandwich that would be far less healthy.

More recently, John Zorn's Naked City was a much more effective and creative melding of different musical idioms.

They continue that on this album and it just don't come together the way the older albums did, its like their trying too hard to sound different, yet it sounds like many other current extreme bands, and at their worst on this album, it even sounds a bit like nu-metal which I despise. The one star is when they do the hardcore elements, it comes across somewhat good still."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mushy and watery..all cans//","review":"Normally this is the only dog food our Boston Mandee will eat, however, when we open the cans the dog food is mushy with water on the top...very disappointed...not what we purchase from our pet store...more expensive but not MUSH at least..what's the problem!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped with allergies, dogs LOVE the taste","review":"My golden retriever and yorkie poo are avid fans of Natural Balance's duck and potato.

The best part (for me) is the variety of products that allow us to keep him irritation-free and healthy. They love the biscuits for treats - small for the yorkie poo and larger size for the golden. The rolls can be cut for soft training treats. I can cut them small for the yorkie poo and larger for the golden. The dry/bagged food comes in small bites and the regular size.

As far as Mrs. Bartolozzi goes I can only wonder if she is saving her tomes on other household appliances for future release.

I have been a fan of Kate's work for 27 years and was so excited about this impending release.Everything has already been covered in the negative posts.I can only add that \\"Aerial\\" is the biggest load of old tosh I have purchased this year; and I buy around 5 CDs per week from many genres.I have EVERY previous Kate release - in the preceding weeks I reached for my copies of \\"The Kick Inside\\", \\"Lion Heart\\" & \\"Never Forever\\" (never far from my CD player).... and all crammed full of beauty, quirkiness, sobriety and madness .... just listen to the exchange between \\"In Search Of Peter Pan\\" & \\"Wow\\" .... it reduces me to tears.\\"Aerial\\" reduces me to tears of a different kind; tears of abject horror that Kate's talent has gone down the domestic drain!She should now retire gracefully as she is no longer relevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited years for this horrible CD","review":"There are no really good songs on this cd. i am not writing an indepth review of each song because all are just self indulgences for Kate Bush. This is an ode to her ego. The only true great cd which I bought 3 copies were 'The Hounds of Love'. Nearly every song was great. And the video of 'cloudbursting' from the cd was wonderful with an apperance by Donald Sutherland as her father.Her next album , I beleive 'Ruberband Girl' had one good song written for an 80's movie 'She's having a Baby' called 'This Woman's work' as the only great song and a few were decent.But her new CD is frankly bad. But since I loved 'Hounds of Love' so much, I still have hope for Kate and gave her two stars. Just don't stay away fromm the studio so long. It's like everything else, practice and perfect your kraft or lose the talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Die-Hard Wilts","review":"I was sorely disappointed as I listened to Kate's new release. I have always held out the highest of expectations for Kate and have been rewarded. Her growth as an artist and fascinating take on rhythm and imagery has been a joy to witness through out the years, but today, as I listen to my beloved Kate sing about her washing machine, and listen to the repetitive phrasing this cd, I'm reminded of performance art music, without the performance. Am I missing something here? I get the sense that Kate has produced this in a box, with no real breath to supplement her talent. Over time, I'm sure there may be one or two songs that I will assimilate into my personal world soundtrack, but for Kate, that's a real Tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, this album is a fake","review":"As a long time fan f Kate Bush this album is completely boring, lack of ideas, very bad songwriting, and i ended up hating the kid. A warning for the Kate's fans, this album is a waste of money.Very very bad Kate, after 14 years you came to us with this? It's disgusting to read that most of the reviews give 5 stars to this collection of bad b-sides, you are no objetive anymore!I hope there will be a fans reaction against this album, we're completely disapointed with it, and it's our duty to say this for Kate to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"2005 IS THE YEAR OF COMEBACKS!!","review":"Kate has been an inspiration for countless artists and after the failure of The Red Shoes I'm happy to see that Kate still has something in her. Aerial is in 2-disc format just to keep it old fashion (like records w/ the two sides and Hounds of Love had it too). I have been an avid fan of Kate ever since Hounds of Love & Sensual World, but this takes the cake. Aerial is one of the best new releases of 2005. Go Kate!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate Bush - Aerial","review":"This is magnificant work. I have been a fan of Kate's since her first release, \\"The Kick Inside\\". It seems to me that Aerial represents a coming of age. One reviewer felt a melancolic sense throughout Aerial. I see it a little differently--more like a grounded presence. Each song feels so in-the-moment....At a certain point in our lives, we may want to turn the pages a little more slowly to savior our time. Given that Kate took along time to put Aerial together, I'm guessing that she wanted to enjoy the entire process of her creativity. This is absolutely what she has acheived. Thank you Kate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate is a goddess!","review":"No one says it like Kate! When I'm in that special Kate-y mood, I just pop on the headphones, pour myself a stiffy and get going to the intersectioin of Kate and Bush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kate is lost in boring themes","review":"I was in love with Kate Bush' music, not in love with her. I want to make this point clear because I suspect the vast majority of people who declare that this is a great album are long-time fans that are in love with her and cannot listen to the record without thinking \\"oh my God, in her first album in twelve years, it MUST BE good. I am sorry to tell you, but, the album is not good at all. It is boring and old-fashioned. And, when you listen to the songs, they remind you of other (and better) songs by Kate. The music of Kate I loved fishishes in \\"The Sensual World\\", her last album I can consider impressive. \\"The red shoes\\" showed signs of lost of creativity, and, in \\"Aerial\\" these signs are very clear. If you search for female singers and composers that take risks now, think about Bjork, Anja Garbarek or my last discovery, Hanne Hukkelberg, this is the music Kate shoud be offering now, not a remake of her previous days of glory. A real pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite enchanting","review":"No, this CD doesn't have the hyperactive, madcap energy of The Dreaming, nor the achingly romantic qualities of The Kick Inside. But it's very enjoyable. It IS more blousy and relaxed than anything she's previously released, and consequently potentially disapointing to those who loved Kate's eccentricity, but it's not as though it's in any way commercially compromised. Some people thought that The Red Shoes WAS commercially compromised. I did on first listen. However, when I listen to it now, The Red Shoes is - bar a few tracks - emotionally compelling and lovely. Moments of Pleasure is a track I used to think was bland. Now, over ten years later, it brings me near to tears. Therefore I would encourage anyone initially disappointed with Aerial to listen to it a few more times, put it away for a while, and then return to it. All of Kate's albums get better over the years. They kind of unfold gradually. That's all I can advise. In ten years, I'm sure I'll want to give Aerial 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums","review":"After living with this album awhile I have decided that I really love it. At first, I wasn't so impressed but the more I listen to it the more I love it. For me, that is a great compliment. So many albums are \\"fun\\" on first listen but bore me after hearing it two or three times. This album means more to me the more I listen. I am partial to disc two. I like this collections of songs that are so different then what we normally hear. They are peaceful, hopeful, and loving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Me Completely Disappointed...","review":"You won't find any of Kate Bush's trademark over-the-top vocals on this one. Kate has definitely taken a more mellowed out approach with softer vocals. I expected (and wanted) her to let loose on at least some of the tracks, but she keeps it calm the entire way. Too bad, I expected more after a 12 year(?) hiatus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I was expecting (er, hoping for) something closer to \\"Hounds of Love,\\" but this was spacey and unspooled. I appreciate change and I appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting, but this was a bit much for me. Some songs seem to just spin off into nothingness, others drag on and on. A few songs have much triter lyrics than I expected from her, and on most her voice seems to be rambling while disregarding the music behind it. I liked one or two tracks, but overall I cannot get into this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I liked this at first listen, but loved it after the second listen through headphones. Kate has amazed me yet again with a subtle recording full of little sounds here and there that can't be heard unless played loud or through headphones. Disc 2 is the superior of the two, but both are amazing in thier own right. What made disc 2 better? the bird sounds and Kate emulating them....The whole cd has a calm, almost New Age feel to it. It takes you to another plane and gently absorbs you into it's beauty, like a Chinese kite flowing in the wind.I loved Never4ever, Lionheart, The Dreaming, Hounds Of Love, and now Aerial.She proved herself yet again with this stunning release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Absolute Brilliance!","review":"I for one am glad Kate's back! We've had to endure years of musical tripe and unimaginative so called \\"cutting edge\\" music. Well, Kate's just what the current sad state of music needs. She's a true artist who shows today's so called \\"artists\\" how it's done. I'm a Kate Bush fan from many years ago. Besides being a fantastic artist and musician, to me, she's just about the epitome of the perfect woman. Beautiful and talented and unafraid. The Red Shoes CD was good but this is brilliant. I dig the whole CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING - This album is on the SONY label","review":"WARNING: The disc is a Sony release, and may install a really nasty rootkit on your computer. It installs without your permission and removing it can damage your CD drive. No joke. There are already multiple class-action suits against Sony over this, but their stance is that their rights must be protected, and they will not change their content.Since the review process forbids URLs for reference, I can only urge you to search the internet for \\"Sony Digital Rights Management\\" before you consider owning this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Ride","review":"Bottom line...This is easily Kate's best work since \\"Hounds of Love\\". For some, this will be Kate's best work ever.Aerial has a more mature feel that starts with an underlying theme centering around motherhood. The first disc could have been sub-titled \\"Dance of the Stay-at-Home Mom\\", while the second opens up to the great outdoors. Both discs are largely piano and acoustical driven. Barely a drum is heard on the first disc, while the second disc starts low-key but gradually develops a beat and a more electronic feel while remaining more mainstream than her \\"Dreaming\\" days. Overall, it's much more of a \\"new age\\" ambience than anything she's done before.It's a beautiful ride to be sure, and far better than I was expecting.GREAT headphone album."},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless...","review":"earlier today i tried explaining this record to someone over the phone & absoloutely broke down into tears. Kate Bush, how does one descibe such an enigma??? Deeply moving this record is & it resonates--where does this come from? Kate Bush is still a mystery to me.

Thank you a million times Kate! for making this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited 12 years for this?","review":"Sorry to buck the trend here, but this is not just bad, its bad Kate Bush, which makes it all the more tragic. I know fans have been starved for new music from Kate for over a decade, but this is not even remotely indicative of why I fell in love with her music back in 1978. Overly selfindulgent to the point of parody, this album cries out for a good producer. Maybe 6 tracks should have been kept, and the rest discarded. I hope she gets back on her feet for the next release - but when will that be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Excellent .. best since Hounds of Love","review":"Having read some of the reviews here, I figured I should throw my 2 cents in. This album has some wonderful, inventive, creative music on it. In general the presentation is more subtle. It doesn't knock you down to let you know it rocks. It invites you to listen and then you notice how good it is. I think this partly due to maturity on Kate's part and partly due to the subject. The few people who have stated the music is boring or doesn't do anything for them, probably haven't listened.A large part of the focus of the album is on beauty and joy. The first CD seems more directed to the mundane in daily living in this world. The 2nd CD seems more directed towards the spiritual. The sea of honey and the sky of honey. The sea below and the sea above. Sweetness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the twelve-year wait. GET THIS.","review":"Why?As inventive and personal as ever, with more subtleties, nuances, and skill. Lush instruments that excel in tone and color, and lyrics that will change how you see the world. Rich layering of genres, humor, and imagery that will haunt. Each song a gem, polished and sparkling. Kate's work has matured well, but she hasn't lost the child-like wonder at the world that is the hallmark of her work. The music has gained subtleties, complexities, and sophistication. You'll hum the melodies everywhere you go; the double-CD set oozes catchy hooks and pop-culture humor, and exposes memories and experiences so well that you'll swear you were there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of people on crack out there","review":"This Album is bad, bad, bad, especially considering the great music Kate Bush has produced in the past. There is not ONE single song that stays in your mind after you are finished listening to both albums, and, as a matter of fact, years have gone by since it was published, and none of its songs are remembered or played anywhere.I can't get over all the enthusiastic reviews on this site, all the OMG, OMG !! It's really true, one could produce an absolute piece of garbage and yet there are always going to be a bunch of idiots who will rave about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Album Cover But...","review":"I have to say I'm very suprised that Kate is back in business. And I'm very happy for her. But this album is a disappointment. I have heard it and only two songs really stand out, King of the Mountain and Pi. Otherwise, it's just a really pretty album cover but a really bad album. I hope Kate is here to stay, but please do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"a grave, grave, and utter disappointment","review":"Hello, there was a time when KB was really hot, an alternatively talented singer from Never for ever, Babooshka, Lionheart, Running up that hill, The kicking side, wow, all dreamy and kinky beautiful records cds and tapes that were unique and speacial but after this longed timed silence this horrible cd is just a grave, grave and utter disappointment.I even feel the sickening spirit of voodoo is distorting the woman's skull.very sad.0 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Critics darling","review":"Kate Bush is a very smart woman.She always was.She knows exactly the amount of time and EFFORT she needs to put in all of her records.And this album sounds great,but she is just trying once again to hide her dirty little secret.Very,very poor songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Trying Sooooo Hard to Like This CD","review":"There's a sketch from SCTV where Rick Moranis impersonates Perry Como by singing a song so unenthusiastically, with so little emotion, and with so little energy, that he sings it while lying in bed or lying on the floor, half asleep. On this CD, Kate Bush is doing a wonderful impression of Rick Moranis doing Perry Como. WHERE'S THE ENERGY? WHERE'S THE EMOTION? Kate's voice is still gorgeous but what happened to her balls? Without that power, her voice just flutters away into nothingness.I've listened to the album almost everyday for a week; unfortunately, it's not growing on me. In fact, I get angrier every time I listen to it. Sorry, Kate. I adore your voice and your music... but Aerial is a travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth my 16.87$","review":"At first i was reluctant to buy her new cd because it seemed that Kate had lost some of her genius with some of the medicore material she had been putting out since Red Shoes. However on Aerial, i was absolutely satisfied with my new purchase. I love how the songs on this album are relaxing, yet have a great pop feel to them. Being a fan of electronic music, im glad i now have a current cd to add to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Magical","review":"Kate's ability to transcend current pop mediocrity and remain true to her vision is remarkable. Her music is just as relevant as where she left off.Disc 1: \\"A Sea of Honey\\" explores a number of musical styles and ideas, from the double-edged sword of celebrity, \\"King of the Mountain\\" to the loss of a loved one, \\"A Coral Room\\". One of the highlights is Joanni, a brooding percussion driven ode to Joan of Arc.Disc 2: \\"A Sky of Honey\\" is a sonic journey through the course of a day and night. From the opening of birdsong and childs voice, \\"Prelude\\" through an artists muse in \\"An Architects Dream\\" and culminating in the beautiful \\"Nocturn\\" and \\"Aerial\\". She is truely a painter with music as the medium. This disc holds together as a set piece with mingling orchestration and themes.Beautiful from start to finish, a true artists expression.Long live Kate and her music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerial Soars","review":"This is a mature, feminine, ethereal and extremely beautiful piece of art!

I think this is one of her best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I'm not much on writing reviews, I can't ever seem to put into words what i think about music. But, I think this is some of the most beatuifully written and performed music I have ever heard. Kate takes you to the places in her music on this disc.You can really feel her passion.Buy it you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"In an age of factory music; of pure, unadulterated pop music mediocrity, Kate Bush has produced her magnum opus. \\"Aerial\\" reveals deeper and deeper dimensions with every listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make another one please!","review":"Some people seem to think this is the Kate Bush version of 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. A long wait for a load of rubbish. It is not. Simply stunning. And not the same as earlier work but still very much Kate.Pi and the one about washing sheets probably aren't for everybody but they have certainly grown on me. The final 2 tracks live permanantly on my ipod and are bollocking good for working out and running.One of my favorite albums I own, I listen to it all the time. I would only give about 10 albums I have ever listened to 5 stars but if I derive the same pleasure from listening to this in 10 years then it would deserve them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beautiful","review":"Disc 2 has got to be one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've heard in ages. Ranks up there with Lisa Gerrard's Sanvean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"(Ignore the review about sony viruses.) unlike neil diamond's recent release there is no sony virus on Kate Bush's brilliant Aerial. This is verifiable everywhere on the web except for the review below this.This album grows and keeps revealing itself; brilliant musicians; mesmerizing, diverse and incredibly moving music; and kate is responsible for everything here. The most remarkable musician around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, Kate!","review":"If you LOVED the Hounds of Love (especially The Ninth Wave) - you will be ecstatic over this album. Though there's no sublime single like \\"Running Up That Hill\\", it's the second CD that is awe inspiring. I was drifting in and out while listening to it and it was a truly spiritual experience. It takes a few listenings to achieve the full effect.This is thankfully so much better than The Red Shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Kate Bush is a musical genius, as any of her fans know. The long time between albums was not worth the wait, but this album is worth its weight in gold. I've been a big fan since her debut album, and missed her the last 12 years, but I believe this is Kate's finest work ever. It's a full 80 minutes long, and I love every minute of it. How many 40 minute albums can you even say that about? The intoxicating melodies, intertwined sounds and vocal magic create a masterpiece. It's the best album of any genre released in 2005. It's not likely to receive commercial airplay, but Kate Bush never had that in mind when creating her beautiful music. This is an album you'll want to play over and over, and tell other people about, which is exactly what's happened with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disc 2 is Magic","review":"As others have mentioned, there are really 2 albums here and they need to be reviewed separately.The first disc is very good, but it's not modulating with my inner soul.I simply can't stop listening to disc 2. The songs go by so fast, it's that good. It really starts to get amazing starting with \\"Sunset\\". I recommend that you put some headphones on and listen to it while you're falling asleep in the dark - it will make more sense.I'm not going to try to explain this in detail. Music transcends that, particularly this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate in the sky","review":"The new album from Kate sound's NEW! It is more atmospheric.The album is divided in 2 CDs. 1st: A Sea Of Honey + 2nd: A Sky Of Honey. Although the first is superb, it's in the second were the true diamonds are. In fact All of them are brilliant but particularly An Architect's Dream, Sunset, Aerial and the most fabulous of all, Nocturn... It begins slowly to the grand finale.And the phrase - on Nocturn - that doesn't leave my head \\"We stand in the Atlantic, We become panoramic...\\" On the title track she laughs and laughs along with the birds singing. Well IT IS SIMPLY MARVELLOUS!This is a fantastic album and - in my opinion - it's one of her best! An it will grow on you in every listenning...Just a curious fact - inside of the booklet the photo wich have the Nocturn lyrics is a cover from a National Geographic issue (June 2000)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have loved Kate Bush for over 20 years but this release is just awful. I don't remember one single song, nor do I want to. Just boring mishmashmush. If it was at least interesting I could understand, but this is just a craptacular meandering dull mess. I just hope Kate has one more album in her because it would be a tragedy to end her musical career with this loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally intense, profound...a work of art","review":"It has been painful waiting for Kate Bush for 12 years but now it's over, she's back with this piece of art, no doubt the album of the year, the album of the century (until she comes out with a new one). A double CD set with a beautiful and inventive album cover that makes you wonder what this fascinating woman was thinking when creating it. The songs translate the Kate Bush woman, mother and person, songs that could just be written by Kate Bush and no one else. Try the beautiful and emotive \\"A Coral Room\\" first what would be enough for you to fall in love with this wonderful album, this fascinating artist that Kate Bush is. Thank you Kate for coming back to us. Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"comeback","review":"Kate Bush returns with an innovative album. Gone is the muddled production that plagued \\"Hounds of Love\\". This double CD is crisp and calls again to be played loud. Yes, she has lost some of her voice dynamics, but especially the second CD, \\"a Sky of Honey\\" is addictive, reminding of \\"the Dreaming\\". It also feels more rounded and whole then the first CD \\"a Sea of Honey\\". A powerful reminder that a long hiatus doesn't mean a creative drought. The samples of birds add a nice touch as does the creative use of a blackbird's song wave pattern as album art. Worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"The highly anticipated return","review":"This collection was somethings that KB's fans were waiting for since the release of the red shoes'93. As a fan I was anxious and happy to finally get the new record. I think it is very good and very profound in its meaning, but different from what I expected. If your favorite albums were the sensual world and the red shoes this one is the closest one in climate. This is the mellow Kate I enjoy. My personal favorite was the dreaming and hounds of love, so the sound is quite different. If you are not familiar with KB's music, get the whole story first. She is not your typical pop star, it takes a special connection not everyone is priveledged with I guess to understand her art. If she added some 'wilder' side of her to this record it would've been a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Will Sink in Deep","review":"All these reviews, with the album out only two weeks. It's hard to sum up \\"Aerial\\" so quickly, but after about ten listens I'd say it's definitely not the overproduced flop many of us were fearing. And, thankfully, it's not cloying to be current or commercial, either. Both thematically and stylistically it's closer to \\"Hounds of Love\\" than any of her other albums. Lush, deep and at times moving, the songs beckon you into her worlds, both domestic and spiritual. Disc One, like side one of \\"Hounds,\\" has more distinct, commercial tracks peppered with the occasional annoyance--like the singing of the entire number pi (which I've grown to like) the very weighty use of a washing machine as a metaphor (which I may still grow to appreciate). I prefer the dreaminess and ambience of Disc Two, but then, I'm over forty. Ms. Bush has taken some big chances in her comeback and most of them pay off brilliantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"gracefully, beautifully done.","review":"This is a great alblum. She is still on top of her game, after all these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Queen (of the Drags?) is back","review":"and headaches,headaches and headaches.But at least she is not screaming so much anymore.Kate Bush always wrote these horrible songs that only her Pseudo-intellectual fan-boys can take.She was always the Cher for Pseudo-intellectuals.But she never wore the thong (thank God).She is not so loud and stupid anymore,but like it was said before,her poor songwriting it's evident.Washing Machine, really? Her fans-boys will say \\"It's not about a washing machine\\". Right...do yourself a favor and go read a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"(B)aerial","review":"what a dissapointment. after twelve years kate couldn't come up with a little bit more than this boring bunch of bad songs...where is the fire? where are the real songs? this bland slowtempo thing just makes you wish for exciting songs she did on most of her previous albums. being a kate fan from the beginning, i realised that things went wrong from the whole story on. the new vocals for wuthering heights were so terrible and unneccesary. decline had set in. the sensual world did have three great songs ( sensual world, love and anger, this woman's work) but the rest just seem to drag on. The red shoes was even worse. And now there is aerial. Two cd's with pointless songs and unexciting melodies which we've heard before by other artists sung in a very insecure and tired sounding voice....my god woman upgrade your studio down and write some good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what we waited for??","review":"I was a Kate Booster when there were damn few Kate boosters and loved all of her albums. In her newest effort, she should have pulled the plug. One disk, after the first listen, will cause me to go out of my way not to listen to again, unless I need funeral music. The other disk is a little better but many songs sound the same and after a few listens to this disk there is still nothing memorable there. It's a shame..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting, so far...","review":"Since you invite me to, I'd love to review Aerial. Unfortunately, since I have never received it, making it way overdue, I cannot. Not to diss Amazon or anything, I have indeed ordered an recieved a good deal of cd's from you before, but this one must have been replaced. If you could retrieve it somehow, I would be more than happy to review it, but until then, I can only say that I've been enchanted by the songs I've heard on the radio..."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet sweet sweet","review":"A millstone and the human heart are ever driven \`round,and if there's nothing else to grind they must, themselves, be ground.Kate Bush is just a genius. The more I listen to this album, the more I am impressed by the way it feels more de-constructed than constructed. Like the songs could have been-and maybe were-bigger and more produced bla bla bla-but they seem in their present form...distilled. Just achingly exquisite.My sister and my mother snapping beans 1975 dad's funeral the porcelain pumpkin that shattered the conflicted summer at the beach and he was sad and that is why he laughed alot back then and my husband is on the porch with the hummingbirds reading a book about something in the gloaming and life...it's sweet sweet sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomparable","review":"What a unique talent Kate Bush is, she writes like no one else. Do not be fooled by the couple of ludicrous critical reviews listed, they are way off the beam. The serious reviews , here in the U.K ,have been universally glowing, most being astonished at both the originality and talent within her songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Kate...how could you?","review":"I have been a Kate Bush fan since day one, and I NEVER thought I would be disappointed in a release by her, until now. It seems to be a mishmash of techno mumbo jumbo. I was just waiting for some diversity in this recording and it never seemed to change. The ambient beats OVER and OVER with very little change from track to track seemed more like an ode to ENYA than a true Kate release. Perhaps she should have taken another couple of years and rethought this. I hope motherhood has not destroyed her creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was so glad when Kate Bush put out this CD","review":"I was so glad when Kate Bush put out this CD, as it has been a while.I have many of her other albums, and all in all I would give this 4 stars. Hounds of Love is my all time favorite of hers. This is quite good though. \\"King of the Mountain\\" and \\"Sunset\\" are my favorites from this CD. It's too bad she gets so little radio play here in the USA. She seems to be locked in the same room with Shona Laing, Tears for Fears, and Til Tuesday (good music, but American radio can't find a place for them anymore). It's really a shame she really has a lot to offer the music world. Her style of music is so unique and beautiful. Kate's live shows had also been as eclectic as her music, and the different moods she adopts in the songs here mirrors her interest in combining drama, dance, and dialogue with her music. It's nice to have her back with some new music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back Kate","review":"Kate, just that little bit poorer would I be without your music. Disc 2 is meditative. It had been so long since she graced us with more music, and then this arrived. Disc 1 a bit more variable but the track Joanni is worth the whole price.Her silence has made this disc ever more mysterious. Listen to her incorporate real bird song into the music, seamlessly. Listen to her laugh her head off on the last track.What does Rolf Harris have to add to this one? Last time it was a didgeridoo. Kate's fans wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I just stumbled on this compilation by accident, wanting a little Halloween ditty and couldn't put it down. There is a different tone to each story. From humor to fright, I loved each different story, especially the variety of styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good book for halloween","review":"This is a pretty good book of halloween-themed stories. Overall, it's a good book with effective stories, but the stories themselves differ very much in themes. Some are humoristic, some are like fairy tales and others are more \\"classical\\" horror stories, including one of Lovecraft's hand. If you want an anthology of stories that have similar styles and atmospheres, don't try it, you will be disappointed, but if your objective is to remind yourselves about all of Halloween multi-facetted meanings, then indulge yourself with this wonderful book. Just don't expect the story you're starting to read to be like the one you've just finished. You will have your favorites, and you will have your not-so-favorites, but all the stories achieve what their authors sought to do with them.As for me, I believe it's going to become an annual tradition for October."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my puppy!","review":"For some reason, my puppy did not like these training pads. My boyfriend had to tape them down so she wouldn't carry them away! She eventually just scratched them up off the floor and tore it to shreds. I think they would work if your puppy is already pad trained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Nature's Miracle products were recommended to us for our 19 year old dog by a groomer. Now that he is gone and we have a rescue dog (who was/is not totally house broken at age 6yrs.) We still use them to prevent the occasional accident from ruining our floors. I forgot what we were paying at Petco but this is a significantly lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best puppy potty pads!","review":"I've used this brand potty pad for almost 4 years now, and I believe it's the best. When my dog was younger, she always wanted to chew on all the other brands I tried, but not these. Plus, with these she never has an accident. She goes to her potty pad faithfully. There's something in this brand potty pad that makes the dog want to use it - something like a grass scent. Other brands weren't as abosorbent either.These pads are good at absorbing unless she urinates in the same spot over and over, so I wouldn't put them on carpet without something underneath. We have these on a ceramic floor and we change the pad once a day (keeping the stool picked up & flushed throughout the day). After we remove the used pad, we wipe up the floor with a disinfectant wipe and then we put the new pad down.We love using the potty pads, because we can leave her home all day long and she never has an accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soaks through","review":"We purchased these training pads for our 6 pound dachshund puppy who we are having a terrible time housebreaking. The first time he peed on them, they soaked right through to the rug. So we tried doubling them and overlapping them, and they still soaked through. We've had to throw out several rugs in the two months we've had the puppy and we got these to protect our remaining rugs but they do not work. Our rug stinks of urine in the spots we have the pads. And we have to throw out the pads almost as soon as he goes on them because they do not absorb any urine smell. We would've been better off using nothing ad just letting our puppy pee on the rugs since we still have to clean under where the pads are.We're going back to the training pads we got at PetSmart, since they actually absorb the urine and there is virtually no leak-thru."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Nature's miracle is a good brand but if you are looking for just pads for your puppy to pee and poop on, go to Costco. Costco sells 100 pads that are the same size for $15.These pads are in fact highly absorbent, however, don't expect a miracle as soon as you put the pad down on the floor. You still have to train your puppy to actually go to the pad to pee and poop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeh, it's a Miracle, the white powdery substance, all over my pup, didn't make her seriously sick, & nothing natural about that!","review":"This is not good for a new teething, playful, chewing, curious pup!These pads should be used for older dogs only, that have trouble going too much.That said, really not thrilled, that I wasn't warned about these, styrefoam, powder filled explosive, for my own, new pup.So I hope I at least, get to help another buyer out there, who is just as confused, & scared to buy just anything for your pup.Cause no one deserves a sick puppy. My lil baby was luckily better, after she threw up what looked like, bunches of white, wet, tissue paper, all night. Thankfully she was safe, crisis adverted, but I wouldn't recommend these again for any puppy owner..Buyer be warry.PLEASE! With care, -BB & CC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that pleased","review":"I purchased these pads for my pomeranian. He still has \\"accidents\\".

Despite the bad reviews, I decided to order some from Amazon as I was running low and the prices was better. For some reason the ones I ordered from Amazon are horrible. I experienced problems similar those expressed by other customers highlighted. The pads no not absorb. For some reason they do not absorb at all and you are left with MAJOR puddles beneath the pads. I honestly think they are defective. I would NOT recommend these pads at all. They are terrible and a complete waste of money. Major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks messy","review":"I had to write a review on this terrible product. They cost twice as much as the walmart or supermarket brand and leak. I have a 5 pound pomaranian who uses pads while I am at work because their bladders are so small. Even the smallest amount of wetness goes right through.Shame on Natures Miracles for making an inferior product. Don't buy, the cheaper brands work so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best choice","review":"I purchased this item for my yorkie and noticed that the urine goes thru the pamper. I have to use two pampers in order to avoid the urine going thru. I have a trick that if you put 1 pamper(white side) facing down(on the floor)then one on top(regular position); it's a guaranteed that nothing will go thru."},{"rating":"1","title":"Together with the worst...","review":"I have tried probably half of the other brands. These are the thinnest and the price is up there.Better and cheaper are the ones you find in 99 cent stores and the Gridlock brand which are bigger, thicker and cheaper per pad.Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with my erring cat","review":"My newest adoptee hasn't yet figured out that he isn't living in a warehouse any more, so I have placed these pads wherever he \\"erred\\" in using the litterbox for his pee. It helps contain the pungent odor of cat pee but is not perfect in this matter. Also, each pad has a type of \\"stuffing\\" under the top membrane and my cat sometimes claws it up and spreads it around a little. However, it beats cleaning up kitty misses on my carpets and floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"My dog is 16 and 1/2 years old so pee pads are a much needed item. Natures Miracle is the best brand. If you don't mind spending a few more $ the extra adsorbing (all white) pads work even better than these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary book","review":"One of the best books written on fundamental principles of mathematics for high school students. The treatment of basics of inequalities,combinatorics,algebra is quite rigorous. While titled elementary the standard of the problems / exposition of concepts is any thing but that. It is targeted towards dedicated student and will require hard work to go through it end to end.I read this book in 1990 to prepare for a extremely competitive examination (IIT ) and it not only contributed to me acing the exam but also laid the foundation of a life long love affair with mathematics."},{"rating":"1","title":"No meaningful Table of Contents","review":"I agree with earlier reviewers disappointed with the lack of a meaningful table of contents.

The other plus is free shipping on orders over $25.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conversational yet empty","review":"There's not much of a mystery here, but it is strong on descriptions of violence and the iron-jawed determination of its characters. It also has the subtlety of a soap opera, and it likes to beat us the readers over the head with victimhood, suffering, sadness and futility. Child writes exceptionally well in a simple, conversational style, but his book needs an edit and before he writes another, he should give these characters and situations more depth. Much as the plot in pornography is an excuse to get the clothes off, the plot in \\"Persuader\\" is a flimsy justification for violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good + Too Violent","review":"I really liked Child's take on the \\"just the facts ma'am\\" tough guy prose.

It is action-packed and well written. Child's hero, Jack Reacher, is the military-trained action hero who is out to get the bad guys. In the Persuader, he is seeking vengeance on a bad guy who was supposed to be dead.There are many tense moments as Reacher goes undercover and risks his life every other turn. He is working with a group of DEA agents who are \\"off the books\\" and supporting him to save one of their agents who has gone off the radar while undercover.The action is continuous. The suspense builds to the very end and creates a very satisfying read. I would definitely want to continue reading Child's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of Reacher the cold stone killer","review":"I have enjoyed several in the series, but in a couple of the books, this one and Killing Floor, Reacher is too much of a conscience free killer for my tastes. Shoot 'em when they're not looking, dispose of the body, and move on to the next guy. Hey, they had it coming. In the better ones in the series a bit more of Reacher's human side is developed, and the bad guys fall when they are gunning for Reacher or his friends. A bit more heroic that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suspense!","review":"Lee Child's seventh Jack Reacher novel \\"Persuader\\" is an intense story of revenge and intrigue told in the first person.Former MP Reacher is the ultimate lonewolf...a taciturn, resourceful, powerful presence.In \\"Persuader\\" he teams up with an \\"off the books\\" DEA undercover operation.The sting to get Reacher inside the target's base that opens the book is explosive and sets the pace for a high velocity, breakneck plot.Busting a drug import business is the DEA's goal (it turns out that it is far more destructive than drugs); Reacher's is to put an end to someone he thought killed ten years earlier. We learn his motive via an insightful backstory.Hunter and prey stalk one another in this suspenseful, deftly plotted compressed time period window.As usual, Lee Child makes the most of a limited cast by making all characters three dimensional, including the ruthless villains.Reacher's credo is \\"Never forgive, never forget.\\" Lee Child makes Reacher impossible to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not up to Lee Child standards. This one has a very thin plot, and has too much willy-nilly violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heck of A First Chapter","review":"If the reader is willing to suspend his disbelief quite a ways, PERSUADER will satisfy the action junkie's taste for thrills. The opening sequence is absolutely nails. It, alone, is worth the price of admission.What follows doesn't completely fulfill that promise. It's a complicated, sordid business with a massive body count. There are times when it feels like Child himself is lost in his own plot, painting himself into difficult corners.The location of most of the novel--a promontory on the Maine coast--offers no escape for the novel's characters but it seems a hindrance to the author, too. By the we reach the third act, the reader will be aching for a new setting. It doesn't come.Still, Reacher continues to fascinate. His single-minded pursuit of western-style justice makes PERSUADER very readable. There are a lot worse ways to spend a couple of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"excitment","review":"Lee Child Reacher novels are so much fun to read. His character Jack Reacher is a man that does what he feels is right no matter what. This guy is a pittbull. I really like how irreverant he (Jack) is to people in authority. He is a real smartass sometimes and cracks me up but at the same time he is very ruthless to the evil doers.I like Lee Childs' writing style, he gets right to the point, no dilly dallying the reading takes off like a shot and delivers. No wasting of words.I also have learned a lot about weaponry and military protocol since Child does explain a bit about these.All in all a fun read as usual, go get 'em Jack."},{"rating":"2","title":"JACK REACHER NUMBER SEVEN","review":"In almost every book in the Reacher series, Lee Child asks the reader to accept the premise that a police agency or government agency will ask a drifter, out of work loner to save the day, albeit, ex military police officer, and along the way probably break a lot of laws and be smart than the folks he works for. That being accepted the Jack Reacher stories are a fun worthwhile read. I like the stories and the character Jack Reacher. PERSUADER is one of the better ones I have read so far, and as always I suggest reading them in order if possible. This story has some nasty bad guys and good guys that don't interfere. I really liked it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking and Rolling Action Packed","review":"I chanced upon this terrific novel at the bookstore where I work. On a whim I picked it up and started reading--what a ride. It's probably the most pleasantly surprised I've been in a long while. The action is hot and super-fast paced. Reacher is a terrific hero who is the modern day equivalent of Dirty Harry. I could almost envision a young Clint Eastwood in the part. I've heard rumors that all of the Child novels have been optioned, so I'll eagerly await the next novel this summer and the movies hopefully to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretches patience to the limit","review":"As much as I love Jack Reacher, Lee Child does him a disservice in Persuader. Child's ability to set up obstacles for Reacher is creative, but he is over his head when it comes to sustaining the thrill. No matter how compelling a scene, Child is uncanny in the way he can stretch it past a logical end, leaving the reader unsatisfied and, in some cases, bored. Had I not felt committed at page 409, I would have thrown the book across the room in frustration. While reading Persuader, I wondered who had the toughest time finishing this story - Jack Reacher or me."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd of three 1 stars from me","review":"I've read 3 of his books - this is the worst of the 3 - not worth any more letters let alone words.One point - he's still doing the 3 plots woven together - see my other comments - it's still easy to jump over the filler.

Jack Reacher in this story has to make some really hard choices. In parts of the story the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering if Reacher will make it through because of the tremendous and insurmountable odds he faces but he does in with much creativity and determination. His can do attitude and positive feedback through positive talking to himself makes the impossible...possible. For me this is a great story for the reader can take much with him as he reads the final pages. Yes good conquers all evil if you are able to laugh in its face and never give up. A quote that I have heard frequently in this journey call life is one of my favorites: \\"When the going gets tough, the tough get going.\\" This saying is credited to the late President John F.

The beginning was great, but as the book moved along, there were characters who were just cartoon bad guys and sometimes the storyline was a bit jagged. I plan to move along and read No. 8 soon, so it the flaws were not enough for me to retreat from all Jack Reacher novels in the series.

I especially liked the discussion of how women and the environment are connected through language through the use of word's like \\"Mother Nature.\\" That use in particular was to put it in a word pimp. Warren covers all areas of ecofeminist thought, and is extremely fair to those critical of ecofeminism. To anyone interested in learning about how our domination of the environment undergirds our domination of other groups this book is perfect. As I said before, this work by a \\"street philosopher,\\" is simply pimp.

Much of the footage comes from artists' performances at the German Musicladen locale. The lighting varies a bit from excellent for America to poor for BTO where Randy Bachman looks like a creature from a horror movie. The sound however, is consistantly good throughout.

Why would a (supposedly) happily married woman throw away an eleven year marriage? She had the nice house on the lake, a career she enjoyed, yet more importantly, she had a healthy relationship with both a loving husband and child. All they forgot was the picket fence. So why does she cheat in the first place? Although it was never discussed, there was a possibility things weren't 100% in the bedroom for Lane's character. Even if that were true... well, hello? Ever heard of communication? Isn't that what women have been complaining to us guys about all along?If that's not enough to keep you away, let me say that the ending is very unsatisfying. Without spoiling the movie, there are way too many loose ends and, quite frankly, the ending that is presented is unbelievable.This movie cheapens marriage to the point where it has no value. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite disappointed","review":"My wife wanted to watch this...now I know why. The name of the movie pretty much gives away the plot so very little needs to be said about it. Wife (Diane Lane) is bored and cheats on hubby (Richard Gere) with some young french guy that you can barely understand. Nuff said.I found this to be incredibly slow. Most of the scenes are way to long and soporific at best. The characters have next to no chemistry and there is very little about them that will cause you to be even slightly interested in them or what they are going through. \\"Fans\\" of Diane Lane may find something to entertain them but that is about all I can think of in regards to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show and Tell","review":"This movie is about 1 centimeter from being X rated. With a good story, plot line, acting, you don't need to go to the extreem with the sex stuff. As I was looking around the theater, I noticed others as uncomfortable as I, and a mad rush to the door as soon as it was over. Many individuals were squirming in their seets, and not from a rush of hormones. They, like myself, were uncomfortable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic","review":"This film deals with infedility and takes it to another level. The ending is pretty silly considering what lead to that point, however it is a very good film.Diane Lane is captivating. The scene where she's on her way home on the train and thoughts run through her head is incredible. The range of emotions she shows in those few minutes are unbelieveable. That is truly one of the all-time classic, non-verbal scenes in hollywood.Richard Gere is alright.

However, it gets pretty clear that the writer and director have NO IDEA how to end this movie, and it seems like it ends SIX times.FILM FACT: The little boy who plays Gere & Lane's child is the most rivetingly obnoxious child actor ever (played by some kid from Malcolm in the Middle)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!!","review":"I always look forward to seeing an Adrian Lyne movie. Look at 9 1/2 Weeks and Fatal Attraction for reasons why. But this movie is actually one of his best movies. This movie is not for sensitive eyes because its a sexy movie. However, the acting is wonderful and passionate. The interaction between Gere and Lane was wonderful. I recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"And she was unfaithful why?","review":"While this wasn't a horrible movie, it certainly wasn't great. It seemed that the writers didn't spend enough time at the beginning of the movie establishing a relationship between the wife and the lover to make me believe that this reasonably happy woman would go flitting off to the city every day to have a raunchy affair. The fact that her illicit lover was french just seemed like one more cliche, though at least the writers had the good grace not to make him an artist.Unlike the other reviewers, I thought the second half of the movie was rather better than the first, because the interaction between Diane Lane and Richard Gere, with both of them lying but about different things, was rather good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Predictable Pleasure","review":"This is by no means a 5 star movie. I'd actually give it 2.5 stars, if it were possible. Right from the start you basically can see how it's all going to end. I felt as though the director tried to cover up the weak predictable script by making every scene overly-dramtic with pounding music and flashy camera moves. The acting however, made up for the predictable story.Diane Lane is by far the best thing about this movie. She did give a great performance, as a selfish immature mother, although it is not Oscar worthy. The other characters were cliched, and the French guy with whom Diane's character has the affair, is downright annoying.All in all, this is a slightly entertaining movie worth watching when you have nothing better to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must admit .......","review":"I originally only watched this to see Diane Lane naked. But I became involved enough in the story to actually feel a bit sorry for Richard Gere. Believe me that's hard to do considering I generally don't like him in any movie he's in (the only notable exception is Primal Fear).The story progressed into areas I didn't expect, and therefore kept me interested until the end. Speaking of the ending, I didn't much care for where the audience is left at. The alternate ending in the DVD sheds a little more light into it, but I didn't like it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thriller","review":"Check this one out.

Richard Gere and Diane Lane were great, but when you see Olivier Martinez.....WOW!!! You just never know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"While I must admit that this was an erotic movie that was more than I expected. Richard Gere plays the unaware (in the beginning) husband who reacts calmer to the circumstances initially that you would think. But things change in a heartbreak. Diane Lane does a wonderful job as the confused housewife who has something missing in her life she can't put a finger on.What struck me most about the movie was the way it made you think on it. There were many little clues left on avenues that were never followed up on. The effect was to leave you thinking about what may have been going on behind the scene. Was everything like it appeared? The movie does not answer many of your questions but it does make you think (if you are prone to ponder).A movie worth seeing, if you take a date, sit close. Many scenes will leave you wanting to sit close - for good reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rest of the story?","review":"The first half was very good, steamy as is typical with an Adrian Lyne movie. However, the second half went from bad to worse. The ending was very rushed and it seemed as if someone had lost half the script, so the actors had to improvise. I have never been impressed with Diane Lane and this movie didn't change my opinion of her. Richard Gere, a wonderful actor, wasted his talents. I had expected an all around much better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"No big deal.","review":"I saw the movie last week, and I thought it was nothing special. Another bored housewife cheats on her husband and it never turns out well... Diane Lane was very good with Olivier, but the movie just got freaky and disjointed.

A long way to go to no where."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a terrible movie!","review":"So here we are after having read all the oh so positive reviews and after seeing it, I now understand why the reviews are positive, there is almost no story, talk about the performances and the dialogues especially the ones from Diane Lane, and I want people who haven't seen it yet that for the \\"thriller\\" part of it, it doesn't start before about the half of the movie which is nothing but about sex; nothing wrong with it but I don't need to go to a theater to see this. Richard Gere's performance is the only one worth seeing, the other two being just about being laid and that's about it. What a shame that US directors came to pick up that awful Oliver Martinez from us in France as if we didn't see enough of him yet! This movie is nowhere to being a classic, and is just an excuse to film some more sex for the frustrated viewers! Useless movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this film!!","review":"If you are a big fan of Flash Dance and Nine and a 1/2 Weeks you will also love the wonderful dark, mysterious and sensual cinematography once again in Unfaithful.

The dialog is difficult to hear, as the soundtrack is SO loud and the actors all mumble their lines. There is zero chemistry between Diane Lane and the actor that plays her lover. This film is very slow and about 45 minutes longer than it needs to be. A lot of graphic sex scenes doesn't make a movie sexy and we just couldn't wait for it to be over. Overall, very, very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfaithful","review":"I thought the movie was too intense. I am very sensitive and that is why I watch most movies at home rather than in a theatre. The acting was superb but I didn't watch it all the way through because it was getting scarier by the minute, and my heart is tooo old for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"It says something when, in a movie about a woman's torrid extramarital affair and the problems that result, the most interesting character is a seven-year-old kid. What it says is that the movie in question - Unfaithful - is a sub-par film.In Unfaithful, Diane Lane plays a \\"happily\\" married woman who with little reason starts an affair with a bookseller. Despite her occasional crying spells, she doesn't really seem all that concerned about who the affair is hurting until it is too late. Richard Gere is her husband who catches on reasonably quickly and eventually takes drastic action to deal with the situation.The biggest problem with this movie is that it is boring. Even the sex scenes - and there are several of these - are rather dull. Add to this an unlikable lead character who has complete disregard for her family and it is hard to enjoy this movie. While some of the acting and writing is decent, overall, this is a tedious event and easily earns a mere two star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIANE LANE is sheer class in brilliant, cool & sexy movie!","review":"This was one of the best thrillers I have seen this year. Well directed with a very hypnotic quality. The film has everything, it's sexy, it's stylish, it's engrossing, it's gripping, and it's cool. Furthermore, it has one of the best female performances I have ever witnessed. DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Streets Of Fire) is absolutely sensational. The acting by all (including Richard Gere and the unbelieveably delicious Olivier Martinez) was very strong, but this is Diane Lane's movie. \\"Unfaithful\\" is a terrific movie, which is near perfect in every regard. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous film with fabulous acting on a fabulous DVD. 5 star","review":"Unfaithful is a fabulous film with fabulous acting by star Diane Lane.

A fabulous film on a fabulous DVD. 5 stars and highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatal Attraction","review":"The first half hour of viewing, I was thinking I was going to see a millenium version of \\"Fatal Attraction\\", but fortunately, Adrian Lynne switches gears and mixes it up, directing a haunting and sad, forbidden love story. All of the acting was top notch, I was especially impressed with Richard Geres performance, he did a genuine job playing a downtrodden husband. I truely felt sorry for his character. I also enjoyed the acting by the italian lover (don't know his name). He's a great actor. This film also has one of the most disturbing, real life looking murder scenes I've ever seen in film, I couldn't even watch it, I had to turn my head away form the tv. The ending of the film was a bit disappointing. It's really hard for films like this to have a spectacular ending, but overall, this was an interesting film."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring movie","review":"Why did it take the director of this movie so long to get the point across that an extra-martial affair hurts everyone involved and in the case of this movie can lead to a violent death. Half of the scenes in this movie could have been left out and the point still would have come across that no good can come of an encounter with a stanger on a windy day. I didn't need a whole movie to figure that out. This is the kind of movie to watch if you have an afternoon to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic , a nonsense movie","review":"Well , i sat on the chair , and all i could see was betrayal , sextual contents ,and broken hearts .

The first time around I liked it, but when I saw it the second time after buying the DVD.. it got to me and really wrenched my emotions. I am one that hates sitting down to see a film for 2 hours and getting nothing out of it. If youre going to watch a movie then WATCH A MOVIE! This one wont let you down. The music absolutely makes the film. Its very dark and somber to say the least. You should see this one.. it has made me a diane lane fan... and a richard gere fan where I had hadnt been at all before. Its an excellent romantic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"a study in acting, if nothing else...","review":"This is an excellent movie mostly because of the virtuoso performance by Diane Lane. Even Richard Gere is good as her sympathetic husband. The movie is somewhat weak on plot and is similiar to a movie like Kramer v Kramer in that it is more just a glimpse of a situation someone happens to be in. There are only a couple of ways a movie like this can end, and, without spoiling it, the ending is really no surprise. Still, because of the great acting and Adrian Lynn's steady directing, it's worth seeing as a very well made movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfaithful - uninteresting","review":"An incredibly boring reinactment demonstrating the pitfalls of adultery and betrayal.

Yes, Diane Lane's performance is good, but it is surrounded by a story that is so boring and predictable they should prescribe it for insomniacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked so many people liked this film!","review":"Could a film drip with MORE cliches and stereotypes? (\\"Let's see....I know! Make the lover French! With dark features! Mysterious! Exotic! Make the husband a nitwit! Yeah, that's the ticket!\\")I've seen it all before and done much better than this. When I saw it in the movie theater with a few friends, a majority of the audience actually started LAUGHING OUT LOUD at the sex scenes between Diane Lane and her lover, ESPECIALLY the scene where they are standing up in the stairwell. It was absolutely ridiculous. I have honestly never seen an audience laugh at a scene that clearly was not meant to be humorous.Don't get me wrong--the first twenty minutes had me mesmerized. But it went quickly downhill with every preposterous, cliched turn.If you do waste your time on this film, pay special attention to the sex in the stairwell scene and see if you find it funny, too. If you don't waste your time watching it, congratulations. Wish I could say the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"this is a chick movie and barely a thriller.

The ending is horrible and could happen only in the movies.

She is not unhappy. She is not bored. She loves her husband and their son. But we are expected to believe that she would fling herself into an affair with an unattractive, scuzzy-lookin' French guy after knowing him for, oh, about ten minutes. Gimme a break! Lane's performance is pretty good, but Richard Gere is fairly awful as the wronged husband fighting for his self-control. The kid is played by one of the Malcolm in the Middle kids, who looks absolutely nothing like a child Lane and Gere would possibly have together. After long, boring tedium, the movie ends with -- ta daa!!! -- SYMBOLISM!!!

But thankfully it doesn't.Sacred builds on the group's debut album nicely. The Texican blues/rock/rock en espanol/Stevie Ray Vaughan touches are all still there. There's more instrumentation than the debut, which is a nice addition. The songs are all very catchy - but again, without being too catchy or cheesy. The lyrics and rhyming are somewhat predictable at times, but really, who cares when they sound this good?I give Los Lonely Boys a lot of respect for writing their own songs, playing their own instruments, and co-producing the album.

Scared the Hell out of me. I saw on the internet where they actually filmed the movie at several locations, but Lewistown was in the mix.

The pace never slows once they defrost the alien asparagus - you never get a break and the edge of your seat is where you need to be for this one. While the realities of daily life provide us with enough awful shocks, this one is a timeless classic and can serve as an escape in a time where escape is much needed.

The picture COLOR and STEREO sound in my opinion really improved the presentation but unfortunately they edited out so much of the movie that parts of it didn't make complete sense. If they could add color and improve the sound quality then, I know that they could do a better job now without REMOVING any of the original scenes.

It is lightyears ahead of its time and will send true jitters down your spine no matter how many unrealistic CGI monsters of today, or silly monster suits of the past, you have seen in cinema.Again, stay away from this 50's \\"classic\\" unless you are a senior citizen feeling downright nostalgic."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL STORY","review":"For years I wanted to see this Movie I was told it was a classic. I could not be more dissapointed. The Thing fron Another World is based off the short story (Who Goes There ) .

Now if you want to see the real story check out the 1982 version by John Carpenter.

But face it the only reason anyone remembers this old movie is because of John Carpenters Remake in 1982 that was great!And by the way this movie is (nothing)like the short story (Who Goes There) that it is based on. The only reason I saw this movie was to see what the 1951 movie was like. I know that in 1951 they did not have the greatest special FX but that is not all it lacks. The writing and the story in this movie are very basic. At times in the movie I am waiting for SHAGY and SCOOBY DOO to run by with the monster chasing them . Even the way they get rid of the monster is like an episode of Scooby Doo. If you have not seen this movie and you are a fan of the 1982 remake you might get a good laugh out of this at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good IMHO.","review":"I don't like this film because of the unwarranted hype!

Sorry folks but truly none whatsoever.. Maybe my earlier expectations shot thru' the roof since I did not know better than to trust the questionable reviews here. But all I can say is this, this film may appeal to some and is actually not too bad but at the same time, it is not great either. I think the word \\"cult\\" is a great misnomer for this movie.

Ah, the wonders of youth!I really would have enjoyed something in the way of interviews (Tobey or Arness perhaps) or at least, as was already stated, some comments and thoughts from experienced directors.

Seeing THE THING again 50 years later, I remembered every single scene. How's that for being memorable?

Set in the frozen artic in the early cold war era, it's a period piece that captures the spirit of that time without getting too campy. We see just enough to keep us horrified, minus the gross-out tendencies of contemporary moviemaking. James Arness makes his pre-Gunsmoke debut as the super carrot from another planet, growing his own army and terrorizing a small group of servicemen and civilians at a remote polar outpost. With decent acting and a kind of understated theme, it works well as a film that has the good sense not to outreach itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thing from Another World","review":"A strong, early entry from the golden age of science fiction movies-- and produced by legendary director Howard Hawks-- it still holds up as genuinely creepy and gripping entertainment.

But--I can see hardly any difference in print quality from my disc than from my video tape. Also, since this is one of the great seminal movies from the 50s, why are there no extras--except a dippy little trailer? So many of the cast members are still alive and well, especially Margaret Sheridan, who was interviewed last year by FilmFax magazine and gave some lively insights to fascinating incidents before and behind the camera. It's frustrating to finally have our great classics appearing on DVD--but without any extra features which would strongly add to their allure for prospective buyers. Fantastic movie but dissapointing DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories of black and white late night creature feature.","review":"Loved this movie growing up....and still love watching it.

So many remakes have been done and have been less than successful in following the the original plot, design, emotion and acting.

Just as the \\"Reds.\\" It was \\"The Thing/it against us.Of course, John Carpenter made the remake with many frightening \\"Alien\\" type horror scenes. Bodies splitting open. You can't trust anyone. This was also the paranoia of who to killed or be killed.But again the original was way ahead of its time. Women scientists, a reporter and military forces in the frozen wasteland, who measure the size of the saucer. They defrost and eventually destroy the alien/monster in a very clever manner. James Arness never looked more frightening.

There are seven chapters covering current issues in the field followed by readings, references, and a glossary.Besides its brevity and well designed layout this book also excels at clarity. Many authors try to say the same thing but in far too many words. Kramsch has managed to write a book that is an asset to the series.There is nothing new or startling in the contents of the book.

This said, the book is still an excellent introduction to the subject. Readers should be aware that it is in the nature of an 80 page survey to condense matters (just imagine the huge amount of literature that has been written on the subject). However, students should also be aware that the terminology introduced is necessary for the study of the subject.

The author takes some rather basic ideas and obscures them with complicated terms that no one in the world except for some (to general public unknown) anthropologists care about. I understand these ideas - most of them are simple e.g., that a foreign student with a good comprehension of English can still misunderstand a text because of an unfamiliarity with the culture. But why should I as an engineering student, or any other student for that matter need to waste their \\"precious time\\" (as Americans say) learning little known or cared for terms with petty terminology.

Instead, it is a sales pitch for the Microsoft's new business initiative on \\"information superhighway\\", which in others words -- the Internet. Consider the miserable performance of Microsoft today in the Internet domain more than 10 years after this book was published, this books feels like a joke, full of wishful thinking.What really bothers me is Gates' rambling on many random topics throughout this book. From politics to world hunger, the author does not have any new insight to offer to the reader, and simply repeats the general view of news agency. It reveals the shallowness of Bill Gates. Perhaps Bill Gates is a super-smart businessman, but he is such a lazy thinker.Do not expect to learn anything new from this book.

Not all of Gate's visions may come true concerning the directions it is likely to take and it's effect on our society; but it certainly gives the reader a springboard for their own thoughts.

He recognizes the weakenesses of his competitors and allies alike. While the media portrays Mr. Gates as a meglomaniac, he does present a compelling case for the future that everyone can understand.While his evaluation of the past is fairly accurate, Mr. Gates does present several ideas for the future that may be hard to believe. His vision does also indicate the dream of the social introvert. For example, the idea of the \\"Wallet PC\\" is funny. In his examples, finding a resturant and finding directions, he shows us that he finds these tasks a little too much for his demeanor. Another example is the PC ID tag for parties that would blink when encountering another of the same interests.

I'm anxious to see what he will come up with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technology is Only a Tool","review":"Written by the Master of technology, the book THE ROAD AHEAD attempts to define the computer revolution and its impact on the future. As time has passed the computer revolution has taken us to places we have never dreamed of (both positive and negative). And it will continue to do so. Each generation of thought stands on the shoulders of previous thought.I highly recommend reading this book. But I also feel the reader needs to recognize the marketing genius of Bill Gates in writing such a book as this. After reading this work, we each need to stop and question if the revolution in the computer sciences is as really as profoundly important to our society as the revolution in the brain sciences.

(he hopes the first thing you notice when you come in is not the electronic pins he hands out, but his \\"beautiful\\" view if the lake outside) he seems to be saying, \\"look at me, I'm rich!\\" very nerdy. if you want a book about the future, read 1984 by George Orwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is the best part...","review":"All right, maybe I'm misjudging it. The CD is entertaining. This isn't a revolutionary tome written by a techno-visionary inventor, it's more a nice little pamphlet introducing people to Our Friend, Mr. Computer. Having read it 4 years ago, I found it just as vapid as Donald Trump's Art of the Deal: you find the same self-congratulation packaged as wisdom, but since Trump never claimed to be doing anything new, it's even worse. You get a techno-primer on such things as the binary system, a cute picture of a boy Gates fooling with a PDP-8, a lot of talk about his way-kewl house, and a CD-ROM showing off what life is going to be like in a Windows-centric future.

It clearly proves that Gates has relied on the ideas of others for greatness, as the man does not have an original idea in his head. At the same time, it is true that he is a brilliant wheeler and dealer, and master manipulator of markets. His forte has been as a rip-off artist, as the evidence coming out in the current DOJ trial clearly shows. If the road ahead is dominated by Bill Gates, it will be a sorry state for consumers and competitors alike.

Most enjoyable was the interactive CD Rom in the center of the book containing text, interviews, a tour of Bill's house, and other great features. (It was a nice touch!)Mr Gates is overly optomistic that computers and the internet will solve most of society's problems.

He takes the opportunity to clearly point out where his dreams as a computer revolutionary meet and fall away from his goals running the most powerful technology company ever.The book is set up like a bunch of speeches. This is how Gates said he thought would be his most effective writing style, and it works to minimize unnecessary blather while focusing on key points. Obviously, Gates has a lot of inside information to analyze situations and products upcoming, and the mental skill to back up his predictions, theories, and assessments.Now that the book's been out quite awhile, it makes for a good read to reflect on some things and await what's to come.

Those who committed the murder were two schoolgirl friends, Pauline Parker (nee Rieper) and Juliet Hume. The victim was Parker's mother. The authors surmise that a lesbian relationship between the girls was the passion behind the crime as they believed that Pauline's mother was an obstacle to their spending their lives together. This so-called study is hardly worth reading at all because in spite of the extensive sources named, neither Parker nor Hulme were ever consulted or interviewed. The authors write and contrive as a pair, resulting in an annoying litany of \\"we were told this\\" and \\"we believe that\\". For a far superior account of this tragic event that shook the archly conservative city of Christchurch, see the movie HEAVENLY CREATURES instead. Though it too is a contrivance, it is much more artfully and sensibly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"More photographs would have been better.","review":"I believe the book was written in 1991, perhaps it could be looked at again seeing as so much new information has come to light ie/Juliet Hulme as Anne Perry, like a second edition with additions.

There are no heroes, just opportunists, obsessives and dangerous madmen. It aspires towards the compelling mundanity of the French policier - the central story is a murder mystery, and some of the personnel were involved in Melville's finest films - and has pertinent things to say about how the Allies compromised with Nazis after the war; but in the end the film is too fond of demonising the old sexually neurotic Nazi villain. None of it works, and yet its oddly watchable in its way - perhaps because its indecision as to what it is makes it unpredictable; more probably, because you can watch Peter O'Toole giving a remote, cold, quietly mannered performance which still savours of the finest ham."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is weird","review":"i dont get this movie at all the start is good and makes you want to watch but then all of a sudden im falling a sleep becase cant figure it out all i know is that a nazi gen killed a woman and framed some guy who is driver and 30 years later or so he is caught and kills him self what happend betewn that time why is this a big deal hes a nazi gen this is going to happen right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice surprise","review":"I found this movie while checking my Reccommended List.

The story is gripping, and the inter-play between war and post-war settings helps move things along. More than most other World War II films, \\"The Night of the Generals\\" depicts German soldiers who really didn't like Hitler, but merely wanted to live and enjoy life.I would characterize this film as a World War II film unlike any other that I have seen. I especially liked Omar Sharif's character - a Nazi German military intelligence officer entranced with a Polish prostitute's murder in 1942 Warsaw. Fast forward two years to 1944 Paris, and we find the same officer investigating a similar murder. The very notion that such a crime would occupy this officer's time is comical, considering that the Allies are pushing to retake Paris and that he is supposed to be investigating a plot to kill Hitler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donald Pleasence at his best.","review":"Perfect for watching when you're tired from working.

I was a bit surprised to see how lowly these reviews were. Now I know why. Things have changed for the worse in these intervening years.

As someone whose parents wanted nothing more than for me to go to an Ivy League school and follow them into the world of banking, I couldnt have identified more with Chloe. Although she loves her eccentric family and wants to please them, she knows in her heart of hearts that design school is where she is meant to be and that she must follow her passion. You dont have to love fashion or clothes as much as the reader or her main character does to like this book. The writer speaks to young girls everywhere. She writes with a sense of humor and incredible wit and I LOVED the glossary in the back of the book. I cant wait for the next book to see what happens to Chloe.

Abby, the new owner of Divinity Candy Shop, was wishy washy and, frankly, not too bright. By the end of the book I was seriously tired of hearing about her cheating ex-husband and the dysfunctional relationship she has with her drunk, self-centered brother and her nasty, know-it-all cousin/employee.The mystery was silly; the ending predictable (even without any real clues).The recipes sounded really good and, yep, I liked the dog.

I grew up eating smoked fish in Scandinavia, and the fish was always bursting with this salty, smoky, fantastic flavor. Unfortunately, this salmon was truly tasteless in comparison. I understand that the natural oils included in the package were for moistness, but the oil smelled, to me, like watery tuna on the verge of spoiling. The color was really close to gray, which also put me off. I really wanted to like it, but nope. Perhaps if you prefer extremely mild and extremely moist salmon, this might be for you.

Look for another one.The lens itself seems ok, although I can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal. The adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released. This would be great, except for two very important things. One, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. This causes some MAJOR distortion, especially when moving. Two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable. In fact it is so cheaply thin that I am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic.

Anne Bancroft stars as his mother, Jenny, and Robert Shaw as his father, Sir Randolph Churchill. Bancroft's character is less promiscuous than was Churchill's real mother. Shaw, however, captures the distant relationship between father and son and accurately portrays the elusive Parliamentary leader.The young actor portraying Winston joins them in an excellent performance. He balances Churchill's raw ambition with his overwhelming sense of honor and high calling. He foreshadows, but does not overplay, the speech patterns and unique orating style of the future Prime Minister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Winston","review":"This is a very fine picture which follows very closely WSC's early autobiography 'My Early Years'.

This book by George Howe, through his characters, explores the mindset of both types and the dilemma of acting against the goals of your own country.I read this book as a teenager in 1951 and found it a gripping story with detailed descriptions so accurate of the times and places that one wonders how the author could know all this. Years later, as an amateur WWII historian, I came across information that George Howe, the author, was a member of the OSS during the war. My guess is that this story, though fictionalized, is an amalgam of real people and real events which the author participated in during his OSS service.

It sounds like mediocre Phil Collins meets lounge jazz. KebMo is an amazing fingerstyle guitar player, but there's hardly any on this album. He has a wonderful blues voice, just a little raspy and wistfully blue, but he sings like he's trying to do pop songs. He's an amazing songwriter, but well, he just didn't write very good songs this time. It's a good thing he didn't really cover any old blues songs - the rest of the album would have looked a lot weaker by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassette and y want a CD's, desapointed.","review":"I order a capol of CD'S and oll the companis send a Cassette, and oder sen 3 CD'S and ist not from LUIS miguel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cd.","review":"The songs in this cd are excellent, my wife love lisen cd's from Luis Miguel, the cd 20 anos is have great songs, i recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely perfect size!","review":"I opted for the white one to hold all 12 of my pink kitchen utensils and it's the perfect size.

However, there isn't much here that I haven't seen before. I didn't feel like I was doing anything \\"new\\". Also, the instructors don't really break down the moves for you, and I often found myself lost as they continued into a completely different position out of nowhere.

The movements were generally easy to follow, although they are not really broken down. And honestly, I was so busy sweating that I didn't even pay attention to the music.

I am not very coordinated, so the beginning was difficult for me, but I did not get discouraged and pushed myself to learn the moves. Some of the exercises I had a difficult time doing, now the more I do them the easier they have become and the harder I am able to push myself.

The ringtones on the phone are really dumb and there are only 3 or 4 music tones, all of which sound stupid. The ringtones are also too soft to hear if you carry the phone on the street. One look and you'll see this is _NOT_ a durable phone at all. The all-plastic body feels it'll break anyday now. Well in my case I didn't drop it or anything, it just wouldn't turn on after 2 days.

I had been interested in Virgin Mobile's pay-as-you-go plan and was excited when they came out with their beautiful new flip phone. After buying it, I have almost no complaints. The color screen is great, the games that come with it are fun little extras, and it's very easy to use. It also comes with a world clock, scheduler, calculator, and up to three alarms you can set (so don't pay $ .25 each to buy them off virgin). The wallpapers that come with it are okay, though I am not a fan of the ringtones. Right now virgin has a promo and you can get three free ringtones off their site though, so take advantage of it while you can. The only negative thing I would say about this phone is that the coverage could be better....but as long as you don't live in the middle of nowhere you should be okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK VIRGIN MOBILE, THIS COST TOO MUCH/switch to ATT","review":"to start out, the phone is good and nice if you want to show off. The real music tones are very weak and cant make out what theyre saying because of the bad audio. Also it cost wayyy to much. It cost 25cents for the 1st 10 minutes. wayy to much. Thats 2.50 cents a day just to get 10 cents a minutue. Listen if you want a Bargain, go to www.attwireless.com for some refubished color flip phones. Theyre are only 10 dollars. No Joke. I just but a LG1150 for 10 dollarsd when they had it for the go phone. But if you get one you wont regret it. Att also offer free nights and weekends and the rest is 10cents. THe best part is its PREPAID."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like The Service But Not Some Of The Features","review":"I like the Vigin Mobile servicethey actually do try to make the customer happy and create offers and new products to the consumer. But Virgin Mobile is not like other pay as you go services like T-Mobile. It seems that the customer is restricted from other sites. With other mobile services you are able to buy and download screensavers,ringtones,and wallpappers, but not with Virgin Mobile atleast not on there older phones. IF Virgin Mobile comes up with a new feature it should be available to every other phone instead of just the new ones. Besides that I still favor Virgin Mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful About the Reception Area","review":"The phone seemed like a bargain if you don't use a cell phone very much, and it would have been if there were any signal.

A nice investment for someone on a low budget who doesnt talk alot or for a student. A very good bargain. For the regular plan you pay 25 cents for the first 10 minutes, then 10 cents a minutes after. For the advanced plan for someone who talks more theres 35 cents a day, then 10 cents a minute. Good bargain in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so cool!","review":"I've had this phone for about a year and I love it.

I love the Virgin Mobile pre-paid and I think that this phone is the best of the lot.This phone has been through a lot. First, I dropped it on a hardwood floor and the batteries fell out, but somehow kept all my status. Secondly, I left it outside by accident and it survived. And finally, I put it through the washing machine (accidently leaving it in my pocket) and it still works, not a number out of place.I think that if you are going for a Virign Mobile phone, or even a cool phone, this is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Phone","review":"I've been a virgin mobile user for about 4 months now. Although I don't have great reception here, it's decent. Even if there isn't any reception at all, there is still clear calls. The phone itself is great. I'm thinking about getting the Flasher V7 or the new and upcoming Kyocera K10 Royale. The only problem with the phone that i've had so far is when your doing whatever on it, then flip it closed, if you flip it too hard it'll shut-off and power up again. Also, it may not come back on. But i've gotten used to having it do that. Doesn't do it much. Overall, this is a great phone for you users that hate monthly contracts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally a good phone for a low end user","review":"I was shocked with the service plans that are offered now when my brother renwed his contract with another company. Initially, we were going to grab a family plan, but those were so outrageous, that I had to find my own plan.The standard battery I got did not last as long as 7 days when I first fully charged it. I average about 3-4 days between recharges and I'm not a big user. (This was a key feature choice over the older 8500)Customer service was good, and the Top-up cards are everywhere.There are some places where coverage is a little spotty, but all and all Sprint has done a wonderful job in providing good signals. Check the Sprint service map before you buy if you're in a smaller city.Virgin is a good choice for occasional users who aren't heavy on their phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some improvements over the 8500 series","review":"I previously owned an Audiovox 8500 and upgraded to the 8610. It is an improved phone in many ways. The keypad is larger and easier to operate. The screen has color. The 8610 lacks the voice dialing feature, but I didn't really miss it. However, I had to return the phone when I discoverd that the ringtones on the 8610 are only 1/2 as loud as the ringtones on the original 8500. In noisy environments, I couldn't hear the phone ringing. So I'm back to my 8500."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great phone!","review":"I really have no complaints. It has great coverage so I'm never out of my service area. You can save a lot of money if you don't talk a lot, or you can use one of Virgin Mobile's new plans if you do talk a lot. With a nice color screen and access to MTV and Virgin Mobile ringtones anywhere, how can you not love this phone? It has everything you need in a cell phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice phone if i could use it","review":"I purchaced this phone and activted it online and everything went smooth, until I wanted to call someone or someone tried to call me.

Good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"This phone is just terrible, to the point that it's almost laughable. It gets terrible reception, the battery is just awful and, believe it or not, the phone is actually a liar.

It's kind of sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"dishonest service","review":"First of all, my 8610 has what I would call barely passing qualities. It only works in high density population areas, goes out underground, and is very hard to hear conversations with. The main reason I am writing this is the dishonest service I have gotten from Virgin Mobile. They added an extra service to it, \\"Joke of the Day\\", without me giving the OK, and charged me for it. I hadn't used my phone in a week and discovered all of these \\"Jokes of the Day\\", and a with a message from Virgin, a week ago, telling me they were starting the \\"Joke\\" service, with payment, unless I indicated not to. I feel that I should be given the choice of saying \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" before the service is started. Well, the \\"Joke\\" is on them, I'll be dropping them and looking for someone more honest and reliable. Also, I know someone else who had Virgin pull a similar stunt on. the person stopped the 'extra' service, and later on, VIrgin started it up again, without notifying them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know what phone the previous reviewer used...","review":"But it wasn't this one. Personally i love this phone, works great, never had a single problem with the quality, sound or reception. Easy to use programming. For someone who doesn't want a lot of extras, ive had mine for a year, and would not trade it for nothing. It may not have a lot of bells and whistles, but as long as i can get my calls, and receive them hassle free, im satisifed. Customer service and support from Verizon is excellent. For those who do not want to get caught up in payment plans, this pre-paid cell phone is the one to buy. Plus you don't need to email me to ask.

I emailed their support and they asked that I send it in and see if they could salvage the hard drive. Ok I admit that I became impatient at this point and decided to get a second one from office depot. I opened both cases and swapped the internal hard drives thinking that is was only the power connection. I know not the best idea, but I was desperate for the information I stored on it. After adding the power to the second one it also shorted out, and both models are useless. I think the second part of the story is my fault, but defiantly not the first part.

Just got a new laptop, new router to plug the disk into, and decided to recover my files. Downloaded the latest driver, went through re-registering the thing...out of about 20 tries, maybe 3 times it indicated it was mounted. But when I tried to open the disk it would get disconnected.

The drive works fine ... except when it doesn't. I've had my PC (which runs Windows XP Pro) lock up more than usual ever since I got this drive. Ximeta tech support is usually pretty responsive but their tech people give conflicting information. One will tell me that they've never heard of my particular problem then another will email and tell me something like \\"yeah, we know about this issue and we're working on it...\\" And it always seems that the fix is to download and install new drivers which have yet to resolve my issues.

Thus, whenever you turn off the computer, you have to shut off Windows so that it takes long time when you turn on the machine again. They are obviously aware of the problem and claim that their new 2.42 version NDAS driver solves the problem. NO.

I had hoped it would be as easy and as lighting fast as I had read. It was not, not even close. Tech support is poor; performance of this product is extremely poor. It would take my other computers about 20-25 seconds to access the main database I use, now with this Netdisk it is at least 58 second or more. Even accessing the data the performance is sluggish and in no way worth the money spent. Tech support said I had an old driver. I installed the new driver with no change.

It arrived without hard drives -- empty enclosures. After 3 weeks of emails, Klegg agreed to send me the real thing and a UPS label to send the empty ones back. That was a month ago.

Sometimes I get toast, sometimes bread that has just been heated a little and sometimes toast that is too dark and very hard. Even if I try to change the time, I press the start button and the timing switches to some off the wall number.

It is a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"the oven lost it's heat","review":"I bought this oven about a month ago to replace my old one which caught on fire. It worked pretty well for toasting things but then I tried to cook chicken in it. After 45 minutes the chicken was still raw. That's when I put a thermometer in the oven to test the temperature of the oven. It was about 100 degrees less than what it was supposed to be. Yesterday I tested the oven again without food. It got hot really quickly but as time progressed, the oven started losing heat. I watched the thermometer as the oven heat dropped and kept dropping.I returned it and bought a Delonghi instead. I hope that one works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"great oven... if it would ever work","review":"Ended up going to a different product after 3 tries with this oven. The first oven did not work in bake mode (the bottom element would not come on) , the second arrived completely DOA, and the third again did not work in bake mode.

If you already have one dont use it, if you dont, dont ever buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does pretty well so far","review":"I've only used this toaster oven a few times and I'm satisfied with it's baking abilities. It seems to warm evenly, toast doesn't burn, and the broiler works well. Maybe a little too well the first time for me. I'm still learning broiling times. I'll update in a month or so. I live in a small apartment and the oven doesn't take up much room. I expect to see my gas bill drop as I only cook for myself.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet, somewhat obsure pop","review":"Except for a few hits that made it very big, most of these songs are quite obsure, unless one was a devotee of The Association. I was recording some old LP's a few months age, and stumbled upon 'The Greatest Hits' of this group. I found myself playing that file quite often. The majority of these songs are quite excellent, and have a surpurb sound quality. This CD is out of print, but other volumes are available.

I was pleasantly surprised by this tea - it has a great taste and you can control the intensity of the flavor by using more or less water. I use one packet in a 24oz bottle of water and it is perfect. The directions suggest 16oz of water. I especially LOVE the convenience of the on-the-go packets. I drop a few in my purse and have a box in the office and can enjoy great iced tea anywhere. Best of all, I find that I'm drinking significantly more water each day and have given up my awful soda habit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice product","review":"took off a star b/c you don't taste the mandarin at all. Its all mango. Didn't like it 1st time I tried it but flavor grows on you. Makes drinking water easier & get green tea benefits.

It sounded delicious! My disappointment was huge: I've never had a powdered drink as foul as this. There was an overwhelming taste of butane or some acrid fuel tasting chemical once the powder was mixed. I tried it several times over a span of six weeks to be sure that my taste buds weren't just off for a day. Maybe in 2006 when the earliest reviews were posted, it was good, but the formula must have changed. It's not my first disappointment from Lipton, but it will be the last time I purchase a Lipton tea product. I'm so glad I avoided buying the case quantity.

It tastes like anti-freeze and leaves a nasty after taste. I tried giving it away to family. They brought it back. Complained that I was trying to kill them. I brought it to my local food pantry while volunteering with a couple cases of cold water. A roomful of hungry, down on their luck individuals would mix some up, take a sip and throw it away. Seriously this stuff is so bad you can't give it away. Buy it at your own peril. The raspberry diet tea is much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck. . . just yuck","review":"I honestly do not like it. I tried to drink it several times hoping to acclimate myself to the taste, all to no avail. So, I brought the packets to the office and put them on the \\"free-for-all\\" counter in the breakroom so my co-workers could have it. They didn't have a fancy for it either. As a matter-of-fact, somebody shoved it way to the back of the cabinet and put a bunch of other stuff in front of it so we didn't even have to see it. It's horrible, I tell you. I finally just threw them all away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"I bought this book and its totally useless for men. It only refers to women, married or widoved ones, possibly with kids. What are we guys supposed to do??? Why limit the book to women only? I felt like everybody ignores men's solitude problems. If you write such a book, then you ahould state it clearly in the title or subtitle that it wont help guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I was hoping to find new ideas for meeting friends, but that was not the case. This book is filled with stories of women being mean to each other. It did say to try church, school, & senior homes. I was really hoping for an answer to this middle aged problem. Not sure why so many women are fake. There is a website called [...] that is kind like on line dating except for your making potential women friends. All in all, I had to force myself to finish the book and it did not have a happy ending. My husband read it too. He only got half way through it, when he decided he'd had enough. He told me women are mean to each other, aren't they. I said yes, but fortunetly not all women are that way. Do not buy this book it is a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another airhead towards males","review":"What does this \\"expert\\" know about males? And to say men don't need friends shows she either has extreme tunnel vision or is out of her head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baseless claim....","review":"...namely, that men don't need friends, but women do. Along with the author's occasional jabs at the male gender, this blithe assumption mars a potentially interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read but geared more toward women with children","review":"I read this book thinking that it would help ANY woman find more friends. Well, while it has some good tips that can be put into practice by any woman, it is largely geared toward women with children. That wasn't the help I needed as I do not have children. If you do have kids and live in a larger city, this book would be a lifesaver. Very well-written and easy to read... I got through it in about 3 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but superficial","review":"This book was full of stories of women who struggled with common friendship troubles and hints about how to help yourself if you are in a position in which you don't have enough friends due to a life change. However, if you are reading it because you don't have very many friends and hope to learn ways to change that, a few hints aren't really going to be too terribly helpful. If you recently became a stay at home mom and hadn't thought of trying to meet your neighbors, this book will be useful to you. If you don't have friends because you are shy, don't know how to be friends with women, or one of the other multitudes of reasons why you might not have enough friends, this book won't help much, but you will be armed with new reasons why it is bad to not have friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"For married mommies only","review":"If you are a single woman without children, this is not the book for you. I was extremely disappointed in this book, especially given all the five star ratings. It took me less then ten minutes to read any portion relevant to my own life, as it was almost exclusively about maintaining friendships when you are married and especially if you have children. Furthermore, I completely reject the idea that a woman without children must make all the sacrifices to maintain a friendship with a woman who has children which is the premise of this book. Friendship is a balancing act and the sacrifices should not be placed on the shoulders of one person.And while other reviews have stated this book says men do not need friends, I did not see that. However, this book is exclusively about female friendships with other females and does not include men in the equation at all. After all, women can be friends with men."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I really wanted to like this book as I felt the subject matter was so timely for what I've been going through, as a single, childless, woman in her late 30's. However, like many other reviewers said, it mostly fell short for me. I've tried, multiple times, many of the things the author suggests. Much of the book was written for women with children, however, I did read the entire book despite this fact. I consider myself shy and there's even a chapter about that - but I gleaned nothing from this chapter that I haven't already tried without much avail. I do think the author means well and although I really \\"liked\\" her, from what I could glean as she wrote about herself, I didn't find this book to be as helpful as I'd hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and practical","review":"I opened this book when I was browsing in the bookstore and I have to say I couldn't put it down. I loved this book. First of all, I was deeply appreciative of Marla Paul's openness and honesty. She says, \\"How could I have gotten to 44 and not have enough friends?\\" This was breathtaking candor in a world where we all want to look very popular. Secondly, she is both very compassionate and very practical about an issue that requires some good tactics for change, not just attention to our feelings. And thirdly, as I read this book, she encouraged me to do some self-reflection. I asked myself, \\"How am I as a friend? Why do I feel lonely at times?\\" Finally, she puts this in context. The world that we live in is just not that conducive to making new friends, especially during mid-life. Let's not take it personally, but let's get out there and find some like-minded souls to share life with. Overall, I found this book to be very helpful, very worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Caine Mutiny [Blu-ray]","review":"The Caine Mutiny is a great movie.

Humphrey Bogart, one of my favourite actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a bargain basement copy","review":"Wile it wsn't mentioned in the listing for this tape, the actual product was recorde at LP. This process was commonly used back in the day to save tape making the product more profitable to the distributor as it took only 1/2 the amount of tape to market the feature. I probably would not use this vendor again, tho' I'm not positive this was a bait & switch circumstance.At any rate the copy flips constantly on my upgrade VCR, making it unwatchable.Will return to Amazon and purchase a DVD.Dlivery, packaging etc were all fine but this is a misrepresentation of what was expected when purchased"},{"rating":"2","title":"Storm Warning","review":"Near the top of the under-rated American movie actors list is Van Johnson, in my opinion, and this is his greatest performance. He is pretty near perfect as the conscientous naval officer trying to do what's right under nearly impossible circumstances during WW2, and he has plenty of competition from a great cast. Almost as good is Fred MacMurray in an equally difficult role as an officer who can't make the cut morally. This story of a warship whose commander, Humphrey Bogart, suffers a nervous breakdown while at sea does a great job of putting the dilema of the men on board in the viewer's lap and inviting you to speculate on what you would do in the same situation. There's a trite romantic subplot carried over from Herman Wouk's enormous novel that easily could have been edited out but other than that this great adventure doesn't miss a beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"since when did h. bogart write the caine mutiny?","review":"one of the first modern books to give us an anti-hero.

Well made and well worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humphrey Bogart is never better","review":"This film is of course based on the book of the same name. I read this book as a young man and subsequently saw the movie. The portrayal of the captain by Humphrey Bogart is an incredible piece of acting. All the paranoia and quirks of the character are captured in his performance. The rest of the cast including Fred MacMurray is excellent as well. This is a movie I had owned on DVD and made the decision to take advantage of a good price on Amazon and upgrade to Blu-ray. I see a noticeable difference in quality but the DVD was not bad either. If you own the DVD you're good unless you find it on sale at Amazon, and then it's worth gifting your DVD to a family member and upgrading your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Speed Ahead!","review":"While the movie is a great piece of acting with a couple of exceptions, the movie does not hold a candle to the superb book of the same name.Some actors are poor character choices. Francis is not the right man to play the baby-faced, heavy set, Willie Keith. The actress, May Winn who uses the same name as her character appears to be a whimpy, love-struck night club singer, not at all like her level-headed counterpart in the book. Van Johnson comes through even if he is not the crew-cut, barrel-chested Maryk portrayed in the book. Bogart and McMurray are superb choices for their roles, as are Jose Ferrer, E.G Marshall, and the one who plays Captain DeVries.The movie is entertaining and worth the purchase, but my suggestion is to see the movie first, and read the book second. That way, the movie will not disappoint.While I found the book far superior, I recommend you proceed full speed ahead with the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOGIE CLASSIC","review":"Great classic movie.

This is one of those movies that you have to watch all the way through, its just to captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bogarts Best","review":"The Caine Mutiny is probably Humphrey Bogarts best movie. His acting, the story line and the production are beyond compare.The stresses that men go through in a combat situation are spelled out in this epic motion picture. The lack of comraderie bythe subordinates of the Captain and well as his inability to relate to others lead to the downfall of an entire crew in war timesituation. Outstanding in every respect, this movie can be enjoyed by all ages above 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect combination of actors and story.","review":"The perfect casting of all the right stars (from a young Lee Marvin in a minor role up to Bogie at his best), combined with a accurate depication of live aboard a \\"tin can\\", makes for a truly classic film. The final court room scene with Jose Ferrer as the defending attorney is as good as courtroom drama as you can see. A must for any Bogart fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I kid you not-This is good!","review":"Humphrey Bogart ia in one of his classic roles and those Fred MacMurray fans used to him as a doting father(My Three Sons) or a slightly addled good guy (Disney movies, notably The Absent Minded Professor) are in for a surprise as he hangs his colleagues out to dry. The typhoon sequence makes the film as well as a compelling case for Queeg's insanity. While Bogey's performance isn't up to Casablanca standards(and mothing is) he is certainly compelling. It's an enjoyable watch and can still pack a wallop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original version from the early 1980s","review":"This song hasn't been officially available since it was on a compilation of 1980s songs many years ago.

I highly recommend this product.If your hair is really dry like mine was, my stylist recommended that I leave it in for 30 minutes twice a week at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Sedaka, a great performer after all these years!","review":"After seeing this outstanding DVD, I anxiously await his return to the Phoenix area. This DVD reinforced my continued belief that he is one of the marvelous singer-song writers of the past six decades. His popularity dwindled in the USA after the Beatles came to light. In Europe he continued and still is a sought after performer. His influence on other artists is brought forth in this performance. His inclusion of other family members by name, through story or performance shows how he shares credit for his success. A wonderful, moving concert! Money well spent for personal entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for all Neil Sedaka fans!","review":"First, the correct title for this performance is \\"The Show Goes On - Live at the Royal Albert Hall.\\" This is a stellar collection of 28 songs, including all the Sedaka favorites. The venue is equal to the quality of the performance, London's Royal Albert Hall. His solo performance is enhanced by a duet with his daughter, Dara, as well as one with Tony Christie. Buy and cherish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Neil Sedaka songs","review":"I thought this dvd would be better. There were too many songs I did not care for.

He makes fantastic claims, such as having thrown 150 no-hitters and apparently striking out 22+ batters more times than he can count during the lengthy time that he played our national past-time. In his stories he always comes out on top, is always the hero and savior of any team on which he plays (and the man played with Josh Gibson), and shows a near zero level of humility. He claims to have been always loved and thought of as the hero by his teammates, which comes off as false considering he would jump ship from team to team regardless of contracts or agreements whenever offered a handful of cash. Certainly a colorful character, Paige was an important player at a tragic time, but his storytelling comes of as self important chest beating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up!","review":"In many examples of actual consultations, Noel Tyl demonstrates the techniques he uses to relate the horoscope to the life being lived by the client. He shares how he translates astrological measurements into psychological insight, the preparation for the consultation, the observations of the client and how he creatively directs all of this into a powerful session that quickly gets to the point. I highly recommend \\"The Creative Astrologer\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for training, just general rabbit information","review":"I got this book from the library before I went out and bought it, and I am happy I did. Our bunny hates being picked up, hates being held, and fears coming near us sometimes (we are his third family). And the book assumes your bunny is tame and loves being held, which most bunnies don't.For example, the training directions for a bunny trance does not start with how to get your bunny into your arms and allow you to turn it over, it starts with the bunny already in your lap, upside down. Hey Patricia Bartlett, if I could get my bunny to stay in my lap, let alone have him stay upside-down in my lap, I would not need your book!If you have a tame, socialized bunny, you can prob train him on your own, and if your bunny needs taming training, this book will not provide it. I liked this book for the general bunny information, but for training purposes, it didn't help us."},{"rating":"2","title":"condition is good","review":"good book, very helpful for the children to know how to take care of the rabbit and know more about rabbits"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie","review":"If your interested in ww2 than this movies the one for you.

Mitchum is good, but that's about it. It's fake and inaccurate, not to mention boring. Even when there is action, it so fake you won't care. I don't even know why it's called Anzio. It focuses on 7 GIs who survive an enemy ambush and try to get back to their lines. Bad script doesn't help. Inaccuracies include helipads on WW2-era ships and Americans with British WW1 rifles. You'll find that looking at the bottom of your popcorn bowl is more entertaining than the movie. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically Inaccurate but Entertaining","review":"The Allied landing at Anzio was not unopposed. Allied forces were bogged down in trench fighting for almost three weeks before they could move inland against the Germans. In this film facts get turned around but the basic story is intriguing. A rather stoic Robert Mitchum plays a pacifist battle-hardened war correspondent who must come to grips with his own convictions. Under Edward Dmytryk's direction Mitchum's character seems to have more military smarts than the professionals do, thus making his character a bit of a conundrum. That's what makes this film so interesting. Peter Falk, Earl Holliman and Reni Santoni are good as the stereotypical GIs that Mitchum goes out on patrol and has to fight his way back with. Riz Ortolani created a good suspenseful score and there are some really good action sequences. The good cast, which is a great asset, includes Robert Ryan, Arthur Kennedy, Patrick Magee and Mark Damon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should have been Scout Troop","review":"This movie is a disgrace to those that fought and those that died at Anzio.

Jack Jones sings \\"This World Is Yours\\" over the opening credits--the lyrics are said to be by the great Doc Pomus, who penned may of those old Elvis greats, but it's repetitive and draws on the title line too much. The slightly-off-color parody of the folk classic \\"Wings Of an Angel\\" that Peter Falk sings while swinging from a chandelier are almost as good. And the film goes downhill from there, drawing from many of the cliches in the TV series \\"Combat\\" of that same era. A B film if ever there was one--it's unbelievable that Dino DeLaurentis directed this. But Peter Falk's \\"Columbo\\" was a few years away, and Robert Mitchum was in a huge gulf between his bravura performance in \\"Heaven Knows Mr. Allison\\" and his role in \\"Winds Of War\\"/ \\"War and Remembrance\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Some great scenery, and a solid cast can't save this clunker of a script.

This is the age of the massive orgazization.You'd be better off reading \\"Corporate Cults: The Insidious Lure of the All-Consuming Organization\\" (by Dave Arnott) to get a clear understanding of the way environments are shaped socially and informationally.This is closer to the real world that we must operate within.You'd also have a clearer insight into power if you read the book \\"Toxic Sludge is Good For You\\".

Thank you for being so quick to deliver and honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but Repetitive","review":"Although an interesting and well-written book, the most obvious criticism of the 48 Laws of Power is not that certain principles contradict each other, but that they duplicate each other. Think about it; 48 Laws. That's a nice even number isn't it? Without being as obviously manufactured as 'The 50 Laws of Power' it certainly has a nicer ring to it than say 'the 37 Laws of Power' would. In fact I see no problem in certain Laws contradicting others, much like the highway speed limit is occasionally contradicted by the reality of rush hour traffic. But there is obvious repetition in Laws like \\"Always Say less than necessary\\" and \\"Win thorugh actions, never through argument\\". There are other even bettter examples, but unfortunately I do not have the book here with me at present to refer to... I think other readers will agree though."},{"rating":"1","title":"a literary abomination","review":"As I began to read this book I thought it had to be a cynically bad joke. This book epitomizes the exploitative mentality of Adolf Hitler and other megalomaniacs. It reads like the handbook of a slave owner, both ugly and self serving. This man is truly deluded and indoctrinated by the last 5000 years of competitive class society and the consciousness of individualism produced by it. He has no understanding or awareness of collectivity and/or collaboration as it exists outside of class competition and the exploitative private property relations found in modern capitalism. This book is a cultural disappointment and a sad reflection of just how far we have to go as a society to actually produce a decent world to live in. The book is abysmal and depressing, and buying it is the equivalent of supporting fascism, its theories and practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ego-feeding\\" - Looks good on the outside...","review":"I must agree with the previous comments. Despite the very delicate cover and layout the book lacks substance.The worst thing about this book is that it makes me sick after a while. I can hear the little voice inside me saying, that I don't want to be a part of the world it projects.1) I don't think that people get happy by persuing power for it's own sake.2) You CAN achieve your goals without hurting or taking advantage of others.Eventually, these \\"laws\\" will make you a very sad and lonely person.

There are many areas where the text is not correct and there are missing characters.

I give it a 5 for the reason that it is a good study on how some of the most evil and manipulative people on earth came to power and how they used it in destructive ways. I read almost all of his books and found them informative for the purpose of defending against these types people that wish to come to power in these types of ways. My impression is that Greene wrote this book and others mainly for the people that wish to have power for all the wrong reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Reading","review":"Well organized, peppered with small stories that can be read on the go.

This book will not help readers gain power through leadership, trust-building, and credibility, which is what I thought it would be.To its credit, it provides an interesting study in human behavior.

The power that it will give you, HOWEVER, ends in DESTRUCTION.There is a far superior sort of power, which you can gain by becoming a child of God. You accomplish this by accepting JESUS CHRIST into your heart as your savior, and therefore becoming a joint heir with Him. This is the ONLY way to avoid HELL.The 48 Laws of Power is a SATANIC book.

However, the Kindle translation has enough grammatical errors to make me regret paying $14 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I liked this book as much as I liked Greene's \\"Art of Seduction\\". The author walks the same path of analyzing historical events and people delving deeply into their psychological nature and provides examples taken from life in order to make a point.This is a great book even if the reader is not interested in gaining power over others. It is a very interesting and fascinating read, and as always with Greene's books I couldn't put it down. The author is clearly very well read and knows what he is talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories","review":"From the Author of:One Day She'll Darken: The Mysterious Beginnings of Fauna HodelThis book has many great historical oddities that relate to everyday life. Who did what, when and more importantly, why. It's a book of wisdom, but I must say, I really hated the red ink on some of the stories - that part (on every page) made it tedious reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pompous writer, but interesting book","review":"I find the subject matter that Mr. Greene writes about to be interesting, but I found it also to be more \\"highbrow\\" than necessary at times. His strategies are solid (they're basic manipulation techniques), but I think more modern references outside of the European courts of the 17th and 18th century might make the book a bit more digestable for most. However, I must give the author credit for not dumbing down the subject matter so much that ANYONE could understand it.Needless to say though, with a little bit of interest in history this book is an easy read. Wouldn't use it as a guide for living, but at least you can spot these strategies in others when they arise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book.","review":"This book teaches you deceptive tactics on how to gain power. It has good historical examples for each law. I found them very interesting. The history helps you undersatnd the laws better and it is short. The book can be hard to undersatnd however. The laws are contradicting. This is not a \\"how to book\\". Different laws apply to different situations. Overall this book is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devious, cunning and simply brilliant","review":"'The 48 Laws of Power' tells you what you need to know to stay ahead in the race for power and dominance, and it does so in a crisp, no-nonsense manner. Each of the 48 laws is explained in detail, with examples gleaned from sources as diverse as the Bible to 'The Prince' by Niccolo Machiavelli. However, I have one issue against the authors which is they have not referred much to Chanakya (Kautilya), the ancient Indian sage and master strategist, who is also the author of 'Arthashastra', though there are passing references to him. However, all in all, a very good book, enthralling reading and simply devious in its suggestions. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want everyone to hate you....read this book!","review":"If you don't care about anything else in the world but money and getting to the top then read this book. If you don't need friends, co-workers, your family or any of your pets to like you, then this is the book for you.I bought this book under the pretense that this book was a self-help \\"how to empower yourself\\" type of book. Ya know like a Dyanetics type of book. Boy was I wrong. This book is a one way ticket to \\"I'm an Azzholeville.\\" The book gives more tips on how to get to the top by stepping on people then the Dallas Cowboys cheerleader pyramid.Why would anyone want to live their life being so manipulative? Its like a full time job of back stabbing. Eventually people will become hip to your game and isolate you. So if you read this book and take the advice, I hope you like eating tv dinners alone on holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Use Friends and Step All Over Them...","review":"Firstly, I am appalled at the number of reviewers -myself included- who have given this book 5 stars. Appalled because of the dearth of simple ethical behavior.

Here's why. The book gives examples of how certain con artists and swindlers act, and the book seems to suggest we follow their ways if we want to have power. And though they quote from respected books like Sun Tzu's The Art of War, they foul it up by taking certain passages out of context, not to mention fouling it up by having contradictory \\"laws.\\" In summary, the \\"laws\\" support selfishness, trickery, and dishonesty. If one thinks that's power or that's reality, that person is sadly mistaken. Even Sun Tzu teaches humaneness and to avoid war or conflict if possilble, at the same time teaches strategy and thus winning. This book provides neither wisdom nor insight into winning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative.","review":"I found this book to be extremely entertaining, as well it offered little hints on how to operate more effectively in the concrete jungle of modern society. Some might view this book as some sort of evil manual on how to manipulate or control people, and they are right to a certain extent if that is how you choose to view this book. On the other hand you can look at it as a book that can help you prepare for the inevitable challenges which you are going to be faced with, that is how I choose to view it. In my opinion this book is like chemistry. Knowledge of chemistry can be used to make bombs and other horrible things or it can be used to help create many wonderful things which are too numerous to list here. In the end it really depends what you do with this knowledge. To sum it up I enjoyed this book and thought it was worth my time to purchase and read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time/Money/Energy","review":"Bottom Line: There are 48 laws, and like many of the other reviews have stated, many of them contradict each other.

The 48 Laws, however, provide much more than a boon to the closet sadist; to echo Greene, \\"the better you are at dealing with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you become. By following the route of the perfect courtier you learn to make others feel better about themselves, becoming a source of pleasure to them.\\" Among the 48 Laws, some are likely to be more pertinent than others, albeit you will be hard-pressed to relegate all (any?) of them to the heap of historical artifact. In short, this book is well-written, uniquely presented, and pleasantly insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product of a clever con who appeals to the worst in his marks","review":"Greene is a conman, you dopes! You're being set up to buy this watered down Machiavellian compost, using the 50% of his \\"laws\\" that don't contradict the other 50%.He gets you to believe that your selfishness and aspirations to megalomania you possess are justified, desirable, and trustworthy. You're all going to die, sorry.

I subtracted a star because the book omits the few ways of gaining power that not only does not involve manipulating, deceiving, and lying, but also helps others.Anyway, anyone who wants to do anything that involves interdependence on others (about 99% of people) should read this book...if only to create a defense against those that follow the Dark path to power."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be a sycophant","review":"This doesn't teach anything about real power. At best it teaches one how to become the dog of the powerful, by being a smarmy sycophant.

That being said, there are a few concepts that are nonetheless worthwhile, such as: \\"Master the Art of Timing\\", \\"Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor\\" and \\"Crush your Enemy Totally\\". The rest is just useless filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Better Than This!","review":"Most people perfunctorily use the 48 laws in their everyday lives whether they realize it or not. We're hard-wired to follow suit, seek groups of like, and cater to the fantasies or others vs. what it visceral and intrinsic to us. These silly politics keep us from forming real, meaningful, honest relationships with others, and more importantly, with ourselves.It's difficult, but ascending above the politics that are ostensibly ubiquitous to human-nature could prove a far superior and more worthy venture. I recommend 'The Four Agreements' by Don Miguel Ruiz to anyone looking to be freed and ascend beyond the pro forma/ conformism of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can you do for you?","review":"In short, this is a sort of self-help manual for the self-advancer. In summary, some actions are presented to gain the individual power while others are seen to decrease it. As a result, megalomaniacs unite! Get the power you desire to get what you want the way you want to get it.Sure, this approach might not do much for your relationships - but if you're a person who prefers desert island victories and cave domination to social functions then this approach may work well.The only real flaw I see in the book is that the oppressor must live with those who are oppressed. Well, I guess that assumes they're allowed to live.The authors write, \\"Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit,\\" - Some might call that stealing. It's also referred to as plagiarism. In taking their advice, I was thinking about gaining the power of writing this book myself.

The second rule of Power is -- you don't talk about Power. The third rule of Power is -- aways remember the First Law: Never Outshine the Master. Fourth rule is -- there ARE ways to get others to do all the work for you AND take all the credit (one of the Laws) while still giving the one who performed the work her/his kudos. It helps Protect Your Reputation (another important Law). Fifth rule -- don't forget that The Laws of Power are \\"amoral,\\" neither moral nor immoral. Sixth rule -- don't forget that although the Laws are amoral, HOW you execute the Laws is not. Seventh rule -- put the book down when you start to feel sick about the corporate world.

Do read it folks just to know how low life manipulative people ultimately attain power, thought the stupidity of leaders with no insticts nor wisdom and vision.

They are about what exists out in the real world, and always has.I felt sad to know and recognize that power is obtained and maintained by means which do not appeal to our noblest instincts, but that does not change anything about power and its laws. The author has brought out a wonderful exposition of what people in positions of power do to enhance it and hold on to what they have.Regardless of what your perceptions of power vs. ethics are, you must read this book because (a) These power games will be played all over you, so you better recognize them (b) Play them as necessary to ensure your survival (you won't be able to win on the strength of your ethics and principles alone.) and (c) It is a damn good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I got a sense from this book that everyone has to compete with everyone.

Their ideologies are very similar to what was described here.I do not posses very good writing skills, but I decided to warn people. Can you imagine dealing with someone who follows it? This book creates a miserable calculating-monster. What ever is described here is NOT equal to success and power. A good example of POWER is who is truthful, compassionate, and tolerant.

If you are running for President of the United States these rules may be somewhat applicable.

Historical examples which prove the laws of power make the book both compelling and effective as demonstrations of everyday use of the authors techniques. Unlike several self help books which provide examples in abstract, the author makes it easy to not only understand and demonstrate the laws of power, but by pointing out historical examples both in the main text and the margins, gives the reader a true understanding of how to apply them in daily life.

I was terribly unimpressed with it. Greene is a hack writer who fancies himself as coming up with profundities. Half of what he writes is painfully obvious (\\"If you want to seduce a woman, try becoming rich and famous!\\") and the other half is self-contradictory (\\"Never depend on others\\" and \\"Isolation is dangerous.\\")He acts like he came up with these 48 laws from first principle and then scoured history for examples that prove him right, but all he really did was read a bunch of anecdotes of people who happened to get lucky and then come up with a summary title that makes it seem like what happened was systemic. Sure, if 100 people act suddenly and bold in their quest to overthrow the emperor, one of them will be successful and Greene will write a \\"Be sudden and bold\\" law about him, but what he doesn't write about are the other 99 that had their heads cut off."},{"rating":"1","title":"What comes around goes around...this is setting you up for some serious trouble","review":"This is the antithesis of what most successful leaders recommend.

Hide your intentions, spy on others and do anything to promote yourself and weaken everyone else are all messages at the center of problems we have today and not solutions. The notion that you can apply these 48 laws and become powerful is a farce. What I have witnessed is that people applying manipulative principles like this end up lonely and sad people. I have always thought that you influence people through your actions, honesty, and openness and I still believe this.

It should be on the bookshelf of anyone who aspires to any level of success in any organization or profession. It should not gather dust but should be read regularly, according to a plan - one law a day, for example, absorbed slowly and contemplated deeply. Author Robert Greene draws on a rich variety of sources including books so threatening that they were banned by the ancient Chinese. He cites the memoirs of Machiavelli, various con men and many others who swept aside what ought to be in order to focus on what is. It might seem that anyone who follows all of these laws in their rich, narrative detail will turn out to be a very unpleasant person. That's probably not true. We suspect, in contrast, that the person who masters the laws of power will be extremely pleasant, with winning ways and a knack for likeability, yet awe-inspiring and in control - though not always obviously so.

The information within this book may sting and be a bit harsh for some people to digest, but it is highly informative. Robert Greene has most certainly done his research. I read some other reviews where they claim the historical information is not accurate. I have not encountered such errors, yet have not done a thorough cross reference either. Thus far, I see the historical events to be quite accurate, although they have been geared or modified to suit the lesson.

The 48 laws of power is used to ATTAIN and DEFEND(against)power, although at its base it settles the conflict that has plagued much of the western culture ideology: morality and power. For those many who assume and truely argue that power can only be attained through moralistic ventures and actions are either telling a lie or have never had power because in the end many leaders (certainly not those glorified in the media)have used this laws to some extent or the other.

However, this is not a book for an advanced homebrewer and although still nice to have some of these things in hand and a wealth of knowledge, many of the projects in here are either too low level or something that you have already done and improved upon or surpassed. This would make a great gift to anyone just starting out or if they homebrew and live under a rock in a cave without internet. Most everything in here is available on the internet in several different forums and websites, but sometime you just can't beat having a book in hand. I purchased it and I am happy with it even though I would term myself an advanced brewer.

It does highlight parts of the process and why you need certain items but in a very practical manner. There are three or four projects in there that I am definitely going to do over the course of the next year. And there is one that I might do if I get really serious about yeast cultivation. One thing that could make the book better is to come out with an updated edition.

That is not a bad smell, but I don't want my house smelling like my flowerbeds. One of my cats refused to use the litter at all. After the cats use the box the odor changes to urine soaked cypress mulch. It is just awful. There is no odor control at all. I scoop 2 litter boxes twice a day for 3 cats and the smell was so bad from the litter box I had to hold a cloth over my mouth and nose. Needless to say I still have most of the bag left.

The plot was ill paced, and by a quarter of the way through the book, when her weak and whiny characters were still being introduced, I was more than ready to set this book down.

It is not a great puzzler but it is a pleasure. Lady Angkatell is one of the best eccentrics that Christie ever created and she criss-crosses the story in her zany manner, keeping the mystery light. This novel belongs in the mid-range of Christie mysteries as it lacks truly bizarre red herrings or an ending so impossible it almost charms. This is a straight forward story but the author still has fun putting her touchingly stock characters through their appropriate paces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough innovation","review":"I purchased a couple of the videos in this series, including this one. I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed in all of them. There wasn't much \\"new\\" here to keep me interested, and I found I was pretty bored. Each of the 30-minute workouts themselves are pretty intense, and definitely get your muscles burning, but the instructors do not break down any of the moves before they do them, and I found it difficult to figure out what they were going to do next. With practice, I guess this might get better. And the three 5-minute \\"mini-workouts\\" for abs, legs, and arms were good, but not long enough to really feel much of anything. As soon as I started to get into them, they were over! Again, I guess it might help to do these every day or something. However, I can't seem to get myself to do these DVDs - there's just not enough excitement or innovation here to keep me interested!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"This is an intense and easy-to-follow program led by very professional and friendly instructors. The three 5-minute mini workouts are great, too! Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is my first Shape DVD, and I won't be buying another. The workout seemed old-school, with the usual stomping around and resistance moves. Program 2 is a rehash of Program 1, and you will not be cross-training if you alternate them. Also, I have some arthritis in my hands, and wrapping the resistance band around them & pulling was uncomfortable.I bought this DVD partly because Lisa Wheeler was on it. I'm a big fan, having done her workouts with The Method. I also notice that she's Denise Austin's choreographer for her newer workouts, and I love them. As usual, she (and the other instructors) did a great job of demonstrating & cueing. I just didn't like the workout.Update: The second time I used the band included with this dvd, it snapped apart in 2 pieces in my hands. Fortunately it didn't hit me, but be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing camera angles, bad music, and poor instruction","review":"I prefer doing workout videos to going to the gym, but this one is not really worth the 18 bucks. The incredibly fast pace, confusing camera angles, poor instruction, and bad music combine to give a dissatisfying workout. It moves so quickly with so little explanation that a novice could easily injure themselves. Also, there are 3 express workouts on this video that target either your arms, legs, or abs. I've only done the abs one, but it was totally ridiculous and only 5 minutes long. At one point they have you rolling around on the floor, not a viable option on the tile in my living room...that's why you use a mat: to stay on it! I would say try a Kathy Smith video...she puts together challenging, safe workouts that make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I purchased this DVD after reading numerous reviews stating how challenging it was. However, I would describe this video as old and tired. It looks like it was filmed at least 10 years ago. I'm not sure if this workout was designed for older viewers, but it looks and feels that way. I finished this workout without having broken a sweat -- but all three ladies (40+) looked like they had just come in from a rainstorm. The cardio involves a lot of hopping around -- very hard on your joints -- without being very challenging. The first workout is billed as interval and strength training, but hardly calls for you to pick up a weight. Save your money and look for a good cardio-pilates video -- like one with Ellen Barrett."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADORE the 2nd Cardio Workout!!!","review":"The second workout in this dvd is my absolute favorite shape workout!!! Busts my butt every time! Challenging but doable and effective cardio right here! I also use Cathe Freidrich, The Firm, 30 Day Shred, and various other workout dvds of all types. I have lost 90 lbs and kept it off for 4 years with workout videos. I highly recommend this video for the intermediate/ advanced exercisers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I could only get through about twenty-four minutes of this movie- it was so badly written. The two children/teenagers in the film were incredibly rude and obnoxious. They spoke and behaved nothing like what one would expect of a nineteenth century child, even a rude one. Shooting Winslow Homer with a slingshot, insulting and making fun of him, barging into his home without permission and in his presence- I guess it was supposed to be funny but it was just annoying and absurd. I couldn't keep watching. There was very little of the artist working on his art from what I saw, other than a moment or two of him sketching before he was harassed by the boy with the slingshot. On the bright side the sets were great and the scenery looked much like his paintings. It's just too bad the characters were straight out of a bad contemporary sitcom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man...these guys are awesome!!!","review":"Until about six months ago I had never even heard of these guys. Now I have all of the material that they have out and I want more! If you like these guys try Hermano and Kyuss, they both rock. Sasquatch is straight forward grungy heavy rock. I can't believe I haven't heard of them all of this time. Oh, wait...yeah I can, I live in Oklahoma. Hell would just freeze completly over before they play this music on the radio in this state! You like to ROCK!!!? Then give these guys a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band,...love 'em","review":"I really like this band. They have that heavy down-tuned guitar sound, along with excellent sound production quality. The album moves along at a nice pace. Nothing too slow, nor too fast. I get a good sense of energy from this band, in which a lot of newer bands do NOT give me. Sasquatch has a great vocalist. This guy can really sing. He has a good rasp to his voice, but not overdone. He also sports a nice set of lungs. I hate categorizing bands, but this band can fall under grunge with a hint of doom. Sort of an up-beat doom album with powerful, no-nonsense vocals. The band is REALLY tight, and is a band for the more serious music fan, who doesn't need a gimmick to lure them in. This band is NOT gimmicky, nor do they need to be. They are a straight forward, in your face, hard rockin' band. Fans of Kyuss, Earthride, Goatsnake should enjoy this. Great band, Love 'em. -I also purchased their 2nd album, titled: \\"II\\" - It's Just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album!","review":"This album is just amazing. Even though the entire album is comprised of cover songs, (albeit some of the best Blues covers of all time), NMA is able to transform every cut into a new experience for even seasoned listeners. Yes, they are catering to a \\"Jam Band\\" set but it works. Deep blues, like all music, is in flux and the North Mississippi Allstars are able to keep their Blues roots while adding some \\"jam\\" to the receipe. It works and if you love to listen to progressive, cross-genre music then this album is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip-Shakin' Blues","review":"The sons of legendary producer, Jim Dickinson, form the bookends to this talented trio of young performers.

I don't care who you are and what kind of party you're at, putting this CD in the stereo is sure to get the joint jumping. Sure the production values on it aren't all that great, but this is a band bred for the stage and with bands like that you can only hope to capture an essence of their energy on record and that's definitely what you have here. They'd do well opening up for Ben Harper, Dave Matthews Band, The Rolling Stones, Phish and, hell, even Metallica. An outstanding showing. All tracks are highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this now","review":"This record really is great. No joke. Not only can these guys play, but they really write catchy songs too. They are unique and blend classic rock and funk sensibilities with their bluegrass tunes. Definately worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds forced, then desperate, ultimately boring","review":"Oh, I was hoping for the best here, but they try so hard to come off as energetic it soon begins to sound forced, and then desperate, ultimately boring. Like Jon Spencer without personality. There's very very little alteration of tempo -- the drummer seems like he's playing the same beat every song. And they don't have anything even close to a distinctive or interesting singer. They might make a great back-up band, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blues Album","review":"Okay, so it's all cover songs...but you've probably never heard them to begin with.

Lord, what a great recording - driven, pulsing, alive, groovin', bottomacious blues you can use!There's some Hound Dog Taylor raw urgency, some R.L. Burnside life done me a dirty deal, and every once in a while, some Duane Allman soaring through your brain. Their version of Po Black Maddie is as good as it gets. Lordy hoody!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it either.","review":"I really wanted to give these guys a chance since I have read such glowing articles about them so I picked this one up. I just don't get it. Yes, some of the guitar work shows musical talent, but that's about it. I think the vocals are terrible with absolutely no soul whatsoever. I also agree with the first reviewer that the drummer plays the same thing on almost every song. Yes, I know, the blues by nature builds itself on repetitive musical themes, but a real blues artist puts out so much raw emotion that the repeitive side of the music never gets boring. these guys just don't have that emotion at all. It's all production and no substance and it gets old really fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated, listen to the original masters first","review":"It's not a BAD CD, but nothing particularly fresh - like classic Mississippi Delta blues filtered through the Allman Brothers and with a dash of Phish. It's good stuff but nothing remotely like the \\"savior of the blues\\" some hype it as - once again, a (mostly) white band does what black musicians have been doing for years and gets the credit; go listen to RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough or any of the other Fat Possum records artists for some REAL down and dirty juke joint blues that'll blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"What a waste of time, money and energy. This is some of the most boring blues I have ever heard. Its repetetive, unimaginative, sophomoric. Not one song held my interest to the end. Look for something else. Go back to the roots. Don't waste your time with this derivative drivel"},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing dissapointment","review":"Introduce the Spin Doctors to your favorite blues records and, in your worst nightmare, they'll produce this music. If you're lucky, you'll wake up before you have to listen to this whole album. If you were suckered into bying this album, throw out the case, flip over the cd, and use it as a drink coaster. If this is the future of blues, the genre should be changed to \\"jams\\" or \\"runs\\". That way, when you hear it, you can say you have the runs and people will know what you mean.

Well, anyway, I do. But not this one, at least not so much.Noah Wylie, Jane Curtain and Bob Newhart are back and the dialogue between them is enjoyabe. The utter lameness of the story is only truly revealed in the last half hour and it's not even enjoyable cheesy lameness--it's just dumb.That being said, I hope there is a 3rd and the writing is much sharper.

It is not 'Indiana Jones' or 'National Treasure' - so don't expect it to be. The special and graphic effects are pretty good based on the afformentioned 'Made for TV' aspect and therefore less blockbuster budget. The story moves quickly and keeps one entertained. It is a good movie to share with the pre-teen & teen kids as a happy medium. (Maybe a little scary for some younger viewers.)

Great acting turns by veterans Bob Newhart and Jane Curtain in supporting roles. This movie is a rather unusual and enticing blend of sword and sorcery and academic geekiness. Wyle manages to both become this character and keep a straight face, a noteable achievement. One note on the female love interest, why oh why haven't we seen more of Anwar in recent movies??

I found this product really helful in preparing for my trip to Sicily, and took the rush hour and travel cd's with me on my trip for additional study. While there was some overlap and repetition, the different approaches were helpful in reinforcing vocabulary in specific situations. Berlitz should have provided the written script along with the CD's, but downloading and printing the materials from their website was almost acceptable. I would recommend this for anyone making a trip to Italy, especially going to areas outside major cities where English is not spoken much. Use a text book to seriously learn the language though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Been looking for this movie for a long time.

Pages to the left run into the center fold and must be read by peeling the binding back, the pages on the right are the same and seem to be on newsprint - Don't Buy this Schools & Library version with the idea it is better quality, s/b at twice the price - because the paperback version is actually better, and far easier to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"It's hard to say anything new about the foundation series. I had always heard good things about it, and finally got around to picking it up. I started with this book, Prelude to Foundation, and I think it was a good choice (even though it's not the first written). However, I think it would have been helpful to have read the full Robot series first because it is slightly intertwined, though so far, I don't think it's spoiled my later enjoyment of that series."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ, Great series, terrible book","review":"I am a huge Asimov fan. The Foundation series is an amazing work, and I highly highly recommend it. It is thought provoking and forward thinking, way ahead of it's time.While the series itself is well crafted and refined, this book is not. This seemed like a publisher's attempt to squeeze more money out of the good name the series had built up. As I read, I wondered if the book even hit the desk of an editor to trim the fat. Unnecessary filler caused the plot to move at a glacial pace. The dialog between characters is worse than believable, no human speaks the way the characters in this book do.Please do not be offended by this review! I encourage, nay demand that you read The Foundation Series! Just don't let this be your starting point! Read the rest of the books and use this book as a supplement if you feel it necessary. I don't think you will, the series is nourishing enough without this afterthought of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interestng diversion from the traditional Foundation plot","review":"Here, in what is the first of the Foundation series, Hari Seldon comes to Trantor to discuss his paper on a mysterious theory (Psychohistory) at a conference. The plot quickly thickens when we find out that the Emperor's right-hand man is interested in this theory. Seldon is contacted by the Emperor, and after an unproductive meeting he goes into hiding in the relatively safe University district of Trantor. The book continues, but ends with an explosive and suprising finale"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and astonishing SF at its best.","review":"Asimov keeps topping himself. A exciting story with belivible characters and imaginative and clever points. Wery well tied up with earlier stories as well as later. We get to know Hari Seldon as a real person, not as a distant legend as in the earlier foundation novells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full-bodied, with an entire world as a character.","review":"Asimov's prelude to the Foundation trilogy is a complete and well detailed journey throughout a world of 40 billion, dealing with complex issues and splendidly bizarre cultures in the early years of Hari Seldon's study of Psychohistory. On Trantor, the capital planet of a Galactic Empire with as many planets under its power as there are people on it's surface, a little known mathematician is thrown into galactic intrigue and a run for his life when his research is sought out by those who must not be allowed to obtain it. Literally a page turner, and a requirement for those who love science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent beginning to the Foundation series!","review":"I've read some of Asimov's other books, and admit I was sometimes confused or bored, but this book was a non-stop thrill ride!

THis is too much.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nitwit characters.","review":"Don't waste your time reading this stuff.

I remember the Xanth series, John Carter of Mars books, but this was rediculously dull. If I hate a book half way I'll stop reading it, which I did. It seemed like a story about a scientist running away from agents of a leader who were trying to kill him. He wanders around on a top of a dome for several pages and I told myself, that's it. I'm done. I'm sure Asimov has done well for himself with the other books, but this one seemed like he was just trying to stretch out a story way too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asimov is the master of Science Fiction","review":"Most people who have reviewed this book have read the other Foundation books before this, but the book is ABSOLUTELY awesome when read after reading the Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn, and Robots and Empire..in fact, i think it reading these 4 first makes the book more enjoyable because one knows of the past which Hari Seldon is searching for and there's the reunion with an old friend. But either way, Asimov is such a master that his books are wonderful in any order!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God Revealed","review":"\\"Prelude to Foundation\\" by Isaac AsimovProf. Asimov has a knack for telling a good story. The really interesting part of this is that it is written in 1980 or so, and talks a little about using computers. In some of his older stories, he mentions the 'slide rule guys' figuring stuff out. I suppose that my knowing what a slide rule is dates me some. It is also obvious that he did not write this for serial publication. He can put together a good book with some disparate magazine stories, but this is written differently. It would have been possible to serialize it, but it was not, that I know of.In the end it turns out that robots are God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asimov's greatest","review":"This book was written 25 years after the others in the series, and Asimov's writing skills had obviously matured and improved. He was a master writer in his 20's but he continued to get better. The charactersin this work are more believable, and in this book he incorporated a very interesting surprise at the end. Asimov earned all the tributes reviewershave given him through the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Historical SCUBA Document","review":"Van's book is a wonderful read, documenting the pioneering days of recreational SCUBA, and is replete with great photos.

There are so many charities out there where you can donate the $60 to and that would really be making a difference. It's always a good idea to check out the actual amount from the purchase the company is donating to a cause.They advertise this bag as \\"$20 a year can transform a child's life and provide the tools for a lifetime of self-reliance.\\" so why not just help out THREE kids and send the $60 directly to the organization?

For that, he receives EXTREMELY low marks in source balance.This is a shameful example of subjective prose written by one who is obviously angry at something. It is therefore not useful to anyone making an honest effort to learn anything.Basic Rhetoric 101 teaches one to balance the basis upon which the thesis is built.

Everyone in my class of over twenty people hated this book. Even my teacher did not think it was very good but unfortunately it is a standard text for graduate level statistics. This book needs more examples and to be edited better as there are a good bit of errors. Also, the structure of the book needs to be changed to be more user friendly. The reader should not have to struggle so much to find the information that he is looking for.The subject matter in the book is powerful and useful.

I found it was terse, dated and poorly worded. The explanations of key topics where long winded, meandering and ultimately muddled. The material in each section was rarely of value when confronted with at least half the sections problems. I felt that there should have been more examples that cut to the meat of the problem(such as MLE) showing the mechanics of the solution and giving general strategies to solve real world problems using that technique. I feel that statistics and mathematics is best learned by doing lots of problems and in the case of statistics practicing on real world data. Detailed solutions done by the masters can also go along way to help improve ur analytic skills. I feel this book does not have either feature, covers the modern topic mathematical statistics poorly and should not be used unless the user has severe masochistic tendencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"drier than dirt!","review":"This is one of the worst probability books I've ever used.

The material is poorly organized: the author talks about some method, then abandons it to talk about something else before coming back to it to complete the discussion.A LOT of the examples he uses to illustrate some point he's trying to make are actually end-of-chapter exercises, so if you thought that you might understand his point better by doing an example or two, think again.

In some areas, the explanations are excellent and the book seems to flow well. However, quite often, this book omits crucial steps and, as a result, becomes extremely difficult to follow.

It is their favorite 1 out of the 4 - and it is nice that is places a primary emphasis on the role of the 2 boys with their father. However, mom is not negatively portrayed and gets a fairly equal amount of time in the story. It helps explain to the kids that the divorce is not their fault - but something that is only between the adults. It also helps emphasize that both their parents still love them wherever they go. At times, this story is a little more complicated, but I know the message is getting through. I also highly recommend \\"TWO HOMES\\", which is a little less complicated and is definitely level-handed for both parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable text","review":"This is NOT a book about making \\"The Misfits\\" film.

Essentially, this is a low-grade millennium version of the 1931 Will Rogers satire \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court\\", which itself was based on Mark Twain's novel. Will Roger's original film about a modern man who dreams he is transported to the middle ages was bad, but this is even WORSE! Bad acting, corny story, gross-out humor, ad nauseum. However, the scene with Martin teaching the medieval musicians to play Sly Stone's \\"Dance to the Music\\" is mildly amusing, as his outrageous speech to rally the peasants against the King (a wild mixture of Al Sharpton, Rodney King, and John F. Kennedy), and Marsha Thompson as his love interest is rather easy on the eyes. These latter factors give it 2 stars instead of 1.

A black, young adult, under achiever with potential gets sent back to medieval times to learn a valuable lesson. Some of the bits are funny and Lawrence shows he has some talent, but there was nothing solid enough here that to make us feel that we wanted to watch it again, unless it came on TV with the language edited.It could have even been done to be more family friendly, but it wasn't.

I'll round down to 2 stars for some language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can It Get Any Worse?","review":"Martin Lawrence needs to face the fact that his best work was on his television series. Ever since he left he has made the worst movies in the world. They are stereotypical insults to black people. His characters are always ignorant and this one is no different.This movie has been done tons of times before. Even Whoopi did a television version. This movie was pitiful. I rented the DVD and took it back without finishing it. It was stupid and the acting was limited. Martin was not funny at all ( which was disappointing since he used to be hilarious ). Martin's last four films have been huge bombs and may continue to get worse.Just please, please stay away from this wannabe-spoof of King Arthur. It is mindless and full of Martin's childish antics.

Films like this are becoming more common these days and it makes you wonder \\"What the hell were they thinking!?\\" (I don't actually know the answer to that question...sorry) Martin Lawrence used to be funny, but then he did Blue Streak and it all went downhill from there.

He struck out again with What's The Worst That Could Happen and in 2001 he made Black Knight. Black Knight is full of bad acting, cliched jokes and it's boring.

Futile attempt to be funny. In this film Martin Lawrence was a certifiable ham who failed miserably in trying to evoke even a smile of amusement. It was like watching an awful stand up comic who was bombing all over the place and just kept going on and on. I couldn't believe I even watched such an awful film. He just keeps on shooting his mouth off, unfortunately his portrayal as an obnoxious loud mouth was not funny at all. I was even wondering if he had a script or did he just blabber away whatever came to mind as they shot the film. I was even trying to find some other elements in the film that could give at least some moment of pleasure... sadly it wasn't even mildly entertaining. I can only report what I experienced, annoyance!

I have to admit that the first time I watched it, I didn't find it funny. However, I ended up watching it again with a friend and was mildly surprised the second time around.It certainly isn't Martin Lawrence at his best. Tom Wilkinson as Knolte was disappointing...not for his portrayal but the fact that he chose to be in a movie like this. The best part of the movie for me was Percival, played by Vincent Regan. An almost unknown actor here in North America, this was certainly not the greatest bit of acting he's done. For a sample of what he can really do, check out his performance as Buck in The Messenger: Joan of Arc by Luc Besson.

If I had to watch the movie all over again and count who many times those phrases are repeated I'd throw myself into a horse's behind 1st.

I don't even know how it ended and I do not care. I left during the dinner scene when Martin leads the band in a Sly and The Family Stone cover. The jokes were juvenile, the direction - deplorable, the story - lame, lame, and more lame.

I honestly cannot think of one positive thing to say about \\"Black Knight\\". Martin Lawrence, who can be amusing at times in other films (...), comes off here as obnoxious, crass, and desperate for laughs. The screenplay appears to have been written for the sole purpose of allowing Lawrence the maximum amount of time to act like an idiot.The premise of the story had potential. Young, stupid man from 21st century is transported back to medieval times and must deal with culture shock and different way of life before finding a way to get back home. A familiar premise, yes, but there could have been some funny moments, at least enough to make \\"Black Knight\\" watchable.However, with Lawrence at the helm, this film takes a nosedive into rude, crude, uninspired humor. As usual, Lawrence focuses on racial humor and tired sexual jokes to garner laughs (he got none from me), making \\"Black Knight\\" an unwatchable waste of celluloid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Stupendous, Heart-Wrenching, Moving","review":"I absolutely loved this animated comic.

The storyline, however, literally put me to sleep!

Enjoyable to watch him play a major role, which is light on the dialogue but mostly physical comedy. And he's great at it. Curious if there was any conscious intent by the writer or director to give a nod to Curly from the Stooges.So why the two-star hate?

He has a great voice but doesn't have the energy level to keep my interest. I own many music DVD's and I'm sorry to say this is not one we will watch again anytime soon.

In this DVD he performs at age 29 and age 35. The 1974 live version is really good and you can see the audience loves it. The 1980 version is fantastic. His voice has matured, the musicians in the band are the best, and the music rocks your soul. In my house, this DVD will be played again and again. Cyprus Avenue is one song that will stay with you. He starts out slow and easy but you can feel the tension building until he shouts \\"Railroad\\" and WoW! This is music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the 1980 set","review":"There are two concerts here: the one from 1974 is a bit more loose than the later one. If you've seen Van a few times over the years, you know that some nights there's no one like him; other nights he's more human than divine. You'll have both experiences here, but at the price and quality of the recording, it's worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound quality, DTS surround is superb!","review":"This DVD is a must have for any true fan of Van Morrison. The 1980 show is particularly inspiring, displaying more of a spiritual side of Van, while the 1974 show reveals his fascination with the blues. The great thing about this DVD other than the actual shows is the exceptional sound quality (DTS 5.1 surround sound) and the likewise excellent clean visuals.

When I put it in the oven, the cake pan had bent (due to the heat) and then leaned very heavily to the lower right hand side which made the cake batter in the pan ooze out which eventually burned. I had to use a large espresso cup to prop up the right side and use a large latte mug to hold down the left side. As a result, the cake didn't cook evenly and created a mess. I'm sure there are higher quality, more durable football shaped cake pans out there. I wanted one on the cheap and I now wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Football Pan","review":"I was looking for a pan to make a 3-D football with. I love Wilton's ball pan, so I thought this would be similar, but just a football. It was a little bigger than I thought it would be, but it made a really great football. I had to do a little carving on it to get it just right, but all in all worked great. My only complaint would be I didn't bake very evenly, the sides got done, but it took awhile longer for the center. It worked for what I was needing, so no regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible product","review":"The design of this pan makes it impossible for the cake to bake correctly.

James Album\\"] is good as well. \\"Funny Little Man\\" is danceable and well... funny. My only true disappointment was \\"Come to Daddy, the Mummy Mix.\\" Although it is cool how Richard used voice samples from his mother when creating the piece - it isn't very interesting and I usually skip over it.

Now after listening to the recording I see why; it sucks. It has wierd noises, and distorted voices.I guess the people who gave this cd five stars beacuse it shows emotion are sort of right. Some music makes me want to cry, some makes me want dance, but this makes me want to throw up. Don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is music?","review":"Man. I'll say this for \\"Come To Daddy\\"--it's like nothing else I've ever heard on a CD. And in this case, that's a bad thing. The best thing I could say about it is that it is interesting. Nothing more. It's a bunch of clicks, thumps, and other bizarre noises all thrown together and put on \\"purée\\".

Aargh.\\"","review":"This EP, although it consists of simply 8 tracks, is one of Richard D. James's greatest albums. The 'Come to Daddy' remixes do not resemble each other whatsoever - and I like every song except tracks 5 and 7. Track five is pretty good, but it bounces around so much and is so hard to follow that by the time four minutes have passed, you've lost interest in it. Track seven is unexplainably crazy... It's not one of my favorites. However, any Aphex Twin fan should purchase this. For ten bucks, you get six of Richard's greatest works ever completed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The guy's finally lost it.","review":"The Come to Daddy EP is proof that Mr. James has finally initiated himself as a member of the lunatic fringe. The title track opens the disc with a chaotic, roaring voice chanting the mantra \\"I want your soul/I will eat your soul,\\" and believe me, things get a lot more disturbing after that. The graceful and delicate melody of \\"Flim\\" is pleasant yet subtly uncomfortable, but any notions of sanity disappear with \\"Funny Little Man,\\" which has to be heard to be believed. The inconsistency of the songs is the EP's only setback, but overall, it contains enough material to easily show the brilliance of the Aphex Twin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dope, beats yo","review":"it's drum n' bass experiments. ...and you can actually listen to it!!!!!!!!! what has the world come to? slightly better than his last album (richard d. james- whose song names like rock-b86ag732hlmnop were arty and annoying.) The opener which is his 'breakthrough hit' is killer. psychotic beats and lyrics which is what you can expect from good old dick james. the rest of the album finds no two songs sounding the same as is the case with many techno bands these days. pay close attention during \\"funny little man\\" for James' funny little perversity. faves are flim, come to daddy, and buchephallus bouncing balling which samples a bouncing ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three words: Where's the score?","review":"I bought this album because I thought perhaps a miracle would happen and there would be some music from the actual M:I2 score on there, but sadly, I was disappointed. I like the Limp Bizkit version of the M:I theme, but it's nowhere near as cool as the renditions of the theme actually used in the film. Other than that, this album is nothing more than a rap-metal collection, which is not a particular favorite genre of mine.We saw this happen in 1996, too -- when M:I1 was released, the first CD we got was a \\"songs from and inspired by\\" disc (except that one was actually pretty good). Later, the original score was released. If you liked the background music in M:I2, do NOT buy this album, simply because there isn't any of it on there. Instead, wait for them to release a score album...which I hope they do!Till then, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Good Songs on the whole cd","review":"I had very high expectations for this cd after hearing the incredibly great theme song by Limp Bizkit. However, once I listened to the rest of the songs, I realized that I had completely wasted my money.

Their are many classic rock bands and songs on this cd like, \\"Have a Cigar,\\" by Pink Floyd. That is a great song and it holds a certain standard. The new songs on the cd (written by current bands) live up to this standard with their level of rock. By this I mean that while it is commonly stated that new bands don't produce even descent music, the songs on the M:I2 soundtrack will tell you otherwise. The lyrics are good, and the tunes are fantastic. Not one song on this cd will you ever get annoyed of or dislike. The awesome standard of classic rock songs have fortunately evolved into the rock songs on this soundtrack. That is why this cd is not only a great soundtrack, but a collection of fantastic songs of the ages. ps- You will love this cd if you like Pink FLoyd, Metallica, or Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take A Look Around (at trendy rock)","review":"This CD contains only a couple tracks I thought were good: They Came In..., Immune by Tinfed, and Carnival by Tori Amos, but other than that... no real standouts.

Buy it and tell us yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Soundtrack, not a Score","review":"I noticed someone in an earlier review gave this CD a very disparaging review simply because it was not the score.That's exactly what it's not.

Don't judge it just because it's not the score."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Soundtrack?","review":"If you are fifteen years old and easily marketed to, this collection of run of the mill rock songs might sound good in your CD player while you're headbanging with your pals.

Only to find that the CD contained anything but the musical themes from the film. To be fair, the fine print does read \\"inspired\\" by the film. Had they released two CDs, one for the marketing boys (the bunch of mostly unrelated tracks they did release), and a second CD of the actual soundtrack, as has occured with many other films, I wouldn't mind, the former being just another example of new millenium merchandising reality. I can only hope the second CD is released sometime soon as the actual soundtrack deserves to be heard in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing music","review":"The very beginning scene had a remake of \\"Iko Iko\\" that was very well done.

I was very disappointed. There are a few good songs, but overall, I was not satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Zombie saves this otherwise Disappointing CD","review":"Well I waited quite sometime for this CD and when I got it, it was hardly impressive. Limp Bizkit's performance was hardly worthy of the Main Theme. The track was only good when they incorporated the Mission Impossible theme into metal, though it only lasted about 15 seconds every minute or so. Metallica's \\"I Disappear\\" was good until the vocals started, which was about 20 seconds into the song, after that it was pretty annoying with constant stop and go's. Rob Zombie's song \\"Scum Of The Earth\\" was in my opinion the best song on the entire CD. It is loud and heavy. The song is definently great to jam out to. The rest of the CD is decent, Apartment 26's \\"Backwards\\" was probably the only other track worthy of listening to. But in the end I give this CD five stars because Rob Zombie's song keeps it in my CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are the good songs in the front and they just get worse?","review":"I expected much more of this soundtrack than I received. I really did. The Limp Bizkit theme, Take A Look Around is the best song on the CD, but it seems the songs just get worse and worse as the CD goes along. It seems like after Rob Zombie, The Scum Of The Earth, the CD takes a nosedive with the Butthole Surfers which absolutely suck. The Foo Fighters song makes a decent attempt to pull the CD back, but it falls short. The back of the CD is all unknown bands, or people that suck. The Hans Zimmer song is some sort of Mexican Village music sounding more like something from The Mask of Zorro, or the Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time. Tape the first two songs on the radio, and stay away from this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rocks!","review":"I heard this CD on May 6 when Tony (one of the Pimps) came over with an advanced copy for us to listen to while we played pool and hung out.

What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abort Mission.","review":"I was leery of buying this soundtrack when I scanned the artists on it. Much heavier than the first Mission impossible soundtrack album, it also has only one track of the soundtrack score. The first movie soundtrack had about four.

Save your money and avoid this soundtrack though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone","review":"This CDs strong point is also its weak point. There is something for everyone; pop to metal. Metallica's I Disapear is a great song, as is Limp Bizkit's Product. Godsmack is alright, but not their best work. Rob Zombie is alright as well, but as with God Smack, it is not his best work.For alternative, Foo Fighters represent the CD's strong point.Second to last, there is the soft stuff, by Tory Amos. This song seems to take forever to play, and if I could remove it, I certainly would.Finally, this CD has a surprisingly high amount of unknown (to me at least) artists. For no reason in particular, they are enjoyable.Buy this CD for the hard rock/metal, or to here a number of good unkown bands. But Rob Zombie is only alright, Foo Fighters are Lack Luster, and Tory Amos is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This disc self-destructs","review":"Sitting through this long grunge-fest is a bit of an impossible mission in itself.

After the first 3 songs the cd goes down hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I should have known from looking at the back of the CD cover that this CD was going to be disappointing. What from M:i-2 \\"inspired\\" some of the songs on this CD is a mystery to me -- The CD starts out with rage and, well, continues to rage until it gets to the last two songs. The only tracks on the CD that are worth listening to, for me, are Limp Bizkit's reworking of the M:i theme into \\"Take A Look Around\\", Tori Amos' \\"Carnival\\", and Hans Zimmer's (a teaser for his Score CD) \\"Nyah.\\" Other than that, the CD seems to have no real connection to the film. A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Metallica!","review":"I'm a Metallica fan so I was very excited about this CD. The first thing I thought was that Limp Bizkit and Rob Zombie did a pretty good job in this CD. I didn't know if Limp Bizkit could do a good job in this because they were terrible on the soundtrack of End Of Days. But on this CD they were great! And Rob Zombie, they let us heard another fast and heavy metal again. And Metallica was great. Maybe some people thought that it wasn't so hard when they said \\"do you berry me when I'm gone, do you teach while me I'm here, just as soon as I belong, then It's time to dispear(?)\\". Well yes, that part maybe wasn't that hard enough, but the other parts are still like metallica. And the other thing I thought about this CD is that it's a little louder then other CD's when you play it, and that is pretty good for hard rock fans. the only problem is that the other artists didn't seem so well. But still it's good enough for hard rock fans. So just buy it, alright?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD RULES!","review":"Great songs from Metallice, LIMP BIZKIT, Godsmack and Foo Fighters... the Limp and Metallica songs REALLY KICK!

M I:2 is a rare exception. Setting aside all the high-quality recordings, you have to marvel at the conscious and celebrated effort to diversify and innovate, especially in such a major mass-market release. Obviously it has great bands doing what they do best, with Metallica, Rob Zombie, etc. But it also has genre-crossing efforts such as the title song with Limp Bizkit and the cover version of Pink FLoyd/Roy Harper's \\"Have a Cigar.\\" Trailing the recording off with Tori Amos is a refreshing surprise and clever strategy against this testosterone-filled mission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barf!

Limp Bizkit and Metallica. More so for Metallica since i am a very Die-Hard fan. I love their song \\"I Dissapear\\" but it is nothing compared to \\"Master of Puppets\\" \\"...And Justice for all\\" etc, etc. The first three songs were great! Then once it hit the Foo Fighters song it really plunged into nothingness. It seems that when they put this CD together, they thought the people would listen to the whole thing after Rob Zombie's remix of \\"Scum of the Earth\\" They were VERY WRONG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the actual movie will be better.","review":"I'm not a big hard rock...and probably never will be; and to be honest I bought this soundtrack only for the Tori Amos recording \\"Carnival\\"--a satisfying, agressively breathtaking rehash. Unfortunately, not even Tori can save this album from being an overload of mostly mediocre bombastic tracks. Metallica, Foo Fighters, and Chris Cornell (among others) do what they can with what seems to be a restricted approach to heavy music. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect about this soundtrack is the sheer lack of developmental style as disappointingly heard on Limp Bizkit's very poor \\"Take a Look Around\\" and Rob Zombie's flat \\"Scum of the Earth\\". Powderfinger, however, is a nice discovery with \\"My Kinda Scene\\" which drifts softly into a wonderful, if stereotypically, mellow manner. If only there was a mission to replace some of these noisily fizzled-out tracks with whiskey hardened tunes, then maybe we'd have something; but I fear that would be impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The lineup is flashy. The songs are new. At first glance, what's not to like about this album, which features a great picture of Tom Cruise on the cover?Actually, there's lots not to like. The album charges out of the gate with the Limp Bizkit version of the \\"Mission: Impossible\\" Theme. Metallica follows it up with a less than-subpar effort \\"I Disappear\\". One of their worst songs in recent memory, this coming from a die-hard Metallica fan.The only songs that are even worth mention are \\"What U Lookin' At?\\" (Uncle Kracker), \\"Alone\\" (Buckcherry), and \\"Immune\\" (Powderfinger). Every other song, whether it be rock-metal or rap-metal, thoroughly disappoints and leaves the listener quite mad. At the price of about 16 bucks, it's the biggest rip-off of the century. Do NOT buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCK IS BACK!","review":"I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I really cannot rate the last half of the cd--but that is only because I keep hitting the repeat button on the first half.

This book is a must for anyone who wants to understand the development of Public Assistance programs and policy in the United States. The section covering the Welfare Reform policies of 1996 including the articles and opinions written by social workers and policy experts. This book is extremely important for social historians, social workers and anyone who wants to understand the debate on welfare and the villification of welfare recipients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished Work","review":"This is a very difficult read. The authors present us with about 187 chapters of documents written between 1884 to 2002 from hundreds of different authors. This may be a fine set of reference for anybody who wishes to write a \\"good\\" documentary history of Welfare. However, its presentatation is disjointed. Wonderful history books present us with relevant facts and insights on a particular subject. The chapters of good history books are written by one or two authors which yield a smooth, telling of the story. This is more like a compilation of good raw material and references which must precede a history book. The authors started a promising project. They retrieved valuable reference documents. Afterwards, they simply copied their reference documents. The authors forgot to write a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two AWESOME \\"Hair Metal\\" albums on one CD!","review":"I've been a Fastway fan for a long time, but these two albums are by far their most productive work.

Had never heard about Tom or his work. Took a chance and ordered the book.Just one word should describe it - MINDBLOWING !Although the art and line drawings are repetitive, the way the whole story is conceptualised and brought to life in the drawings is indeed amazing.Am a fan now and forever, have also ordered a couple of his other books.The only reason I give a four star rating is that the Book could have been published in one volume and the size and layout could also have been slightly larger, which would have enhanced the visual appeal.All in all a book worth keeping and prying into as and when the need \\"ARISES\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview","review":"The format isn't exactly great, but the fact that all the comics are together makes this collection worth while.

The size does not bother me, as one page contains only one frame; it's not a ten frames per page type of comic, as one might suspect. Highly recommended, but if you need Tom of Finland's art reproduced large, check out Taschen's hardcover Tom of Finland coffee table book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down!!!","review":"I was going to pre-order this collection because I'm a big fan of Tom's. Thank God I waited for the reviews. Indeed, when this collection was first announced, you couldn't check the dimensions and the price sounded too good to be true. Now I know why... Amazon, please pass your customers' feedback to Taschen and, hopefully, they'll resize this collection to a larger format (letter size would be great). Instead of shrinking cult books like \\"The Art of Pleasure\\" (which I proudly own in its original HUGE format), they sure can bring this collection to a respectable size.

The singable songs collection is very good too, as is the Christmas album."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!","review":"This boxed set is fabulous! We've become a Raffi family!

Feast 2 has lots of gore, a couple of jokes, poinless violence, and ummm...well not much else. The story is pretty much non existent, the acting lets just say I have seen better in a 70's porn movie, and the directing, I guess he was asleep. An all around waste of time.

I dont think this is anything compared to the first one. and if there is a third one...dont expect alot of money coming in for it. they seem to be getting worse and worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"To put it bluntly, this is a move made for immature drunk college guys.

An absolute slap in the face to the first movie, which was passably good compared to this pile of feces.No fan of horror movies should ever give this even a passing glance."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete letdown !!!!","review":"part one was an unexpected gem of a indie horror movie. fast paced, hot women and decent fx. to add, it didnt take itself too seriously. here it was an utter mess. it tried to do too much or wanted to be ''evil dead 3'' too badly.this picks up minutes after part 1 ended. i like when sequels do that. the sister of the chick who was going to rob the bar is searching for her. sister (whos the boss of an all girl biker gang) stubbles across the old bartender and the stupidty begins.this is a much better comedy than horror movie but its even short on laughs. a better title would have been ''least''."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's just...bad","review":"Horror junkies know that films in the genre fall into 3 basic categories: great; implausibly silly but entertaining; and so bad it's not even good, just bad. \\"Feast 2\\" falls squarely into the last category. There is no rhyme or reason to this movie. Story arcs often go nowhere (the Honey Pie storyline for one) and there is no tension whatsoever -- just lots of gore. Now, I'm never one to dismiss the power (and fun) of good blood-splattering, but the film doesn't even deliver on that level. There's just lots of red goo and meal worms for the sake of...I'm not sure what the sake for. Additionally, the movie dragged; I kept waiting for something of interest but there wasn't anything. Continuity was also bad: actors covered in slime one minute and looking pretty damn dry the next. While the original was an entertaining slice of nastiness, this was a complete letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feast This One In The Trash Can","review":"I actually give this movie less than five stars. The most HORRIBLE movie ever made. I honestly cannot beleive they actually put up the money to make such utter trash!! The first one was good and actually kind of scary as most monster movies should be but this one was way over the top of being ridiclous. Especially when one of the obviously very fake creatures gets disected and when the movie actually shows a baby being killed and torn apart!!!! PLEASE Do not waste your time or money with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS TOTAL CRAP!!!!!","review":"Ok, I loved the first FEAST movie. This piece of crap was just out of line and stupid. I have seen troma movies better then this! Everyone in this movie is a total jerk and by the end of the movie your begging to see them all die ( but you don't!! ) the movie just ends. that's it. This movie is nothing but the F-word over and over until you can't stand hearing it anymore. NOt much Gore, bad story, stupid actors, it never shows the monsters, etc. Stick with the first Feast movie and save your money, unless you want to watch 2 hours of monster farts, semen, and snot. This movie is pure bad taste!!! Any 4th grader could have made a lame movie better then this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy indeed...","review":"First of all, like a lot of other reviewers who gave a 1/5, I LOVED the first Feast. It is in my top 5 favorite gore-horror flicks. But the sequel was 100% sloppy garbage.It starts off ok, picking up the morning after the 1st one ended. The sister of the biker-chick shows up to find her sister's arm in the mouth of a dog, and the injured old bartender hiding under a truck. So, out of reasons of vendetta, she takes the bartender hostage, looking for \\"Bozo\\", whom she thinks is responsbile for her sister's death. Not to give away the storyline to those who want to see this, but that is the only piece of plot I could comprehend in 100 minutes. She never even finds \\"Bozo\\"!The acting is putrid, effects were even worse, and the \\"monsters\\" look like glorified puppets. It almost seems as though the movie was made on an elementary school's cafeteria budget.Unfortunately, a 3rd movie is/has been made. I guess it cant be worse..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feast 2: Sloppy Sequel","review":"I'm being kind with the title actually. I found the first \\"Feast\\" to be a pretty entertaining if not overly campy, gory horror flick. This sequel is abysmal. Not one likable character. The creatures look sillier. The acting and dialogue are laughable. Skip this if you do not enjoy unintelligent inane garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"First was excellent, this?","review":"While the first \\"Feast\\" was an excellent movie. I combined good writing, good acting and excellent directing. What happened to the this one and Feast III? Simple, they milked the originals reputation for all they could. Where there where a few moments that provided a couple of chuckles these two sequels just plain sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Hungry!","review":"The first film worked so well hidden in the darkness of night. With Feast 2, the harsh sunlight exposes the cheese, and the cheese has melted into an oily blob in the gutter. Very sloppy indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feast II: Sloppy Seconds","review":"I watched this movie last night and here is what I thought. First, the moview was worse than the first one. Second, what is going on with the trashy dialogue. I mean a few sentenence enhancers can help make a point in a movie better, but the constant use of the f**k word is just plain trashy. What was with the out of nowhere scene where the baby was killed. What that thrown in just to make the movie worse. I gave the movie two stars but I should have given it less than that. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd read a review before buying it.","review":"The first FEAST was a hip, edgy, funny, over the top film that had horror fans like myself wanting more.The filmmakers want to have more blood, guts, nudity, and violence, and generally break some taboos for this sequel. And boy they did they ever. So much so that I hit the stop button after one particular scene.If you have children or are sqeamish, you may want to pass this movie up. In one of the most tasteless, disturbing and shocking sequences I've ever seen in a film, a cute baby is hurled into the air. We then see him falling in slow-motion before he hits the ground. We then see the poor child crying and writhing in a pool of his own blood before being eaten by the monsters.I understand the point of the Feast movies, to be funny and gory and they are, but why kill a baby? I personally felt this was very uneccesary and will be passing up on that 3rd Feast. I don't have much of an appetite anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a feast!!","review":"It's true, this movie was far from perfect. The acting was decent, and the gore factor was real high. If you have a beer or two, mellow out, and watch the movie for entertainment purposes, you will like it. If you watch it like movie critic, who thinks you can make the perfect movie,and really can't either, you won't like it. I did enjoy the movie, but I get biased. The more gore, the more stars! Give it a try, you might really like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM A GUILLOTINE LOOKING FOR A HEAD","review":"Feast 2 is similar to the original. A group of people are held up in a location by the beasts. In this case they are in a town and are attempting to break into the jail house because it is the safest building in town. Some of the original cast returns. Introductions are done differently. Instead of the clever 4-5 line bio, they show you a black and white retro bio which was about as ineffective and less funny.Jenny Wade returns as Honey Pie. She deserted the gang in the last film and is greeted as a punching bag in this one. Movie includes a monster dissection and we still don't know the origin of the beast, i.e. alien, mutant, experiment. More action, less drama than the first one.F-bomb, sex, nudity (Diane Ayala Goldner, Melissa Reed ?) rear midget nudity, baby tossing, midget hurling, topless biker chicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first DVD i've ever thrown away..","review":"Absolutely terrible.I was a big fan of FEAST and couldn't comprehend how the same team made FEAST 2. The monsters are no longer scary, the effects look cheap, the acting is terrible and unless you like vile and ugly women vomiting on one another do NOT watch this movie. It's more than a waste of your 90 minutes.Throwing this movie away was an insult to the garbage can."},{"rating":"2","title":"feast II","review":"I did not expect it to be in its original packing and it was delivered 3 days faster than anticipated"},{"rating":"1","title":"Closure?","review":"Feast part 2 does not explain what these creatures are or where they are from.Feast 2 does have a brief scene where one of the characters attempts to study the creature. However, nothing is solved or even slightly explained regarding the creature's origin.In addition, none of the cast is likeable in this movie. The worst scene involves an \\"attempted\\" rescue of an infant that only you can watch to judge for yourself.If there will be a part three, the producers need to put some closure on the creature's origin and perhaps have at least one or two likeable actors in the movie.There is some suspense and gore. Again, this sequel answers none of the lingering questions from part one.This is a two star product-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by the hosts","review":"There are some funny songs on this CD. Unfortunately, Bob & Tom decided to repeatedly insert the sound themselves laughing stupidly at the obvious punchlines in the songs, and totally wrecked them as a consequence.Good producers of compilation albums know that it's about the music, not about the themselves, and in the process show how clever they are by pulling it together (see \\"A John Waters Christmas\\" for the perfect example). Bob & Tom aren't smart enough to understand this.They leave the Dr. Duke Tomatoe songs alone, but those are available elsewhere. A couple of other tracks escape the sophomoric giggles of Bob & Tom, but not enough to salvage this mess from being completely unlistenable. Save your money. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a listen","review":"Just as in years past, when a certain \\"sound\\" comes in, or in this case, back into the mainstream, there are usually dozens of soundalikes and coat-tail hoppers.

It seems sometimes as though each new band has a couple of primary influences that they derive their sound from......as of late, it seems that Gang Of Four has been the flame - with the Departure, I hear a bit of GOF but more then anything, I hear Au Pairs.

These twenty plots are a better subject for an essay or paper than an entire book. That the author has to say about each of the twenty plots could be summed up in three lines: The protagonists goal, the relationships between two or three main characters, and the hook.

The flow is not seamless as others mention, but there is so much to learn from Peggy. The series for neck and shoulders is relaxing and uses biofeedback techniques to improve sense of shoulder position and posture. That is very unique for a yoga video. I recommend spending time learning the postures at your level and then just doing your own individual practice to music or in quiet. A goal of yoga is to be able to know your body better, accept where you are, feel a flow of movement and do what your body needs at that time. There is a also a great chair based yoga programLakshmi Voelker Chair Yoga, Single Chair Yoga Vol. 1out there for a dynamic adapted yoga practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this DVD.","review":"I have rheumatoid arthritis so I was looking for something that would help me to exercise but not hurt me.

It is a little longer than I thought it would be, but it is well worth it. Ms. Peggy Cappy goes step-by-step on the DVD. I think I used/stretched some muscles that I have not used since 8th grade (smile). If you have stiff joints, then this is the DVD you may want to get.

So I was really, really surprised when following the East Yoga for Arthritis. I thought, \\"Finally, an excerise I'll be able to do without hurting my neck.\\" Wrong! My neck hurt for days after doing the exercises. One of the biggest problems with arthritis in the neck is that it doesn't always hurt or pinch immediately; it sneaks up and gets you afterwards. What the problem was, I don't know. All I do know is that I wouldn't be able to use the tape I just purchased. But it will not stop me from utilizing her other tapes. I just don't understand why the exercise program didn't relate more to the problem of arthritis or how to help the various parts of the body that is so afflicted.

I am past middle age, was fairly active before my operations, have grown married children and found this the perfect thing to help me become active again - yoga - it's a wonderful thing! None of the exercises/poses/positions hurt my back or hip and my body felt wonderful after completing each step.

I wish I had purchased something else. Peggy Cappy obviously knows her material. I think the problem here is primarily with the editing and design. It would have been helpful to have an instructional section, followed by a practice section which you could turn on to work through. Instruction is mixed up with practice. With all her talking, the DVD is 110 minutes long! I don't have that amount of time, and constantly fast forwarding is really not user friendly. (The last portion of Sun Salutations abruptly cut off, as mentioned by another reviewer.) Her two helpers looked less than thrilled to be on the DVD! Come on - show a little enthusiasm! The lack of music, while not critical, is a legitimate complaint.I won't give the DVD away, since I need to work on flexibility to counter my osteoarthritis.

She is an excellent Yoga instructor with a soothing voice that easily prods you into a level of relaxation. Most, but not all, of her instruction is well suited for elderly students with physical limitations. A few of the stretches can be too difficult for someone not flexible or limber although with time and by following a weekly routine the stretches become easier. If you are recovering from any type of injury make sure your doctor or physical therapist gives the green light to begin even the easiest warm-ups associated with Yoga. I spend a lot of time in front of a computer and find the hand warm-ups along with the neck stretches really helps lessen my discomfort. Doing just those moves could benefit anyone of any age and minimize the related pain.

Who is going to do it and not get bored? Why not break it into small programs - with breaks - for specific problem areas, rather than standing/seated/reclining poses?

For those of us who HAVE read the prior two in this series and any of the Herris Serrano books it IS tied together and, as I said, indicates the possibility off at LEAST 4 additional books.

This book is better than a romp in a theme park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"This is the first Moon book I read, and it will also be my last. I picked it up at an outlet mall because I liked the cover. The book is basically a series of vignettes involving a lot of different characters so there is no major plot to the book. The few sections with Esmay and Barin were probably the most interesting. Moon was apparently wrapping up a bunch of loose ends from her prior books.

During the first chapter the book outlines a plot worth reading. Then the last chapter barely closes the first. The sub-plots within sub-plots combine to make this the most boring book she has written. I almost thought another writer must have slipped in. However the story line is written in her style. I do not reccomend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half a Book","review":"Having read the previous two books in the Esmay Suiza series I was looking forward to reading this one. After reading the book I was left with an unsatisfied feeling. I reread the book and realized that I felt cheated. It felt like I had read half a book. After a comparison with the previous books I noticed it was shorter and that none of the plot lines seemed to come to a conclusion. If you've read the other books don't waste your money on the hardback. Wait for the paperback. While I'm waiting for the other half of this book to be published I will go back and re-read the Haris Serano series of Familias Regnant books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but when does the *story* start?","review":"I enjoyed the first two of Elizabeth Moon's \\"Esmay Suiza\\" books immensely. Esmay is a very likable heroine, and she's the same sort of \\"trouble magnet\\" as Modesty Blaise.*This* book, however, isn't about Esmay. It's about the assassination of a head of state, power politics, technical problems with rejuvenation technology, a mutiny on a prison planet, and a blood feud between the Suizas and Serranos (think Montagues and Capulets with nuclear weapons) Esmay herself appears in no more than about one-sixth of this overly-long book, and she's mostly being shoved around from pillar to post.I have a feeling that Ms. Moon is basically using this book to set the background for what I call \\"meal ticket series\\" writing, where each book is milked for maximum revenue without regard to entertainment value, and you have to buy *all* the series to understand any of it.I was greatly disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and too many plots","review":"Elizabeth Moon is a favorite author of mine and I looked forward to the next installment in this series but.... I found the book to be confusing, sluggish and distracting.Not enough time was spent on any one plot and I felt cheated that I didn't get more out of one thread through the storyline. It was a bit overwhelming to juggle all the scenarios and keep them straight. At times, I lost interest.I frequently re-read Moon's other books because the writing is so strong but this novel fell flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very little military action/adventure, but interesting.","review":"Chronologically this novel is a sequel to \\"Rules of Engagement,\\" but in mood and orientation it is more a sequel to, \\"Winning Colors.\\" Very little of the book is devoted to the continuing adventures of Esmay Suiza in the Regular Space Service. Like \\"Winning Colors\\" it is mostly devoted to the maneuvering within the Familias Regnant. I enjoyed the character development and insights into the government of the Familias, but there is very little military action/adventure. The mutiny on Copper Mountain had some good action and this novel did set up the civil war within the Familias and the Regular Space service for the next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"More loose ends than Don King's Haircut","review":"I think Ms. Moon must have been uninspired and yet pressed by her editor for a sequel to the otherwise worthwhile Esmay Suiza branch this series.

Read this book and draw your on conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"First third of a book","review":"This book reads almost as well as her earlier ones, but there is no unifying theme, plot, or situation. It is a Familias book with a hodge-podge of subplots instead of a Suiza book. Sometimes it is hard to tell which events in one area are happening at the same time as other events in other subplots. It ends so abruptly I got the impression the author had to finish the book in 3 days instead of 6 months. An additional 200 (or more) pages to finish this book would be a great improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Set-up but no delivery...","review":"Well, having read (and re-read) the previous books focusing on Esmay Suiza I was expecting this to be the latest installment in the her ongoing adventures. Silly me. This entire book was a set up for future novels regarding the Familias and (hopefully) Esmay. This was a very frustrating read since it was background and set-up solely. There was no apparent plot or direction. Hopefully all this frustration will be rewarded in future with a new novel which returns to the focus of the previous installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Extended Prologue","review":"With Esmay Suiza on the cover of the book, I was expecting to read a novel with her as the central character. Instead, the book is like an extended prologue, setting up all the events and characters for the next novel. Esmay doesn't have much of a presence in this novel. Each character has short segments within chapters--no character is more important than another. This made it difficult to care much about any of the characters. I wanted to read more about Esmay but Moon was taking a different approach and I suppose you could say that the book was about the Familias Regnant and the changes it was undergoing. It just didn't make very compelling reading for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change of Command","review":"I waited for \\"Change of Command\\" to come out in the paperback edition, and I am really glad I did. This book is so clearly meant to set up/stimulate a desire to buy \\"Against all Odds\\" that the entire book could easily be seen as being an \\"advertisement\\" or a marketing ploy to make us REALLY want \\"Against.\\"I certainly desire \\"Against,\\" but after \\"Change ...\\" I will definitely wait for paperback edition, and perhaps the used paperback edition. I really hate feeling like I got scewed, but the marketing strategy for this series, now that it is popular, really makes me feel that way.\\"Change\\" is the first E. Moon book I have read where I felt \\"cheated,\\" as if this books' purpose was to get me to spend money now, and then more money later, just to get the next book so I would have some sense of closure.Baen is certainly not the first bookdealer to use \\"suck you in\\" marketing, but I thought better of both Baen Books and Elizabeth Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from one of my favorite authors","review":"Having read the other reviews posted here, I concur with the other reviewers. This is an intermediate book that badly needs the next in the series to be worth reading. I'm not convinced that the society described is viable, particularly the level of technology required for their \\"barbarian\\" neighbors, but the series is enjoyable anyway. I hope the next book is up to the standards of Remnant Population and the five previous books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Change of Command suffers from \\"interum syndrome\\" where a book in the middle of a series has to tie up loose ends and introduce new subplots, but can't seem to create cohesion or a self contained storyline. Many new interesting developements are introduced, but left to dangle. If Moon can come back and write a good sequel, this uninspired volume might be seen in a better light. Best to reserve judgement.Sachie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Space Opera","review":"This is an extremely disappointing follow-up to Rules of Engagement. Moon makes the BIG mistake of thrusting a faceless cast of thousands in our faces instead of focusing on the main characters from her previous two novels in this series. I liked the first two books because Esmay was a brash and courageous young woman with an interesting back story. Here, she is a mere decoration that is as important as a flyspeck on the wall of the Familias Regnant (think I got that right).Save your money and run for the hills."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different look","review":"In spite of the negative reviews I've read, I actually enjoyed this book a great deal. I'm anxiously awaiting the opportunity to read the conclusion to what was set up in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning point for Familias Regnant series","review":"The Familias Regnant is discovering that \\"the center cannot hold.\\" Perhaps this is why Ms. Moon chose to tell this story from so many POVs, demonstrating that this empire is tottering not from a single mighty blow, but from many seemingly minor events forming a disastrous cascade. It is not a book which can stand alone, but it is an excellent illustration of how the success of a political system depends on its members' actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"This is not my favorite of Kathy Smith's DVDs. I do generally enjoy her workouts, but with this this DVD I don't care for the extra long introductions (which you cannot skip over), and also the fact that she does cheesy voice overs for the workouts as opposed to talking throughout the routine. Additionally, the music she chose is horrible, elevator music and not at all motivating. I've done the workouts a few times but mostly this one is sitting on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith: Super Slimdown Circuit","review":"This is a good workout. I work out regularly and yet found my muscles ached a little the day after this workout. Because of the different mixes on the DVD, I can do a workout Monday and get a different workout on Tuesday; so it's like getting 2 DVD's in one...a good value for the cost.The one complaint I have is the editing is off in a couple spots. Although Kathy does show proper form for each new exercise there's a couple times when there is no time allowed for getting into position or for transitioning to the new exercise; she goes right into it and you lose the first few reps. I have noticed this with other DVD's by other instructors as well. I recommend the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith - Super Slimdown Circuit","review":"I borrowed this workout from the local library before I decided to buy it. What I like about it is you get effective sculpting of the upper and lower body. The upper and lower body sculpting segments are each about 40 minutes long. It's different from a workout that concentrates on weight training. Each move is displayed by one of Kathy's exercise group members to ensure you do the moves properly before you begin the exercise.There is a cardio segment where you can follow at a slower pace or the ramped-up pace by emulating the exercise group member you choose. When it becomes a little more intense, a 2-minute timer appears on the screen so you know you will be working at that capacity for a short time. This is also about 40 minutes long.This is like getting 3 separate workouts in one DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"I am a huge Kathy Smith fan, but I did not like this nearly as much as her other workouts. I found the lower body workout to be a bit boring--the music was way to mellow. I didn't like the introductions before each segment and I found the pace to be too slow. Also, Kathy seemed to be missing her usual energy. For toning, I would instead recommend her Lift Weights to Lose Weight, Volume 1.However, I did enjoy the cardio segment, which is why I gave the dvd two stars. It's a nice workout if you don't have a lot of time. It gets you moving and is a good pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but a bit difficult","review":"I have to compare this one to Code Veronica in the resident evil series.

McCusker is a self-help guide written especially for men, and about improving one's life through honing one's self-esteem, intellect, appearance, health, love life, and sex life. Examining the impacts that one's upbringing and childhood have on learning how to play the game of life, From Dweeb To Adonis offers some rather iconclastic advice (such as trying cigarettes or other unhealthy practices only once), yet overall offers an in-depth view in the factors that contribute to the formulation of personality, habits, routine, and all aspects of daily life as well as how that life can be improved. From Dweeb To Adonis is an original, \\"user friendly\\" advisory which is quite well written, and a commendable addition to self-help, self-improvement reading lists for a male readership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor recording","review":"I was very much looking forward to this album. For anyone familiar with Mexican romantic music, these two great artists were legends in their time and still are. The selections represent the most famous songs they were known for. The songs of Luis Aguilar were just great! However, this album does a great injustice to Pedro Infante!I was very disappointed by the very poor recording quality of the songs of Pedro Infante. He always displayed a very clear rich and melodic voice. Yet, I frequently had to raise the volume just to be able to hear him.There is really no reason for this, since the two singers were contemporaries. Otherwise, this would have been the perfect album for us fans of these two immortal singers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Calvinist Universalism","review":"This book was a disappointment.

I am all for repetition, but on this seemingly catchier release hardly any of it sounds different. Instead, the band seems convinced that layering any cheap melody and bland vocal on top of a boring tempo for a long enough time and we will have hypnosis. They might have fooled many with their earlier instrumental-driven discs, but with a heavy focus on more of a pop element, it has never been more certain that the group's songwriting abilities remain questionable at best while striving for an aesthetic that has always been beyond their grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you would expect","review":"I already own the claw and ball style 7315 davis and stanford tripod, which is the little brother of this one.

That is until Disney got a hold of the file and cropped the screen. It really does affect the musical numbers on the show. Disney should have simply released a two-sided disk, one for full and one for wide screen. I'm hoping that Disney will wise up and re-release this DVD wide screen. Hopefully either refund or give current owners a rebate towards the wide screen version. So Disney if you're reading this take note of all the other reviews that also dislike full frame.P.S. As for the story it's as good as all the other reviews say it is, if you can get past the missing chunks of the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney releases edited version...","review":"\\"Muppet Treasure Island\\" is a wonderful film. It is very funny and the acting is great. And while there are some nice special features on this DVD release, Disney has decided that they need to release the edited Full screen version because this film does not appeal to adults. Can you believe that? Disney thinks that adults don't like the Muppets. Well, I hope that Disney can release a Widescreen version in the future. If you want a pan-and-scan Foolscreen DVD, go ahead and buy it, but I suggest that people who want to see the film unedited should wait for when Disney decides to release it in Widescreen. Give the DVD a rent for the special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"A muppet classic!","review":"I regard this as the last of the original series of Muppet movies with most of the original Jim Henson team.

After his last success at adapting Dickens' A Christmas Carol, he has once again succeeded, albeit in a different way, at story adaptation. Only this time, he makes a fine Muppet movie based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island.The film stars Tim Curry as the Long John Silvers, although many other humans had strong parts as well, including Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins (the boy), and Billy Connolly (proprietor of map.) All the fun is here though, and basically the whole storyline of the novel, as the Muppets sing and dance their way through the film.This film is very entertaining for the whole family. A few dark parts might mar it for really young children, but I find that most kids would enjoy it, as I did when I was younger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muppet Treasure Island is a Treasure","review":"Jim Henson's Muppet version of RLS's Treasure Island, this movie is certainly a treasure to own.

The production value is high, the characters are colorful, and it is endlessly quotable. Rizzo and Gonzo practically steal the movie with their constant hysterics. Other great performances include Sam Eagle (as Samuel Arrow), Clueless Morgan, and Blind Pew. The humans weren't bad either (Tim Curry and Billy Connolly bring some star quality to the picture). They even managed to squeeze Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem and the Swedish Chef in for cameo parts.

March is a very strong character, one that you look forward to growing with. The is not wholly original, but still a well done thriller. The ending has twists and turns that don't strain credibility (a huge advantage in this day and age of insane \\"top this\\" thrillers) and offer some geniune surprises. Spiegleman spends far too much time detailing the minute details of apartments and couches and features of minor characters, but that is typical of some first time authors. A good start to a promising series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good debut!","review":"Spiegelman clearly knows whereof he speaks and actually makes the world of banking interesting. He has created an interesting protagonist in John March, including a history revealed throughout the story. The story does start out slowly and one has to get through the information about the banking industry, money laundering and data security, which s interesting and relevant but not exciting. After that, the story definitely takes off and suspense builds to an exciting ending. I very much enjoyed this debut book and am looking forward to his next."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting Read","review":"Black Maps is a page turner, full of exciting scenes that expose the true nature of greed, power, and fear. The characters in the story come to life through detailed descriptions and crisp narrative and dialogue, while the backdrop of Wall St/New York City evokes a feeling of glamour and danger.What makes Black Maps such a great read is the complex story line with all its twists and turns. Just when you think you have it figured out, the story shifts in another direction. Just when you think all is well, more danger lurks behind the next corner, or in this case, on the next page!Black Maps is great mystery with alot of substance. Its the type of book that one can read more than once, with the same sense of enjoyment each time.It's truly one to be tried by all mystery fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sensational","review":"This book was hard for me to get interested in.

March leaves the area and sets up a private investigator business in New York City. He gets a blackmail case involving a client who is an executive with a seemingly shady past. The plot is quite good as the reader follows many twists and turns along the way. The author gives quite vivid and detailed physical descriptions of the main characters. For my taste, even though I thought this was an excellent read it seemed to often lack that \\"must turn the page\\" quality that distinguish's the five star read.Still it was a nice change of pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves 6 stars - or 7","review":"Knopf doesn't publish just anyone's first novel, much less a PI mystery. Not hard to see why they signed Peter Spiegelman - he's as good as Michael Connelly. Black Maps is an amazingly mature work, without the usual reservation \\"for a first novel.\\" It's engrossing from the first page to the last. Spiegelman's writing never gets in the reader's way - it's never self-conscious or - fatal for a mystery - transparently tricky, coy, or cute. It's a real story - the characters that carry the plot are alive and interesting without exception, and even the minor characters at the second and third levels have energy. A wonderful, wonderful piece of writing. Spiegelman has a place among the mystery writers who are master craftsmen - Connelly, Robert B. Parker, Tony Hillerman (at his best), et al.

If you like detective stories set in Eastern-Europe/Russia along the lines of Martin Cruz-Smith's \\"Gorky Park\\" series, you'll love \\"Red Meat\\". I hope he writes many more novels of this genre set in the Commonwealth of Independent States"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute failure","review":"It is amazing to see Philip Kerr's talent dimishing so rapidly.

I like the fact that they toy encourages skill development in fine motor, matching, color and pattern recognition, and imagination. I was surprised by the fact that my 2 year old loves it too. Becuase this toy is made of a very durable wood material (both the doll figure and clothing articles) I'm sure they will both love it for years to come. This is a great alternative to the much less durable \\"paper dolls\\". I would caution use with young children that are still mouthing objects however as the shoes are small could pose a chocking hazard for little ones that stick toys in their mouths. Overall a great toy for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun idea, cute, but . . .","review":"This toy is a wonderful idea with poor quality. I bought this for my daughter and she really enjoyed it, albeit briefly. My biggest complaint was that the paper is glued to the wood, and the glue does not work well enough. Within a week or so of purchasing, and with not much play time, the clothing started to peel off its wood backing. I called the company and left a detailed message. No one ever returned my call, which was disappointing since I was under the impression that they stood behind their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alternative to Barbies","review":"My daughter, age 4, enjoys playing with her 2 Melissa and Doug dress up dolls.(She also has the princess magnetic doll.)

That was in Jan 2011. Wow - don't wait on that one.Regardless - the book, I feel, is worth much more. It is not 100% comprehensive covering all technical aspects as say the Chicago Manual of Style, but is perfect for a student in research courses (not just psychology) developing skills on how to follow a research paper format/framework.It is brief, and it comes with sample pieces. Because of the brevity and simplicity (still 154 pages so addressing quite a bit) students may get a lot out of this as it is possible to digest. It is a healthy bit size of researcheyness, especially for the new writer: but not limited to.Again, for $3.00, put it on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"review on \\"A Separate Peace\\"","review":"I usually dont like reading books, and of course I had to read this one for school.

Also, having to write a report on every chapter probably didn't help much either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Of all the books that were inflicted on me in high school English class, this was definitely the worse. Pretentious and stilted, \\"A Separate Peace\\" has the reputation of being a soul searing exploration of adolescent turmoil and the evil lurking behind the facade of everyday life, but in truth never offers any truthful insight into either of these weighty topics. The deepest conclusion it reaches is that people are capable of bad things. And it's a miracle if you can feel any sympathy whatsoever for the whiny, self-pitying narrator. It's hard to identify with anybody who is such an ass. A bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed reading A Separate Peace.","review":"The characters,Finny and Gene,were very well developed. They seemed real and life-like. I felt like I could know bothj of these people. The book also deals with a common problem betweenpeople which is jealousy and misunderstanding. I can understand what these two things feel like and that helped to bring me closer in to the book. A Separate Peace contains many important symbols. By reconizing these symbols I got a better understanding of the book and its characters. I could look at the situation in different ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seperate Peace is a great novel about friendship","review":"I believe that the novel A Separate Peace, written by John Knowles represents an excellent high school reading selection. Throughout the book John Knowles' use of symbolism adds several levels of the meaning to the book. The conflict observed in the book involves a subjective, man versus man battle. Gene constantly compares himself with Phineas. It takes Phineas' death to make Gene realize that the competition with Phineas occured only in his head. Phineas, trying to enjoy his life, did not waste time competing with Gene. Gene, on the other hand, lived to compete with Phineas. This interaction of the main characters and the rich symbolization in the book made A Separate Peace a very challenging novel to comprehend. The dramatic rivalry kept my interest all the way through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was to unrealistic for me!","review":"A Seperate made me think about what really happened. If you take the time to actually think you find out that Finny was never mad at Gene. I don't think there is one sane person on this world that would get pushed out of a tree and forgive the guy who did it. A Seperate Peace was just a little to unrealistic for my likings. This book is way overrated. If you are thinking about reading this book, make sure you really want to before you do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sepearate Peace is superb! A thrill ride for the mind!","review":"I think A Separate Peace is Knowles's ''gold- mine''.He can never surpass this display of litterary skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was bad","review":"i didn't like the book i thought it was boring. i don't like reading books that are about the old days and the war. one of my teachers made me read it for school and i didn;t like reading it. i felt it was hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Boring and Tiring","review":"For my honor's english class, we had to read this novel over the summer. I was in high hopes that this book was going to be excellent, but was very disappointed to learn that the book was incredibly boring, and did not hold my interest for very long. I do not recommend this book for reading pleasure, and wished that I could have read a book that relates to teenagers this day in age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly worth the effort of picking it up","review":"After hearing all of the wonderful things about this book, I must say I was very disappointed once I began reading Knowles \\"classic\\" work. The idea of the book is very good, but the approach taken by Knowles leaves much to be desired. Unless you have far too much time on your hands, avoid this book in favor of a book with more depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a classic?","review":"Uninspired dialogue, flat characterization and a cookie-cutter approach to symbolism aren't the makings of a classic. I'm amused at the righteous indignation some Knowles partisans can work themselves into. Are you bothered by the fact that people don't like this book, or rather that they have enough independence of mind to recognize a minor work when they see one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The English Class Bible (Straight from a 16-year old)","review":"A Separate Peace has all the elements of a well written story.

It was so boring that it was a struggle to get through one page! Turns out the lesson you learn from this book is that all people are capable of bad things? This is another example of one of those \\"classics\\" that you already know the moral to.

This book takes place in a New England boarding school during World War II. In a Separate Peace, Knowles created a character by the name of Finny, which is the best of best friend there can possibly be. Finny and Gene are best friends, and they face many hardships and tough decisions throughout the course of the book. Finny is the more outgoing and athletic character and Gene is more of a nerd. At times, Gene envies Finny and one day wishes that for once Finny got caught pulling those senseless stunts of his. Gene also shows a tremendous amount of jealousy throughout the book. The fact that Finny forgave Gene for purposely pushing him out of the tree because of jealousy should tell you a whole lot about this kids character. Knowles did a good job on keeping me hooked onto this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read. It is written in the type of context that all should be blessed with. I just read it in my 9th grade literature class. It is stuuning and honest, full of events that many go through with their closest friends. If you have ever wondered what it is like to read a masterpiece, here's your chance to stop wondering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo","review":"I've read this book twice in less than a year, but both times I was forced to and both times it was equally unenjoyed. I found everything about the story, especially Gene, extremely hard to relate to. Oh yes it's about envy and the loss of innocence and the loss of sanity and friendship and hidden feelings and yada yada yada, but at the end of the day none of this makes it a story worth telling. Not only is Gene unrelatable, he is also unlikeable. Finny may understand why Gene pushed him out of the tree, but I sure as sh*t don't. In fact, it angered me that Gene got to live on in what to me seemed like a zombie state and Finny, who had much more potential for a great life, did not. I thought Gene was stupid to assume that Finny needed him as much as much as he needed Finny. Gene tries to justify his actions by blaming it on the times or whatever else.. I say Gene is full of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classically Bad","review":"Finny, the worst charecter ever. Well guy falls out of tree gets paralyzed end of story except when he gets murdered.

This is about what it feels like to read this book. I love reading and have read titles such as \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" \\"Jane Eyre,\\" and \\"The Odyssey,\\" but when I reached the end of this book I almost burned it. There's very little action and it's really not believeable. I think I would have had more sympathy for inanimate objects what with the way the characters were so symbolic rather than alive. I consider the time I spend reading it a wasted few weeks of my life and I now truly believe that high schools are out to torture children with these kinds of books, and if A Separate Peace teaches them anything it's that life is not too short to read a very bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"And why am I reading this...","review":"On the back of \\"A Seperate Peace\\" the summary includes the words,\\" tortured world of adolescence\\". This book is not close to being about the tortured world of adolescence, this book is about a book who did something stupid and then it haunts hiim for the rest of his life, and we are forced to hear him whine about it. I consider myself well read and open, and I am not enjoying this book. I am sorry for freshman english students who have to these 196 page of whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perspective","review":"I've noticed that most of the low ratings for this book are written by people lacking cranial capacity to digest the book, not really due to any judgment of the content. Which is surprising, since this book is a quick and easy read. The book failed to make an emotional impact on me, because I saw the perspective as being ridiculous. If it was set in any other time period, this would not have bothered me. Here we have a ridiculous child obsessing over the social hierarchy of an all boy's school, worrying about silly things, while across the globe, war atrocities are occuring, people are dying. This setting puts the main character's, Gene, strife into the perspective that it is all silly childish nonsense. The only emotional resonance this book contains concerns Knowle's only likeable character, Phineas. That is what earns it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Gift, And a Wonderful story","review":"I was forced to read this book in my school. Though I hate being forced to read books, I found this one the best out of all the ones we were forced to read. Yes, I consider this book better than To Kill a Mockingbird and Cry, The Beloved Country. It is very heartwarming and touched me so far, that it makes me as a 15 year old male want to cry. If you could just picture yourself in the place of Gene, it really makes you think about the hardships of what they must have gone through. The one music peace that reminds me of this book is 3 Doors Down's \\"Loser\\". It almost sounds like the book! THIS IS A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG CHEEEEEESY REVIEW FROM THE CHEESEMAN!","review":"A Separate Peace by John Knowles is a good book.

Gene is careful and intellegent. While Phineas (Finny) is wild and carefree. Although they are best friends, both are jealous of the other. Realizing that they are competitors, Gene pushes Finny out of tree. Personally, I didn't enjoy this book. I didn't seem to have a climax and didn't flow properly. The author also seemed to leave out a lot of major details. I don't recommend this book. I usually enjoy books on World War 2, but I hated this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Overall the book was not interesting but I did see some good in it, It really does bring you back in the past but it was just not interesting. The plot was good, laid-out very well, but I felt like things were going a little bit too slow for me, there wasn't much action to it besides maybe 3 scenes. This was my summer reading book for school though. And I read many books before and this is by far one of the worst I read. I just wanted to really stop reading it, almost tear the page off. But i had to for school. This is more for older people to read. Im 16 and couldn't find anything good to read in this book. I just didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite make it","review":"I am a fan of classic works. I loved Catcher in the Rye and enjoyed the Great Gatsby, Ethan Frome was also fullfilling, but this book was completely boring. I am a fan of symbolism and meanfulness of life but this book didn't do it for me. I could only relate to Gene. This, i found was not a good idea after a few chapters. I guess my problem was that I didn't trust Phinny to be a good person. Whatever the reason, I plan not to read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISTURBING","review":"Overall I found the book, that I had to read for a freshman honors English course very disturbing. Although I liked some of the characters and how Knowles developed their personalities, I found the plot of the book, disturbing and not the kind of thing that 9th graders should be reading about. The book frankly scared me, and although I know it occured in a different time period than the one I am currently living in, it really got me to thinking about my friends, and if any of them would ever be sick enough to try to hurt me. Not something I ever wanted to think about. I HATED THIS BOOK!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good book!","review":"Although, i was able to relate to the book in different ways the book was boring, uninteresting, and horrid.

All in all i was not satisfied with the details of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite book","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. I read this book in high school and didn't remember a thing about it, probably because I was really bored. I didn't even remember the end, which is dramatic. Then I read it again in college and I fell in love with it. I've read it numerous times since then and I'm always amazed at how well-done it is. If there was no shipping cost at amazon.com, I'd buy 100 of these books because they're so cheap, and just give them out to college kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really didn't like this book","review":"I read this book in my 11th grade English class. And I hated every moment. It was the first book that a teacher had given me to read that I hated.I didn't like the main character. I thought him an idiot. I didn't like the supporting characters. I didn't like the plot. I didn't like anything. Maybe it was the fact that there were no female characters and I had a hard time relating to young men in this situation.It's been a few years since high school and I've had people tell me to try to read it again. See if age has changed my views. I tried, got 30 pages into it and threw it down. I have such a strong reaction to this book, that I couldn't even give it a second chance.I realize this is supposed to be a big literary achievement but I hated this book. But at least I can't say I didn't react to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and powerful story","review":"This book to me has to be one of the best books I've read in a long time. I was assigned the book in English as an independent read, and I glad for it.I was sucked in from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring.....","review":"Ok, I had to read this for English class so maybe that's why I don't like it. The book is one of the most boring I have ever read. I would have less trouble going through a university chemistry text book than this poorly written junk. First of all, nothing interesting happens. Gene, as the narrator, is very annoying. Both Gene and Phineas are not very real seeming characters. I just sort of scanned through the novel after the first three chapters. This is not a good book for pleasure or study.

I am an 8th grade student in the Trenton, NJ area and this book is part of our English reading requirements. Not only did the students not enjoy reading this, but the teacher didn't either; I could tell. The book does teach valuble life themes, such as friendship, trust, revenge, etc., but it is not anything intersting, much less fun, to read. This book bored me out of my mind, but I really didn't have a choice whether I wanted to read it or not. If you're buying this book to read for pleasure, think before you spend the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really did not like this book","review":"I was required to read this book for class, and I really did not like it. The plot itself is interesting, but the author's style of writing is especially tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowles... A Separate Kind","review":"In short, Knowles is of a separate kind! But... What makes this book so special?! Well, it's got to be the way on which he presents its characters. It seemed to me for a moment, that I already have known those guys (Gene/Phinneas/Lepper). Having wote his novel as an adult, Mr. Knowles really captures the escence of his own adolescence -that he lived at Exeter University, the real-life counterpart of Devon School. The only drawbacks have to be the somehow disturbing ending, and the lenght of the story itself. It's a quick two day book. Ideal for any course of English... As the one I'm taking now. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had the potential to be a really good book","review":"I was forced to read this book this year in school and it is awful. It starts out being a happy-go-lucky book about 16 year old boys then turns into a paranoid, hatefest! I hate the way that Gene who seems to be a perfectly healthy boy turns into a person with a bad case of paranoia in two chapters. This book is depressing for no reason and very pointless. Please don't read it because it is a waste of your time. Spend time reading some other books of a much higher quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A separate Peace","review":"The interesting book about a friendship between two teenage boys was written by John Knowles. Rivalry arises between the friends and emotions take over. This book left me in suspense on what the outcome would be. A turn at the end comes unexpectedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seperate Peace","review":"I had to read this book for my junior year's English class. I thought it was a very interesting story and unique in the way of the in dept friendship of Gene and Finny. It takes place at an all boys' school in which they stay all year. However the 90 % of the book is a flashback remembering back to the time when him and Finny attended the school. The main plot of the story is that Finny is athletic and Gene is smart. However, Gene gets jealous and purposely injures Finny when they are performing dangerous stunts. But know body but himself (Gene) is aware of that fact, and throughout the story it shows his struggle with himself and his friendship. Overall I think this book is a great read and recommend it to anyone looking for a medium length book. I gave this book four stars because I feel their are some things that I would have liked to have been settled however it is wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ASP school reading","review":"I had just read the book A Separate Peace by John Knowles. This book had no action of any kind what so ever. If you are a patient reade, then you will enjoy the book. However, if you need continuous, ongoing, exciting situations, then you will not like the book. The book is extremely dull and boring. You need to really go in the middle of the book to find some exciting situations. The love, violence, and excitement are not found easily and are not found in a bold manner. Even though I am a kid that doesn't enjoy to read, I feel that anyone in their teen years will not feel this a strong book. However, there are always some people that enjoy all different types of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"ASP school reading book","review":"I have just recently read the book A Separate Peace by John Kowles.

I'm not saying that everyone won't like this book but unless you love to read just to read you will hate this book. This review isn't from a student that hates to read, I actualy like to read. The thing about this book that realy made me dislike this novel was that there was no real action, it was dull and bland. I do not recomend this book and encourage people not to read this book unless forced to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!!!","review":"Perhaps it's because it was forced upon me at school..perhaps it's because I can't relate to a book about boarding school boys during WW2 because I am a teen girl in the 90's. However, I liked Catcher in the Rye well enough... I know it's got a moral, and is probably interesting to some...but imho it was boring and pointless. I could not connect or feel any emotion for Finny and the other guy. The only thing I liked was Leper Lepellier, and I can't remember why. I completely agree with Lisa Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish this non-gripping tale","review":"I think this novel demonstrates why we \\"don't all get along.\\" Anyone who can give this novel a 10 is someone who I would probably find to be most unpleasant company.

Somone explain to me why I should finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, it's ridiculous","review":"This book is full of the flowery, unnecessary sort of detail that I'm used to seeing in these so-called classics. I found myself just turning the pages it was so boring. And I have to say that the plot was upsurd; what kind of sixteen year-old knocks their best friend out of a tree because he's jealous??? If Gene was a real person, he would be a total psycho. Lastly, no teenager would ever talk or think the way these characters do. This book makes me wonder what the heck kind of world John Knowles lives in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey! the stars only go down to 1! I'd give it a -100!","review":"If you have not read this book, take advice from a trusted friend. DON'T DO IT! The book is so boring that I fell asleep just looking at the cover.

I've read short stories that had a more intricate plot. Characters in Saturday morning cartoons have more depth. Intense, only for people get scared watching Disney movies. Symbolism are sure there is any? If you want symbolism read The Old Man and the Sea or The Pearl. While I was reading this I saw a Simpsons episode where Lisa Simpson says this book is at preschool reading level. A preschooler though might find it a bit below their intellectual level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well-developed","review":"I had high expectations for this book when it first started out. Take the beginning and the end and you have a pretty good story, but it seems to drag on into a meaningless void in the middle. Some people seem to love this book but it did not appeal to me. The characters did not seem very well developed, having one personality trait that was shown the entire length of the book. While Leper was supposed to be crazy, it seemed to me that all the characters were crazy, maybe more so than Leper was. The book was not realistic to me, appearing more like a painting that expresses only the outside than a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story about the conflicts and illusions about friendship","review":"The novel A Seperate Peace, an involved book, tells a story about the conflicts and illusions about friendship. Personally I hated the characters and the plot and by association I have come to hate john Knowles as well. If I set out to write a book I would at least try to make it interesting.

There was nothing redeeming whatsoever about this book. The plot is terribly implausible (a branch, strong enough to hold up two adolescent boys, can be \\"jounced\\"?) It made my head hurt. The wispy, long-winded language alienates the reader, making it even more impossible to read. By the end, I wanted to slug all the characters, the author, and maybe my English teacher for making me read it!

Well maybe he wrote something else that was good, but I don't intend to find out. If mentioning the Simpsons makes me sound like a moron I'd like to say I've enjoyed some Steinbeck, Rousseau, deMaupassant, Pirandello, & Tolstoy. All the \\"likeable\\" characters died or went insane. This is the worst excuse of a pseudo-intellectual mess I've ever read. I had to read it in High School, but there are better books out there for High Schoolers. So many in fact it's sad people assign this disturbing trash. However... I remember, it's been years, that some of my former classmates liked it so maybe it taps into something I'm not getting. Here's hoping I never do."},{"rating":"1","title":"TORTURE","review":"In school they made us read many boring books, but none of them were as irritating as this one.

Not only did the story run sour, but the plot seemed to start at the climax and work downhill from there. Also, the novel should be taught, but only to classes who like Knowles' work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Boring","review":"This book started off slowly and I patiently waited for it to get better. But the more I read, the more bored I got and I realized that I didn't care about anything that was happening in the novel. The writing was dull as well as the characters. Gene causing Finny to break his leg and all the stuff that happened after was less than thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmmmm........","review":"Personally, i enjoyed the book. I wouldn't but it but i would get it at a public library. I think it shows how some people are mistaken as someone there not. Gene thinks finny is out to get him , but actually, he's not. The book gives a lot of examples of life lessons. It shows that growing up isn't as easy as most people thought and looking back you may regret some of the decisions you made when you were young. The conflict between Finny and Gene will keep you intrested but guestioning about your relationships with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book","review":"I had to read this book for my 11th grade English class. When I was assigned the book I was not too excited. But then when I finally started to read the book I got really into it. This book is one of the best books that I have read in a while. I thought that this book was very easy and fun to read. The way that the story moves from scene to scene in the beginning is a good way to start out a good story. The main characters, Gene and Finny, are roommates with each other. Finny organizes a club during their summer session. And the rest of the book revolves around what happened that summer. If you want to read a good book, I suggest that you read this book \\"A separate peace\\", by John Knowles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dianiel","review":"To tell you the true, I didn?t like A Separate Peace that much atthe beginning, I couldn?t understand the point of it. It wasn?t until I have to make a research paper about it that I stared to like it, and understand it. The thing I like the most of it now is the way Knowles? explores the darker side of Gene?s and Finny?s friendship. From the beginning towards its very end you can see the transformation of Gene?s feelings, from insecurity to anger, to remorse and acceptance. You can never know what really happened to those teenagers because all the tension gathered inside of them because of a WWII just about to be unleashed at any time. The book really relates to us as teenagers as we are passing through this step of our lives. A separate peace is a great book, understandable, and beautifuly written. I recommend if you really want to know what teenager problems are."},{"rating":"2","title":"A child trying to decide who his real enemy is if it exists!","review":"It is an action book.You see every action and sympathy with the characters and even feel hatred towards them.The relationship between Finny and Gene is what the author describes.The setting he chose and all other details are superb.It personally is the best book I have EVER read.If you are emotional and love emotional books take a look at this review.If you love happy endings let me tell you something don't read this book.However if you want to see your tears runing thru your cheeks with such a fiction book you know what you have to do.It is very effecting and I infact think everybody should read it...Well i will be looking forward for your opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all-time.","review":"John Knowles has done all of us who wish to read great literature, a great service. This book was entertaining while at the same time conveying the deepest of lessons. As a new middle school teacher I can appreciate the tremendous job that Knowles did in capturing the contents of the hearts and minds of two complex youths."},{"rating":"2","title":"i LOVE this book","review":"i reread it for the 3rd time today. i first read it when i was in 8th grade and totally loved it then too, so i don't think this book is really targeted at any age level, but rather, at those who are emotionally ready to understand, no matter what their ages are. I think you have to have gone through certain aspects of life to really get what the novel is getting at. I loved this book when i was 13, but i understand it a lot better now that i'm 18. And i will always, always, be in love with Finny =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very depressing, boring, and not worth it.","review":"I hated this book. I was required to read it twice: in 8th grade and Freshman year and I hated it more with every page. High school boys don't think like that, they're not murderous crazy people they're boys. Knowles does not know what he is talking about. The writing is poor and the overall plot is boring and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!! Warning!!","review":"Do not read this book. It sux. This book can possible be the most superficial and the worst book that I've read so far in my life. Save your soul and don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I thought the characters were unrealistic, the dialog was unrealistic, and the whole book was just disjointed. I didn't like it. Not one bit. The author often went off on tangents that made no sense, or just plain ran around in circles. I'm sad my 8th grader is required to read this when there are so many other good books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no point in reading this.","review":"I had to read this book at school and it took me SO long to finish it because it was so boring. It's about a bunch of high school kids who are not realistic at all. The plot is pretty much whether or not the main character tried to kill his best friend by pushing him off a tree branch. I never really found out if he did try to kill him, which makes this a very pointless book to read... The people who love this book love it because of hidden meaning and other stuff English teachers always talk about. If you're like that you might like this book. For the rest of you, don't read this book. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I CAN'T STAND A SEPARATE PEACE","review":"I read \\"A Separate Peace\\" for school this past year. First off, the book didn't catch me from the start, which isn't a good sign when you're reading a book. The book is so unrealistic, but it seems like the author is trying really hard to be. For example, one of the main characters, Finny fell down and broke his leg, then broke the same leg again and died from it. All of the characters were dysfunctional, and weren't well defined at all. There was no concrete plot, and my entire class didn't like the book, or the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring book","review":"\\"A Separate Peace\\" was a book that I had to read for my summer reading list from school. The whole book was very descriptive and I guess original but the plot itself was extremely boring. I had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.. how did I ever finish this book?","review":"A Seprate Peace is extremely dull book. It has a nice plot, but it is ruined by the extreme details (we're talking about pages describing one thing) and a lot of metaphors. (And plus, my teacher ruined it even more by finding more obscure metaphors, such as Phineas is Gene and vice versa.) If they had been used more lightly, then the book would have been more of a pleasure to read. If you love details and metaphors, this book is for you. If not, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and Boring","review":"I understand it's supposedly a \\"classic\\" but I do not consider it to be one. A novel worthy enough to be studied in school and tested on, should be deeper than A Seperate Peace. Yeah, so it has a lot of symbolism. BIG DEAL. This book was horrible. I couldn't relate to the main character, because he was just nasty and unlikable. It has been commpared to the Catcher in the Rye, but it's nowhere near as poignant as that novel. (my fav btw). I love to read but this book was stupid and I got NOTHING out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Reader reviews range from 5 stars (MASTERPIECE) to 1 star ( TRASH). I come down at the 1 star level, but would not label it trash.Rather, I question the validity of the story line from beginning to end. If Knowles intended symbolism the obvious interpretation of the Cain and Abel story is so heavy handed as to be laughable.I lived through that period in time, at the age of the leading characters, who would now be in their seventies. Their attitude toward WW 2 is totally off base, and doesn't reflect the feelings of my contemporaries or me at that time.The falling from the tree premise is articial and strains credulity. As does many of the other devices used by the author.How this book achieved the status of a classic is a puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pathetic excuse","review":"I just finished reading this book for my sophomore honors English. I hated it. The book was well written and interesting, but depressing and sickeningly nostalgic. Gene is whiny and self centered, and hasn't changed a bit since the \\"accident\\". What a joke. John Knowles created a very likable, good character in Phineas, but you had better not get too attached to him. I'm awfully sick of disgusting \\"classics\\" such as this. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya love it or Ya hate it!!","review":"Warning: this book is boring (if you're an action type of person) I'm not into the dramatic parts of peoples lives, so that is why i didn't care for it. But for those who look to see the part of life that is past the common thoughts you'll love it. For those who HAVE TO read it for school, it will take sometime and you might just want to burn the book by the end of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I knew the book was used, but did not expect it to have writing on almost every page in the margins and a lot of highlighting and underlining....I thought it would be slightly used...disappointed in product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Wanted this book since we recently moved to NH and live near Exeter - where the prep school is based. Good quality, as expected. Great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not capture the attention of the reader. Yet, good plot","review":"I found A Seperate Peace to be a well written novel with an excellent plot. However, Knowles fails to capture the attention of the reader. Knowles uses a lot of symbolism, but too little action. This creates an excellent novel for those with little else to read. I would prefer to read something a bit more interesting. I would recommend this novel for those who are looking for a well written novel with lots of symbolism and forshadowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away, run far away","review":"Like many other helpless high school students, my English teacher forced me to read this book. It is the most pretentious piece of...words are insufficient to express my disgust. Why must we read garbage like this in school instead of truly great works by authors such as Hemingway and Twain? Answer: spineless teachers and parents. Screw 'em all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"I love this book! I read it for a summer reading novel, and completly fell in love.We see Gene travel back to the school that haunted his past. The place where a heavy burden he had carried for so long occured. This book travels through Gene's memories back to when he was in school, and his best friend was a vivacious kid named Phineas... or Finny.I'm not going to spoil the ending on this, or the mystery behind it, but I fell in love with this story. It had a deep meaning behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BoRiNg","review":"i dont think that this was a good book at all. i thought it was boring and i didnt understand it that well! of what i read anywayz! i thought that gene and phineas were crazy and i jus didnt like how things were put!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?!?!","review":"I recently had to read Of A Separate Peace, i found this book to be dull and uniteresting. This book was written about the 40's, which has no relation to me in this time. I generally like reading about war, but this book was horrible. The character werevery boring to read about, they way hey portrayed the characters just made the story worse. I wish i would have never read this book, and i want the time i spent reading this book back! Hopefully i will never have to read another book written by John Knowles, although i dont think any book can get as bad as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I know Mr. Knowles was trying to be all mysterious and intellectual, and I'm sure people will tell me that I just don't understand the meaning and the method to his madness, and the inner truth,etc. etc. But seriously how many different words can you use to describe BIG TREE or CRAZY SKITSO PARANOID GENE. I'm sorry if you all liked this book but it's just a bit much. I think the descriptions were 'nice' but there were way too many and the majority of them had nothing to do w/ the tiny bit of plot this story had. My real reaction to this book was Ugh ...I have to write an essay on this due tomorrow..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phineas Rising","review":"I read this book the summer between seventh and eighth grade, Just the name of this book invokes a kind of nostalgic sadness for the insanity that was my adolescence. I have had friendships that closely mirrored this situation and still haunt me. This book should be the present given to every boy and girl on their thirteenth birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for High School Kids","review":"I really liked this book when I read it recently, but I also read it in high school and found it tedious and uninteresting. I think this book is simply not a good match for most HS students, which is why there are so many negative reviews here from kids who had to read it for school. Teachers would do well to notice that and pick books kids are more likely to be able to \\"get into.\\" Otherwise, how will they ever love reading enough to pick up this classic as an adult and appreciate it for what it is?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Separate Peace Of Life","review":"This book is a classic in american literature and institutes the literary elements that are essential to strong story telling and enhancing the idea that the author wants to get across to the reader.During the story the characters have entered thoughts and feelings throughout the main plot and the story has been set up as being during a war and the story actually has nothing to do with the war and at the Devon school and the boys that lived there and set out to do good in their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"um... OK then","review":"OK, I know this book was supposed to be about a boy and his inner struggle with himself about his friend Finny but I found it so boring. Reading this book was like watching a soap opera. There were separate stories going on in one story. Everything was jumbled together into one really boring book. I've read many books and only one other that I've read bored me as much as this one did, that book being The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemmingway. That book has about as much plot and action as A Separate Peace. A man goes back to his favorite school, man has a flash back about a particularly bad summer, man leaves school. But all in all I guess the book does get a rating of \\"2\\" due to all the imagery and the way the book was written. And I guess, because the book does deserve some credit, that it was an OK book to read if you have an extra 2 hours on your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seperate Peace","review":"I absolutely enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. A Separate Peace is a book that takes you back to a time when you perhaps were jealous of a certain friend or even reminds you of that friend you are still envious of. This book takes place in Devon, where Gene is jealous of his best friend Phineas. Phineas seems to be the one kid in your school that is popular and most athletic. Phinny could also be described as always looking for something fun to do. Gene however is a kid that is into his studying. The story is told through Gene's eyes and takes place during World War II. This book shows the realities all of us can face daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's a title?","review":"I thought this book was interesting. I liked the way that it used flashbacks in order to tell the story. I am also glad that it placed the story while a real war was going on since there was a private war going on between two of the characters. It is a good book for anyone who has ever been envious of a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic? That is debateable","review":"The book is written very well, and the author is not as terrible as he may be given credit to. But the book only lacks in one area... Entertainment value. I was required to read this book for an English class, but did find it to be interesting, just not entertaining at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book wasn't a real winner in my opinion","review":"I didn't really like the book. I had to read it for my sophomore advanced english class also, and maybe it was the way we analyzed EVERYTHING, but I dreaded having to read it. I think that the 2 rivers should have just been 2 rivers... meaning I don't think there should have been symbolism in every little detail and you shouldn't have had to read everything 3 or 4 times to get the entire meaning that Knowles was going for. I just didn't like it. Sorry if you disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmmm...","review":"I read the book for my sophomore advanced English class, and it seemed to drag on and on with boring unnecessary details. I found the implied homosexual attitudes of Gene and Finny amusing, but I found that the only segments of the book that really interested me were the ones involving physical or emotional pain. (If you didn't notice the subtle hints of Gene & Finny's homosexuality, go back through the book and look for them -they're pretty evident."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was well written, but boring.","review":"I think it was kind of boring, because it did not have much action in it. It was very dramatic. So if you like drama you might like it. I don't really like drama too much, so it wasn't one of my favorites. Although I thought it was very well wriiten and had many great themes. I also think it had great charachter development. I recommend it highly for those who like drama, but for those who like action try to avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"We read this book in my English class last year and it's pretty good. It's about 2 friends at a boarding school. They're total opposites. One is the typical jock type and the other is the typical intelligent type. Somehow, the 2 roomates end up being best friends. Well, this friendship leads to tragedy, when one of them falls from a tree. Later, there is even more tragedy when he dies. This story is told from the point of view of the surviving roommate. I seriously would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read good classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Separate Peace is a tale of growing up","review":"Two boys struggle with maturity and growing up in John Knowles A Separate Peace. Phineas will do anything for his best friend Gene. Gene feels threatened by Phineas affability though. These feeling lead to Gene causing Phineas to fall from a tree and shattr the bone in his leg. This break leads to Phineas ultimate death. I found this book very enlightening of the teenage mind and mentality. John Knowles insight on the teenage mind would have led me to believe he still was one, if it had not been for his developed but efficient writing style. The story and the writing made this book very enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illustrates the conflict and guilt contained in a friendship","review":"In A Separate Peace, John Knowles illustrates jealousy and conflict in its cruelest form through the friendship of two high school students. Knowles evelops the character extremely well by describing an inner hatred contained in the narrator. I enjoyed A Separate Peace for its reality and description of life during World War II. A separate peace did not contain much \\"action.\\" However, I believe that I enjoyed the book for its subtle conflict and symbolism throughout the story. The author used the characters to show how bitter a friendship can be. The book impacted me in many ways and I recommend A Separate Peace to anyone interested in the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Separate Peace","review":"This book is very moving.The story of the two best friends that have their friendship end the way it did can make tears in your eyes. The end was very surprising, I totally didn't expect it. The conversations that Finny and Gene have. The feelings that are described bit by bit. It all makes the story more interesting and sad. I recommend this book to everyone. It kind of complicated but, still, it's awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Up the One-Star Reviews Everyone!","review":"God willing, perhaps our words will reach the Board of Education and they'll FINALLY see how bad and useless this book really is!

I must say that it was torture and I had to force myself to even finish the thing. I have read hundreds of books in my life and this was by far the worst. The characters didn't even seem like they were human and it felt like they were devoid of emotion. Gene seemed kinda psychotic and unfeeling throughout the entire book and I am still trying to find the point of the whole thing. I think the pacing was bad and nothing interesting happens throughout the entire book. Also the characters do not feel realistic and the whole thing just felt wrong. Totally unrealistic the whole way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"i could give it a big fat \\"0\\"","review":"Terrible book, Terrible Plot, No substance, nearly retarted.

And (to be honest) I don't really like it either.It is the story of Finny and Gene--two sixteen-year-old boys in a private school in New England. Gene knocks Finny from a tree early in the novel, leaving the reader several questions: Why did Gene do it? Does Finny know Gene did it? What does the tree symbolize? What is the relationship between the school and WWII? Why is this young-adult classic putting me to sleep?This isn't a bad novel for a kid, but I would suggest that anyone with above a 5th-grade reading level stay away from it--unless you are having trouble sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"I am a 16-year-old sophomore and I just finished A Separate Peace for English.

A Separate Peace barely had a plot. I bet no one will agree with me. But this book had bad writing, and was not interesting to read. It was definitely not a page-turner. My english teacher has been telling the class that when we write anything, we have to have an opening sentence that grabs the reader's attention. NOTHING in this book makes me want to keep reading. Yes, I had to read this for my english class, and yes, I had to write an essay about symbolism, blah blah blah. So that probably made me hate the book even more. But I would never read this if I didn't have to. Speaking of symbolism, can't the author just write a good book without having all those deep meanings embedded in the.. well.. \\"plot\\"?

However, well to put it bluntly...this book was retarded. The book was confusing and the plot really wasn't that great. I don't understand why people like it so much. Honestly, in my opinion, I think that schools could stretch their reading curriculum. Just because it was a \\"great novel of it's time\\" doesn't mean that other stuff isn't written as well.

I just wanted to say that when reading this I was thinking, I hope that all the books we read in high school arn't going to be this bad. The language in this novel was so boring. There was no action. I couldn't stand reading this book. I never really finidhed reading the book but we discussed it in class. Let me just tell you from the start, buy the cliff notes. I was lucky enough to get them and pass my final essay about the novel with a 95! Wooo Hoo! But let me tell you that this book is booring, unentertaining, and pointless! What kind of person would do some of the things that Gene did! It has no relistic meaning to it. My english teacher some how thought that this book was good. So to end it briefly, Stay far far far away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A definate yawner","review":"This book is extremely boring. I am not A.D.D but all I read through the whole book was blah blah blah .... phineas... blah blah blah. Maybe this book related to teens back when it was written, but not anymore. I do not know any seventeen year old boys who are sooo infatuated with their best friend that its like they are in love with them. Sometimes I start to feel sick while reading this book! It is sooo boring it makes me want to weep. Anyway, if you ever have to read it for school, Happy reading... err... sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELL NO","review":"I was assigned to read this book for summer reading.

The author's writing ability is nowhere near even reasonable and the plot is practically nonexistant.

I highly reccomend that no one should ever buy this book and if anyone has it, they should throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is a Classic. Every Kid Should Read This Book","review":"I remember reading this in high school and I loved it. The story and characters are unforgettable.

The plot is kind of a shabby one but it is central to this story (though I feel that WW2 is more of a central issue in the story). This book isn't as exciting as the cover makes you think but it is a good read and it teaches some good lessons about friendship"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a very good novel, that many people young and old may identify with if they have ever felt in anyone's shadow. However, despite its poignancy, I do not feel that it is a great novel, and I can't really think of the words to say why, as is sometimes the case when trying to explain the difference between good and great. Maybe it just doesn't have the je ne sais quoi. Others may find it excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A high school horror","review":"The author's prose style is belabored, the dialogue is stilted, and the characters are one-dimensional. The symbolism is not woven into the story gracefully; instead, the author hits you over the head with it like a hammer. There are plenty of better choices for high school reading lists. Evidently, educators believe that if any enjoyment can be gleaned from the reading experience, it cannot be good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This book was a high school essay project. It was a pleasant surprise since it turned out to be a good story and enjoyable reading. There was so much depth to ponder for a good essay it even held the teenagers attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brillant book","review":"A Separate Peace is a brillant book that seems so simple in its context, but yet is so deep in its meaning. The reader gets the oppurtunity to take a close look at the relationships and feelings of teenage boys as they change due to experiences and time. Throughout the novel, Gene, the main character, discovers a lot about himself and in the end he figures out his true feelings concerning his best friend Finny, which ultimatly helps Gene to discover himself and leads to his achievement of a separate peace. I have no doubt in my mind that this book will fully interest any reader; those who like simplicity in their reading and those who like to look for the deep meanings in a book. This book shows that in order for one to be happy, they must first accept themselves, long before anyone else can appreciate them and accept them. This book is not only entertaining but is also full of life lessons that one may take away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sad, boring, but meaningful and in-real life sitaution","review":"you may think that this book is boring when you read this novel. it is boring. i read this book when i was in my 10th grade for honors english. i had this novel for summer reading. i didn't really thought about how this book would have such a meaning as like what happens to real and ordianry boys in the high school years.this book has something to say about friendship, competition, and love. i am agreeing to say that this has no climax, but it has deep meanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading - And Not Just For School","review":"I was not familiar with this book until I was assigned it as part of my freshman (high school) English class. The elements usually praised in literature aren't necessarily what make this book worthwhile. The beginning is slow and the end rather abrupt. But between the beginning and ending is a complete story that really makes you think. Cliches such as character development and life-altering experiences apply to A Separate Peace but do not adequately describe it. A few ordinary teenage friends. World War II. Hidden jealousy and spitefulness. A Separate Peace is a great book to read and discuss for English class, but it is even better to consider for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good story buoyed by great writing","review":"While I didn't find this story to be the best, I found Knowles writing to be excellent. Filling the book with descriptions that are vivid, interesting and unique dialogue and believable characters made a story that was overall just okay a very interesting read. What I found lacking and always do in these types of books, is the believability of certain aspects of the characters maturity. Sexuality while mentioned in passing is much more important to any boy this age. While the events that unfold in this book may put this on the backburner, the idea that our protaginist could be in love with his best friend Finn, if fully realized, would have made this novel much more interesting. Overall a great book which I would have my kids read if I was a teacher. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes American literature and is trying to read the canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adolescent classic","review":"A Separate Peace is a timeless tale of conflicting adolescent emotions. The pull that Gene, the main character, feels between devoted friendship and envy is painfully brillant. The imagery in this novel is very vivd as well. Everyone should read this book at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book scared me.","review":"Phineas was like this some kind of Greek God; he was athletic, beautiful and very noble. It scares me to think that jealousy can destroy all this. This book made me face a realistic side of human nature that I don't like to gaze upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring Consequences --A Pertinent Subject for Teens Today","review":"My 9th-grade students have just finished reading this novel, and I can't begin to describe the wonderful and thought provoking discussions that we were able to have about the relevant issues and questions it raises and explores. Although the characters are resurrected from Knowles' own life, and the book is situated in a distinct historical moment, the experiences of the teenagers in this novel are seemingly timeless. My own students were able to relate directly to the array of feelings and situations that the characters encounter, and, I believe, as a result have come to a better understanding of themselves. Who can ask for more from literature?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try a little harder!","review":"I think the person that gave this book 1 star would have liked the book better if they had tried to comprehend the characters feelings. Just imagine young people going through all those changes in their lives. ( the war, adolescence, etc. ) I think the way they were portrayed was very realistic and intruiging. You learned how different people reacted differently to the war and how it affected everything they thought and did. Even to make them question the loyalty of their friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pimped out Review","review":"A classic I would recommend to another person is A Separate Peace by John Knowles. The story is about two friends who go to the same boarding school. It tells about their problems between each other, their family, and with themselves. I think this book is good because it deals with problems that could really happen to you. For example, one person didn't believe in him. He finally decided to go because he believed in himself and realized that he had to believe in himself. I also think it was interesting to find out what would happen to the characters, as they went their separate ways. If you like books that have a lot to do with real problems that could happen to you, I recommend you read A Separate Peace by John Knowles."},{"rating":"1","title":"a seprate peace","review":"A SEPERATE PEACE well i personally dont like this book, it switches around on the things the writer is feeling and what he is writing about. it does have a littlebit of action but not much it at parts keeps you interested but not as much as most would like. i feel this book is a book for older people or people whole like boring books. it is a shame that phineas doesdie at the end oops i gave it away. its not a book that you would want to read if your into action and all that good stuff. i sugjest you read this book it is good but I personally do not like this book,but also thats my opinion . teachers i think it is a good book if you are talkin about the war because it talks about things you do in wars and things you did do . it has a wide variety of vocabulary . it is a good book for a class but as one i do not like the book. peace Melissa B."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring all talk book.","review":"It really bit hard, the best action in the book was when Finny fell out of the tree. If you are an emotional women who wants to cry or have someone to feel sorry for, then this is a good book but if you are a guy who likes action and hates to fall asleep while reading, than this book, like I said, \\"Really bites hard.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful, Well-Constructed Tragedy","review":"After all these years, still a very spare, incredibly well-constructed little tragedy, with some of the most beautifully written sentences in modern American literature. Perhaps just a TAD too formulaic, but the book's literary beauty and emotion impact make that a matter of small consequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy this at all, I read it for school.","review":"I can honestly say that I strongly disliked this book, but it still wasn't a full-on hate. This was a required read for English this year and I suffered through this book for a long 2 weeks. The first 4 or five chapters were very boring and slow with only a few exciting sentences. I prayed every few pages that the book would get inriguing soon, but it never happened! To me the most exciting part was when Gene got the telegram from Bobby stating that Leper had run away from the army. Something that really annoyed me with this book was how Gene had this creepy obsession with Finny and followed what ever he said. Gene had NO personality whatsoever so it just added to the dullness of the book. I did however like the theme of the novel. I would not recommend this book to anybody unless you are most uninteresting person I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhh","review":"This book was not very good. I do not understand why Gene would try and turn a great friendship into some kind of war. Finny never knew that Gene even felt that way. Finny did not feel that way towards Gene at all. Even when Gene confessed to hurting Finny on purpose because of jealousy, Finny refused to believe. I do not like this book because it does not symbolize what a real friendship should be like. I understand that everyone was going through hard times because of the war, but friends should stay close during hard times. They should not turn against each other. This was a bad thing that Gene could do to his best friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It&#65533;s been done before","review":"The story of a struggle between friends is almost a cliché. It seems that authors use this topic if they just need to put another book out on the shelf. The main character, Gene, wallows in his own self-pity so much that it made me wish that I could punch him in the face. The only good part of the book was the character Phineas. He was full of imagination and tried to make the best of the war, World War II. He even made Gene forget about the war and train for the 44' Olympics. There are books out there that have much better story lines and have a better impact on the reader than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced to read","review":"Last year (grade 9) this book was required to read. I am not a huge fan of reading books my high school supplied because [I don't like] the majority of them .... Anyways, I thought I would give this book a try, like I always do because I am a major fan of reading, and unlike most of my classmates I actually read the book, and it was very very hard. I do not recommend this book to anyone, but im sure lots of people like it, lol seeing as not everyone has the same opinion as I (Really?? j/k) so, read it if you are interested, but I found it long and boring.

I was prepared to get my Zero with pride, but I thought maybe it would get a little better, I was wrong. The characters were fake, the plot was awful. Worst of all, the forgiving scene was impossible. when you hear that you know whats going to happen from then on, you dont need to read it any longer.Unfortunately I, like Gene *mutters* WANT that A. I need that A, so I read it through and now I am reviewing it with as much honesty as I can. the only character I almost liked was Leper, and that was because I felt sorry for him.If you have to read it, my condolenses, if you want to read a slow dull book, go right ahead and pick it up as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. The only reason i continued to the end was because this was a required reading for an Honors English class.

Okay, then does _A Separate Peace_ make up with deep characterizations and beautiful style. No. The style is techinically perfect, but lacks any verve. The characters are lame. The 16 year olds act like annoying 13 year olds. Gene is immature and I wouldn't bet money on his heterosexuality. Phineas is an idealized best friend as oppose to a character who is realistic. Everyone else is a stereotype (the smart, nerdy kid, the jock who is a jerk etc)...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that forces you to grow and take a deeper look.","review":"I was introduced to this book because of an English Honors reading assignment. I originally just checked it out at our school library, but I ended up buying it before I was finished reading it. After just a few chapters I knew I had to own this book. \\"A Seperate Peace,\\" ended up being my favorite book and I was totally wrapped up in it while reading it. Since then I have read it several more times and it is always just as magical. This book is about friendship and hidden jealousy. I fell in love with the character of Phineas and felt as if I totally understood everything Jean was going through as I read. Read this book! It changes the way you look at things especially yourself and forces you to take a stronger look at the things hidden within yourself. -Dan Vincent '98"},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfied","review":"i just recently read a separate peace in my freshman english class. it is one of my favorite books if not the best. i related this book very much to the catcher in the rye, another book high on my list of faves. i seriously recommend this book for peoples of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Separate Peace\\"","review":"This book, \\"A Separate Peace,\\" is one of the worst books I have ever read. I can honestly say that I could not understand the concept and the book to me was very hard to understand. I would actually recommend finding another book to read. The only good chapters in this book were the second and the eleventh. I am just trying to be honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was rather exhilirating","review":"I think that the book \\"a Seperate Peace\\" is a good book. It takes place in a setting similar to those of any school out in the country, which happen to have the priviledge of attending. The whole story is based around a relationship between the two main characters, Gene anf Finny, and there athletic and mental pursuits to out do each other. It is a good book, with lots of symbolism; a good book for anyone looking for a book about a relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still hear Phineas' crutches on the stairs.","review":"This book contains a number of surprises that keep the reader engaged. It is also narrated by a boy named Gene, who the reader gets to know inside and out. He shares his personal insecurities with the reader such that he becomes a very real person, with trials and triumphs that will make you gasp in fear or sigh with relief as the plot unfolds. The other main character, Phineas, is one of those people who appears to be successful at everything he does. Gene gets jealous of this. The reader though, is distant enough to know that Phineas is far from perfect and as I read the story I was hoping that Gene would figure that out a little sooner than he did. I give five stars to this book for the realistic portrayal of the two main characters, who continue to interact in my head long after the story has ended.P.S. I think they've got the wrong date on this title. My copy is from 1967 and it is the eighth printing. The copyright and first printing is dated 1959."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book to force kids to read.","review":"This has to be one of the most depresing books I have ever read. Basically nothing good happens the entire time and the main character has some serious head problems.. While this book might provide an interesting look into the thought patterns of an adolescent male, I do not see why it is hailed as a classic by our literary society.The best thing I found about the book was that it was short. If I had been forced into spending much more time on this piece, I do not think I would have finished it. If high school teachers want to influence kids to enjoy reading, there are much better books than this one (Ender's Game, The Belgariad, to name a couple). I think a major reason that lots of young people are convinced that they hate reading is because they were forced into reading \\"intellectual\\" books like this one in school. A bad practice I say."},{"rating":"2","title":"The evils of youth","review":"Like William Gerald Goling or J.D. Salinger, John Knowles has used mere boys to explore serious themes in this classic novel. Gene, an isolated honor student forges a friendship with his roomate, the sly, charismatic Phineas. Although they are very different, a rivalry and subconscious spite developes between the boys until a boiling point reaches in Gene, causing an action he will be analyzing for the rest of his life. The backdrop of WWII America is perfect for a book which so subtely explores the themes of evil, jealousy and guilt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left to the Imagination","review":"I read John Knowles's A Separate Peace as an assignment for my tenth grade English class. Overall I thought the book was very good. Knowles describes each setting and background to the smallest detail. However, he doesn't go into great detail when describing the main events of the story. He doesn't put a concrete image in your mind about what happened between Gene and Finny on then limb of the tree. While most people would say that Gene purposefully jounced the limb to knock Finny off, I don't believe that he jounced the limb at all. I think that Finny just lost his balance and fell. This is why I like the book so well; different people can interpret the information that John Knowles gives us in different ways. You should read the book and see what you think about the scene on the tree between Gene and his best friend Finny. Knowles truly leaves it to your imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seperate Peace","review":"John Knowles discusses adolescence and friendship in a way I have never seen before, this book has truly a had a positive impact on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring novel","review":"A Separate Peace is by far my favorite book. This story of friendship demonstrates the consequences of jeaulosy and the admirable quality of forgiveness. Although the story is set in all male boarding school and there are no female characters, I, being a girl, nonetheless find the story interesting and inspirational. I would recommend it to any young adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most compelling stories about a boys maturation","review":"If you like symbolizm, well written literature, or the story of a boys maturation during World War II, this book is a must read. Knowles style allows the reader to become part of the book and forces the reader to make judgements about the characters. It is a well written book and a must read for anyone who likes movies such as \\"Dead Poets Society\\" or \\"School Ties\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the book...","review":"One of the most wonderfull novels ever written. I read this novel for the first time as my grade 9 English assignment. I re-read it for my grade 10 ISU, i did the same for grade 11 and 12.

It wasn't the type of book that I normally like to read. But when I started it, it was hard to put down. It was a strange, mysterious, sad book. It was also made for great discussion. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friends and enemies","review":"Like too many of the classics taught in American junior high and high schools, this one again deals with relationships between young males in an all-male setting. This time the setting is a private school in the New England countryside prior to WWII. Two friends, Gene and Phineas, face the rigors of school together and form a bond that will last their lives. One day however, in an adventure climbing trees, Gene shakes the branch Phineas is on, plunging him down to the ground where he is crippled. Later, a confrontation ensues between them induced by the words of others. The confrontation leads to Phineas breaking his leg, and dying in the ensuing medical procedure. Gene recalls these events as an adult later on with regret, trying to understand whether he did what he did out of malice, jealousy, hatred, etc... He, and the book comes to the conclusion that part of growing up is recognizing the evil within one self, and how controlling it is part of maturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of books...","review":"To say the least. I really don't know why the people who come up with high school English curriculums insist on reading books like this. There are so many better books that still fall under the \\"classics\\" category. I mean seriously, what high school kid enjoys reading Great Gatsby? No one, because these books are just plain stupid. Uninteresting, pointless plots, these \\"coming of age\\" novels are so overrated in makes me furious. So if you're not a high school kid and thinking about reading this just for pleasure, think again. It would be more pleasureable to break your kneecaps with a sledge hammer.So why did I give it 2 stars? Well, it was pretty funny when Finny fell out of the tree (although it was unintentional humor). And of course any time you have a character named \\"Leper\\" in a book, it's instant comedy. Especially when he goes insane.But other than that the book sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K.","review":"This book is not apropriate for the current times and was very dry.

I don't understand why it's a standard requirement in US high schools. The narrator is an adult looking back at his prep school days; it is written from an adult point of view and, I believe, should be viewed as adult literature. The lovely writing comprises poetical descriptions and subtle characterizations that are beyond the grasp of kids. No wonder so many are bored by this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"This book was not that great, certainly it may have been written with decent style and may have an excellent plot but I failed to see what the entire story was about. Finny falls from tree, Gene feels guilty... and the point is? Look, this book nearly put me to sleep everytime I tried flipping a few pages and I have read the 1000 Page Book called \\"Red Storm Rising\\", and it didn't put me asleep. Maybe I should stick with Clancy's Books but it was a pity that my English teacher assigned me to read the book. Christ, I can read 1000 Pages and can't read 250 or whatever it was.. and in some aspects the characters seem to be homosexuals, because they seem truely attached to one and each other or there seems to be some kind of secret relationship we don't know about.

Irony in this book was semi-interesting. The Characters were hardly developed, in my opinion. The jock and the brains as friends may funny, but it would never happen. The Death of Finny was far expected from the beginning of the book. If he doesn't have his sports to keep him busy he doesn't have anything to do that he is very good at. Sports were his prodigal purpose in life.

The only part I understood and liked was when Gene shook the tree and Phineas fell out and broke both legs. As for the rest of the book read it when you have trouble sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids still have to read this?","review":"I had to read this book in high school, and I hated it. These characters live in a world that most people can't relate to, including someone such as myself who grew up poor in the south. These New England prep schools are places where the wealthy such as the Kennedys go to hang out with other rich people, and the whole scene just makes me want to puke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful piece of literature","review":"Where to begin? This is one of those life changing books. It will make you question yourself, as any good piece of writing should.There's so many different themes in this work it's hard to sum it all up. It tackles the question of human nature, good and evil.Both the good and evil of human nature is shown. It's simply a must read.Personally, it's one of those books that I learn something new about it everytime I read it. Thank God my 8th grade English teacher put this on my reading list, otherwise I may never have come across this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Separate Peace","review":"I just read the book A Separate Peace by John Knowles.

There are many fine books students should read in High School: Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbirg, MacBeth, Iron and Silk, and Lord of the Flies to name a few.

Ugghh. The book is disgusting and morbid, the ending idiotic. Finny understands why Gene pushed him and accepts it!!!??? These aren't really people. This story is just a blatant rip off of the Cain and Abel story with some stupid, unecessary twists and characters who's motivations are obscure if not unlikely. Hardly as good as any one want's it to be. Read something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Say: BORING?","review":"I found this book to be incredibly boring and pointless. The author goes into topics that I believe he knows little about and therefore cannot understand. Also, there is way too much detail. When you write many pages describing something insignificant and unimportant, face it, you have a problem. To tell you the truth, if I could have given this book zero stars I would have. Those who classify this book as a \\"classic\\" definately overestimate it. Sorry John."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say? I gave it one star.","review":"ok, I can understand how this book could be interesting if maybe someone else had written it or something. I was FORCED to read this stupid book for english. Well, I liked Finny. I think he was a victim of a messed up, crazy \\"friend\\" who just decided one day that Finny was conspiring against him. Gene may have been a good student, but he was a screwed up kid, not the brightest crayon in the box, you know? Leper was a little scary, but not as scary as Brinker Hadley. He thought he owned the world and everything in it. He need help. Anyway, if John Knowles supposedly put himself in all four of the main characters, I'm hoping the majority of himself was in Finny, because, if not, he's messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh So Boring","review":"I was forced to read this book and it really didn't keep my attention. There were just some parts in that book that were unecessary. I think Gene was really paranoid and probably needed psychiatric help and so did Brinker. I actually liked Finny, he was a poor innocent victim in this book who was subjected to a bunch of freaks. Overall the book was uneventful and I pity anyone who has to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"Extremely Overrated. The book's writing is clumsy; the characters and the plot twists are fluff; the whole crafting of the novel is horribly unclever. It has no redeeming features whatsoever.

I want to review this as many times as I can so I can bring the three and a half star rating down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one horror of English Class","review":"I'm a sophomore who was required to read this novel over summer vacation. Sorry to say, but from the first page to the last, I had an extremely hard time keeping my eyes open. I consider this a very short novel, but it took me more than a week to finish it. Also, I found this story quite hard to understand. The characters seem very drab and don't have much of a personality. I had to write an essay on what I learned from this book, but nothing came to mind. It was a completely waste of my time. I've read much longer, but interesting books in two days. This boring book caused me to procrastinate and I still don't get the main point of this novel. Anyways, thank you for reading my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great book!","review":"This novel is an excellent piece of literature and evoked various emotions. Knowles did an outstanding job using versimilitude. It made me feel as if I was close friends with the characters. When Gene punched Quakenbush, I felt like it was my fist and my own revenge. I also shared the guilt with Gene about having jounced the branch and causing his broken leg. The two main themes of this novel were friendship and the struggle between good and evil. Even though there were struggles in Gene and Finny's relationship, Gene always kept a part of himself for Finny like when he felt he gave a part of himself to Finny. This teaches that friendship is complex, but it can always be maintained. Good and evil were present in everyone and they coexist. This is the way life really is. This was an interesting book and I suggest it to English classes all over the world. Kelly and Allison"},{"rating":"2","title":"Separate Peace: Don't pass up the chance to read this novel!","review":"After being designated this book for our sophomore Honors English class, we read and discussed this great novel in depth. Our opinion is this is a well written and an enticing book. Many themes are threaded throughout the novel and it portrays a emotional insight on life. One reason which strongly influenced our liking of this book is the character Finny. Finny's care free attitude towards life and his ability to like everyone for who they are, are a few examples of someone we would cherish as our own friend. Whether an adolescent or a grown adult, we recommend this book for anyone who wants to relate or relive a teenage friendship.

I recently read Remembering the Good Times by Peck and I simply can't resist drawing a similarity between the two books. In fact, because the tone/style is so similar, I was somewhat able to predict the ending of Separate Peace halfway through the book. Nevertheless, it's a wonderful book. It's a story about the friendship between two boys. One is a bit on the envious side and hurts the other, who later on either ignores or forgive his confession. (Some psychological analysis may be inserted here, but I won't go into that.) In any case, I'm personally attracted to the character Phineas, whom the book describes/shows as a very charming fellow. The style in general makes me want to read the rest of John Knowles's books. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I don't know, I really enjoyed this book. I guess some books are for boys and some are for girls, this one is truly for boys. Although, if you are in bargain for a great read, you should read this one, regardless. Maybe it's because this book just spoke to me, for some reason, and that's why I like it, I don't know. I truly suggest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This book is about World War II and how it affected high school boys. Some people find Gene, the main character, to be too self-absorbed. To me, this shows lack of understanding. Gene was struggling to keep up with the extroverted and handsome Phineas, his best friend. As Gene struggles with his deep jealousy, he is slowly consumed by the war. In an act of resentment, Gene causes Phineas to hurt himself and be banned from sports. This was devastating to Phineas, and Gene must live with his dark secret..."},{"rating":"2","title":"High school life","review":"A Separate Peace is a wonderful novel based on high school boys during World War II. This book is especially good for young readers since it focuses on boys of the age of 16. The characters in the book expierence iner-conflicts with themselves and conflicts with other characters that they don't know how to control.

Finny is the typical egotistical Jock so he had itcoming to him for getting gene to do all of those things like skip school and go to the beach , which in the long run caused him to fail his trigonometry test. If it was me I would have also shook the branch!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The first 50 pages of this book set up what could have been a great story. Gene admired Finny--almost to the point of worshiping him. Over the summer session at school, though, he realized that Finny felt threatened by him. Although Finny was the gifted sportsman, he knew that Gene also had athletic talent. And he knew that Gene was the superior intellect. Finny knew that Gene was \\"one better\\" than him. This set up a conflict that I expected to build to explosion over the summer. Instead, an innocent prank turned the course of the story and it was difficult to tell where the author was going. Clearly Gene was responsible for the accident, and because he didn't confess, I expected the new course to follow the tension that was bound to build until he was exposed. Instead, the story was more a chronicle of the school year--friendships formed, subjects studied, and plans for military enlistment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Honest and Beautifully Tragic Novel","review":"John Knowles is a genius! His use of the seemingly unimportant details to reveal the many smaller philosophies, which are all connected to the book's broader meaning, makes this novel a masterpiece. Though he reminds me a little of Golding, Knowles has his own brilliant method of writing which surpasses many others I have read. He provokes thought like Socrates through his often overlooked comparisons, asking us what we think of it all. There are many tributaries leading off of the book main philosophical vein, a vein of black but pretty matter. The section where Gene feels ghostly unattached to his surroundings while walking brings to mind the Smashing Pumpkins' song \\"Blank Page\\". The final comparison of youth to the military jeeps makes one go \\"aha!\\" in a strangely passive way. 5 stars! Never a boring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was well written and easy to get into","review":"It was a good book and actually made me shed a tear towards the end the characters were playful and the script was well written thankyou for your wonderful job writting it!

Nevertheless, this book had real meaning: it was outstandingly interesting. Knowles effectively managed to wield the English language to create a wonderful prose and an ingenius parable. Read this book, it will really surprise you (and, many books I have read I found to be boring and predictable--this was not one of them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.

It was twisted, perverted, and evil. Is this supposedly a book about friendship?!?!? Any feelings of love or caring were lost on me, at least on Gene's part. The ending was more than disturbing and I hated it! A selfish, despicable \\"accident\\" robbed wonderful, talented Phineas of the life that was rightfully his. (Perhaps this novel would have been easier to swallow if there had not been a feeble pretence of friendship. Even worse, there seems to be an effort for the reader to empathize with Gene.

I still wonder if I got some pirated version. The video transfer was terrible as if done by some cheap hack: colors are erratic and the image shifts around.

Paro, played deflty and amazingly by the ever beautiful Aishwarya Rai is his neighbor of slightly lower caste. The story revolves around the tragic love of these two characters and the love of Chandramukhi (played by Madhuri Dixit), whom Devdas inadvertently meets while trying to drown out his sorrow over losing Paro. EVERYBODY, Indian or not, MUST see this film. The acting is incredible, the sets and costumes beyond breathtaking, the background score simply perfect, the musical numbers placed appropriatley to mesh completely with the film, and the direction flawless.

This is particularly annoying, since it's the only Bollywood film of the three I purchased in this batch to be soo poorly encoded. Some scenes are almost unwatchable.2) The opining is loaded with ads and trailers, like one expects only on a cheap rental, not a retail DVD product.3) The \\"Special Features\\" DVD lacks subtitles, and some of the key interviews are in Hindi, hence useless for English-speakers. Even some of the English-fluent actors throw in Hindi phrases, perhaps when they can't quickly come up with appropriate English phrases for local customs and characteristics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring on the small screen","review":"I watched this with friends who swore the film shines of the big screen. It just seemed boring, repetitive and the music was just OK. The acting was hilariously, painfully bad at times. I think it could be engrossing on the big screen, but only if you are hard core into traditional Bollywood films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, terrible DVD","review":"I've already seen the film, on Amazon on Demand, and it's a stunningly beautiful classic, as everyone else points out. The visuals on this film are the selling point. But this DVD is a bad copy of a video copy and looks like an old VHS tape. Not worth it. T's also odd that the two disc set ius described as an -on-demand copy, but this one isn't, which is why I paid a bit more for it. Trust me, it's just another lo-grade dupe disc, probably produced on demand.Great film, though. An essential Bollywood classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devdas - great movie but poor quality DVD","review":"I loved this movie but the quality of this DVD is very poor... at times I wondered if someone had set up a tripod in a movie theater to record it. Very dark/blurry and pixels freezing/slow to catch up. Also the subtitling at times didn't match or were absent. Not worth returning given postage to send back would cost more than the price of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devdas (2 Disc Set)","review":"I paid 18 dollars for this movie and when I received it... I can't believe it the DVD's are COPYS. I don't know what happened here. But I'm really desappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bollywood Gold Mine","review":"To call 'Devdas' a lavish production is the understatement of the decade. This is the epitome of 'over the top'. However, all is not materialistic. The narrative is well told, the music is excellent and the cultural information conveyed is extensive indeed. Westerners are likely to find that the narrative takes a long time to move forward, but in this case patience is rewarded. Another slight problem for me: the 2 lead actresses look similar, both breathtakingly beautiful. But if you care to see one recent Bollywood film, this is a good choice. I look foward to seeing it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wee bit of a let down","review":"This movie was a wee bit of a let down.The subject matter was your typical Hindi movie and included subjects which most Hindi movies choose to stay away from - whores and charlitans.I was disappointed with Shah Rukh Kahn as he was intoxicated most of the movie.A movie to say 'I've seen' but not one I would recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw It In The Deep Blue Sea","review":"\\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" or \\"Three Hours to Kill\\" had been much better, more literal titles for \\"Devdas.\\" The overlong film is literally all flash and no substance.

When i received the DVD from this company I come to discover the terrible quality of it. It is as if it is a pirated copy. Terrible video quality along with poor audio.

Yet i only watched 1. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. A friend of mine whom i really hate, started talking about Hindi movies. And since i saw one, i used the names of the superstars to brag about it. And then i was 'forced' to watch DEVDAS. such a stupid name. Fine. Lets get this over with.My frown slowly turned into a smile as the first song blasted the halls of the living room. The show was the best i've seen. And the ending... i found it sadder than the TITANIC only because PARO was screaming 'DEVDAS' and then... Go see it.Honestly, its the only reason that i am now hunting for a movie better than it. It also brought great friends together.I rate it 4/5. Since i want to give it an honest and fair review.

Bansali has done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic sensual overload","review":"This was one of the biggest blockbusters in India of all time. It is also immensely popular outside of India.Apparently the plotline is based on an old Bengali tale. There is even an earlier, lower-budget version in Bengali, but this giant Bollywood production is in Hindi.This is a lush period piece set in the early 20th century. The cinematography and set design is unbelievably gorgeous. The songs, sung in the style of the time, are mesmerizing. And my girl, Madhuri Dixit, the worlds' greatest dancer, steals the show. And Shahrukh Khan fans will not be disappointed by his performance. Yes, true to form, he spends half of the film in tears.In summary, Instant Classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An indian classic.","review":"I really liked Devdas as an indian classic.

They spent a lot of money on this movie and it shows! The dance numbers are over the top and gorgeous and music is wonderful too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Plot","review":"I thought this movie was utterly ridiculous! The plot was outside of the realm of believability. Why would a man refuse to marry the woman he loved all his life and then become an drunk when she married someone else? It really had no intricate plot. Just one bad drunk after the other. I fast forwarded most of the movie in utter disgust. Drink...get sick...drink some more...get sick some more...pine away...drink some more...get sick some more. I am a writer and I can honestly say that this movie had no progression...no movement. This movie is just plain bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOST OTT FILM OF ALL TIME!!!","review":"The new version of Devdas is visually stunning, but otherwise one of the most worst movies I have seen in a very very long time. Not because of the actual story, but because of the liberties taken with it. The characters are all amazingly over the top, with awful performances coming from almost everyone except the lead three stars. Jackie Shroff in particular irritates amazingly. The film does not reflect the Bengali culture at all - and the actors or director have made absolutely no effort to ensure the few Bengali dialogues in the movie are spoken correctly - the pronunciation is generally wrong. The music is amazing, but the sets are loud and garish, and Mr Bhansali seems to have an obsession with Aishwarya Rai running with 3 metres of sari flowing behind her.If you want to watch a good Hindi film, then watch the vastly superior Lagaan instead, rather than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I've seen many films from all over the world including Bollywood but \\"Devdas\\" is in a class by itself as the most boring pretentious over -produced badly acted by any standards, so that even as self parody its ghastly - without subtlety or the rapturous extravagance one can enjoy in Bollywood films.

It's a fun melodrama with gorgeous costumes and dancing so I wanted to offer a copy to my 9 yr old who just loves Bollywood. Loves this film specifically.This is a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE copy that looks like something pirated off the Internet - the resolution and colors are AWFUL, the subtitles are amateurish and not at all aesthetic: huge white Helvetica on black beneath the film.

Hamed never fought anyone, Kevin Kelly doesn't count because Kelly was old, in his prime Kelly would have destroyed Hamed. All that aside, I checked out the book from my local library and read through it the other day and I must say it is terrible. I find it totally one sided, Evans is in love with Hamed. He wants to be Hameds husband aparently, because I havent seen [behind] kissing like that for ever! He makes Hamed sound like a GOD when he is merly a pitiful boxer and 2nd rate man from what I read in Boxing Monthly. Can you say 11 kids out of wedlock; him and Oscar are battling for Dead Beat Dad awards!

The shoes are a bit stiff at first but break in after about 10 wears or so. I love them because I can wear them at work in the business attire setting but also pair them with a suit and they look great either way. They definitely fit a formal and a semi formal setting great. As far as appearance they are a classy looking shoe without looking pretentious or ostentatious.I would give them 5 stars except for one thing. They scuff relatively easy and the beautiful brown color gives way to a lighter more tan color. For me personally I like the look of slight wear in the shoes but some may not.These are sturdy shoes. I wore them about 2-3x's per week over a four year period for work and then occasionally for more formal affairs and it was about four to five years before the soles started to separate from the rest of the shoe.

This hose is definately not one of those. Although the description describes it as having a thick and durable wall it is not very stiff at all. In the first few minutes of using it about 10 kinks developed that totally stopped all water flow. You need to carefully lay out the hose before use and watch constantly that you don't twist it since kinks form with the least provocation. All in all I wish that I had bought another Craftsman brand black rubber hose that I have for the front of my house since that almost never kinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible experience........","review":"We purchased this hose more for the color than anything else. It arrived and it was black, which made my day. My husband installed it and immediately began complaining that the hose wouldn't unravel correctly and kept twisting. He filled it with water thinking this would straighten out the kinks. Unfortunately he was wrong. During every use the hose would kink so the water supply would shut off. Today, approx 10 days in use, I noticed a hole as I watered more than what I intended to. Sad as there is not a huge supply of black hoses but very happy that Amazon has a great return policy.

This one- HUGE disappointment. Maybe it was just me?.. I didn't enjoy that this author kind of rewrote the rules for this book. The writing style isn't true to the first two, making it a little confusing. Little things like the change in everyone's dialect killed the credibilty I was trying to give Herndon. Maybe the only thing that kept me motivated was the urge to finish the series and it was so suspenseful ~ more action and cheesy combat cries than needed for a plot like this.

The difference is that ROC uses 2 closing prices a set number of periods back to determine momentum, while this trading system uses 2 lowest lows separated by a highest high called a regular cycle or in the alternate 2 highest highs separated by a lowest low, called an inverse cycle. The object is to project the next highest high ( or lowest low) through applying the rate of change for the total number of periods between the 2 highest highs or lowest lows. The premise of the book is that the ROC will remain constant for the set number of periods of the previous cycle or inverse cycle as the case may be. If it doesn't then you supposedly have reversal.

They are a series of vignettes with no coordinated point or direction. In this little volume Francis Kazemak helps the reader avoid the trap of poor writing. He holds your hand through the process of learning to write your story well, in a number of different formats (poetry, as well as prose). As far as English teachers go, he is engaging and not pedantic (in my experience, no small miracle!). He provides good examples and clear instructions. This is a solid roadmap in the designated journey of writing your life story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Record; Awful Reissue","review":"Let's be honest: this is hardly a \\"lost\\" masterpiece. Sure, Bremner's terrific--when he's got the right band, the right songs, and some sympathetic arrangements. (Let the man ROCK, is what I'm saying.) But a lot of these tunes are merely pleasant--hardly up to Rockpile standards--and the production is horribly dated. (Sounds more like bad Squeeze, say, than the bashing Brinsleys.) Probably worth three stars as an LP. Now let's talk turkey: this thing was mastered off vinyl. There are audible clicks & pops throughout--something that's simply inexcusable for an '80s release. If Gadfly couldn't get the masters, that's one thing; but, jeez, at least dig up a cleaner record for your reissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I was mad for Rockpile, not only on their own, but on all the Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe records, and I was extremely sad to see them break up. That's why I was so happy to discover this CD, which is very much in the same mold. And it's really nice to see Billy step out from behind the shadow of Edmunds and Lowe. Some great songs here, particularly Fire in My Pocket, which could have been on Dave Edmund's Twangin'. Yes, the production is a bit dated, but less so than you might expect for a 1984 release. The early digital echo is a little intrusive, but the songs, the singing, and the playing more than make up for it. Just a delight, and all the more so because Terry Williams is playing here. He just makes everything go. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Roll On Lotion","review":"I would've given it 5 stars, but it was a little strong smelling.

In this book, the author meets a mystical man named Simon, who introduces him to the work of a \\"ragpicker\\" and the work behind it. If you ask me, EVERY human being should get a copy of this book. once you hit a rut, or you still riding high, read this. I know some may say that this may be a bit sappy, but if it is of a help to one, why not partake of it? In my opinion, Mr Mandino as well as others were some great men.

Reading this book reminded me of what a great creation I am and that I have enough within myself to be grateful.

The cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around. When it unwinds it does so VERY slow and loses it's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it. Plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with? What are you supposed to hit it with then? These things you don't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up. Don't waste money on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this product.","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old son's birthday. He was very excited about it and having Derek Jeter endorse it was an added treat for him. We spent half an hour setting it up and trying to figure out how to use it. We eventually concluded that it was a BIG disappointment. The ball comes around real slow and drops to the bottom of the pole. I was worried he was going to hit the pole instead of the ball. I can imagine how this might work for a power hitter like Jeter, but imagine a 10 year old! Save your money, time, and child's feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord Way too rigid *** DO NOT BUY ***","review":"This is the first product I've bought through Amazon that I wish I could give a negative star rating.

A video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit. What we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle. It would barely even unwrap.

This new one is basically worthless. The ad says you can use it on a pole, where this is true it does not specify that the pole must be 2 inches or smaller in diameter. How many poles do you find that size? Pretty much zero. It WILL NOT fit around your typical basketball pole as they are 4 inches or bigger.The strap is long enough, but the velcro is not long enough for it to secure around a larger pole thus making it worthless.I think the design is so that you are forced to buy their pole to use the item. If you notice in the picture of their pole it is a small diameter item.What once used to be great is not worthless, Unless of course you want to go out and spend more money buying their pole and equipment to use it.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"Does not work like advertised.

Schools do teach values - they are implicit in the curriculum.

It is impeccable. He covers the wide ranging topic of occult sexuality through various cultures and religious traditions, in a concise, readable manner. . .not an easy thing to do.I like that the book is separated in 2 parts--part one is mainly theory, and is a full complete work unto itself. If the reader feels ready for practical application then they can explore the second part of the book.One of the first things taught in magick, is that if you summon an enity, you'd better know how to test it to make sure of it's true idenity/attributes and you better know how to properly separate yourself (banish) it. Good intentions are not enough. I found this important info lacking in the book.

Some of the songs are a bit lengthy, but they all feature some excellent musicianship and they're worth listening to. With almost all of the more progressive leaning albums it takes a while to fully appreciate the album, each listening reveals more that you didn't hear the first time around. My musical background is classical violin by training and I can see the more complex overall composition, similar to some of the romantic era works; this isn't the collection of solos and spotlight moments loosely strung together that is too common in progressive metal. It is definitely an acquired taste album. Don't be put off by the fact that these guys are Christians, whatever your religion if you enjoy death metal you should give these guys a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"leaping lucifer these guys are christian?","review":"okay this is gonna be short and sweet. look at the cover looks pretty sweet then you see angels and demons battleing on it with a closer look, then turn cd over see metalcore looking dudes and see solidstate first thought Pussys.

I guess that I am the only person that noticed the drums on this cd kinda sucks compared to the rest of the music. This whole thing reminded me alot of The Red Chord and All Shall Perish, except that the drummer couldn't hang with the rest of the band. The mix is turned up way too loud and the triggers sound so monotonous that it could very well be a drum machine with a crappy programmer. Anyways, none of that stops me from listening to this cd because it is by far one of the best metal cds you will be able to find released this year. If you like these guys and want to hear the bands whose archetype they tried to become, check out The Red Chord and All Shall Perish, better throw in a little bit of new Opeth also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of fresh air in the metalcore scene.","review":"This band doesnt seem to fit one specific genre.. It has metalcore, progressive, death, and thrash influences. While the music itself is a welcome change in the all to familiar metalcore scene, it does not fit any traditional pattern, thus does not flow as well as more experienced band's albums such as Opeth. Great release, but randomness and christian lyrical content bring it down just a notch for me. Im sure future releases from BTA will be much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 and a half, actually","review":"I'll round up to be nice.Seriously, though, Darkest Hour, Unearth, Meshuggah, Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth, and many, many other bands are far more original than this. This is what happens when Christians try to be \\"real\\" metal, they sound like old In Flames, another band that owns these fellows. Just because they're Christian doesn't mean it's new or exciting, and these guys are just sort of ripping off the melodic death bands like Arch Enemy and Dark Tranqulity, again, both of whom own these guys.All in all, great. I like it, but it's far from new. Just because you don't like a sub-genre, such as nu-metal or metalcore, doesn't mean it's not \\"true\\" metal. I like metal because it has more variety than most genres of music in todays world, so I say enjoy it.

Most of the time I was reading this book, I was longing to hit Patience over the head for ignoring the man who was so desperately in love with her.The last straw for me was the scene (which was a tad much for a regency romance) where Patience came close to losing her virginity to her childhood crush, Pip. It was too detailed, if you get what I mean, and it was close to the end of the book, which made it worse some how.This book gets one star for poor Richard.

The materials he presents and uses in his analysis are quite interesting and makes the book an important contribution to the history of Soviet foreign policy from the latter half of World War II into the early Cold War.The argument he makes is a rare case of a second image analysis, that is he sees the Soviet domestic political environment as decisive factor behind Stalin's foreign policy. More specifically, he argues that Stalin's statism was challenged and twisted by revolutionary ideologues from within - Zhdanov and others - hence the Cold War. The problem is that Cagg ignores Stalin's own ambiguity and his supreme control over his lieutenants.

After several conversations explaining why that was not possible (which allows for the educational one star :)), we set out to find the next best thing. Most inflatable dolphins I found in the stores were small (made for 3-4 year olds) and not very sturdy. This seller sent this giant inflatable dolphin out very quickly. I received it in less than a week. The dolphin is large (5-6 feet) plenty big enough for a 6-10 year old, even older however they would probably not get alot of enjoyment out of it. Our granddaughter has made it a pet and plays with it for hours. It does require someone to pull her around on it, of course, but I find she also enjoys making herself fall off of it too.

The celebrity profile aspect of the book is what will initially sell the book (and the insights into Alan Webb's character and running life are interesting and worth the read), but what will make this book a staple amongst runners for years to come is how it glorifies athletics and addresses topics to which every runner will relate, such as training, frustration with poor performances, the comraderie of a team and why people love to run. It is not a profound book, but it is a quick, easy read that is insightful and reaffirming.

If this was an original IP it wouldn't have gotten 1 star.Because Hollywood thinks that American movie-goers are simple, and will settle for the same crappy mix of self-sacrifice and sadness that has been the theme of too many movies (mixed with some cool CG) they decided to completely dumped the original meaning of the title \\"I Am Legend\\"; which I might add, if I think about it in its original context is chilling and genius. The alternate ending somewhat makes up for what was shown in theaters but, they really screwed up by cutting it just to appeal to more consumers. That's all this film was, it took a mildly popular and ingenious story and twisted the ideal into something more \\"lowest common denominator\\" for profit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie/Poor Adaption","review":"Had I seen this movie without reading the book I would put it on my top ten list of favorite movies. However, the way the movie was adapted was so far from the source material the only recognizable aspect was the basic premise and the name of the main character. That being said, the movie was very entertaining and was not at all a waste of my money. I think anyone who likes the action/horror genre would appreciate this, but if you have read the book, go into the theater with an open mind, forget about the source material, and just enjoy yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate ending is way better Sci Fi","review":"Very well done Zombie movie, when the alternate ending is used. The regular ending is the typical ho-hum blast 'em up. The alternate ending is much better - get this version if you like Sci Fi!However, I wish it had done more explaining what made the zombies different, and how they could be cured. If that had been in the movie, would have made it a better biologic sci-fi thriller, instead of a slightly biologic Zombie flick. So just 4 stars because I'm an obsessive medical type guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"Finally, an end of the world thriller that is worth seeing! This remake of 1971's Omega Man is a perfect example of how end of the world movies should occur. The flashbacks to the time before the catastrophe tell the story of what actually happen. Will Smith is really great as Dr. Robert Neville. Instead of going on some insane journey to find an unaffected area, he stays right in the heart of the crisis and tries to fix it. He is a great example of a true hero and Will Smith portrays it perfectly. Smith's personality in a dark and somber movie is a bright spot and his interplay with the innocuous things he encounters is fantastic. Will Smith make the film, aided by a great story and some really cool special effects.

This book has such potential to make a really great movie; unfortunately, this movie does not fit the bill.

Don't rip off consumers by promising a 'digital copy' that doesn't work with anything. The point of having a digital copy is so that you can put it on digital devices OTHER than your computer.

The book is actually a million times better and it's nothing like this movie \\"adaptation\\" - the two shouldn't even really have the same title.The way Hollywood blockbusters are going these days, it seems more likely that I will walk through a completely empty Manhattan than see a good big budget movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swing and a miss!","review":"Nothing like the book it was based on...the animation is terrible and cartoonish, the story jumps around all over the place...watch it once to get it out of your system.Now go read the BOOK for a much better experience!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaccid Film","review":"This is the flattest, limp, and dull thing. After reading all these superlative reviews, this film was a total disappointment, given the great material and potential. Some good Bob Marley music does not a great film make. There is no character development, only an inexplicable unraveling of Smith, in what amounts to a slow suicide by stupid choices. This Doctor, who supposedly is super-intelligent and tough, would shoot his dog once it got infected, not slowly strangle it, each tear and emotion lovingly filmed as it leaks off Smith's close-up. I can't adequately communicate what a big so-what this film is. And let me tell you, Vermont ain't that cold (plot hole #401), what about a NYC winter and the mutants? For excellent futuristic Sci-Fi, try the film \\"Equilibrium\\" which is far superior, as are the series of \\"Riddick,\\" \\"Blade,\\" and \\"Underworld/Evolution\\" films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of hype","review":"Ok, I saw the trailer for this way back and I thought it looked pretty good. After seeing it, I was anything but thrilled. The story resembles the classic Omega Man of the early 1970s with Charlton Heston. Though in general I do like Will Smith, I found a number of his block buster films busted, and this is no exception. Nevertheless, the film did have some good moments and even had moments of intense drama.

It is also unrelentingly depressing. But if you have seen \\"Omega Man\\" with Charlton Heston you may want to see it just to compare the two movies and the scenes of a deserted Manhattan are admittedly impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Not legend","review":"As many people have already said this Movie does not follow the book at all.I do not even understand why they would title the movie after the book to begin with. (Spoiler) The simple fact that the book ends with \\"I am Legend\\" meaning the future vamp/humans would always remember him as a monster who murdered people and live on in their dreams and future stories told to children (like a witch or Dracula) does not hold true to the movie , in fact the movie ends with \\"they will remember his legend\\" a man who fought for a cure.Aside from that it doesn't really explain a lot and with out some background knowledge you would probably find this film a little confusing.

Usually with remakes, I prefer the original but not in this case; and I really like Charlton Heston movies (referring to \\"Omega Man\\"). This remake did so much better with regard to action; what someone might go through mentally with the loss of family, let alone being the only person left on earth; and some reality with what you see in the background of the film. So the film does well mixing some good drama and action enough to keep you from hitting the stop button because the science fiction part is so unrealistic.However, this \\"alternate\\" ending sucked, to put it mildly. I'm not going to give it away, but puh-leeze.

Oh yes, lest I forget, make sure an important landmark is destroyed...Seriously, this clunker of a movie only made it at the box office because of Will I-Star-In-It-So-It-Must-Be-Great Smith. Substitute him in your mind with a generic actor, and the movie's flaws become painfully evident. The premise of a mutant virus turning ordinary people into zombie cannibals (groan) is threadbare. Much of Will Smith's presence on the screen, when he's not squaring off with zombies, feels hollow and flat.

However, his tests are not successful.Well, that's pretty much it...until like the last half hour of the film. That is a big disappointment for me.

I have watched everything from \\"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air\\" to \\"Men in Black\\". I think that he is a very clever actor and usually picks his movies with care. Sadly though, this was not one of those films. The flash backs became annoying, the acting was rather ho-hum..and WHY did they have to kill the dog? That dog was the only \\"heart\\" to this film.

So little was changed, in fact, that it rapidly becomes a tedious embarrassment. I understand that few quality screenplays are being produced nowdays, but I still loath cheap reproductions of modern classics. \\"Invasion of the body snatchers\\" starring Donald Sutherland was another movie that was recent re-made into a poor quality clone. My point is, why bother? Rent the earlier versions and judge them yourselves. I don't need to spend the money in theater, nor on DVD to enshrine the sad newest rip-off versions....Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, but his starring in \\"Omega Man ReVisited\\" does little to rescue this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy Ending - Real Cop-out","review":"Pretty good adaptation of the novel by Richard Matheson, modernized and great idea to set it in NYC.

Though it is small you can really tell the difference from standard definition TV and movies. Blu-ray really is the way to go when it comes to the high def experience. It is only if have an HDTV... without one get the standard TV. As for the movie, well it was very enjoyable. They do play down the vampirism that the book describes but for the long run the movie is very entertaining. Will smith portrays the protector of humanity in this epic film about humanity's demise at its own hands. We believe to much in our superiority over nature and believe that we can alter DNA, splice genes and make other genetic modifications and then release these new things into the world without the slightest clue as to what will happen once they start to interact with the natural environment. Will Smith is our last hope... is humanity finished?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Legend, is no legendary movie","review":"I had never seen the other movies or read the book, so I wasn't expecting anything other than usually good Will Smith movie, like Independence Day or Men In Black. They didn't explain enough about why the vaccine for cancer was made and then how it spread the way it did. Too many plot holes and then the \\"rescue at the last moment\\" plot device is just way overdone. Since I bought the 2 DVD Special edition with both endings, I would have to say both endings disappointed me in different ways, either sacrificing himself to save the two others or surrender the girl zombie and save himself. Here is an ending I was expecting: He finds a cure, figures out how to transmit it, and everyone returns to normal, the whole nice happy ending, not a ending that wasn't exactly resolved.

The acting is pretty good as well and the story telling is pretty darn good as well. Why didn't I like this movie then? It just wasn't very fun. There wasn't a lot of human interaction.... it was basically a Will Smith monologue and while he did a good job listening to Will Smith talk to himself for over an hour gets old real quick. The zoombies or living dead special effects wise were top knotch but they were a little creapy (which is probably what they were going for).Strangly enough everything in this movie was done well except the fun factor. This is kind of a depressing movie and nothing really good happens until the end (kind of like Will Smith's the Pursuit of Happiness) and by the time that happens it just isn't enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film","review":"4.5 stars. Now this is entertainment. Will Smith carries this suspenseful film effortlessly. I know many have complained about its CGI, but I actually found the vampire characters quite scary and believable. I'm not sure whether it was explained how Fred the mannequin was removed from store or why the vampire population weren't turning on themselves for food. Some of the plotlines were predictable but it doesn't mean they weren't still effective. Losing Sam caused a lump to swell in my throat. The thought of being completely and utterly alone was a bit much to wrap my brain around. My problem with the film was the same as most: the ending. The decision seemed so abrupt. If the tunnel was strong enough to withstand the blast then it was strong enough for him to hunker in and wait until morning to leave with the woman and child.

Everything was looking good until I saw the hairless rats that were so overly the top cgi generated it looked like a pixar movie. Then it got worse from there, the villans were all cgi and you could tell they were all computer generated because nothing looked even remotely realistic about them. I have concluded that WB studios are lazy and do not care a thing about how the audience feels. When it boils down to WB movies I've noticed where they are relying too much on CGI and none of it looks real. I made the mistake of buying this movie, and am stuck with it and the loss of $20.00.

When my wife and I went to see this film over Christmas break at the show, I had high hopes, and I was entranced until the final 30 minutes of the film, and then I was what????The movie spent such a long time effectively building sympathy for the protagonist, and then threw it all away by rushing the end. And without giving away the end, the alternative conclusion available on the disk 2 versions, while maybe a bit hokey, was much more satisfying and enjoyable.So my advice is if you are going to buy Legend, get this Two disk special edition"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurried work is worried work.","review":"Just like my title states, I felt as if they hurried this movie and so the CGI suffered. The zombie/mummy/whatever-they're-called were very cartoonish. GREAT concept and story, but not a good film. I also felt as if Will Smith's acting wasn't his best. It almost seems as if his mind was elsewhere. If they had spent more time on this film (particularly the CGI), it would have been one of the decade's best.

Over all I did not like the film. Will Smith's movies always have great special effects, but they seem plastic to me. I did not like computer generated super man zombies for instance. The Last Man On Earth, from the 1950's is a much darker movie with it's child burning pits! However the Vampires were cheesy and is in black and white. Check out Omega Man, from the 1970's for a stronger movie. A lot less special effects but a much stronger performance. Best of all check out the book, I am Legend.

While I enjoyed the movie, I was expecting to have the normal two disc extras available on the 2nd DVD to watch on my DVD player. Well, the only thing on the 2nd DVD is an alternate ending to the movie. All of the good extras (how it was produced etc.), are only viewable (not save-able) on a Windows Computer (uses MS specific stuff) that you hook to WarnerBros through the internet and will only be available through March of 2009, at that point those extras go poof and you won't be able access them - nice.

In fact, that was basically what I expected to see: a remake of a \\"dead\\" movie with a bunch of flashy CGI effects and Will Smith one-liner quips.Surprisingly, not only were the flashy CGI effects included, but the movie actually did have quite a bit of substance to it. The Fresh Prince also only had a few one-liners, less it would have spoiled the overall dark tone of the movie.Overall, it was enjoyable. Just sit back, relax, and watch it.

And while this one did fall short, it was much betterthan I had expected. The special effects are better than the original, but given 40+ years difference they ought to be.The main saving grace of this film is Will Smith. He\`s an excellent actor and he did a good job on this movie. In his role as RobertNeville, he really made you believe that he had been alone for three years. A little lost, a little robotic, a little crazy. Justabout what you would expect of a person who had been through something like that. Very much like Charlton Heston as Neville in theoriginal movie.Is Will Smith in the same class as Charlton Heston? Not quite. But Smith is still fairly young.

Maybe better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major dissapointment","review":"Let me state right from the beginning that if I had not read the book, I may have ranked the movie higher, but (unfortunately) I can't be that objective. Richard Matheson's near perfect man vs. self story of isolation and terror had been made into too many bad film versions already, and this one does nothing to help the cause. Will Smith does a nice job of trying to carry the film on his well developed shoulders (nice job with the reverse chin-ups, Fresh Prince) but the plot is convoluted and the emotion is forced. Watch this, if you must, but be prepared to be hugely disappointed if you've read and enjoyed the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't blame the seller","review":"The HD DVD side of the disc didn't work, but I can't really blame the seller as it could've just been a bad disc.

Neville is immune to both the airborne and contact strains of the virus. Having ended up with just his dog, Sam, Neville loses touch with social skills and mores, becoming a lonely (and exceptionally buff and good looking) man who talks to mannequins.Excellent acting by Smith (as always), great screenplay and computer generation for the most part, \\"I Am Legend\\" simply flows and differs from typical films of the genre in that it is elegant and classy. The zombies that the virus created are over-the-top for this film, and the ending came too fast, as if the director suddenly got bored and decided he'd had enough. Be that as it may, this is one of the better horror movies I have seen in a while, and Will Smith is always a pleasure to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"Good and fairly realistic rendition of a doomsday scenario.

There is no deeper examination of loneliness, just shots of aloneness. The threat to Neville has been dumbed down- in earlier versions he is the threat. In this film, he is the threatened. The female he meets is a religious bubblehead, rather than a plant from the semi-zomboids that are looking to start a New Breed. And on and on goes the watering down. The film fails as both an adaptation, and if seen without knowledge of its forebears. But, aside from its Hollywoodization stripping the tale of its relevance and depth, this film version even fails its low Hollywoodized standards of success- it's dull, poorly made, and has not a second of suspense. It is a retard's retard.

Even though this is technically a remake, it stands up by itself as if it wasn't.The plot is masterfully crafted . The end was somewhat expected, as finding a cure would be only the way to go, but Smith dying was totally unexpected, at least in my opinion.There is little to gripe about this one. But what needs to be griped about is the insanely bad CG. In this age where every other cartoon movie is CG, to have such horrendous animation is inexcusable. I guess all the budget for the movie went into paying Will Smith.Another thing people complained about was how Will Smith seemed to act like himself. With Will Smith, this seems to work in almost every movie he stars in.

The entire movie is focused on him dealing with zombie like creatures that only come out at night. The movie is long and boring with a really lame ending.

Smith is supposed to be a brilliant virologist, but when he sees a manequin placed where it will attract his attention he behaves like a child and gets his faithful dog killed. The \\"darkseekers\\" are supposed to be raving maniacs, but they are smart enough to anticipate Smith's reactions and to engineer a clever mechanical trap. If they were that smart they would just get weapons or explosives and kill him. If he was so stupid as to not recognize enemy action, he would not be a virologist. After he is saved from death, at the last possible instant, and taken home, he pulls a gun on his rescuers. You have to be amazingly stupid to think you need a gun with someone that just saved your life.

(The first one looked like it was filmed in someone's garage) Parts of this movie looks like the computer work which was done in a documentary on what the earth would look like if man disappeared.I am a fan of the fine work which Will has done but this does not reflect any of the movies he has made.

Not a movie I will keep in my blu-ray collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Slow Boring Remake of the Omega Man.","review":"This has to be one of the worst remakes of another movie that I have ever seen. We fast forwarded through most of the movie. They took the original (Omega Man w/Charlton Heston) plot and really messed it up. Everything seemed to be done in slow motion, they dragged out scene after meaningless scene. The story line was atrocious. The worst part was how stupid Neville (main character) was in this movie. He took no precautions or equipment that I would have taken in his place.

After watching it I was totally disappointed.

The setting, the actor, and the story generally make it all possible. Unfortunately, it starts off wonderfully, but slowly loses steam. There is no clear wrap up at the end, leaving viewers to wonder as to the fate of mankind. Also, I found the CGI on the \\"psycho people\\" to be distracting. They don't move like humans, and that makes them seem less threatening... distended jaws, leaps that defy gravity, etc. It wasn't necessary. Will Smith is very good in it, although it is unclear how the world was lucky enough to have the lone expert in the virus immune to it. Some explanation should have been offered. Overall, a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Film","review":"This wasn't a very detailed film. I liked it but was glad I saw it on cable and didn't pay the regular movie price or I would have felt cheated. Also, his blatant advertising of Shrek in this movie was a little nauseating. Smith shouldn't taint a good film with a mediocre one. Don't bother buying I Legend. See it on cable or order it though internet library loan at your local library if it doesn't have it on the shelf. Will Smith dropped it with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped and a huge disapointment","review":"I Am Legend was without a doubt one of the most over hyped and disapointing movies of 2007. Francis Lawerence shows the same mis direction he showed in 2005's Constaine and the script is strictely by the numbers. The only saving grace in the movie is Will Smith's performance as the last man on earth. As for the hyped alternate ending it's also a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"a definate buy","review":"I bought this version of the movie for about 5 dollars I got it right on time, the movie its self had the quality of a brand new disc. overall i give it 5 out of 5 because of the quality and price, very good quality, very low price"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst screen adaptation of Matheson's novella yet !","review":"I saw this movie the first day it opened and due to the fact that it had the same name of Matheson's book , I expected something closer to what the author intended than previous film versions . Instead it was the worst of all three movies based on the book . Plot holes galore , CGI effects among the worst I've ever seen in a film , an ending that looked tacked on and rushed , and a heavy religious theme , where none at all existed in the book made this movie a huge disappointment . It was so bad it would've flopped horribly had it not been for the superstar drawing power of Will Smith . If you must see it - rent don't buy !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Legend (alternate ending)","review":"This was a good movie at the theatre (4stars). So, I wanted to see what this alt ending was like. My opinion is that this movie is good until the ending; LAME. It seems to dislocate the continuity and consistency of the film. How would one feel after destroying all humans and creatures on Earth. And when his best friend dies, he goes postal. Anyway, was his escape a dream Or was his escape just a result of his mind fracturing or diverging. So was the woman and child real or were they internal conflicts; his way of saving yet sabatoging himself? Is there a right or wrong answer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool movie. Very nice bluray","review":"Verdict:Movie is really nice (simple story but cool). I prefer the alternate ending (much more realistic; I hate happy endings).

This is the movie where I realized Will Smith can actually act (the same way I realized Ashton Kutcher can act after watching Butterfly Effect; which I also own).Bluray: Very nice video and audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Legend","review":"I'm not a huge fan of remakes, nor am I a fan of Will Smith, but I wanted to like this and went into viewing this movie with an open mind. First problem with this movie is Will Smith, he can not carry a movie by himself. If you're a fan of his, you'll probably love it, but not being a fan of his, I have to say he seriously lacks the chops to pull this off. Second massive issue is the horrendously awful CGI. The wide shots of the city look fine, but the lions in the beginning are just unbearably bad, and then when they finally show the vampires, that was just the final nail in the coffin for me. No pun intended. They just looked horrid, very poorly done. I watched both endings, and they were both very bland, the unrated theatrical version being the worst of the two. And while I have to say that the movie is very much watchable and not the worst thing to ever grace the silver screen, it needed a lot of improvement and a new lead actor to make it a worthwhile film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, Dated CGI","review":"Will Smith delivers another performance so powerful that you can't help but stare in awe before you realize that you are crying.The story was taken from Vincent Price's \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" which was later redone very popular with Charlton Heston in \\"Omega Man.\\" All 3 films are worth watching, but \\"I am Legend\\" changes the story in some powerful ways.The initial CGI for NY city is amazing. The digital craftsmanship is phenomenal.Unfortunately the CGI that is front and center in the movie is painfully inadequate (especially on Blu Ray). Basically all living creatures were done poorly. They feel cartoony.So, as long as you go in with the proper expectations about CGI, you can focus on the amazing story telling, plot, and acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect HD","review":"The picture and audio quality of this Blu-Ray was perfect.

Followed the story line of the original \\" Omega Man\\" pretty close. Just had more special effects. Liked the original best but this is worth watching.

WB sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum...","review":"Excellent set up at the beginning. Really intriguing concept, except for one thing: we've seen this before, and last time, it was called 28 Days Later - and it was a lot better than this cliche-ridden, horribly executed piece of mainstream, Hollywood trash. Once the CG \\"zombies\\" appeared, the entire movie went downhill from there. I went into this expecting something halfway decent. I guess I expected too much. Films like this are the reason that I avoid big Hollywood blockbusters. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange!","review":"The reason why I give this particular movie such a low rating is simple: it ends different from the version that I originally saw. I first rented the movie on Amazon which had a good story ending, so I purchased it. The dvd ends up with the main character dead, and a stupid death at that. I was thinking \\"Wow, only people as dead headed as those in Hollywood would come up with such an ending!\\" Why is the ending different when I rent it online?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Legend","review":"I saw this film after it was released and I really loved it. I've noticed that a substantial portion of the 1 star reviews are because the film strayed too far from the novel (which I have not read, so I didnt have that problem). I thought the movie as a whole was very well done, and its one of my favorite recent films. My only gripe is that the alternate ending would have fit in much better than the ending that was shown in theatres(IMHO).

Get the disc just for the alternative ending!. it was a real conversation piece to show both. The quality make you get lost in the film quickly.

Too many instances of having to suspend disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Smith strikes gold again......","review":"Having never read the book, I cannot comment on how the story transfers to the big screen, except to say that in most cases, the transfer isn't favorable, so to judge it based on that is unfair.Visually, this movie is quite impressive. I've never actually been to Manhattan, but seeing the wildlife roam the streets littered with abandoned vehicles and plantlife, made me feel as if I had.I had a couple of minor issues; one with the plot that I cannot mention without being a slight \\"spoiler\\" and the other with the rather abrupt ending, in my opinion.This certainly didn't really distract from the overall experience & once again, Will Smith was wonderful mixing drama with his brand of comedy in precisely the right places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the alternative ending version","review":"Will Smith puts in a brilliant performance as the last \\"normal\\" man in a New York ravaged by a disease that has turned most people into feral night-hunting predators (not literally vampires as in Matheson's classic novel). The theatrical version of the film is greatly marred by a jarringly trite Hollywood-style ending that is completely out of step with the rest of the film. Fortunately, the Blu-Ray disk includes an Alternative version with a far superior ending (and one that is considerably more faithful to the spirit of Matheson's novel). Because the alternative ending builds on plot elements from earlier in the film, I can only imagine that it was the original ending, but that somebody lost their nerve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I liked it; it may be my favorite version--though I still love the Vincent Price one. Will Smith did a great job carrying the movie by himself (of course with lots of help from Sam!). It was funny, sad, scary and made me think--not all movies can say that. I wished they had expanded the preface of the beginning a little further, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll stop here. Give it a try, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Stars For Will Smith Only","review":"I have to agree with those who are sick and tired of the CGI effects replacing real people. I enjoyed the movie, but I had its moments when I just wanted to stop it. I enjoy most of what Will Smith does, but this was a bit over the top with the terrible CGI characters who were supposed to be zombies.I bought it, and now wish I'd just waited for it to come on cable. It's just not one of those flicks I'd watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining.","review":"I loved this movie, even though I am not a big Will Smith fan, I think he plays the brooding hero very well. I'm a true sci fi nut and love anything hinting at supernatural, so this movie was right up my alley. I purchased the expensive version with the alternate ending and found it to be lack luster in its finish. The original version is definately better. I enjoyed it and have seen it at least four times now and enjoy it more each time, its very entertaining which is what true sci fi is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why??? Bad Acting,Bad CGI, Just Bad.","review":"This movie version from one off the greatest short stories ever, is horrible. It's The Fresh Prince...but angry and confused. Save your money if you have watched ANY Will Smith movie you have seen them all. It's a shame that such a promising actor keeps resorting to The Fresh Prince persona. Why do they insist on making bad movies from this great book? Adding a ton of money. horrible CGI and a once marketable actor will not help if Hollywood keeps changing the story line.

For this role we need A REAL CHARISMATIC ACTOR who could convince us of how it is to be lonely in this world by his performance and will smith has nothing to do with vincent price and hell...even with charlton heston.One star for the SE and the mutants.

Definite PASS on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Human civilization collapses","review":"The premise of the movie is so disturbing, that I didn't really enjoy or appreciate the rest of the movie. Civilization as we know it collapses, all the animals too. Human culture, history is gone within 3 years. May it never happen. I feel the flashback technique that is used to tell parts of the story, failed to drive my interest. It should have been used more sparingly - Batman begins, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 are two examples where too many flashbacks only broke the continuity of their story lines. In Equilibrium, a brilliant movie, flashbacks were used more effectively to intensify dramatic moments. Overall, what I found disturbing about the movie is the fact that we learn little about the rest of the world, the US, commercial NY alone seems of interest to the movie makers, a thin story line wrapped in a cheap budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM LAME-O","review":"I was greatly disappointed in this movie. I normally like Will Smith and zombie movies, but this was just 100 minutes of cartoonish computer generated special effects with no movie.

I, for one, thought otherwise. It would have been a decent enough movie, in its own right, had they called it something else. But they didnt.The only thing this movie has in common with Matheson's (amazing) novel is the name of the protagonist. Thats it. Every single other identifying mark was changed, moved, or taken out altogether. Matheson must be rolling in his grave at this point.If you want to see an adaptation, watch Last Man On Earth, with Vincent Price. At least in that one, they got most of it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Dont let the previews fool you, this movie is not about zombies. There are bits and pieces where they make an appearance but this movie is not about zombies. Its a Cast Away-inspired slow paced film about a man who has lost his mind due to the fact that he thinks all humanity is gone but him. The whole thing is his everyday life and how he survives. Its very serious and minimal action which I was really hoping for. So if your expecting Resident Evil type action dont waste ur ten bucks. But if ur down with the depressing lonely life of one man in new york then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie that had potential","review":"Two things that should NEVER be in any movie.

I found it to be tedious, time-consuming, poorly written, largely unexplained & just plain silly. Most of the movie was spent just showing how along Will Smith was in New York. That was cool for about 5 minutes, then it just got silly. The only saving grace of this film is Will Smith's performance, which was really good. He is a very talented actor, but the poor writing & lackluster direction show once again that even the most brillian actors need good writing etc. The ending was too convenient. All of a sudden 2 more uninfected people just happen to show up & they know of a colony in Vermont. Quite honestly the entire story could have been told in about 30 minutes, plus the director tried to use cheap scare tactics instead of suspence which was also not cool. OVerall not the worst movie I've ever seen but certainly nowhere near the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but...","review":"This was a really good movie and I have no complaints exept the language!

The doctor's manic mission is to find a cure for plague. He is on his own, except for his trusted dog, left behind by his family when they fled New York.The doctor is played by Will Smith, and he has to carry most of the movie on his own. And carry it he does. He could have been manic or over-the-top, but he kept things reserved, showing the quiet warping of personality associated with imposed isolation for years.The film isn't perfect. The zombies are too McGuffin-like, and the film feels a little shorter than it should have been as a result. Nevertheless, the movie was enjoyable, and provided some good scares too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining","review":"From an entertainment view it was very good. I thought Will Smith did an excellent job as an actor. It was a lot like \\"Omega Man\\". A little short for me. About 1 hour and 45 minutes.

Would have liked to see Smith do more exploring of the city. They made it look pretty real. Very enjoyable movie. Check it out.Steve"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the worst movie I have seen in long time. The effects are fake and the plot didn't make sense.

It rings true every step of the way. I will not go into exactly what happens every moment of the movie, and there will be no spoilers here. Instead, ask yourself if you would like to bond with Robert Neville, the character Mr. Smith plays, and go along on his dedicated journey to save lives, maintain sanity, and survive while avoiding imminent danger. Also ask yourself if you would like a good cry. This movie has a few tearjerking moments, and if you have any heart at all you will probably shed at least one tear. This movie may not be perfect, but if you like the idea of Will Smith in this role you should see it at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I liked this movie, it was a semi-realistic take on the end of the world vampire movie. Who knows with the crap drug companies come up with now a days this could be a possibility for our future. Who's to say what happens after their done messing up everyone's health care. This movie was pretty good for a man and his dog, it made me look twice before entering a dark room. There was one thing that I questioned, if you were driving North up the East coast and the bridges and tunnels of New York city had been blown up, that would make it pretty hard to make it to the City, not impossible but pretty hard with flesh eating vampires on the loose. Great special effects though, it was a good movie, I would not buy the DVD but I did pay to rent it and it was well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie","review":"Will Smith is once more playing a role that can really suite him.

I found this movie to be long, boring, and had a mundane ending. He was much better in I, Robot.Okay the end of mankind theme has been done before..but with much better flare. I will admit that Smith had his shining moment's in the movie but they are \\"few\\".And the ending was just typical for this kind of movie at least add some kind of over the top ending not something that I could probably see in the \\"spike\\" channel for heaven's sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Legend","review":"\\"This movie was totally awesome, Will Smith, Alice Braga, and Charlie Tahan were fantastic in this movie.

But at what cost? You'll want to purchase this movie for sure!I Am Legend [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cineplex Fodder","review":"Will Smith is now, regrettably, experiencing the \\"Scorsese curse\\" -- which is to say that when the auteur is granted an unlimited budget, he lavishes his attention on expansive production rather than focusing on a project's essence. The result is bloated spectacle. There's an audience for this stuff; and this epic will be remembered no longer than an episode of bucket-of-popcorn indigestion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Legend","review":"Plain and simple, overall good movie but let down of an ending, probably due to all the hype before viewing of the movie...but still enjoyable..."},{"rating":"2","title":"alternate version is by far the best version.","review":"I saw this at the cinema and while I enjoyed it annoyed me a little because certain elements of the story didn't add up. However the alternate version which has a different third act clears those up, in fact it is very different. In fact I find it amazing that this was not the version shown at the cinema.The features are all interesting enough and the picture quality is very good too. A worthwhile ourchase on blu ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I very much enjoyed this movie - particularly the alternate ending.

They're reviewing the version of this movie that played in theaters which was a very good movie that was completely ruined by it's own ending.This version of the movie, which has the original ending (Not the ending shown in theaters) is great. It's Oscar worthy. It blew me away. It feels like a completely different movie than the one shown in theaters, with a completely different message at the end more in line with the book that the movie is based on. I wholeheartedly recommend this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"I thought this movie was very good, and wanted to see it again the next day. The CG was a little unbelievable and reminded me of the movie \\"The Mummy\\". Other than that, I felt the story was very good, and the acting top notch. The end was a shocker, and was totally unexpected, but it just made the movie that much better. I plan to buy this video when it is released and will be in my special collection of favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, nauseating, stiff political propaganda","review":"This book by Walter Veltroni, a leading Italian communist who was working for and paid by the KGB until just over ten years ago, and now claims to no longer be a 'neo-communist', is no more than stiff propaganda against a man whom he envies from all points of view - political, personal, social. The book does contain some useful information for those who might want to do research on the turbulent topic of television in Italy, but the biased and useless views of the author make it almost worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been better","review":"This looks like a straight transfer from a VHS tape that was released in the early 90's, and evidently Rhino did nothing as far as remastering either the video and audio, and that is very disappointing. Most of the video clips are grainy and of terrible quality. Seems Rhino could have put in a little effort and found better segments. Overall, it's a pretty good, if brief, history of how the Yardbirds came together, but little care went into video/audio quality. From now on, it'll make me wary of any future documentaries of this type from Rhino, who normally excel at music CD remasters, but have greatly disappointed me in their DVD music documentaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Documentary","review":"I was so disappointed bought it in a local store for my husband for Xmas who is a big Yardbirds fan and didn't read the reviews in here which I always do....

Perhaps I set my sights too high, as I have read better fiction online, free.The mini-textbook was okay, for readers with little or no exposure to neuro-linguistic programming.

Admittedly, Dr. Horton's concept of demonstrating NLP technology within the structure of a story is absolutely brilliant! However, his book falls short of delivering ANY of the promises of his concept. His story is obvious, cheesy, sophomoric, crass, grandiose, and poorly written (typo's included). The second part is so basic you would be better off finding presentations of this material anywhere else. What a dissapointing waste of money and time!

Yes its a dark brew but so what...for me that translates into my tea dollar stretching much farther than ANY of their competition. I am not a tea snob by any means and ONLY drink iced versions. Period. So it may be that for the tea snob inclined the flavor, body, bouquet, balance, yadda yadda may disagree with you and if so, so be it. For me, Walters Bay is a perfect and very economical replacement for Paradise Tropical, China Mist, and all other flavored variants.

A great read; hard to put down. It spans his sickly childhood, through his arrest and conviction at the University of Virginia for shooting a local bully, through his finding himself in the Confederate calavry operating behind Union lines throughout the War. Never captured (although seriously wounded at one point), always honorable, he kept hundreds and at one point thousands of Union soldiers/cavalry tied up protecting against his sudden appearances. Then, the real shocker: after the War, he became friends with General/President Grant and was sent to the Indian Territories and Hong Kong on behalf of the US Government to clean up corruption there (which he did), and then he became an attorney with the US Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. for the remainder of his career.

Other examples of the genre include Munich Machine andThe Andrea True Connection. Of course disco legends Donna Summer and Boney M also had their roots in Munich.

It was that I didn't really care about any of the characters. The twins weren't fleshed out enough to worry about, and I didn't particularly like any of the others. In \\"The Rice Mother\\" she somehow brought to life characters that, even if they were terrible people, grabbed me somehow.

Not a very dramatic ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine writer, bad book","review":"After reading 'Mapping the Edge', I think it is apparent that Sarah Dunant is a gifted writer. I believe that I may try to read one of her other books, possibly 'Fatlands', but I could not recommend 'Mapping the Edge' to anyone.It is very possible that I have too much testosterone to understand the character of Anna. I found in the book's first 100 pages that Anna acts in a totally selfish, and to me, unfamiliar, way towards her child and loved ones. At this point, I did not care what happened to her, and I could not resurrect any such feelings as the book continued.I am sure that many people will find this book enjoyable, I, however, was not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mapping the Edge","review":"This book was awful. The characters were uninteresting, and the pace and candence of the story didn't make me care for them at all.

Besides that, I thought my first drive was defective since the light kept blinking intermittently. My first Micro's light stayed on constantly unless there was a file being transferred to the drive. I thought it was defective so I returned it for another one. I brought it home, and what do I find out, the light blinks intermittently just like the one I returned and THOUGHT was defective. I guess that's just how they are now. Why they would make the light blink like that, I don't know but it's annoying. The new rubber bodies that the drive comes with suck too.

Adrenaline Rush, Mobstability, Legit Ballin and even Kamikaze are tight albums. This CD is like a Ja's Pain is Love...the hardcore gangsta ryhmes I like are few and far between, and the lovey-love crap is everywhere. This is merely a pop/R&B; album to me.The so called \\"bangers\\" are pretty weak compared to Twista's earlier body of work. Singles from this album will probably get played more on TRL that BET. I know Twista is trying to KEEP making money (I know he ain't starving), but this is bubble gum crap all the way through, appealing more to 12 year-old girls than anyone else.If you're a huge Twista fan, buy this album.If you thought Ja's watered down Pain is Love with 10 love songs was good record, buy this album.If you prefer 97-99 Twista STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS (I wish I would've)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twista goes pop... why???","review":"The thing that surprises me about this album being bad is that you never saw it coming. Adrenaline Rush, Mobstability and Kamikaze were all great albums. The day after is garbage beyond belief!

Can't even compare. \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" was a masterpiece of sorts, and was classic, raw, underground Twista, before he went commercial. In a way you can't blame him because he finally is getting the recognition (and money!) he deserves. However, its sad that an artist has to go commercial for them to get recognition and the sales they are deserving. But for hip hop heads looking for the old Twista, sad to say this ain't it. Not even close.

What he didn't realize that just because that song was good, the rest of his Kamikaze album was diverse and had a lot of substance. This time around, he just released a straight R&B album, save a few tracks. There is barely any Twista that we've grown to know. I can understand if he wanted to put one or two songs on there for the ladies, but practically the whole album?! Come on man, it's like Danny Devito starring in a romance movie. He needs to stick with what he's good at. Let's hope his next album will be more of the Twista that we've known in the past with hard beats and fast flows that didn't have 95% R Kellyish lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Women","review":"First off I am from the southside of Chicago 76-92 era.

This seems either rushed or he said 4get it these idots want know this is thrown 2gether. Why Kayne West did not produce one track, what's up with that???

All his life he's been very active. This situation was sad for us and for him. A friend brought a treat for him which included some Happy Hips. The treats were gobbled quickly. Over the next week or two we began to notice a huge change in our Eskie's behavior. He was more energetic. He seemed to want to go for those long walks again. We have bought Happy Hips twice now. I'm getting ready to order again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"My dogs LOVE these treats!! I can't say enough good things about them.

Additionally, he feels like a very special Good Boy with each treat. He loves them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eatwell chicken strip treats","review":"These are the favorite treats for my Chow Chow! She definitely prefers them to her natural dried dog food. She weighs about 80 lbs and I give her three to six strips each day. She is a stubborn dog, but I can always get her to come with the chicken strips. I'm also happy that they contain the recognized ingredients to help the joints of older dogs like mine (she is 11)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"I threw away my bag of chicken jerky after hearing about the FDA warning on chicken jerky products made in China. Looking on the back of the bag, it says this product is made in China so I will not be buying it again. It's not worth the future health of my pet, despite how much they may love their jerky treats. I'm on the lookout now for a USA made alternative. Put your pets first, not you wallet. It may cost more to buy USA made, but it is worth it in the long run if your dogs avoid dying an early death that could have been avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"This book does a good job of discussing why groundwater extraction (pump and treat or whatever else you want to call it) is not useful for cleanup of petroleum contaminated sites, rendering it best suited for hydraulic control of plumes.The author also has a pretty good discussion regarding lifecycle design considerations and the various steps to go through/questions to ask with regard to effluent treatment and equipment sizing.Some of the technology descriptions appears to be taken from design of remediation systems by suthersan, but both books were published by the same company so i guess that shouldn't really be a surprise. Both books offer different perspectives, so I find them both to be pretty useful, however, I like this one a little more because the author seems to be more of a practical guy whereas suthersan is more theoretical.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of the design and correct application of remediation technologies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The Smackaroos Diet Treats Garlic Lob Carb Crackers arrived in a baggie, not sealed and were stale"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"Shipping was fast.

So Im stuck with it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't expect a miracle","review":"I don't doubt that this Monster brand unit is probably the best built of all the brands of FM transmitters, but I did notice that it cuts off the high end significantly. I have a portable device with a built-in EQ, and even with the top end boosted all the way it didn't sound quite right. It reduces the overall sound quality to FM quality (or less) and I noticed occasional chuffing noise in the background during quiet songs. The transmitted music is quieter than real FM broadcasts, which is true of all FM transmitters - they really should build in a small line-level amplifier to these things, it wouldn't be that hard to do. On the upside, the transmitter never \\"lost\\" the signal.In summary, this is a good cheap temporary solution if you don't have any other recourse, like if you're going on a long trip (maybe in a rental car) and don't want to be driven crazy by bad FM programming, but it's not at all equivalent to a basic line level radio input."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Very Well","review":"I bought this product based on the great reviews I saw and I am very, very pleased with this product. Everyone I know has had a hard time finding a FM transmitter that works and sounds good. This product WORKS and it the music SOUNDS GOOD. The only setback is that I found only one station in my area that is completely compatible with the device. However, that one station works great. I highly recommend this if you just want to listen to your own music on your ipod or mp3 rather than all of the crap on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works...decently.","review":"This transmitter works pretty well, I live in a fairly large city and when I am anywhere near the city, there is a lot of interference. Sometimes vehicles drive by that have their own transmitter working and it overpowers my signal, so I get their transmission clearer than my own signal.Today, after 4 months of owning it, it has stopped broadcasting the signal to my left speakers, so I am only getting sound on the right side.You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gadget","review":"When my nephew told me about FM transmitters I had to have one. I had just purchased a new Sony MP3 player and subscribed to Napster, but the stereo system in my car had no plug-in for the player. I researched many products and decided to purchase the Monster RadioPlay FM Transmitter.I am so pleased with this gadget. It's very easy to set up and use, and I have no transmission problems, no static, no interference from other stations. The only gripe I have is that I have to turn the volume all the way up on the player to hear it on the car radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of static","review":"This thing will work on one station decently until you take a turn on the highway (or go under power lines) and it goes to static. Works better when you hold it, but are you going to hold it while you're driving? I don't like the limited number of preset stations you can tune to either. Plus it transmits the music quietly, meaning that you have to have the volume of your stereo and the player turned way up and sometimes even that isn't the volume I want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"I went from using a cassette type system to play my blackberry music thru my car stereo. The quality was actually better than this unit. The stations available are pre-set and you cannot change them. Unfortunately, the majority of stations are in use locally for me. The remaining stations are fuzzy and moving the phone and unit around in the car create crackling. Bottom line, for under $14 I will continue to use it as its good enough for a tone deaf gent like myself. If it ceases to work I will most definitely spend a bit more for stations I can set myself and a bit higher quality.*Two months after purchase this unit blew out my cigarette lighter and rear tail lights...buyer beware!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent item","review":"I had previously had a similar item from a different manufacturer. It stopped working so I purchased one of these. I am very pleased with this transmitter. I've had no trouble with it at all. I use it both with my Ipod Nano and also sometimes with my laptop. It works great. One thing I do like is the way you select the FM channel. The previous one I had the channel selector was part of the plug that goes into the lighter. The problem is that on our Honda Odyssey the lighter plug is down near the floor board. Making it very difficult to adjust when stopped and almost impossible when traveling because you couldn't see the display. The Monster unit has the selector as part of the cord. It comes with 8 presets that cover most of the lower range. It's much easier to work with. Overall I'm very pleased with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far exceeded my expectations!","review":"I was skeptical about getting an FM transmitter after reading many many opinions and reviews about transmitters in general, not just this model. But I have not been let down yet. The sound is crystal clear, no static, no interference. Have tried it in more than 3 different vehicles, no problems at all. Very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Wireless FM transmitter","review":"I got what I paid for!

Interviews with all the major bandmates (Anderson, Bruford, Howe, Wakeman, White, Squire, Rabin, Kaye) telling all the stories they remember from 1969 to 1991 , the union tour. And the footage from the archives of their various concerts, from rehearsal halls, and just other fooling around in general is awesome. They did good with this video. A must have for all Yesfans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE- THIS IS NOT A CONCERT DVD","review":"This DVD is a rip-off just like the 35th anniversary tour video Yesspeak. There is not one complete tune in the whole disk. While there are a few interesting clips of YES's earliest years that I have never seen before, it would have been nice to have complete versions of their music, but instead, just as you start getting into a tune, it cuts away to a band member's interview comments.Adding to the insult is the fact that this DVD was so cheaply produced, there isn't a booklet or even a single sheet inside. The graphics on the outer cover are also poorly done, and the whole thing looks like it was reproduced on a color copier.Too bad such a great band released such an awful product. It could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rockumentary","review":"If you're not familiar with the music of Yes then you will find this DVD very frustrating as it doesn't contain any complete songs. For fans of the band it's a must. Interviews with all of the band members, as of 1991, with no holds barred in terms of conflicts and issues that occured within the band during it's history. At times the guys come off as a bit arrogant, but why not, in a genre that rewards mindless drivel they were willing to push the envelope and wound up succeeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either Love or Hate","review":"I don't want to bash this film, but honestly, if i knew what it was before renting it i wouldn't have gotten it.

Even if it were plausible that these were amanita mushrooms, do you think that this type of trip would have been likely....losing consciousness...to the point that you dont remember what happened during the trip? I dont think so...only someone utterly ignorant of the effects of psychedelics would posit such a thing.So, that part is not realistic at all.

Just when you think you have the movie figured out, it spins you in the complete opposite direction and then takes you to places you never thought existed.An especially memorable scene is one of the hallucination scenes in which everyone just turns to sand.

Instead of maintaining the advertised 1.85:1 ratio on a 1.78:1 HDTV screen by matting it (the black bars on the top and bottom), it stretches the movie to fill the screen. I suppose most people don't notice this, which is why the studio thought it was okay, but I'm sensitive to this kind of thing. Everyone's head looks too long!

Things were taken out that made the plot confusing and even worse some thing were left in that did not make the story flow. The last two hours are disjointed and for some reason goes away from the Protagonist. We don't see him.The ending had to be re-done because the original ending was a cliffhanger for the following season. The ending totally reeks. It is really, really bad.

It's also boring, worst of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Years","review":"For the few people who remember this tv miniseries - be warned. This DVD has a version with a different ending.

But when I got into it, it intrigued me enough to sit through the whole thing (in two sessions - it's a VHS two-reeler on the long side).See the other reviews for plot details. It's an intriguing premise. The chemically-dusted protagonist comes only gradually to realize he is growing younger. The slow unfolding of that proposition occurs like artichoke leaves being peeled back, well done. The byplay between the elderly couple (Keith Szarabaika and Frances Sternhagen) is very well acted, sweet and almost believable. The heroine Terry (Felicity Huffman) is nice eye candy. The villain Jude (R.D. Call) is duly evil but somewhat over the top. But much of the other acting is truly over the top - the \\"mad scientist\\" Toddhunter, the Major, the hippies, etc. Those exaggerated, caracaturish personae get in the way of what began as a promising plot. The ending leaves one kinda unfulfilled, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Film","review":"My New favorite Stephen King film. Not a horror film in standard King tradition.

The directing was extemely poor and the plot confusing. The \\"mad scientist\\" was so over the top that it was a farce. The only saving grace in this whole affair was the acting of Keith Szarabajka (one of the Equalizer's sidekicks!). His role as a janitor who suddenly begins to grow more youthful is well acted. At no time does his performance seem forced or artificial. His contribution is the only reason I forced myself to watch through to the end. For those who are actually looking for a movie with plot, script and direction....my advice is to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Golden Years","review":"When I ordered this video it stated on the form that it was Closed Caption.

By lying down and allowing herself to be raped to get the information. The book is all downhill from there. Less a memoir of a former radical turned yuppie crying out for redemption, this is a cry for help from a deeply disturbed, hypocritical woman who simply found more of her kind and decided to blow things up, maiming innocent people in the process.

I rarely cut myself with the inexpensive (generic double blade) razors I usually use, but with the Intuition Razor I've knicked myself every time, often more than once. Also if your hands are soapy it slips out of grip frequently. That's very annoying when you're trying to take care not to cut yourself.

Lastly, after a few uses the soap part wore down substantially."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This razor is very poor - the razor blades have rusted alomst instantly which I think is very dangerous.

In addition I saw the play at theater in the round where Rex Harrison's son took the role of Henry. Both were throughly entertaining and prompted my purchase of the DVD.I likely classify myself as a senior citizen by admitting to liking this musical so much. Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn are very good as Henry Higgins and Elisa Doolittle. However it's Elisa's ne'er do well father that steals the show. This musical dates back to the time when it was common to include more than one memorable song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anybody who gives this movie less than 5 stars is foolish!","review":"This movie is outstanding in every way. The acting, the music, the costumes, the sets, I could go on and on. The movie is far more than just decent and anyone who can't see that would have to be somewhat of a fool! Even though Julie Andrews had already played Eliza on Broadway (and may have seemed more suited for the role in the movie ) Audrey Hepburn does a very good job and adds incomparable charm to the role in one of her best performances. I have also heard that Audrey could sing quite well but that her voice was not what they wanted for the film and she was dubbed. The music is wonderful too and I love the romantic story. If you have not seen it yet you definitely should!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray is a dud. What a shame !","review":"So sad. Such a great film, but I've given it such a low rating. What a disapointment Why is the Blu-ray disc PQ so bad? Yes, there are some well lit scenes that are outstanding, but there are many, many more shots that are dull, flat, and just plain poor picture quality.

I'll wait for the remastered version...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound alignment and visual sharpness","review":"In addition to fuzzyness and glowing halos mentioned in other reviews, my version has a horrible alignment of sound track and lip movements, almost like they were originally speaking in Chinese. The singing portions are even more out-of (lip) sync. No credits at the end at all except for the \\"restorers\\". Pure garbage version of one of my favorite musicals. I didn't check for English subtitles, which I usually show on my Movie Night Parties with my international friends (who could hardly be expected to follow all the diverse accents in this movie), but if the reviews saying they do not exist are true, makes it an even worse choice.

I love absolutely everything about it: the songs, the acting, the exsquisite costumes, beautiful sets, the delightful humor and the brilliant acting. This movie defines what great musicals are all about. Audrey Hepburn, what can I say. She played the role of the coarse and unrefined flower girl Eliza Dolittle to absolute perfection. The way she played the role was so convincing and the way she could grasp that cockney accent was sheer brilliance. Rex Harrison as the role of the bitter and sexist pig Professor Higgins, was amazing. I must say that not only is he sexy but his acting proved to be nothing more than perfect. Rex and Audrey make a terrific team in this movie, they really shine.

The story of poor girl makes good is lavishly portrayed in one of the most successful transformations from stage to screen. The exquisite Audrey Hepburn proves more than a match for Rex Harrison and the rest of the consummate cast. Lovers of period costume will delight in the wardrobe, and those that enjoy the charm of the musical lyric will be captivated by Marni Nixon's renditions. This will also appeal to the Anglophile who can never get enough of the London of old. Both sad and funny My Fair Lady is a bittersweet confection that will be sure to delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fair movie","review":"My Fair Lady is a good film and definitely worth watching. Storyline is good up until the ending. For some reason, the ending is flat for me.

Should Audrey Hepburn have been in it? Should she have used her own voice? That's all good and fun and important questions. What drives me insane however isn't Hepburn at all, but Rex Harrison. He has most of the songs and he ISN'T SINGING!!!!! Give me a pitched! Just once! PLEASE!!! I never know if I'm listening to a musical number or not because the dang man won't sing. So I can't hum along with any of these songs and get them stuck in my head because as far as I've ever heard, they don't have melodies. I'm not sure why this never gets brought up, but to me it seems this is a musical without music. It's like telling me the movie is in color and then it's all in black and white or telling me that the movie is a scary movie and giving me a chick flick instead. Get a main cast who can sing/are allowed to sing.Oh, and change the ending.

The sound is great, but the quality of the picture transfer is lousey to say the least. It looks a lot better on DVD. At least it does on my 65 inch Vizio TV. Both sides of the picture are out of focus and lack color. Be sure you rent this before you buy to see how it looks on your system. I am very disapointed with CBS (Fox) for ruining this film. If any of you remember the Fox Tod-A-O release of \\"Oklahoma\\" on DVD and how \\"bad\\" it looked, this is another disaster by Fox.

It's definitely not in the same league as \\"Ben-Hur\\", \\"The Sound of Music\\" and \\"The Ten Commandments\\" important blockbuster roadshow films of the mid-century which got releases worthy of their stature.But \\"My Fair Lady\\", in 1964 the most eagerly awaited film since \\"Gone With the Wind\\", and the winner of numerous Oscars, including Best Picture, has been dismissed in a mediocre single-disc transfer which does not do justice to the BluRay format.

(He ought to have been at ease. He played the role for two years on Broadway!) Stanley Holloway is wonderful, and gladys Cooper is good, too. Though Julie Andrews would have been good, Audrey Hepburn is charming, beautiful, and graceful, and is absolutly perfect once she loses the Cockney accent, which gets to be pretty annoying. (It's at its best when Marni Nixon dubs Audrey in the songs \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly?\\" and \\"Just You Wait\\".) These are reasons enough for seeing the movie, and don't let the news that it drags stop you. Yes, the begining gets to be a bit much, and there are plenty of scenes that could have been trimmed.

So my one-star rating refers to this Blu-ray release and not the film itself. My first reaction to watching this blu-ray was disbelief; waiting 3 years for the blu-ray release thinking (hoping) that the delay was due to their working with the on the original 65mm negatives. NOT!! The quality of this transfer is IDENTICAL to the DVD, (i.e., poor in both cases); in fact I did a back to back comparision of the bluray with the upconverted DVD (using an Oppo player and a 100\\" projection screen). Additionally, the quality of the DTS HD surround is NO BETTER than the compressed DD on the DVD. DO NOT buy this blu-ray if you already have the DVD. If you do not have the DVD, I suppose you should go ahead an buy it - but do not expect it to do justice to your high-def TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BLU RAY DISGRACE!","review":"If this were lets say Valley of the Dolls or Barbarella, it would be accceptable, but this is a classic of the American Cinema and after three viewings of this sub par Blu Ray, I am still in shock! This is most distressing since the restoration team of Harris and Katz took great pains in bringing back this film from oblivion in 1994. What makes matters worse is this BLU RAY has the best sound of any previous issue which is no consulation since nothing, I mean nothing was done to bring the video to Blu Ray standards. As a matter of fact it is worse than any previous DVD issue. Something must be done. If we can get prestine BLU RAY transfers of Sound of Music, Ben-Hur and Ten Commandments, there is no excuse for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cinematic treat for just about anyone","review":"The long-running broadway musical was finally brought to the screen in glorious fashion. Based on George Bernard Shaw's play \\"Pygmalion\\", this film is chock-full of immortal musical numbers and contains perhaps the best acting performances of both Rex Harrison (Henry Higgins) and Audrey Hepburn (Eliza Doolittle). It's a bit longer than the average picture, but every minute is wonderfully entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"I have two quibbles with the version I got:1) the songs of Audrey Hepburn are dubbed.2) the version I got was shorted to take out the girl learning to dancefor the ball.A big George Bernard Shaw fan, I actually saw this when it came outin 1965 ( I think) while in college.I loved seeing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful commentary on the wrong track","review":"\\"My Fair Lady\\" turned me into a big fan of Audrey. I have grown very fond of the British culture with the language drillling, the high tea, the Ascot Day and many other plots in the film. From the bonus material on Disc 2, I found reservoirs of information about the film, which was produced well before I was born. Even the commentary in the Disc 1 was very informative. The sound mixing was so poor that I tried several times to foucs on the commentary but failed. To some points, I was so annoyed that I tried to deactivate the sound track of the actors and the commentors but failed again. I would rather WB put it in a separate disc. Like what Eliza's father said, \\"I am willing to pay extra for this. I am waiting to pay extra for this. I am wanting to pay extra for this.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best musical","review":"I have to be honest in that I am not a huge fan of musicals. I watch them mostly to placate my wife. That said, my wife and I saw the London production company last Sunday afternoon do this one at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC.Monday afternoon after we came home, we got out this version and watched it again. If you have the opportunity to see this musical, either in person staged by a quality production company or on this DVD, please do so. This is a wonderful story that gets richer in multiple tellings. My Fair Lady is like an old friend. Every time I see it I am happy with it.This particular edition also gives insight into the production process that helps to connect with where the play came from.A definite \\"must have!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"Classic film that allows new generations, as my children, appreciate the film classic and amazing actors missing and they could not know"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast service","review":"The DVD was in excellent shape.

However, I fear this film version sometimes seems a bit leaden, despite its lavish production. Old greats Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway, having done it to death on Broadway for years, sometimes seem to be going through the paces, and Audrey Hepburn, alas, is no Julie Andrews in this role. (Though at least Julie got to go and make \\"Mary Poppins\\" while this was being filmed.) Some musical numbers are dragged out too long by Hollywood's attempt to turn them into big dazzling numbers. Of course it's hard to ruin this great show, and it's always fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"my fait lady blu ray..paramount how dare you!!","review":"Unfortunately My Fair Lady is no longer owned by CBS or Warner Bro any longer. As seems to be the sad truth with the distribution rights of many classic films these days, they are getting passed around the table from one studio to the other as contracts and copyrights expire. Now Paramount has inherited My Fair Lady. Paramount it seems is becoming known for poor blu ray transfers of older films, and My Fair Lady is now the culmination of that lazy and cheap culture.Unfortunately, this means that we will most likely have to wait 10-15 years before someone else does another printing in whatever home video format out does blu ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLU-RAY not as bad as some of the reviews","review":"The first DVD of My Fair Lady is a knockout and almost flawless, the second release not so much, but the BLU-Ray is a mixed bag, I see none of the speckels some complain of, there are no shots that are out of focus unless you are talking about the hazy effect found on some edges, these are clearly visible and distracting, I wish Warner had the rites to this film and that it underwent the same transfer solution as The Wizard of Oz or The Sound of Music, the DTS HD Master audio is stunning, if it cost more I would pan it, but for $16+ I can put up with the few scenes that have haze problems because all in all it is sharper on my 110\\" screen than either of the DVD releases, lets hope for a future rerelease that is done with more precision"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ars gratia artis or Auri sacra fames ?","review":"This Blu-ray of 'My Fair Lady' is not in the least what a Blu-rayought to be. It's merely the image of a DVD stored on a carrier ofbigger capacity and with higher resolution. I'd like to call thatpixellaneous dissipation.The late Jack Warner spent a great deal of money to produce thismasterpiece - too much, so he couldn't afford to secure the rightsof further distribution. If one - like CBS - has the privilege ofhaving obtained these legal rights, one should have the appropriateobligation to care for such a work of art with due respect.That - I regret to ascertain - they have not done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish Transfer","review":"A wonderful classic movie musical has been given an appalling transfer to high definition. It moves, shakes and wobbles throughout the entire running time. Image quality is highly variable. There are severe color issues on the left and right sides of the image, especially notable in darker scenes. This is one of the worst transfers of a 70MM production that I have seen. The only positive is that the audio is a marked improvement on the standard DVD. Avoid and let's hope a fix is forthcoming - but don't hold your breath waiting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Fair Lady Blu-ray - Buyer Beware - wait for fix","review":"\\"My Fair Lady\\" is one of the greatest musical films ever produced.The Blu-ray looks good - but a defect in the transfer leaves the image a bit lighter at the far left and right edges of the screen - It looks like you're watching the film in a theater - and someone left the side theater doors open allwoing the lobby light to pour in vs. watching the film in a completely dark theater.Wait for CBS/Paramount to correct the problem before ordering"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on You CBS !!!","review":"My Fair Lady is the 1964 Oscar winner for Best Picture and is one of the very best musicals ever made; it is a classic that deserves the same stellar treatment that The Sound of Music and Ben-Hur received. CBS's indifference to one of its crown jewels is an insult to the artists who made it and to the consumer who is frustrated and being asked to pay for its substandard quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexcusable!","review":"For what was one of the most publicized restorations in film history, it is totally inexcusable for CBS to have released this inferior transfer. I got through less than 5 minutes of the Blu Ray disc and simply couldn't take it any longer. The opening credit sequence is grainy and once the film moves into the film proper, there is a weird hazy fog that circles the center part of the frame. This is downright horrible. The discs should be recalled and destroyed. This would be bad for any film, but for what is considered one of the greatest film musicals ever made its downright criminal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Old Hollywood Production","review":"Nothing more can be added to what has been already said by the Braodway & film critics and the general public. To remake this film today would be very difficult from the standpoint of finding the right talent and experience for such a production. Hollywood is too much into the coarsening up of the culture and making political statements to bring such a refined flower to the screen. Making a sucessful screen adaptation of a Broadway musical is perhaps the most difficult thing to do in the movie business. Sadly film musical have not fared well with the public in the last 20-30 years. Hence, the studios are reluctant to make any new big-budget efforts.To the reviewer in Perth, Australia, Givenchy, my bloomin' a**. It was designer/photographer Cecil Beaton who did the costume designs for this film production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous movie","review":"Absolutely beautiful.

Who was superbly spectacular- no one could take place. Which is why i can't stand watching this movie! Audrey Hepburn (who was only good in Breakfast At Tiffany's) was horribly mis-cast! First of all, Audrey cannot even sing! She was dubbed- and Marni nixon (the one who dubbed her)isn't even that good. Julie Andrews acted and sung the pact perfectly. But it's ok because Julie won an Academy Award the year My Fair Lady came out anyway- for Mary Poppins- Audrey wasn't even nominated- with good reason too. And you gotta love Rex Harrison, who also created the role of henry higgins alongside Julie Andrews on Broadway. Because Rex fought and fought to get Julie Andrews on the movie of My Fair Lady. This movie is nothing because julie is not in it- (...)But, we later found out that even Jack Warner voted for Julie at the Academy Awards- which she won!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!","review":"The DVD does not work in Ireland so it is absolutely useless!!

Julie should have had this role. The songs are good in this musical but other than that the plot stinks. Unfortunately the songs are not nearly as well sang. Marni Nixion sounds alright but is not Julie. I listened to Audrey's version's of some songs and no offense to a good actress, but she can not sing, not like Julie. So do yourself a favor and buy the original broadway recording to here Julie's beautiful voice. Or better yet watch THe Sound of Music.

Not knowing the Swan Lake was a story in it's own right, with the same characters adn damn near the same plot, I couldn't even deplore the lack of originality displayed.But this! Oh no!Heaven forbid Disney come up with a sequel that is, oh, you know, GOOD. And trust me, I've watched them all. (hey, I do have a little cousin...) Mulan II - heaven help me. Aladdin II - heaven help you. Swan Princess II - heaven help the person who wrote it. Cos God knows, no one else should.

To whomever, I say \\"Thanks\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Cosmic Slop'","review":"Of all of Funkadelic's Westbound albums, this one, in my opinion, was the most R&B sounding. The concept, on the other hand, was as deep as any of Funkadelic's LP's. It was like Holland/Dozier/Holland on acid. The title cut was one of the most tragic songs in music history: A mother having to sell her body to feed her children. Deep. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that this album, despite a couple of up-beat tunes, was probably the most disturbing and sorrowful album that Funkadelic ever put out. The gritty, urban realism of 'Cosmic Slop' pre-dates the realism of modern Rap music by over 20 years.George Clinton and his crew were way, way ahead of their time."},{"rating":"2","title":"original space age ...","review":"yeah funkadelic keeps it real if iceberg slim and dolemite hired kiss or jimmy page they would have made this truly underrated gary shider goes off with the title track then george deals with vietnam' ... addiction;tricks'and ... male and female too short damn sure took notes like ice cube'and dr.dre 'every othert underground rapper once again george must have been psychic"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"Wow, I like many, many different types of music, but this is really, really bad.

Way too many loose ends are left dangling. Where realism should happen (the dialogue, or the contrived meeting in the print shop cafeteria), there's melodrama and/or predictability.

It's great to use as an instructional text because it comes with questions and exercises on the various sections. It's up-to-date about using visuals in texts, and using the web to research, and authoring websites.

There is no end to the stream of evangelism and \\"share your faith\\" courses whereby Christians are told how best to present the gospel - usually in some new method of the author's devising. They all claim to base their model on the preaching of the gospel we see in the New Testament. Save your money and energy, bin them all, and read this. Dodd was not writing to promote some new scheme of gospel presentation. The result is no padding and concise discussion of what the Gospel is (if you think the Miracle/Jesus prayer or some other 20th century formula is it, think again!) according to the New Testament, and how it was preached. If you really want to preach the Gospel message, here's a good place to start learning how!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good writing, mediocre mystery","review":"Yeah, JT can write okay. The book wasn't boring. But as a mystery, this was a loser. The detective never solves the case, the killer simply confesses at the end.

Tey is highly regarded, but it probably isn't on account of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disatisfying Mystery","review":"To my mind, the basic understanding between a mystery writer and his/her reader is that an alert reader will be able to guess part, if not all, of the solution before the mystery unravels and the author reveals all. On that ground, Tey fails. The ultimate solution comes out of left field, makes a mockery of extensive investigation along many promising lines of questioning, and leaves the reader wondering -- why did I bother? If you want to read Tey, read Daughter of Time, which is much livelier. On the strength of that book, I bought all of her others, and read Man in the Queue and Shilling for Candles -- now the books are in the recycling bin. Not worth my time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Tey and the First Book of 2003 for Me.","review":"I read, this my first Tey mystery, because all mystery afficiondos should at least sample her writing. She is famous in the mystery world, and you need to read her in order to determine how we got to where we did with mystery writing. I enjoyed the story. She certainly puts enough twists and turns in her plots. The book is somewhat dated (it was written in 1929) after all, but she has a lot of talent. I liked Inspector Grant even though he really didn't solve this puzzler, but it was fun following him around in his quest for the killer. This is a rather unique format for a \\"locked room\\" mystery since the victim was stabbed outside in a theatre queue, but it appeared that no one had the opportunity to do the deed. I want to continue to read the rest of her books. She writes fairly complex stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the Titanic -- smooth sailing -- until ...","review":"I had mixed feeling about Josephine Tey. I thought \\"Daughter of Time\\" was overrated, but I really enjoyed \\"The Franchise Affair\\" and \\"Miss Pym Disposes\\". So when I came across of copy of \\"The Man in the Queue\\" at a bazaar sale, I invested $.50 and gave it a read.The story starts out with a clever murder. Inspector Grant faced with an unidentified victim and unknown motive begins bit by bit to glean pieces of information. This process is by far the best part of the book. Eventually, he identitifies and tracks down the prime suspect. Despite all the evidence, Grant remains unconvinced of the suspect's guilt and continues his investigations. Then \\"Deus Ex Machina\\" (translation: out of left field) comes the solution -- definitely not in the \\"fair play\\" category and very disappointing.Historians and critics of the mystery/detective genre may like \\"The Man in the Queue\\". Ordinary readers like me should skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like style...","review":"you'll like this mystery. I am not a big mystery fan; perhaps that's why I like Tey.

NOPE. Everything about this step is great until you go to put it in your receiver and then (2) issues arise: 1) there's no hitch pin... ok, not the end of the world; 2) the hitch pin hole is about 1/2\\" off, so while the step is retained in the receiver - it's slipping around enough that you would never trust it enough to stand on it. (which is kind of the point here!) I have a factory installed hitch on my Ford Expedition, I would imagine this is the same pin-hole offset that every other receiver has. So who's receivers are they designing this step for, I guess that's the real question - quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"hitch step","review":"Product works as advertised.

I don't know about you but I generally shave using the sharp edge of the blade only ... so, after the soap wears out on the leading edge [in about 3 legs-worth of shaving!], it is necessary to give a swipe of the razor in the opposite direction before actually shaving, in order to get any soaping action. This seemed to double my shaving time rather than shorten it. I wish I could express more effectively just how much I hate this product. I also wish I could get that darn song out of my head ...

If I hang my towels in just the right way I can get them to slightly hover over the ground. It's fine, I keep my floors clean.What they do well is they provide a decent amount of space between the two rungs so two big towels can hang together and not touch. WHICH means they air dry better.

I have read many books about Christianity and several have been good, but very few have left a lasting impact. But this book is different. This book asks the tough questions that many don't dare or care to ask. It re-examines the modern evangelical church through the lens of historic early Christianity.If you've ever read the New Testament and looked at the church of the first century, and then looked at the church today and wondered why they look almost nothing alike - read this book.If you are tired of doing church and want to dig deeper into what it means to BE the church - read this book.If you've ever wondered what the Christians closest to Christ and the Apostles believed about God's Word - read this book.If you are comfortable with the status-quo, it is definitely not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the 1st edition better than the 3rd.","review":"Yes, I read the 1st edition and loved it. I latter lost it which is why I'm buying a new one. I bought the 3rd edition which I believe left out a lot from the first. I have been reading the works of the early fathers off and on now for 4 years and what bercot says in this book about Baptism, the Lord's supper, the wealth and health dogma, salvation, evolution, our culture and Roman culture is right on the money. I must admit that when I first read the 1st edition 3 years ago I was shaken. But the Church today needs to be shook and it is a good thing to research these things from the primary sources so that noone can tell you that they didn't believe it because they did. Also I have noticed that those from a Reformed background have a tendency to hate this book, while those who are not tend to like it. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting....","review":"Mr. Bercot has done his homework. However, the general premise of this book is that we should look to the early Christian writings to guide us in our understanding of the Bible. He generally has a good understanding of the aforesaid writings, but his emphasis on the authority of these writings is unsettling. He almost equates the works of Clement, Tertullian, and Justin Martyr with the works of Paul, Peter, John, and Moses. In my opinion, the works of the fathers shows how quickly heresy moved into mainstream Christianity, not how the truth remained to be upheld."},{"rating":"1","title":"As other reviewers have said, be cautious","review":"A Master of Divinity does not a scholar make (far from it, in most cases).

It is disturbing how much the author actually uses some of the early non-canonical,christian writings as the means to interpret the God breathed Holy Scriptures.If Cyprian, or Justin said it, that's good enough for David W.

Maybe if we lived in the Middle East but here in America it's a whole different story. I pray I never have to endure the pain and hardship the 1st and 2nd century disciples did. Though I long to be as spiritual and faithful as them. This book has some sobering challenges about how we live too materialistically. I know I could live without my stuff but it's like sin; once you've experienced it it's hard not to want it again. I don't miss living in mansions or having servants since I never did, but take away my indoor plumbing electronic entertainment and even just freedom to drive down the street and it's a real challenge to imagine getting by without. Thank God for all the blessings you have and never forget how good you got it. Now get out there and be spiritual. This book will help you do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read for serious Christians, thoughtful insights","review":"An excellent review by the author (a lawyer) on practices of early Christendom; very challenging to all Christians. As with any good book I like, I don't agree with everything it says. For example, being a neo-Evangelical seminarian (Gordon-Conwell Theo. Seminary) and church member, we spend a good deal of time in church history, so this might not be an issue for some churches/people. (Thus, I'd feel that he was beating a dead horse in my Bible study.) Pros: Most people would enjoy this book, and Christendom would be better if we read this and took it to heart. Good narratives and quotes. Good treatment on some issues (divorce, entertainment, following Christ, persecution/suffering). Cons: In addition, author is not good at correlating/contextualizing issues to present day. Author is not as well-studied on theology/philosophy, nor biblical languages, which are critical for doing good theology, preaching, and exegesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Church That Dissappeared","review":"While I give Bercot one star for at least acknowledging the genuine faith and practice of the pre-Nicene Fathers his dismissal of Constantine as a sort of anti-christ who was primarily responsible for the Church rushing headlong into apostacy shows his complete unfamiliarity with that era and ignorance of what it mean't to be a Christian in the early Church. It was somewhat surprising that having begun this work by positively showing the post apostolic fathers as faithfully adhering to the gospel he suddenly with the appearence of Constantine literally proclaims that Satan finally figured out how to prevail against Christ's Church and contrary to Christ'spromise conquers it after 300 plus years.At least Mr. Bercot admits unlike many Evangelicals there is at least something worthwhile in post 70 a.d. Christianity. If only he could see the promise of Christ extending past Constantine and Nicea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosopher King-Sized Social Epistemology","review":"I must agree with the review that appeared this week in the TLS (Times Literary Supplement, London, 27.01.00), which managed to describe the book without talking about the social character of knowledge - except to say that Goldman has a 'dirigiste' view of how knowledge should be controlled and communicated in society. His own euphemism is 'epistemic paternalism', and readers might want to judge for themselves what it all means, once the dogmatic philosophising and gratuitous formalising is removed. This reader found the implications rather scarey, though luckily this philosophical stuff rarely gets beyond the seminar room. A definite step from back (and away) from Fuller's work on social epistemology - and even more conservative types like Kitcher and Longino."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Autumnal Album....","review":"A more perfect Autumnal composition of music there could not be!

But in recent years certain acts (Alan Jackson to name one) have tried to force country music into a set, monotone pattern. Mark Mcquinn breaks free of that mold, and shatters it to pieces with his highly original album! That's a plan and Mrs. Steven Rudy are probably the best examples of Mark's creativity. While \\"She DOesn't Dance\\" proves that when he wants to, Mark can be a country crooner. I highly reccomend this album to anyone looking for an escape from cookie-cutter-country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mrs. S. Rudy great, the rest trite.","review":"I just bought this CD and I'm so disappointed! The zip, pop, fun of the first song released completely evaporates to where he'll sing a line and I'll be able to guess the next one, even if it means cramming in lots of clumsy syllables.

The product has changed and is inferior to what it used to be, or else just this lot is defective. It is very hard to apply, almost like it's rolling off the lips instead of onTO them--almost like there is a coating of wax preventing it from being absorbed or something; it does not seem to help to sharpen with a pencil sharpener either.. It also makes little chips of pencil color that break off on the lips and are impossible to blend in.

Looks really nice, especially after using a little teak oil like they suggest. Problem was with the actual delivery. The box came really destroyed and with no hardware for putting together. Called the 800 number of the company and they said they would ship out a package, which they did, but it took over a week. The huge box had to sit in my hallway for all that time. Also, when I told them about the UPS delivery and the destroyed box, they asked how I ordered it. When I told them Amazon, they said Amazon must be getting their leftovers, because they weren't the ones who shipped it. After all that, the bench looks really, really nice for the $200."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice solid bench at a reasonable price","review":"This is a good looking solid bench at an attractive price. The curved back and seat make it more comfortable than most other benches. After I finished it with teak oil, it looked very attractive. Very satisfied with this purchase.

They start out sleeping in soft brown clothes and they spruce up into bright colors to greet the springtime. The pictures are absolutely brilliant, fresh and innocent, colorful and joyful with satisfying details in the flowers and little critters.

That said, the show itself is fun, and what a hoot to see Bobby Sherman and David Soul in their \\"Brides\\" roles! Bridget Hanley is lovely, and her spunky character makes a good counterpoint to the rather bombastic Robert Brown (a graduate from the same acting school as William Shatner, from all appearances).

It is about family, love, and new beginnings. I loved seeing so many well known actors, too, at a very young age-like Bruce Lee. I will confess-I was (and still am) a Bobby Sherman fan! Buying this set is a sure thing. I look forward to the second season when it is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally","review":"I can't wait! This has been a long time coming.

Co-stars are David Soul (Starsky & Hutch,) Mark Lenard (Star Trek,) Bridget Hanley (Harper Valley PTA,) teen idol Bobby Sherman, the hilarious Susan Tolsky and Henry Beckman, and the fabulous Joan Blondell. The series' star, Robert Brown, is probably the handsomest actor ever to grace the small screen.Only nitpick I have...no extras on this DVD set? No interviews, comments, bloopers, or outtakes?

This is definitely one of the better foreign zombie films around, not the best, but better than 80% of them. I'm not going to go into the plot as other reviewers of this film have already given out way too much info.If you liked the filmIdle Hands, then you've got a pretty good idea of what this film will be like...just with Irish accents and zombies and Samantha Mumba instead of Jessica Alba.If you collect zombie films, you'll want to buy this one.If you're just a casual viewer of zombie films you'll probably just want to rent this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I admit it, I expected extreme hokiness with this one. In fact, I rented it and then let it sit on top of the TV for a week because I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch it.Surprising well done, decent story, and not the ultra low budget I had expected. A nice blend of comedy, with some scares built in, the characters were likable, the actors actually had a decent degree of talent, the story made sense, and it wasn't overdone.I recommend this to fans of the horror genre, and those looking for a few laughs here and there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better zombie films that I have seen.","review":"This film is well produced, well acted, has well done gore, and is entertaining to watch.

It prepares beginners but it may also be intimidating. It is a lot to learn at the beginning, not an easy introduction at all. But that is not the worst. What is really negative in this course is its poor organisation and there are also some mistakes here and there. Unit 1 starts with How are you? which makes sense. Then unit 3 deals with food, What does it taste like?, unit 6 moves on to Did you study in Jalandhar?, but unit 7 goes back to the basics of food with What will you have to drink? On the positive side there is good input of native speakers in this course.

It is packed with wonderful drawings of babies doing all sorts of silly things, such as \\"Babies kick and babies crawl, slide their potties down the hall.\\" He enjoys the rhymes, but he LOVES all those pictures of the babies playing with things like \\"shoes and hats, sleeping cats,...an empty box, and Daddy's socks.\\" It is a great book for beginning readers (especially those expecting a new baby brother or sister) because the print is large and well spaced.

The book was very thin and really did not go into much detail. The author only alludes to what Elvis might have been thinking/feeling etc. or quotes what others have stated. The whole book felt like a term-paper I might have written at the end of high school. Being a huge Elvis Costello fan, I really expected more from this book. The book is divided up into three sections. The first section is the bio. The second is a discography (available at almost every EC website) a complete waste of paper (but given that the bio portion is so short the author probably needed to fill the pages with something). I only wish I had read a review of this book prior to pre-ordering it. I've learned my lesson.

I have been haunted by the story since I first read the book two years ago. I too can visualize the story being a movie or an afterschool special. The ending made me turn back to page 1 and begin again. There are very few books I can ever say that about!

I wanted everything to work out for the main characters, as I wanted my own mixed marriage to flourish. Neither was the case, but the story let me know that I was not alone in the things I was experiencing and the validity of my reactions to them. These characters have stayed with me for decades now, and a writing course I'm taking just asked us all to list the most memorable characters we had encountered in fiction. That set me on a quest to see if anyone else had ever heard of \\"Five Smooth Stones.\\" Apparently enough so to ensure its reprint!It is a long story -- but so, hopefully, is life.Read this along with Maya Angelou's \\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\" for the value of the poignant stories each portrays.

The story is told throughthe voice of Amy the 11 year old. She descibes the life of her family and life for the outside the home- school, segregation, etc. The books seems as though it could be autobiographical describing both the good and the bad of this family and the community. The author brings dignity to the characters and to their surroundings. Amy and Aunt Minne were my favorites. Though a dysnfunctional family there still is a story of hope, survial,and endurance. I look forward to reading other books by Mary Burnett Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was more like a year in the life of Amy","review":"It appears that Amy had a difficult year when the family moved. She had many more issues than her father womanizing, gambling and drinking. Her red hair was a problem for her.

Too bad it wasn't a giveaway item. Be advised that the four Beach Boys tracks seem to be alternate studio takes or demos. It's no wonder they used the other, better versions. The Jan and Dean tracks are better, but still probably not those you heard on the radio. And one isn't even close to being a 'surf' tune. The tracks from The Deltas (actually Jim Waller and the Delta's, I believe) are not too bad. But they're a bit off the path for surf instrumentals. For a better mix of surf music, I kind of like 'The Best of Surf Rock, Vol 1&2' or Rhino's 'Rock Instrumental Classics, Vol. 5 (Surf)'. If you really want a Beach Boys compilation, get 'Endless Summer'."},{"rating":"2","title":"DoesTHE FIRST IMMORTAL have a flaw?","review":"Well, it makes you want to read too fast, to find out what happens next. But reading fast reduces the impact and makes you miss some important nuances, so you don't get the full benefit. Maybe it will be like the movie TITANIC. Some people have seen it a dozen times. If a lot of people re-read THE FIRST IMMORTAL a dozen times, things could change on this planet faster than otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone wanting to see the next millenium.","review":"If I was a decent author and not just an amateur critic, I might know what Jim Halperin needed to do to improve his book. Stylistically, there were a few rough edges that I couldn't quite put my finger on. But that's beside the point. I want my family and friends to read this book. I won't recommend it to them because I expect them to be entertained (although I certainly was), but because Mr. Halperin has done a fantastic job of piecing together a highly credible vision of the future- and how we might all find ourselves living in it, indefinitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I skipped the last 100 pages...","review":"The idea of cryonics is a fascinating one, but the fiction writing seemed very weak to me. It combines the cartoonish, one-dimensional characters of Heinlein with the hectoring of Ayn Rand. Lazarus Long rides again in the character of Benjamin Franklin Smith. I don't know, when I was 15 I could read this stuff, but not now. The future described as a utopia seemed more like a Big Brother-ish dystopia to me. Anyway, Halperin does include an excellent but brief appendix about cryonics - clear, well organized and to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a novel?","review":"I gave this book two stars to be fair, because maybe it eventually gets better at some point. I wouldn't know; I didn't get very far into it. There seems to be absolutely no plot to this novel. It reads like a history book of the future, and I couldn't stand that so I quit reading. Oh, and for the record, I thought The Truth Machine was fantastic, so this was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe It's just not my type of book, but it was BORING..","review":"While I thought the idea was fascinating, and potentially engrossing, I found myself continually flipping ahead looking for something to *happen*...

Great idea for a book, but this isn't that book. Skip this one! It gives science fiction a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden, uninteresting Sci Fi","review":"My dilemma in writing this review is that, in principle, I agree with many of Halperin's scientific views as presented through the characters of the book. Unfortunately I ended up not caring in the slightest whether any of the characters achieved immortality or not. Who cares if someone else is immortal if you don't particularly like him/her? Halperin's ability to create a realistic and caring prose portrait of a human being is lacking as far as I'm concerned.The tone of the book is polemical - for never a moment is there a doubt that this is a diatribe against religion and superstition. I have a low tolerance for superstition and less for religion, but the constant harangue is tedious - I end up feeling like I'm being lectured.The book did not entertain or educate me. I found it depressing that such inconsequential and unsympathetic characters should be rewarded with the gift of a longer life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth Machine It's Not","review":"I got this book with great expectations. I truly loved the Truth Machine and was expecting more of the same. I brought the book with me to read on the airplane on my way to a Mexican Vacation. Being the complete idiot that I am, I did not bring a back up book because I assumed this one would be just as good as the first. I tried to like the book, I really did. I read about half of it, before I realized that watching the passengers on the airplane was a lot more interesting. From the other reviews I read, I guess the second half of the book is a lot more exciting. Trust me, it's not worth the effort to get there. A boring plot with unlikable characters makes you start feeling like the first immortal waiting to be awakened. Maybe if he hadn't written such a great first book, then my expectations wouldn't have been as high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawd...","review":"I'm fairly familiar with theoretical nanotechnology and longevity, so I read this book only after it was hyped by Alcor (the cryogenic facility). What a mistake. I suspect the 5-star reviews were written by the kind of people who are impressed with a product like \\"VCR Plus\\". Maybe some people need bland, stereotypical characterizations to be introduced to these ideas, but if you want to do without the fluff, I highly recommend Eric Drexler's \\"Engines of Creation\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid character development with interesting futurist idea","review":"The First Immortal has many interesting ideas about the future but its insipid celebration of \\"the family\\" made me ill. It dilluted the impact of the changes in the world of the future with all the constant hugging, analyzing and \\"forgiving\\" of each other. The characters' personal angst was silly; their egotism was obnoxious and distracting. Mankind may become part machine through nanotechnology but let's hope we manage to maintain some self-respect and individuality, rather than the cloying, co-dependent, emotionally-damaged, self-involvement of these characters. Should have left them frozen. Skip itl."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Immortal - cryonics has never seemed \\"so hot\\"","review":"This was a truly well-researched and enjoyable read. I am a voracious reader,and tend to go through fantasy and science-fictions books quite quickly..The First Immortal was comfortable to read, but made me stop and think. The ideas represented were both creative but feasible given where science is today. The world portrayed in this book may truly become a reality in our not-too-distant future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual sci-fi","review":"Very thought provoking. Stimulating. He takes a questionable technology (cryonics) and explores its meanings and implications. More importantly, Halperin doesn't let the plot degrade into just another sci-fi story. ONE WORD OF CAUTION: If you are planning on reading \\"the Truth Machine\\" (his first novel) read that one first as \\"the first immortal\\" gives away part of the ending to the first book. Note: Its not a sequel but they share a timeline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two GREAT reads!","review":"I just finished The Truth Machine and The First Immortal and loved them! It's not often that you read a thoroughly enjoyable novel that is so thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read; realistic view of the near-future.","review":"James Halperin has given us an interesting but realistic view of a future in which immortality is attainable. However, there is a price (isn't there always?!) to pay. The ethical and philosophical arguments are ingeniously constructed and very believable. Nothing is presented as black-and-white, but in varying shades of gray. Most of the characters are intelligent and easy to identify with. A thoroughly enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life (or Death) Changing","review":"I would have never imagined that reading this book would cause me to seriously question beliefs which I had accepted throughout my life. The First Immortal is an outstanding read, a book which you refuse to put down. I have never before questioned when the end will come. I had accepted death as the final chapter to life. However, First Immortal offers the opportunity for you to skip ahead. Discussing the implications of cryotransport and nanotechnology, the book argues for a future without natural death. It does this without \\"stupid\\" science, suggesting realistic future possibilities offering endless life. James Halperin is a talented visionary and I am glad that I was lucky enough to find this book. I dream about his view of the future, a world where life is truly precious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising start, then......ugh.","review":"I was put off by the hokey futurism in Halperin's \\"The Truth Machine\\", but it had enough storytelling muscle to make me give this one a try.The first half of the book is really interesting, as we see the twists and turns in the life of Benjamin Smith, his philosophy, his family. Really, Halperin had me in the palm of his hand here.But like \\"Truth Machine\\", once we get to the future, it all unravels. We get wild speculation, world government, and so on, etc., futuristic cliches up the wazoo. In fact, the world of the Truth Machine is the same one here. So it was like going through that pain *twice*.Halperin could do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much hype","review":"This book was not as good as the hype. I was rather disappointed. The development of the characters took a back seat to the development of technology. The conclusion of the tension between Ben (father) and Gary (Son) was very anti-climatic. I was left wondering what the author was attempting to portray. When I was a kid I read a book entitled \\"Deep Freeze\\" which offered a much more interesting look at cyronics and what the future held for those who are looking for immortality."},{"rating":"1","title":"DullsVille","review":"What a Snooooooozer. The writing is just so dead-monotone. Zero depth, emotions, action, story. Pass"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I must admit that I hated the truth machine, this one is every bit as bad. Completely one dimensional characters populate this novel. Zero stars would be more appropriate, be careful of buying this book based only on the reviews here. You may get less than you bargain for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Very much like The Truth Machine, this book is a genuine page turner made all the more impressive by the fact that the story has a foundation in actual scientific research (something I didn't discover until after I read the book). I highly recommend for sci-fi and non sci-fi fans alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After having read The Truth Machine, Halperin's first novel, I was more than eager to read this one. Unfortunately, Halperin wrote a book that was too similar in style to his first novel and too long in getting to the real meat of the story, thawing the main character. Halperin does provide a believable and somewhat optimistic view of the future and how we get there but this view was not enough to hold up the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasantville meets cryonics","review":"Not only are the characters one dimensional - they are all the same! Significant lack of imagination, both dramatic and ideas. If you like great ideas, and would like to have fun reading - read *** Greg Egan ***. He is one of the greatest science fiction writers of the day.The First Immortal felt more like a very dry documentary than fiction. That may actually be the redeeming factor - it's an almost-plausible extrapolation for the next few years.Dialogue was very banal. There was alot of preaching and people giving speeches at the drop of a hat.Significant repeat of the previous novel - the truth machine. Similar feel. I believe the concept of a widely accepted and infallible truth machine is extremely unlikely in the near future. Since both books rely on this premise, they are both flawed. I should also say that I find the idea repulsive - the potential for abuse and oppression is tremenduous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic characters and plot as well as painfully dated material","review":"I was surprised how cheesy this book turned out to be, given that it was so well-reviewed and is only 10 years old. Suffice it to say, the material hasn't aged well. There aren't many redeeming passages to balance such items as the cringe-worthy (and wholly unnecessary, from a plot perspective) incorrect prediction of Al Gore as the winner of the 2000 elections, the canned ww2 narrative, and the colorless protagonist. The whole wrap-up to this piece was incredibly pat and unsatisfying, inserting wildly under-elaborated technologies to explain why every aspect of modern human nature other than the urge to be a big happy family is suppressed by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wasn't compelling","review":"I agree with some other posters that I did like the author's science, and think in the near future this may be reality, but it was a bland, repetative, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story of enduring love with plenty of history","review":"Phoebe and Oliver are two of the most memorable characters I have ever met. Their story of enduring love has enchanted me for years--right up there with Scarlett and Rhett. The added interest of WWI history pulls this book together in an unforgettable way. An all-time favorite of mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawn's Early Light","review":"I have read Dawn's Early Light and Yankee Stranger and can't wait to read the complete series.

Wait till you hear what the kid in this story finally decides about being sold.

The explanations are not clear -- a bad written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should stick to what he knows","review":"Not up to previous novels. Premise not believable - characters shallow and setting boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be a story right out of today's headlines.","review":"This is my first P.T. Deutermann novel. It started out a little bit slow but was rich in background. By the time I reached the back cover I felt I knew my way around a DRMO. The story line is believable, current and frightening. By the end this book was moving like an inbound rocket. I definitely recommend it and will be looking for other Deutermann titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfunctional Direction","review":"When I viewed the opening credits, I noticed that it was sponsored by the Italian Ministry of Tourism and Entertainment. That raised a flag in my mind that something was amiss.This film is about life among street children in Italy. It appeared that the Director was attempting to document life of these children in a gang. But it was so poorly done. There were several scenes that were repeated as if the Director was trying to fill in time. And I thought that nothing could be worse than Genesis Children.Don't waste your money on this movie. If you want to watch a decent film about gang life among children, purchase Pretty Boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"This is a poorly done film. Vito was the only decent actor. But not much acting really required with the c grade script. Life as troublesome kids in Italy quite realistic but lapses in action and ridiculous dialog voids any realism. Alot is left to imagination as the flow of dialog is sketchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's bad","review":"Michael York in an incomprehensible mess. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. No, not bad-good, just bad-bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad? Did you say bad?","review":"You want to know how bad this movie is? I watched for all of about 10 minutes then shut it off!

Check Amazon's other offerings of \\"Dark Planet\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"Anything Maya Angelou writes is worth reading, I loaned it to a friend, she loaned it to her sister & I just thought I'd get another copy for myself, unless someone borrows it too !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Role Model for women","review":"Maya Angelou is such an insightful writer. She has a very colorful background that explains why she is so well liked. She certainly knows about many, many aspects of life and has come a long way in her life. She is a true role model in the world. Not just for black women but for all women."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book of Sustenance!","review":"I have read a few good books this summer, but this one is by far the greatest! I read it with a quickness. It is so full of wisdom. This is one book that I will read again and again. I recommend it to all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead End","review":"Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up \\"Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now.\\" And what did I find as a result of my maverick literary exploration? Ehh...Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful. If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipe For A Quiet Afternoon","review":"1 easy chair, sofa, or bed - 1 set of comfy clothes - 1 cup of something hot - 1 rainy, lazy weekend afternoon - 1 copy of Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now - Put on comfy clothes (or stay in pajamas) - Take hot cup of cocoa, coffee, tea, etc. - Curl up with book (getting out of bed optional) - Open book and prepare to be taught, inspired, and moved by these brief, but thought-provoking, writings of Maya Angelou, who always seems to know just how to touch the spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Maya","review":"This is my favorite of the books I've read in which Maya Angelou sits around contemplating life, though it's perhaps not the most representative of her work. For the moment she sets aside her intellectual self, her history, her issues -- anything by which you might identify her as anything but a fellow member of the human race. In this book you're left with the essential Maya -- the wise woman with the great heart and the steady mind who speaks out from timeless space. It's an easy read, and life feels better when you're done. And if you're at the end left in doubt whether she's also a world-wise and savvy intellect, then anything else she has written will put your doubts to rest.I love Maya Angelou."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now\\" by Maya Angelou. In this book, she writes about the positive and negative expericences she has had in her life. By reading this book, you can she that Maya is a very intelligent woman. A couple of topics she writes about in this book are Religion and Living good and living well. She gives advice on how you can be a better human being. This book makes you think about things you may take for granted. It also makes you see things in a different light. I haven't read any of Maya's other books, but now I definitely will! This book is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT.","review":"Probably one of the worst \\"horror movies I've ever watched. Please for the love of God don't spend your money on it it's a waste of your time. Basically it's a badly filmed version on paranormal activity.

They shouldn't have went that far . NEVER WATCH IT AGAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"An hour and a half OF HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is probably the worst horror/supernatural film I have had to endure in many a year, I understand that smaller independant film companies have a limited budget, but I think they should have at least spent the 10 they were given on a decent lighting manager!

It's set in Italy, a priest shows up now and then to offer no help, people do dumb things and still don't try to get out of the building, and the end makes it looks like there might be a plague or something going on in the village and it has nothing to do with the rest of the plot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.....very bad..........","review":"Wow, another hand held camera with people pretending to be scared.

From the first measure he plays the notes, and nothing more. While listening to \\"Francesca\\" I found myself repeatedly turning up the volume in the forlorn hope of somehow getting the passion from sheer decibels, but to no avail.

The instrumental arrangements and musicianship are exquisite, yet the album rocks too.The song writing is first rate. The messages in the songs are stimulating without being pompous.

The robot lazer part is what made me quit, I tried for 2 hours to get past it and I didn't. It just got to annoying for me. This game is basically a jack the ripper wannabe ripoff in it's way, which is ok in my book because I've always been interested in the stories but they should've made this game a little better. I recommend this game if you feel like getting annoyed with a few pointless agravating puzzles, a semi decent story and the making cookies cheeze.

Technical and hard facts are woefully missing.And information that is there seems very out of touch with the way the real world operates. Example: The author heartily endorses buying a Mac as opposed to a PC, for the obvious reason that Macs are better computers. Agreed, they are.

I'm still staggering. All of the acting is amazing. The jaded characters. The tragic moments when Gloria Swanson re-experiences, for short periods, the thrills that she's been living for. It is so amazingly haunting. This movie is so much more than the famous ending line.I am so grateful that this film didn't meet the same fate as Queen Kelly (the film that Norma and Joe watch in her house).

Hmmph!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dated","review":"This movie is very dated. Not only that, but it was boring. You can tell that this was done on a shoestring budget because the film is made in black in white. These days, you make movies in color unless you're really strapped for funds. Sundance won't even consider your movie if it's done in black and white. It just looks cheap and it won't fly with most audiences today. I'd normally give this just one star, but I'm giving it two because of that funny line, \\"I'm ready for my close up!\\" I'm not really sure what that meant or what it had to do with the rest of the movie, but it made me laugh. But the movie's poor production and the fact that it's in black and white forces me to give it just two stars. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Dead Man's Hand\\"","review":"The eerie opening of the movie, sets the tone. William Holden is speaking, telling of his experince and you realize that he is the dead man floating in the pool and it is a post-mortem spiel. This is the one film that I remember Gloria Swanson for--her playing of the dusty movie relic who has an over-exaggerated sense of self-importance in Hollywood. In fact she is long forgotten. William Holden had the unfortunate luck to get mixed up with her, and as the authorities are coming to take her away, she delivers her classic line, \\"Mr. DeMille, I am ready for my close-up.\\" Thinking that the members of the press are the production company of a new movie that she will star in. Dementia rears its ugly head. What a great classic movie. Swanson and Holden are fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"a timeless classic","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time. Just for the clothing designs alone by the legendary Edith Head, its a must see. The decor is amazing. Its like the Addams Family. Gloria Swanson is the perfect narcissistic diva in this film. After all those references to William Holden in the I love Lucy series, you can see in this movie what made Bill Holden such a heart throb. If youre from L.A. like I am, you will really appreciate the shots of a traffic-less sunset blvd and the old shots of the Paramount lot.

Buy this DVD...you definitely won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy","review":"For approx. the first 2/3 of the movie, Sunset Boulevard could go toe to toe against Citizen Kane for the title of the best movie ever. The writing, acting, and directing achieve a synthesis that is unparalleled. The film is so funny and well-played, it literally blows my mind. The problem comes in the last act when it ditches Norma in favor of the relationship between Betty and Joe, which, -don't get me wrong,- it's not bad, and Nancy Olson as Betty is one of the film's true delights, but the film loses the locomotive force it had going for it in the beginning. I think this is the reason why, although considered one of the greatest, the film often finds its way to the bottom half of top ten lists (number 12 on the AFI list of the 100 greatest movies). Still it's a great classic, and looks pretty fantastic on blu-ray. If you haven't watched it in a while, give it a try: it's sure to surprise and delight you all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all time","review":"This movie will change not only how you view Hollywood but how you perceive movies in General. I am certain this Movie will be talked about as a classic, not only for this generation, but for all time. Furthermore the History of this film, the stars and players is truly legendary. Stroheim, Swanson, Holden and Billy Wilder have all acheived Immortality thru this film. There is also a very enlightening and entertaining history of this movie on the DVD. There is something about this movie that is unlike any other. I also reccomend the book by Sam Stagg"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic gem","review":"i recently bought this dvd and i am absolutely in love with it. Gloria Swanson truly deserved the oscar for this movie, not Judy Holiday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dialogue","review":"This truly has some of the best dialogue of any movie ever. It's hard to make a movie about the movie business but \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is really not about the movies but about age and class and celebrity and life and death. Small subjects.This is what DVD was made for -- to give those of us too young to experience a classic upon its initial release the chance to see it fresh and clear for the first time now."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIGITALLY REMASTERED AND READY FOR ITS CLOSE-UP","review":"This film was William Holdens first big hit. It marked the great Gloria Swanson's triumphant return,(NOT COME-BACK!) Brilliantly acted, this film tells the story of a movie writer, Joe Grillis, and a crazed silent movie star, Norma Desmond. From the view of the body floating in the pool to Gloria Swanson's famous closing line, \\"Alright Mr. DeMille, I ready for my close-up!\\" this film will keep you enthralled. With a bit of sly humor and a marvelous script, Sunset Boulevard is a must see.It inspired the Andrew Lloyd Webber play of the same name. The American Film Institute ranked this film the 12 best film ever made. Once you see it, you'll know why.

All of the extra features, including the orginal morgue opening scene which was not included in the theatrically released version, are very nice to see. However, there is a fundamental problem with the actual movie part of the DVD. The DVD version of Sunset Boulevard is 110 minutes long but the original release is 115 minutes long. The original release had practically no fluff in it so the deleted scenes do hurt. I highly recommend Sunset Boulevard but I cannot recommend this so-called collectors' edition to anyone because it does not include the full length version of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art, but Not Entertainment","review":"I guess we're supposed to judge a film by how well it achieves what it sets out to do, and based on that, this film is a success. However: For me it is depressing, with little redeeming value. *Spoiler Alert*... The most likeable character is killed off at the end by the very unlikeable aging star (and it's her personality, not age, that is the problem); it's an innovative ending, but not a satisfying one, IMHO. This film achieves \\"creepy\\" very well, but cast an unpleasant shadow over my evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Frame Sucks","review":"I am really fed up with buying really great movies that are not formatted for widescreen....I wish people would be more curteous and let serious movie collectors know what they are buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic Film, but an Inferior Disc--","review":"Why would they make the \\"Special Edition\\" in full screen?

Still one of my favorite movies, but I sure was disappointed when it came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre and Melodramatic","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but I was shocked that a film with high number of stars and apparently so popular was also so horrible. I forced myself to finish it hoping it would get better, but sadly that was a waste of my time. Almost from the beginning to the very end, the film was incredibly improbable with over the top acting that made the improbability painfully obvious, creating an overall plain bizarre movie that is not worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marley Cole's Triumphant Kingdom","review":"In my humble opinion, there are only a few books that I would consider \\"classics\\" that are both honest and favorable toward Jehovah's Witnesses. Unfortunately, they are all out-of-print and rare collector's items today, many times selling for hundreds of Dollars.These \\"classics\\" include Marley Cole's two books: Triumphant Kingdom and Jehovah's Witnesses: The New World Society as well as the book FAITH ON THE MARCH by A.H. Macmillan. These were all published in the mid-1950 and their copyright has since expired and fallen into public domain.It is truly upbuilding literature and by reading each one we can claim a little bit of insight into the spiritual heritage that makes some people unashamed, yes, even proud to be associated with the God whose name is Jehovah."},{"rating":"2","title":"INXS shines forever.","review":"This anthology marks all the highs that make up INXS, and offers many gems that are hard to find otherwise. It makes me want to go to all the concerts again and play every CD they've ever released. Michael may have left us but his aura is strong in every track and the band's sense of fun and art mix so well in every song.

Live on INXS in \\"Shine Like It Does!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERRATED","review":"Seems like INXS always was getting the short end of the stick from music critics and I cannot exactly understand why. This is a brilliant overview of thier work and it is a shame that they are no longer with us due to the untimely passing of Michael. The title cut for this c.d is actually probably my favorite INXS cut ever. I highly recommend this compilation to anyone who wants to hear a brilliant and talented rock band that was tragically underrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad, Bad and Dangerous to know","review":"INXS were a force of nature in the 80s, and it is good to see their glory captured in this powerful anthology. I say 'powerful' because it is gorged with the timeless ingredients of classic, poetic rock: there is the impossibly happy funk, the epic hooks, the amber swagger in the voice of the singer, the compelling Michael Hutchence. Here we are reminded of the most charismatic and mythically debonair rock stars ever, and if you doubt it, whack on the needle tingle of Need You Tonight or the poignant yearn of Shine Like it Does or the Byronic romanticism of Never Tear Us Apart. Music for inspiration, for comfort, for partying, for melancholia. Listen to the Devil Inside and go out and buy this sexy and profound essential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of all the compilations, take this one","review":"God, how many best-ofs does this band need to put out? If you want the best of them, I suggest you buy this one, as the sound quality and remastering is extremely well done. It's sad, but if Michael Hutchence were still alive to see what his former blokes were doing he would be justified in taking his life all over again. Of course I'm talking about the band's decision to look for a new lead vocalist by way of a f_____g \\"reality\\" show. What a DISGRACE to the memory of the GREAT Michael Hutchence - there is absolutely no way this band deserves to comeback pulling this nonsense, and the \\"winner\\" of the contest will have only my contempt as his reward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"I bought these thinking they were the actual \\"Illumination\\" brand candles.

I owned all of their original material on British Import, and even though I thought their \\"final\\" album (released 15 years ago) was disappointing, I bought this one with high hopes. It is a triumph. I disagree with one of the earlier reviewers: I thought the \\"Nutty Sound\\" was immediately recognizable (\\"Johnny the Horse\\" or \\"Drip Fed Fred\\" could have come from their \\"One Step Beyond\\" days) but songs like \\"Elysium\\" remind me of \\"Keep Moving\\". Listen carefully to \\"Saturday Night Sunday Morning\\": it's lyrics will bring a wry smile to your face...\\"everything has changed, just everything; it's not Saturday Night, it's Sunday Morning.\\" That's probably the theme of this disc: the same band, a little older, a little more mature musically. I'm glad to have them back, making great pop music again."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool package","review":"Rose Royce has there classic Jams on this Set.while there are many Greatest Hits Sets out on them this one is fully loaded on the Main Versions.this Band peaked at the right time&had a nice Mix of Funky Jams&Slow Jams that worked really well for there overall Style&Sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"talking about the car wash","review":"rose royce was tight my faves are wishing on a star, and love don't live here anymore and can't forget the classic I'm goin down remade by mary j blige, ynv, and more recently camron ooh boy. and can't forget the ghetto classic car wash you ain't ghetto til you jammed off that cut so if you feeling rose royce you should get this and keep daddy rich's memory alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"For those of you like me who didn't grow up listening to R&B radio as a mainstay may not realize how many terrific songs Rolls Royce put out. I went for years thinking they were a one hit wonder with the song Car Wash. When I heard Love Doesn't Live Hear Anymore and learned it was Rolls Royce I began to check out their albums and thought the Greatest Hits would be a good place to start. This album has several great tracks I didn't realize the band performed. A couple sound like re-hash of Car Wash but for the most part this is a must have album. Gwen Dickey is an outstanding vocalist whose talent puts many of the tracks over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funkadelic's 2nd Best Album","review":"The first three Funkadelic albums (Funkadelic, Free Your Mind. . ., and Maggot Brain) are all amazing. The band morphs quite a bit after that and loses some of the rock edge that, to me, makes these early discs such an interesting mix. If you liked either of the other two, you'll like this. If you haven't experienced Funkadelic yet, I'd say start with the first album (Funkadelic) and then grab this disc, and free your funky mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH my god.","review":"I will put this as simple as possible.

After spending some more time with it and listening very closely to the whole affair, my opinion has not changed. Eddie Hazel's guitar work just doesn't appeal to me. The title track always depresses me and sends me running for some Beatles, Parliament or Nick Drake. Anything.....is better than this mess of an album. I can't explain it, but \\"Maggot Brain\\" remains one of the worst releases I've ever heard. Maybe it's a mental thing, but to me, this shouldn't even exist, let alone be called a masterpiece, just my humble opinion. I will never listen to this again....it just has a weird, unnerving effect on me. Strange."},{"rating":"1","title":".....I Don't Think So!","review":"Well, I guess they can't all be gems. The sound is thin. The lyrics are cosmic rhetoric (and not at all humorous), the melodies never quite take (and if they do, you should get out more often) and the much heralded title track is one long bore. Eddie Hazel may be dead, and may have been an integral part of the Funkadelic Family, but the accolades heaped on him and this \\"song\\" are unwarranted. A waste of time, money and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special here","review":"The guitar parts on the instrumental 'Maggot Brain' are overrated, i found personally this track boring ; in the overall picture, this is not a totally bad album, there is a couple of good songs, but this is in no way a masterpiece; i bought this album after having read some very positive reviews on amazon here, so my expectations about the quality of the music were high, i must admit i have been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diverse and somewhat insane recording","review":"Funkadelic are a band that do what it says on the tin if there ever was one: Maggot Brain is a superb cross between funk and pyschadelica. The album is diverse, however, from the drugged-up guitar wigout of the title track to the edgy, metal-influenced 'Super Stupid'; the closest to an appealing single, the glorious funk-soul of 'Hit It And Quit It'; the more straight-forward soul of 'Can You Get To That' and the insane closer 'Wars of Armageddon', which is simply all over the place in the best possible way, the closest here to a direct cross between funk and psychadelica. All five of these tracks are exemplary: the two remaining average by comparison. Nevertheless, this is a tremendous and groundbreaking recording that is truly an essential for any record collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS version has poor sound quality","review":"I ordered DVD, but received the VHS version instead.The sound quality is terrible.

Obviously the only people watching this movie are high, drunk, or have an IQ half their shoe size. I was FORCED to watch this for a journalism class where we had to write a review for it. It's sad that anyone took time and energy to make a movie so terrible and even worse that people actually bought it. The plot was a horrible rip off of the classic \\"Casablanca\\" and the actors were unknown and just plain bad. The only humor was drug, alchohol, or sex related and after watching it I realized I had wasted precious time watching a film I can hardly believe was ever made. Don't waste your time or money. WORST movie EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin it strong!!!","review":"I have seen this movie well over 20 time and i still love it. One of the great stupid humor movies of my time.

I really like skiing and winter so the snowboarding footage was great, I am ready for the season. This movie was a lot funnier than I expected. I was rolling on the ground during many parts. If you liked American Pie, Road Trip, Scary Movie or anything like that you will love Out Cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I had a copy of this movie prior to purchasing this one, but i watched it so much that the old one stopped working. This movie is amazing. Check it out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of this world comedy","review":"Winter sport and comedy lovers will find this predictable but hilarious. We all know the story. The cute misunderstood guys get their mountain (ski resort) in the end but the way they get it is very funny. Naturally there's a bad guy who tries to buy the mountain and commercialize it, and there is a love triangle just to appeal to everyone. The extreme skiing scenes will make you feel their pain while you're laughing. Don't let any of this keep you from seeing it. If you like comedies you owe it to yourself to see this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Cold","review":"This movie is funny and light hearted. It follows in the tradition of the ski comedies of the 80's and makes it contemporary. I could do without the sappy love story drama, but that probably makes it more palatable to female viewers and there is enough guy humor to offset it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly funny movie in a world full of lame movies...","review":"*A girls point of view on the movie*Sometimes it seems like the writers of movies anymore will just make up stupid or gross stuff to get a laugh out of people, and it's getting old.This movie, however, is AWESOME! It's just totally funny from beginning to end. It's light hearted and has a terrific cast of actors. Each character is played so well that it makes the movie really good. While watching you'll think to yourself that you know someone in your life that just like one of the characters, and I think that's part of what makes it so funny.I give this movie 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny movie","review":"This movie is a great movie full of laughs, i saw it a while ago and remembered it being good, so i bought it from amazon. I watched it again and it still was good, but it's not amazing, i kind of built it up to be more than what it is! But it's still a great flic! I'd recommend it for a good laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing you havent seen before, but...","review":"This is just another in a long line of comedies that feature gross out humor and guys trying to get laid. Trust me you have seen it all before. On the other hand there is some great snowboarding scenes, at least one incredibly beautiful babe, and Lee Majors! Lee is holding up pretty well and dosent look like he has aged much since starring in \\"the Fall Guy\\". He plays a bad egg in this film.\\"Out Cold\\" bills itself as \\"Animal House on snow\\", but that is wishful thinking. The humor dosent come anywhere near \\"Animal House\\". There is very little here redeeming enough to recommend this one, but there are a couple of chuckles, and it dosent break the cardinal sin of being boring. If you like cheesy movies like I do, then you may want to rent this if nothing else is available. If you are a snowboarding fan, you would probably appreciate it more than the average viewer as there is alot of this in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"Are you people serious? Is this what passes for comedy in todays sad world? This is by far one of the biggest abortions of a film...no, movie I've ever seen. To call it a film would be a slap in the face to an art form that I have such respect for and if you have any respect for the art of film than you will distance yourself from this dibacle. There's stupid comedies (Dumb and Dumber, Austin Powers) and then there's this. There are not enough adjetives in the english language to describe how bad this movie is. Please avoid this film like the plague and if you want to see a real comedy watch something like \\"Rushmore\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you rate this product","review":"This is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. It really pin-points snowboarders to within 1/100 of a milimeter to their attitude. I am one myself, and hell, you would have to be pretty damn crazy not to make an attempt at Inga (She's a Fox)! Without the hot chicks (the movie would be of less quality), there is the comedy, which is laugh-so-hard-you-cry funny, and really awesome action on snowboards. I am a snowboarder (Bridger Bowl represent), and I think this movie doesn't do the world of snowboarding a lot of justice, put it sure exploits it accurately. Peace out, and ride hard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Cold","review":"This is a funny movie to watch. You can watch it over and over. It also has great music and great down hill skiing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on the Consumer","review":"Though the original reviews for this movie were really really bad, i think it all depends on the person watching it. I am a teenager and found this film to be extremely enjoyable. Adults would not appreciate this movie very much and thats why it got such bad reviews, the reviewers are most likely adults. I would also suggest this movie to the many snowboarders out there(which i am one of) this movie is HILARIOUS! It makes you want to move somewhere like Colorado or Alaska just to check out what it's really like to live in a town composed of mostly snoboarders. For those of you that are not snowboarders.... It will make you want to learn. Though I wouldnt recommend this film to adults, if u are an extremely bored teenager in need of some entertainment, this is the movie for you. And also watch it without ur parents in the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever","review":"I LOVED this movie! Everything about it made me teary-eyed with laughter.

Well, needless to say, my mind filled with about a million questions such as \\"can I run while trying to get pregnant?\\" and \\"How will my running/training effect my baby?\\" This book helped answer these such questions as well as questions I didn't even know I had.

How realistic is this for the average pregnant woman who just wants to run for fitness?I did find the stretches to be useful, and wish there could have been more useful information like this in the book. It felt like it read more like a pregnancy manual at times then a fitness book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Advice for Pregnant Runners","review":"I picked up Running and Pregnancy before we even started trying to conceive so that I would be educated about my exercise choices once we achieved a pregnancy. I am pleased to say that this book is very realistic and doen-to-earth.

He bought a biography of The Andrews Sisters, and when I saw \\"Swing It\\" on the coffee table, I decided to start reading it. I then decided to order one for a friend of mine who's into swing music, and when he saw the negative reviews posted here, I was dismayed. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, which told me lots about this trio that I never knew, from their personal friendship with Lou Costello, to their abundant sacrifices for the war effort of the 1940s, to the reason they were so famous for squabbling. I also never realized that they recorded and performed through 1966 (who would've thought that The Andfrews Sisters recorded things like \\"Puff! The Magic Dragon\\" and \\"I Left My Hearty in San Francisco\\")? I thoroughly enjoyed the biography, and the pictures were great. And in regard to the bad reviews, I wasn't surprised to find that the e-mail address of the reader who wrote the \\"Yawn\\" review was \\"Nutloaf.\\" That about says it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second rate at best","review":"Being a huge fan of the Andrews Sisters, I was excited to see a \\"biography\\" had finally been written about them. But as I read the book, I was very disappointed. If you're looking for their life story, all you're going to get is second and third hand quotes from aquaintances, and nothing more. Not one family member was directly interviewed. It does serve as a good reference for their discography, but that's about it. I suggest you borrow it from the library instead of buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"A real plod. This book reads more like somebody's college thesis: factual and flat. Most personal insights are provided by quotes from Maxene which the author must have dug up someplace. It really sheds no new light on any of the three sisters.

The book has an adequate but basic history of the war. However colour profiles has many bad mistakes: even the front cover pictures represents wrongly the post-war camouflaged Sea Harrier. The code of XZ451 was \\"006\\" during the hostilities. Colour plate no 4 has a same machine but a different text under it: ZA174 had a medium grey scheme. I also doubt that Argentine navy A-4 Skyhawk (plate no 8) wore Super Etendard style camouflage during the conflict (if ever). Photos are very useful even there is also pre- and post-conflict photos among them. Argentine losses are listed, British are not. But it is nice to read that Mr Chant tries to be neutral, for example, the \\"own goal\\" Gazelle loss (6th June 1982) is mentioned. I still believe this book belongs to modelmakers and historians desk but it cannot be trusted solely as an concise history of the Falklands air war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr.Chant should put more effort in","review":"No pictures of the pilots,gun cameras or the \\"MiG\\" killing Harriers.Makes mistakes like the BBC reporters at the time by calling NAVY pilots \\"Flight Luietenants\\" and vice versa for the RAF pilots, as Luietenant. No in depth look at the battles or pilot's accounts.I think Commander \\"Sharky\\" Ward will do a backflip to see that he was in Mike Blisset's squadron,800 NAS, at one stage in this book.I really think Mr.Chant should get some tipps from Shlomo Aloni's books about the Isreali Aces."},{"rating":"1","title":"just think twice before buying from this saler","review":"Iam really very feeling very bad for this order for the first time with amazon the brake pad i receive is not for the car i need well they are clever they write the same number on the packed but when i opened it was something , i ordered i brake pad for Toyota land cruiser 2006 for the rear and driver and they send me a green and blue packet and was not nice to see its only the color what inside is the same pads small pads i even don't know for kind of car its even not like the pads appear in the photos .....my advise is think twice before buying from this company"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maple Sugar","review":"This may be the best resouce for tapping and make maple sugar ready for your kitchen table.

Can't even make a shake!","review":"We are registering for a new blender for our wedding even though we got this blender just a few months ago. It is sooooo loud.. it's ridiculous really. It smells like it's burning. When trying to make a shake you have to keep stopping it to stir it.. it just doesn't work properly.

I have 3 of these. Don't get me wrong I like them. The oldest is retired because it is over 30 and looks like hell. I use it for parts. The two I have now are this one and a cheaper one. They all have this rubber part. The newer ones have a poor design in the jar base screw. It's plastic and it breaks easy. I've been through 3 plus in 6 years. I did not buy mine here I got one At JC Penny on sale and one at Wallyworld.Update to my review. This is not a heavy duty blender. There is a rubber part in the \\"ALL Metal Drive\\" that will fail. The replacement parts are not as good as a new one most have dry rot and break quickly. I've got 3 and when I fix them I'm selling them and getting either a Warn Or Vitamix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great To Look At","review":"Looked great on the counter. Continually vibrated around when in use. Difficult to remove lid, too shallow. After a couple years of occasionally making smoothies, the rubber axle sheered off with the blade. Waste of my hard earned money. Not made of the same quality as Gramma's, she used hers for a couple decades, and made strawberry smoothies all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction on parts","review":"After reading mostly positive reviews I thought I would give this blender a try. Very quickly the sealing ring was shredded which other reviewers had mentioned happened to them as well. Now the plastic base is now cracked once again rendering the blender useless. In six months time, with limited use I wouldn't expect this poor quality from a blender that isn't cheap. I also don't like how the glass pitcher doesn't attached securely to the base. It will turn when the blender is on. You have to hold it in place. This one is being returned and I am trying a new blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I purchased this blender - after reading reviews of the breaking drive mechanism, etc. I make a lot of fruit smoothies (frozen fruit, juice + other ingrediences). Knife/axle separated after 2 months of use. This is not a solid blender - probably good for very light duty. The drive mechanism, although looks like 'all metal' is really held together by a rubber fitting. NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one Month (Buyer Beware)","review":"Wonderful blender...for about a month. Use it once daily to make a smoothie. Nothing difficult. Today the gear in the base snapped off...no way to order a replacement. Complete waste of money.

I have just burnt out my first beehive blender and went looking for another one...I think that is one of the best compliments I can make for a product. I have had this for maybe 5 years and have abused it with everything I can think of to blend. I love the 2 speed toggle feature and the simple design. I have looked at the \\"super blenders\\" and realize I don't need a $500 (or more) blender when this model Oster does everything I need for less then $80. Frozen items will \\"freeze up\\" and fail to rotate if there is not enough liquid to make it spin. I find many additional carafes at thrift stores since Oster has made this design for years. I would recommend it to a friend and buy it for a gift...what more can I say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not really...","review":"this product is too bulky and just make too much noise. i read the review that this blender doesn't make too much noise,.. well it does actually i only used a few times due to its noise it disturbs everyone in the house :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendor Blender","review":"I wasn't planning on buying a blender, I am very leery of buying a blender as i do not think most of them work at all. I really wanted a VITAMIX, but it did not fit in the budget. I happened to be shopping on young house love's amazon store and saw it, considered it breifly and decided against purchasing it. But my husband kept talking about making smoothies and i told him i'm not buying a blender, we need a vitamix (he thought it had something to do with vitamins :)and wasn't impressed). The more he talked the more i thought about the blender so i went shopping again at YHL's store and read the reviews on the beehive, which were all very favorable as i recall, a lot of people had the same concerns as i did, but were pleasantly impressed with the blender. So i gave it a try and am happy. Nothing compares with a VITAMIX but i am pleased with the purchase for the price. It has served me very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic, not chrome","review":"For starters, I didn't actually use the blender so I can't comment on its performance. I was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box and found out the base is made out of plastic, not metal. That is, apparently, the drawback of buying things online without seeing them and thinking that \\"chrome\\" means more than just a color. The base is a brushed nickel sort of plastic but the circle part that holds the jar is a shiny \\"metal\\" plastic. In my opinion, the \\"metal\\" plastic makes the blender look kind of cheap. If I wanted a blender that is going to look somewhat cheap, I wouldn't spend $50+ on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible LID","review":"This blender was nice for about 3 months. The round rubber lid is HORRIBLE - i think it shrinks with use. I'm not sure why other reviewers didn't mention this. It's like not having a lid at all - water goes everywhere. I tried getting a replacement lid but reviews said that it was worse than the original. I am hoping that the square design will work. Also, the plastic attachment that keeps the blade sealed cracked on mine, so that's another weak point. I thought i had found a solid blender.. but turns out it's not quite there."},{"rating":"1","title":"after one year of use","review":"The more I use this blender them more I dont like it.

It is so loud I will could not use it without ear protection. I took the glass pitcher and put it on my old blender that is 30 years old and works fine.

Turn it on and leave the house.2) It doesn't do all that well with ice or frozen fruit. We got it because the box said it would crush ice, but it never really did, we ended up just using the crushed ice option in our fridge's water/ice dispenser.3) We've had it for two years and it's broken twice. The first time it broke, the mechanism that the jar sits on and spins the blades torqued off, so my husband got online, ordered a replacement part, and fixed it. It's a year later and the same part broke again when I tried to blend frozen fruit and milk for a smoothie.Go with a different brand or model, we've been pretty disappointed in The Beehive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for ice crushing","review":"After reading all of the positive reviews,I thought this blender was a pretty safe bet.I bought it just a little over a month ago, and we use it for making protein drinks. At first it worked great. Crushing ice was no problem. Now after using it about 15 times, it does not want to crush the ice. I have to turn it off and stick a spoon in it to move the ice around and get it to start again. Very frustrating. I am learning that truly good blenders are hard to find, and the learning curve is getting expensive. I guess I will have to break down and spend $400.00 on a Vita-Mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not durable","review":"We've had this blender for almost a year.

Check that carefully.HAd it more than a year, and still leased.. You don't need more speeds -- that's just silliness. Somebody puts on X speeds, so then somebody comes up with X+1. Just more plastic to break. And who knows if you can find parts? Maybe if it was mapde yesterday.For the Oster, the metal on metal is reassuring and you know that you can find parts. And it has that classic look.Frankly, there are too many models.

Perhaps the resemblance to Anglagard has to do with their former percussionist, Mattias Olsson being at the production helm? And the mellotron! This is without a doubt a mellotron- drenched affair from start to finish. Each track is teriffic and holds the listeners' attention well. No wandering, meandering moments. Just straight- forward, intense prog that includes all the right ingredients to satisfy the most demanding prog fans' desires. Kinda hard to get your hands on, but WELL worth the effort. Recommended to fans of the above mentioned bands as well as Liquid Scarlet, Wobbler, White Willow. One of my new faves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Recording!","review":"We borrowed this CD from the library, and greatly enjoyed it. As string players, we were quite impressed with the precision and virtuosity of this [seemingly French] orchestra. The orchestra has a very detailed, gritty sound, which at times reminds one of the \\"stringy\\" sound of a Baroque orchestra. The Souvenir de Florence was very well done, and having it played by a chamber orchestra instead of a sextet allowed it to be played great expressive range, from really note solo parts to the bigger, more impersonal sound of an orchestra. All in all, a great recording, and was very impressed with the quality of the orchestra, in my opinion, definitely on par with St. Martin in the Fields, the Berlin Philharmonic, or any one of the other major symphony orchestras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wistful sampler of Cocteau Twins","review":"The only complaint one might have with this CD is its brevity. The four tunes here are so well-knit into a cycle of musical and emotional cohesion that if Cocteau Twins only released one recording, \\"Love's Easy Tears\\" would still distinguish them from all pretenders. Just before the magnificent \\"Blue Bell Knoll\\", the band runs through trademark synthesizer washes and keening, other-worldy singing. It's worth a listen, since subsequent albums reveal a change in style and lyric clarity. \\"Love's Easy Tears\\" is a sample of Cocteau Twins unique and scintillating sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect pumpkin book","review":"At this time, this is the most comprehensive volume on the Cucurbita genus. A good personal narrative, coupled with sublime photography. My only quibbles are that none of the images show cut open fruit, to give a view of the flesh and cavity.

A great album, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK AT TIMES,BUT SLOW AT OTHERS","review":"This movie is something between a scifi and a horror. Its Predator meets The Howling. It starts out with a group of soldiers training in a combat sim in Scotland I believe. They later encounter these half man,half dog creatures, however not original at all but still ok at parts during the action. The main problems that bring this DVD down is this is by far the worst quality DVD I have seen(hands down)it has a film like appearance with lots of grain on the screen,by the way I have a 32INCH HDTV AND PROGESSIVE SCAN DVD PLAYER,WITH COMPONENT CABLES,so its not my imagination this is really awful being that this was released in 2002,because I have Halloween(1978),Stage Fright,A Nightmare On Elm Street (1,3,6)and they look great on DVD. So if you can get over the bad picture and some hard to understand accents, then give it a try,otherwise just stick to the classics"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog ***","review":"This movie was truely not what I expected. It has an excellant plot but the werewolves were second class.When a military team is on a rutine training mission in Britain they happen to run into some not-so-rutine forest inhabitants. They find a survivor of a previous military team who is badly injured. While giving him care black figures appear in the trees.The werewolves were very cheaply done, typical people stuffed in suits. The little bit of animation was terrible a sixh grader using photoshop could have done better.There was a comical scene where one of the soldiers, cornered in the kitchen of an abandoned house decides he won't die easy. He takes the werewolf on in a boxing match. The werewolf being so shocked by this attack get licked (and stabbed) pretty bad. Upon the verge of victory the soldier is killed by another werewolf.All in all an ok movie for the true werewolf lover.

Luckily it worth worth the purchase. I found it very entertaining as far as werewolve flicks go. The werewolves themselves were like 8 feet tall and great. Definately one scary looking pack of wolves.The film follows a group of soldiers going on a trial mission only equiped with guns holding blanks. As they move through the woods they come across a site were a group of secret ops were torn apart leaving only one survivor. They soon realize what they are dealing with is far beyond what they have ever been trained for.I would definately recommend Dog Soldiers especially if you are a fan of werewolves.

The best thing about it is there is no CGI or any thing dumb like that. Does have a good but not original story line (even the cover says it copies JAWS, ALIENS and PREDATOR, but they are all films I like so who cares any way).

I won't get into a plot review, you can find plenty of reviews here and at other sites if you'd like. So here's a head's up on this edition. The DVD picture quality is quite poor. Fortunately it didn't distract my ability to enjoy this movie, but I will be searching out higher quality copy once one is available. Just to note, this is coming from someone who is NOT snobbish or nitpicky on picture quality on DVD's. And in case it's important to you, there are NO extras or special features on this DVD edition. Better video quality and inclusion of any features would garner this product 3.5-4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, low budget werewolf fun!","review":"I did not go into this movie with high expectations but I really like Kevin McKidd and wanted to see more of his work. Has anyone noticed how hard it is to get ahold of most of his movies and tv shows in a US format? Journeyman isn't even on DVD. Sucks imo, he's a very good actor. Anyway, I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie, sure it's not a big Hollywood special effects spectacular but the writing and the acting are all top notch and the movie goes lickety split almost from the get-go. McKidd does a great job as the lead character of Coop, and Sarge and the rest were also very real, enjoyable characters. I'm buying it for my personal collection and have already recommended it to my brother, who is a horror fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great horror flick in the classic style","review":"DOG SOLDIERS is great horror done well the old fashioned way. There's no CGI in this film. It's all \\"real\\" (as in animatronics and costumes) and it feels \\"real.\\" There is excellent use of situation, the environment (the dark, confined spaces, limited visibility), camera angles, as well as good acting to generate suspense. No, we don't believe in werewolves anymore, but it doesn't matter. The plot ties together well from beginning to end, and peoples' actions make sense under the circumstances. You'll spend most of the movie on the edge of your seat. Pay attention, because there are no wasted scenes.The first time I saw this movie, it became one of my all-time favorite horror flicks. I absolutely had to have it in my DVD collection. In an age where lazy directors substitute technology for effort, DOG SOLDIERS stands out as honest horror done very well.

Blu-Ray is grainy.","review":"That about sums it up. Just wanted to throw in my two cents.As others have stated, the picture quality is really bad for Blu-Ray.Amazon seems to like to combine all movies into one bucket, regardless of media type. I would recommend, when searching blu-ray titles of older movies, to always sort the reviews starting with the newest first. Had I done that, I would have passed on the blu-ray version and purchased the DVD, which obviously appears to be of better quality.The surround seemed to be somewhat disconnected from the front stage as well. I didn't get that feeling of being immersed in sound on the Blu-Ray version. Bear in mind though that this is an older movie.In any event, I would recommend purchasing the regular DVD over the Blu-Ray version.My rating is based more on the transfer and sound quality. The actual movie is absolutely awesome and should be a fixture in any horror fan's collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Predator, The Howling and Dawn of the Dead","review":"A brisk, vicious and sometimes gory werewolf movie, Dog Soldiers is a well-produced B-movie. Sure, the plot is a tad formulaic with a group of soldiers facing a supernatural enemy (a Filipino film virtually had the same plot, setting and ending but they were against crazed religious cultists), but the way it's edited and paced, you won't have time to foresee what's coming.A must-see for werewolf fans, the creatures here are mostly people in costumes, a refreshing sight in these CGI-laden times. They seem more real, although they tend to move a little stiff.Dog Soldiers won't blow you away with Shyamalan-like twists nor moral rhetoric, but it will provide you with continuous thrills and chills throughout the movie, just like its spiritual predecessor, Predator."},{"rating":"2","title":"'BOUT TIME!!!","review":"FINALLY!!!!! after so,so many failed attempts at making a watchable werewolf movie,a GOOD!! werewolf movie has been done. but, this movie is hard to stick the label \\"werewolf movie\\" to because of the overabundance of action, dark comedy, and sheer entertainment you'll be subjected to while watching it. the story centers on a group of soldiers dropped off in the woods against a spec. op. team for war games. it does'nt take long for them to realize that there is no more spec. op. team(except for a few parts here & there) and they need to find somewhere besides the woods to stay until morning.and let me tell you,when they do, it's a LOOOOONG time before morning arrives for them. excellent acting all around,enough well done gore to satisfy any gorehound,and(believe it or not)an outstanding HAND TO CLAW fight scene,make this a definate MUST SEE for any lycanthrope fan out there.or for anyone who justs likes to have a good time watching a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had no idea.","review":"starts off really boring and slow, but once you make it past I think it was something like the 30 minute mark, it gets better. much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best looking, most realistic werewolves in all of horror, No CGI","review":"I rented this movie and wanted to own it.

I am a life long horror fan and I kid you not when I say this is hands down the best werewolf movie ever made. It's November 2012 as I write this, 10 years after this movie came out, and nothing beats it. The story/set up is really briallant. A British military squad is set to the Scottish Highlands on a training mission only to run into the middle of a dangerous clan of Scotts, to put it mildly... Extremely well paced and acted; fantastic werewolves - kind of like Aliens only with Scottish werewolves. Absolute must have for a genre fan. I still only have this on DVD. I've only seen negative things written about the Blu-ray version (sounds like it's a straight dump to HD, very grainy, etc., poorly done). I would love to see this movie trully re-masterd to HD and released properly on Blu-ray. I'd buy it a heart beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good...","review":"I had low expectation coming into this movie. Most werewolf movies are really bad to say the least but this movie wasn't one of those.It had surprisingly good actors and story. It really had the feel of a Predator/Night of the living dead movie. The werewolfs were good looking too, no CGI which I appreciated. The people that made this movie looked like the actually gave a damn about it.I only wish they had a bigger budget, I think they could have done more with it, but for what it was I thought they did a great job!Kudos to Dog Soldiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST WEREWOLF MOVIE........... EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"OK.. I think my the title of my review sums everything up, BUT I'll try and elaborate. Dog Soldiers is set in Scotland.

The story was original, they didn't convolute the plot by trying to explain where the Werewolves came from and I think it adds a sense of urgency to the movie. These were the best practical effects I've seen for one in a long time and two in any horror movie. If you're a fan of the Werewolf movies, add this one to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW................................................Loved it................................","review":"extremely fun as hell to watch. Thanks to the 215 reviewers on this movie, I can now say as of yesterday , I'm the proud owner of this movie! Never heard of it, never seen it and I will say, THANK GOD FOR NO CGI CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!! This is 1 of the best Werewolf movies made. The acting in my honest opinion was awesome. The costumes were top notch on those wolves too. I just finished watcing this and I will probably watch it again this weekend, it was that damn good. A buddy of mine is going to buy it also since he saw the middle of it and loved what he saw while I was watching it. A must buy for anyone who loves war type flicks or Werewolf movies. I love both those types of movies so this was amazing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-See For The Werewolf Fan","review":"A fiercely intense horror about a squad of British commandos and a female civilian trying to survive the night in an abandoned farmhouse in the Scottish Highlands against a pack of werewolves.From the moment a mutilated cow falls down an embankment smack into the middle of the soldiers' patrol the action in this film is nonstop. Towards the end is an excellent fight scene with the men out of ammunition, literally fighting tooth and nail with the werewolves. They don't know if they'll be alive another second - neither will you the viewer.Although there are a few holes in the plot and some of the situations seem contrived, this little known British production has gained a well-deserved cult following over the last four years. In my opinion it is one of the best werewolf flicks to have been released in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Film - Terrible Transfer","review":"The negative review score isn't for the film - I actually dig Neil Marshall's take on 'survivors band together for one last stand'. It's the high levels of grain that accompany the transfer to 1080p. I'm not sure if it's how the film was shot or just the lack of care taken with it, but this is a definite skip on BluRay. This looks exactly the same as my DVD version, with virtually no features. Glad I picked it up on sale, anything more than 7 bucks would have been a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Not So Great Blu-Ray","review":"Great movie, terrible transfer. This Blu-Ray disc seems to be just a few notches up from the DVD transfer. Muddy, grainy and often soft. And hardly any extra features. I guess for the low price it's worth the upgrade to hardcore fans, but overall I'm not sure why this is on BD when the transfer hardly warrants the price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorites...","review":"\\"...and I expect nothing less than gratuitous violence from the lot of you!\\" Hooked from that line on. Don't care what any other reviewers say this movie is tops in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for straight to video","review":"I despise most of the .... that tries to be played off for horror or comedy or most movies in general. I saw the box and laughed at what I thought would be a horrible \\"B\\" level horror flick. Wrong. I decided to rent it finally and found it to be quite entertaining, the werewolves were almost as creepy as the ones in howling. My only gripes were the lycanthropes were really friggin' tall, almost spider-like, and where was the obligatory nudity for a horror flick? Other than that I was pleased, the taste of \\"Evil Dead\\" in it made part of it quite entertaining. Rent it and be suprised. Crazy Brits, I can't wait to see 28 days later."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOG head wolfweres look alike","review":"Overall this movie delivers some good horror moments however one thing that bothers me is that a soldier stabs a werewolf to death(in the kitchen) when they can't kill the werewolfs with machine guns in close range. C'mon. And it's too dark and I can hardly see the actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Werewolfs are waiting outside...","review":"A squad of soldiers is on a standard training maneuver on the Scottish Highlands where they are suppose to encounter a unit of Special Forces. However, the military exercise is swiftly cancelled when they find the Special Ops soldiers slaughtered and the radio out of order. Stranded in the wilderness, the soldiers find themselves not being on the top of the food chain as something fierce is ready to snap at them at any moment and from any direction. Dog Soldiers begins with a very interesting premise, however, this changes as the story unfolds and temporarily the film becomes awkward. Nevertheless, there are some first-class horrific moments that will startle the audience, but the overall experience ends up being a cinematic frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for the dvd... 5 stars for the movie","review":"This is a warning for people who are looking at the First Look Pictures version. It has ZERO options on the menu. It doesn't even have scene selection. I guess that's why it costs less than the 20th Century Fox version. Other than that, this movie is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without much pretention: a moder horror classic from U.K.","review":"\\"Dog Soldiers\\" is a real jewel for the horror genre, a \\"Must have\\" movie. Putting werewolves againts a prey that can fight back is a really nice turn, maybe the scrip is somehow predictable in some parts, but then you have a few scenes that take away that. Made it with a low budget, this movie takes the most from it and use it in an efficient way, but the greatest achivement was in the cast, the actors are brilliant in their roles because you care about them, you feel them real. The sarge, Cooper, Spoon, Joe, Terry and Bruce could be any real soldiers, Captain Ryan is a real jerk and you enjoy hatin' him, only Megan was somehow a little off base. Great action, suspence, nice timed pressure valvles, and class actin' make a truly amazing debut. You must keep and eye on the director and hope that this magnificien cast gets more roles of this caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY BLU-RAY VERSION","review":"Save yourself the money and keep your old edition of Dog Soldiers. The Blu-ray version actually looks worse and there are none of the special features that are on the DVD edition. Way to rip us off Firstlook Studios."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big fan of the movie, horrible Blu Ray","review":"I give it the 2 stars for McKidd and the film, as I like both - but nothing on here is worthy of Blu-Ray.Picture: Grainy, tons of artifact, darker than the original preservation, and just plain disappointing. Looks like they used the original transfer without ANY cleaning up. The night vision footage and wolf point of view are meant to look grainy, but I was hoping they would fix the rest. The creatures look decent depending on the scene, but the suits don't get that respect the makers deserved in Blu (no CGI).Sound: By far the worst \\"True HD\\" mix I have heard. Maybe a shell casing or two hit the outer channels, but everything got heavily mixed to the front speakers.Extras: None.Recommendation - Even with this low SRP it has nothing to ever make me watch this again at home or as a demo in the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Werewolf Movie Ever!","review":"If you are not looking for pulse-pounding suspense, a few well placed laughs, and the best werewolf movie ever, then you need to move on!A band of soldiers on exercise in the Scottish Highlands are attacked by werewolves, and are picked up on the road by a mysterious woman who brings them back to a cottage in the woods, where they must stay alive until dawn.WOW!Five Stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spindly wolves and lots of giblets","review":"Looking at some of the other reviews, I must be in the minority on this: I thought the movie was *very* weak. Rather than just saying that, I'll be fair and go over the pros and cons.Pros:* Lots of blood and gore.* Angry Scotsman.* The dog is cute.Cons:* Spindly \\"werewolves\\" (did a taxidermist have a yard sale?).* B-movie special effects and techniques.* Little-to-no plotline. I wasn't impressed.* \\"Nighttime\\" was exceedingly bright, even with a full moon.* The wolves \\"night vision\\" looked like they just colorized daylight. I've never seen night vision that looks like that.* They must've blown the entire budget for this film buying red food coloring, renting a house and blowing up vehicles.

First off it's british which is okay I can deal with it but the movie turned out to be real talky ...I found alot of it was uneccesary...I can't really go into that much detail because this movie made me feel like I had A.D.D...My mind kept wandering off and it was hard to focus...It had some nasty scenes but really it was nothing new ...As a fan of horror films I would not recommend this it was really weak in my opinion... I did give it 2 stars for effort !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst werewolf flicks","review":"Big disappointment. Not scary, too much talk. The acting, bad. The camera really jumpy.

The start was great though, and thats what earnt it 2 stars. Very tense and scary when you hear the werewolves when they are closing in on the soldiers that are retreating after finding another unit slaughtered. But after that, its all downhill.The werewolves were the worst attempt at horror i have ever seen. They were more funny then anything. It just completely stuffed up all the good work done before it.What made the early stages good, was that the werewolves were blending into the shadows, and all you could hear was growling. but the fright factor vanishes once you see them.A terrible piece of poo!

I hate when a good premise is given over to camcorder weilding cheapskates trying to make a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Junk","review":"This was the worst horror film I have ever seen. The lighting was horrible and the actors virtually impossible to understand. The camerawork was dizzying. The werewovles looked like what they were, men with fake wolves heads on them. Between the mumbling accents of the actors and the film looking like it was shot with no lighting at all, it was absolutely impossible to figure out what was going on.Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironic","review":"I find it ironic how the makers of this movie think that they have accomplished something great, such as making a low-budget movie that's better than most big-budget Hollywood stuff. They haven't; in fact, this is more routine, predictable, and cliched than 90% of what Hollywood turns out these days.Dog Soldiers is a scene-by-scene remake of 'Aliens,' set on Earth. The soldiers think they're elite, then they fight the creatures, realize that they're stranded, and then hole themselves up. Of course, there's an evil organization that thinks the troops are expendable, and of course the blond-haired main character survives in the end.Nothing original or inventive in this movie. For better horror/action films, stick with stuff like Aliens, From Dusk Till Dawn, and Dawn of the Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!","review":"The title and premise seem cheesy, but this movie is great fun!!!

It doesn't play nearly as well on the small screen as the big, but it's still a lot of fun and head and shoulders over most recent British horror. Kevin McKidd gives a surprisingly excellent performance in the lead, which helps raise the bar considerably, although considering the strong results director Neil Marshall got with his female leads in The Descent it's surprising just how poor leading lady Emma Cleasby is here.Great fun, though if you have a multi-region machine you're better off with the PAL UK disc which has a strong selection of extras too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog soldiers","review":"Good action movie. I rented it just because it looked like it would be entertaining to make fun of but it actually was pretty well made.

Definately one for those who prefer something from the 'art house' movie genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I absolutely loved the John Irving book that this was based upon. Very quirky (especially for it's time), hilariously funny, and the characters he created were magnificent. In my opinion however, the movie was uninteresting and only mildly funny. Not many movies do justice to the books they've been based upon, for many reasons. This is no excuse for Hotel New Hampshire however. Irving's \\"World according to Garp\\" was a superb book (similar in length and complexity to Hotel NH), and was made into a very good movie. I'd recommend checking out that one instead if you want to see a John Irving novel of this period on film."},{"rating":"1","title":"D-Movie","review":"Even one star is way too much for this whole load of crap.

When they made a movie, I went to the theatre in the off-chance that they managed to make a good movie from a lame book (it's possible).No. THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSIRE is also pretty horrible.The characters are quirky for the sake of quirky. I never believed them. They work so hard to be cute and unconventional that they're completely smug and obnoxious, draining all sympathy for them. Stylistically, it's just confusing. When Rob Lowe zips over to bed his foul-mouthed sister Jodie Foster, I had to wonder what the filmmakers were shooting for. Slapstick incest?I didn't read John Irving for years because, after this, I thought he'd shot his wad with GARP and was just writing the same story over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perplexing","review":"It horrifies, it warms the heart.

I had to turn this one off after twenty minutes. Yes, it is making fun of exploitation films and so I expected it to be silly, but it is a boring, stupid kind of silly, like listening to a group of teenagers dubbing in the dialogue to an already bad movie. Even when I was a stupid teenager myself, I thought that \\"Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex\\" was only marginally funny. But this is worse. Why do so many people like Woody Allen movies?

You all know Woody Allen hated the result of this his first movie project! Don't tell me you really think it's a quality movie!In fact, the best thing you can say about What's Up, Tiger Lily? is that it is an interesting experiment: putting newly-written english words to an already recorded awful Japanese action movie. The other good thing are the approx. two minutes in which Woody Allens appears, and the gorgeous 1960's-style Japanese girls.There's no story; a few very funny (or rather: far out) laughs, mostly because of the extremely poor, nearly parodistic quality of the Japanese movie; and that's about it.An experience rather than an enjoyable quality movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"She's a personal friend of James Bond!!!!\\"","review":"I cannot believe that this was released and What's New, Pussycat was not.This is way past the point of being deranged.I can't believe that anyone would believe Tiger Lily would have more commercial potential than Pussycat. Of course, Image Entertainment released Tiger Lily so they have the video rights, whie Pussycat was released on VHS only by MGM/UA so MGM must have the video rights. Therefore, this is not really an apt comparison. However, I never miss a chance to kvetch about the appalling dearth of good films that remain unreleased in the U.S.The chat rooms being, as near as I can determine, useless I would like to engage in discussions with some people who also list films that should be on DVD.

The overdubbed dialogue at times is silly (two guys in a fight shouting insults like \\"Spanish fly!\\" \\"Turkish taffy!\\") and at times quite clever (one pun involving equinne necrophilia takes a while to get). Great cinema, this is not: I once saw the film in a theater where the projectionist showed the reels out of order, and it didn't affect our enjoyment of the film in the slightest.One side effect of seeing this movie, however, is that it's impossible to view any performance by Japanese actor Tatsuo Mihashi without cracking up: When I saw him play the courageous Japanese pilot in \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\", I continually expected him to start wisecracking about egg salad recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book for kids.","review":"I aways say the frog and todd should stay in your heart until you have children.

I'm serious you should read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Children's Book","review":"My two boys grew up with my reading them this book almost every night before they learned to read.

Frog and Toad have it all over Dick and Jane!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frog and Toad Are Friends","review":"This is an all time favorite of mine since i was a kid. i hope this classic lives on forever. the times frog and toad spend together always reminded me of how my best friend and i spent our times together. always a learning experience, and always having fun. frog and toad learn very many important lessons on life in these stories, but most important, they learn the value of friendship-a value the children of today seem to lack anymore. i would reccomend any of the frog and toad series to any parent to read to thier children. they are some of the best available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arnold Lobel is the Ernest Hemingway of Children's Lit","review":"This is a lovely book. The adventures of Frog and Toad are my favorite (and not just because in every friendship a little Frog or a little Toad must fall). The sentences are clear, simple and clean but always descriptive. The subject matter is age appropriate and fun. My son and I listen to the stories in the car on our way to school.

Frog and Toad are Friends is broken down into five short stories that are cute, funny, and very easy to read for a level 2 reader. With stories about friendship, Arnold Lobel takes us to a realistic forest setting with a hint of fantasy, where animals wear pants, have adorable little houses and talk to each other. Frog and Toad go on some simple adventures that portray the depth of friendship in the most effortless of ways. Within each story Frog and Toad are sometimes up and down, they may have miscommunications, and laugh at each other; but they are always there for one another in the end. The artwork is very charming and sweet which gives children an insight into their world and a message of the importance of good friendship and community. This book is perfect for the young readers or even nostalgic adults who need to put a smile on their face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Learning to Read Book","review":"These stories are fun to read with our children.

Of two different natures, they bring out the best in each other and enjoy life and nature to the fullest. The simple stories will delight young and old alike. My son, now on the old side for these books, but just at the perfect reading level for him, still enjoys the simple, honest humour found within the pages.

We really do as much as possible with her, while she's awake, to keep her from watching TV. I discovered early her love of books, especially on CD, and has since been very interested in expanding our CD library with books on CD, rather than just having music.The stories on this CD are read in a quiet soothing voice with just as much \\"excitement\\" as a 4-6 yr old needs while in the car on a long boring trip. The characters are fun, real and interesting to learn about. Some stories touch on lifes' lessons while others are just cute.I bought two of the these CDs, to add to her Usborne Books on CD collection and we only had to turn on the DVD player once, and then only after 7hrs on the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth the price.","review":"I purchased this chair approximately 6 months ago and use it every day. I sit in the chair, on average, between 70 and 80 hours per week. I use a computer all day for work, mostly typing. Granted, that could be considered heavy use, but for the price I paid I would have expected it to hold up much better (I was hoping for 1-1/2 to 2 years). It is unstable - wobbles from side to side - the casters do not roll freely, and the padding in the seat broke down after 2-3 months. I have tightened the bolts several times and it keeps wobbling. The chair I bought at a local retailer for $99 held up much better and much longer than this one. I do not recommend it, nor would I purchase another item from this manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Kid's Guide to Watching TV intelligently","review":"I heard about Joy Berry's books for helping children have good characters and solve family problems for months, then I got this book.

Finally it will help your kids solving problems related to watching TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Democracy: Word of Many Meanings \\"","review":"This book exlores in depth two main contending views of democracy. The authour shows them to be radically different and ultimately incompatible. The book relates the two forms to different notions of man and society.

Don't let it be that for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"Even though Kevin Kline has his moments in this movie, it is not anywhere near enough to sit through and be tortured for its duration- Not a comedy at all- Pathetic portrait of various characters- All trying to adjust with varying circumstances and personal issues- None of which have been graced with intelligence- Even the wealthy characters are abundantly pathetic- The trailer is the best past of The Extra Man- Watch that for free- At least, the trailer is funny, fast-paced and interesting- Which the movie is not- Don't be led to think this movie is a light-hearted comedy- It is not! With the exception of a few scenes, and I mean, very few, the movie is quite depressing and disturbing- In short, a great disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"P U - this movie stinks","review":"If you enjoy watching people be odd just for the sake of it - then you might enjoy this, otherwise keep looking for another movie to watch.Good cast - worthless story.Kline plays a prudish bachelor of almost no income, living in a total dump and having fleas - yet he acts like someone with money and sucks up to a wealthy old lady to be included in upper society occasionally. Paul Dano plays an extremely timid loser who rents a cot in Kline's crappy residence. He experiments with cross dressing and has a little crush on Katie Holmes (which goes nowhere). John C Reilly plays a nice but wild and intimidating looking man with a cartoon character type voice. There really isn't any plot to this story - or any story to this story. Just some odd characters who really aren't interesting at all - especially Dano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"No narrative. No background.

I went into the theater thinking, \\"wow, I think this is going to be the best one yet\\". After 45 minutes I left. Yes, the way Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) sliced up people was diffrent. But that doesnt make a horror movie. The aliens, the time travel, the rebuilding of a human body, its all pathedic. Well, this franchise should be fed to the dogs now. Considering I loved 'Jason Goes To Hell', which most people hated, then you must agree with me here. This sinks quicker then it starts! Avoid this and rent the original nine previous volumes of the Camp Crystal Lake horrors."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never been so bored!","review":"OMG!! this was absolutely the dumbest movie I've ever seen. What a piece of [pooh](Kane hodder should be ashamed of himself)Too much humor I thought. The uber-jason section was ok, but also dumb. The costume is not creepy, it's more cyborg-ish. Best part was the Crystal lake hologram. That was meant to be funny and it was.

This is no way compares to the other jason films. Infact is stains the Jason legacy. this movie is stupid and not worth watching. The film makes put no effort in making outer space or the space ship and the actors are stupid and can't act period. The space ship and looks extremely fake like somethin off a mini-series. The only good part in the film was when jason's body turned into all metal and that's at the end of the movie (go figure).

I thought \\"Jason X\\" was corny and even more unrealistic than the previous nine.In this installment, Jason Vorhees is finally captured and kept locked up. That is until he escapes and begins to kill random people at will again. To keep him at bay, he is frozen and remains that way for many, many years until he is thawed out by a bunch of....you guessed it, teenagers, who are now living in space. Of course that was their death wish because Jason awakens angrier than ever (with new armor and facemask to boot) and is determined to wreak havoc and kill as much as he can.To me, this film was made just to say that 10 films total in this series were completed. I am, however, looking forward to the future Jason vs. Freddie movie. I hope it's better than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT SEE THIS MOVIE!","review":"I have so far thought that the Friday the 13th series has been alright. But this movie was terrible. It is absolutly unwatchable unless you are a huge fan. The movie takes place in space and Jason gets unthawed thats all the more proof you need not to see this movie. The plot is absolutely ridiculous and the acting is terrible. There are only two cool death scenes in the whole movie and thats it. DON'T see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Ok, am I the only one with a bit of sense here?Jason X, the tenth film in the long running Friday the 13th saga is a mindless big heap of trash. After Jason's so called Final Friday, we suddenly find him half alive in Crystal Lake research unit. With a very shaky \\"we're keeping him alive due to the regeneration rate of his cell structure\\" plotline we're off on a bumpy ride already. Since Friday the 13th Part 3, none of the horror movies had no plot direction or credibility so at least we know what we're in for.But why must we be subjected to this nonsense once again.Vicious Kane Hodder once again returns to play the homicidal Jason in space (the year 2455) after being cryogenically frozen in a suspender. All Jason X has to offer are new gadgets, more glitzy effects and the return of the superbabes, a known trait of any Friday the 13th movie. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is even too much!","review":"How anyone can give this biggest piece of c%$p movie any stars is beyond me!

The first being reviews that disect this film for good or bad. Really, I enjoyed the film, but it shouldn't be something anyone puts a lot of thought into. It's fun, mindless and entertaining. Nuff said. If you like sci-fi and horror this film is great. It's no Aliens, but come on, what is?The other funny thing was one reviewers comments on not wasting your money on this film and getting a good film like Freddy vs Jason instead. Strangely enough, I can't tell the difference. They're exactly the same type of film. If you can accept people coming back in dreams and from the grave/hell then why can't you accept them existing in the future? Bizarre. I guess if you don't like sci-fi AT ALL, don't watch this, but otherwise, don't miss it, it's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie might be worst ever","review":"A very fake movie all it is is blood and tites. but the killing doesn't look realistic. has absoultey no plot.

But once I settled into my seat, I was ready for a good scare. Halfway into the movie I was still waiting. The sript and the acting were the stuff of straight-to-video. The moive starts out with an interesting concept and a very cool visual style - but once we get Jason unfrozen on the ship, it all goes to hell. Lets' see - in outer space with an android, a strong female lead, a man whose main focus is money and a creature hell-bent on killing everyone. Sounds familiar? Belive me, the formula worked much better in Alien than it does here. Save your money - if you really need to see this, it should be on video and dvd next month."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Comedy Section Please","review":"I must say if you are looking for a real scary movie you probably already know this is not the one. In the distant future a bunch of students recover a vessel from space. On the vessel is Jason, of course, and a woman from Earth. They revive the woman and assure her Jason is dead.I must say this movie is the funniest I have ever seen. Seeing Jason beating ..two holographic women that just won't die. Or a droid switching into Rambo mode and beating ...Jason is hillarious. This movie is really trash, but it is very enjoyable. The DVD has excellent features you can watch all the murder scenes one right after another without worrying about the storyline inbetween. A great addition to any DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this film VERY stimulating","review":"This film was very sensuous the atrocious acting was very seductive and the marvellous storyline made me weep with delight.Oh how i laughed, when i watched this film at the cinema. I found it to be extremely entertaining, so i have compiled a selection of my favourite scenes:-When two campgirls try to seduce Jason but end up being beaten simultaneously against a tree (you should have heard their seductive speech, \\"let's smoke pot\\" (in a deep unattractive russian accent). The next cool scene was when Lisa Ryder (women with a black Mop hairdo) tried to perform really bad martial arts but had her head slapped off,(i was hoping she would die, but she was still alive despite her head rolling along the floor like a cabbage). The beggining of the film was very misleading as it was actually quite good, but you should persevere through the entire movie, cos i guarantee it will put a smile on your face (if only in disgust)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie in the series by far","review":"Jason is frozen in 2010 in Crystal Lake Research Facility. In 2455, He's thawed out on a space ship and he kills away through the crew on the ship soon thereafter. Didn't something like this go down with Leprechaun [Anyone recall Leprechaun 4]? It was terrible when they tryed to send Leprechaun into space and it was even worse when they tryed to send Jason into space! This is by far the lowest point in the series. This series should've ended years ago, But filmmakers saw that they could make a lotta money producing sequels to these movies so, The series continued and continued and the inevitable result of that is movies like this.

It has a story of a low-budget Showtime softcore flick, combined with a spectacular quality of production. In terms of stagecraft, the movie has some of the best set designs... ever. What I kept thinking was: with a storyline this horrible (or lack thereof), who paid for this? Ultimately, the movie is a waste of time, and it is certainly not a serious horror film. It actually feels like a satire, with sexy female science students dissecting stuff while waring outfits too racy for a New York City nightclub. Basically, it is watchable, but one has got to see the farce of it, or I would start worrying about that IQ level.Half a star for actually making the movie, half a star more for great set designs, and a whole new star for nice college girls getting sliced up, amongst other things..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Horrible!

Good documentary in the special features about the friday the 13 th serie ;) Finally better than the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason should disown this one.","review":"The only reason this film gets two stars is for the idea and the upgrade (as short lived as it is). Sean Cunningham needs to take the Friday the 13th series back to the basics. I enjoyed the idea of Futeristic Jason and I really liked his new look although it seemed such a waste to do it for the last 10 minutes of the movie. As for the acting and awesomely bad dialog not to mention the Alien franchise rip offs (ex.. Jason wasting well trained grunts while people listen in. Remeber Bill paxton in Aliens? Game over man. And remember Alien Resurection when the Hybrid Alien gets sucked out of a hole in the ship? Even with it's many shortfalls there are some decent death scenes to enjoy.Only for true Jason fans.

I really had high hopes for this movie since ive seen all the other ones millions of times. It was both poorly acted and poorly written. The actors would blurt out cheesy lines that no one would ever say in a time of crisis. The actors were very unemotional and you could tell they never were in another movie. In my book the only thing that saved this movie is that the kills where highly original and highly gorey. The uber jason has to be one of the worse parts. you shouldn't have to give an unstoppable killing machine an 'upgrade'. this movie [stinks] its highly un recommended. If you want a good jason flick.

The general idea of this movie is okay, but the feel of a Friday the 13th movie just isn't here. The older movies, although most of them share a plot, are gobs more suspenseful and fun than this. From the first moment on, everyone knows that Jason is the killer. How much fun is that? Also, that female robot on the movie is just soooo cheesy.

I should have known as soon as I read \\"Jason in space\\", but since I am a loyal fan of the series, I gave it a chance. Everything about this movie, especially the plot was awful, and the acting wasn't much better. The ending was horrible, as I expected. The only good thing about this movie was Jason's killing style, he is back and meaner than ever, no mercy, by far in my opinion he's done his worst killing in this movie.

I just have to wait for Freddy vs. Jason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has the whole world gone mad?","review":"An average customer review of almost 4 stars? Have you people all gone mad or worse still have amnesia? Jason supposedly went to hell yeah? Then why is still in one piece.

Unfortunatley, he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space! Yes space! The budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good. There may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it's just not enough! This sequel sounds more like a Star Trek episode and completely ignores or escapes the true origins of a good Friday the 13th flick. Supposedly, a TWELFTH Friday the 13th movie is being made (if you count the excellent Freddy Vs Jason). While Freddy Vs Jason was indeed impressive, there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Str8 Garbage","review":"FOR 1 THING THE JASON MOVIES ARE OVER-RATED.

I always enjoyed the films and even though they had no budget and sub-par acting at best they have alwasy been entertaining to sit through. That was at least until part 8. But when New Line Cinema took over the series, they ruruned it. Jason goes to Hell was the worst movies in the series (a plot would have help), and Jason X isn't far behind. I like most people waited 9 years to see this film, and I was very dissipointed. There was barely any plot, at least the others had character devolopment. Buy to complete a set, not to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guilty Pleasure.....","review":"When I first saw this, I said to myself,'This is way too stupid'. I watched it again on the Sci-Fi channel, and thought it was entertaining. This and 'Freddys Dead: The Final Nightmare' are always getting slamed, but I think they're really entertaining. I mean come on! Who didn't laugh at the part when Jason puts the two camp girls in the sleeping bags and starts to hit one with the other. I also laughed when the head of the cyborg or robot chick came off. It was totally fake but I couldnt help but laugh. The desighn of the cyber Jason was really awsome looking, how the mask was melted into his skin. Just watch and enjoy, already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"C'mon, it Jason flippin' Voorhees!","review":"If you saw this, or are contemplating buying it, then you already know what you're getting into. Yep, it's Jason in Space. For those of you following the storyline of the Friday the 13th franchise, this really has nothing to do with it. It doesn't follow Jason Goes To Hell, and you will find no mention of it in Freddy Vs. Jason. It seems like the creative team behind this basically answered the question \\"what would happen if you put Jason in the future, in space, with cutting-edge technology?\\". Sometimes you almost forget you're watching a slasher movie (except for the kills, which are plentiful and fun). There are, inevitably, elements of the Alien movies threaded throughout the film, as well as nods to the franchise history. Despite coming from a 9 picture legacy, Jason X comes across as somewhat fresh, if not very original. Just sit back, crack a beer and enjoy; that's what these movies are for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of X dollars","review":"If are you feel like flushing federal bills down a toilet, then go ahead and buy Jason X.

Jason slaughters everyone on the ship . . . blah, blah, blahThe beginning of this movie is just SO wrong!!! Did the director even watch Friday The 13th : Jason Goes To Hell? How did Jason become chained up in some kind of Crystal Lake Secret Facility? The ending of the film is semi-decent.

Obviously Jason X seems to be set long after that.. but who knows? If Freddy and Jason met in hell prior to this film it seems that Jason was the victor. but it still could go either way.

Jason's new look was completely dull, cheesy and unconvincing. Hell, it doesn't even add a new level of horror, or of amusment. At least a B-movie can get a few laughs and enjoyment for the cheese factor, but not Jason X.

The pace of the movie was handled extremely well. There was never a dull moment and it was actually much more suspenseful than I expected.

I recommend if you can't take gore then don't watch this because there is plenty of gore and blood. It had a great ending that I wish to tell, but won't because it would ruin the whole ending.

I thought it was cool with the opening of the film with that girl getting cryogenically frozen with Jason, and then many years later getting thawed out.

There was absolutely no attempt at creating suspense or characters anyone gives a damn about. Jason as a money making prostitute. Now this is a new concept.

For a perfect ten, which it is not, Jason X, is truely one of the worst futuristic (or more technologic) horror movies I've ever seen (ever watched 'Leprechaun 4: In Space'?). Jason is frozen in an ice chamber, remade in the future, and killing a crew of space students. It is really stupid - the settings make an excuse for the writer to make creative deaths. Especailly when one of the students get thrown off a bridge and lands on a huge medal screw.

While the Friday the 13th movies always been known to be more of a horror aspect from its inception in 1980 up to its big finale with Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. This movie feels more of a science fiction movie than compared to being a horror film that the franchise has come to known as. I'm not saying that's a bad thing but it's like a interesting idea to move Jason away from the typical of what we've come to know about his character, still killing people even in space. Although this may not be the best film in the series but it can still be enjoyable to watch, I give the movie along with the nice extras a 2.5 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason X (2000)","review":"Well, I thought the Friday the 13th series couldn't screw up after seeing the first 8 films, but Jason Goes to Hell earned its spot in the 5 worst horror films I've seen. Now comes Jason X, I heard it was about Jason in the future, in space, I literally just wanted to avoid this movie, but if I had, would that have been a good idea?Actually, it would've, I thought this movie sucked too. Its pretty much a group of kid students, researching in space, and theres something about the end of the Earth, so the whole world is being transmitted to this new planet, this wa so stupid, and in my opinio, hard to watch for me.Then Jason turned into this robot type thing near the end, I literally just shook my head \\"no\\", and I saw how much of a fail this was. I know most people say \\"Dont take it seriously\\", so I'm not, thats why im giving it 2/5 instead of 1/5.

They are found 450 years later and brought on board a space craft where a scientist and his team of teenage students revive them and mayhem ensues.I thought the premise to get Jason to space and catapult him ahead a few centuries was kind of clever and there are some moments of humor throughout the movie that worked, but otherwise it's the same old same old. No one can act, they all do stupid things that no one not in a horror movie would do and Jason just walks around slaughtering everyone.

This movie is kinda gory, but sometimes its good for a Friday flick. Jason is really awsome in this one. Although he's not really the original looking Jason, the disfigured freak. When it shows his face in this one, his head is a normal shape. But other than that, this movie keeps to the original plot. Jason's out for blood in revenge of his mother's death. In this one, alot of people die, Jason's second death in this one is really cool. This girl gets a missle launcher and blows off his head, leg, arm, and heart. Then he turns into like a Terminator type of Jason, with this look, Freddy wouldn't have stood a chance against him. But the end is pretty good when they finally kill him for the third time.In this one, it shows some of the original cast members of the original movie, along with camp crystal lake for a few minuets.

When we finally see Jason get his upgrade, it is only for about ten or fifteen minutes and we don't get to see him go down town on anybody really. Jason should've gotten the upgrade near the beginning of the film to make it a little more exciting. The plot is ridiculous and even outrageous for a horror movie.

Later I was shocked to discover that it was a movie and whereas I enjoyed the movie, I think I still prefer the version I had as a child. With all that said, even if the animation isn't perfect and the story line isn't filled with tons of adventure, the lesson about friendships is beautifully shown between the acts of Todd and Copper when they're young and (more poignantly) grown up. Even from the age of 5 I was able to enjoy this story. It made me cry then and still does to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare story with thought provoking message.","review":"Never saw this one as a kid but got it for my children and started out watching and thinking it was too full of old cliches and sterotypes.

These complicated social issues are handled without being preachy or dogmatic, but making you really think. What an impressive change from the tired princess nonesense. The kids love it, has all the good elements of story telling and keeps them interested, but even my 3 year old talks about the problems each of the characters is facing.

Fortunately, they seemed to be friends just like they were young.

This movie is about friendship for the adults who watch this. However, I watched this with my two young sons. After watching this movie, my sons turned every toy they touched into a shotgun. In this movie the human characters point guns at other humans, mistreat the animals, and use degrading language. My husband is a hunter and we have always taught our children that a gun is not a toy and that you NEVER point it at a person. This movie just destroyed all that teaching. I also am disappointed with some of the language used in this movie. There is no swearing in the movie, but there is a lot of language you don't want your young children using.As a mother of two young boys, I will not be showing anymore Disney movies for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"actually, it's a terrible film.","review":"When this movie came out, I saw it immediately.

Unfortunately, they forgot to have the important things - plot and good animation. (In one scene with a waterfall, you wonder if they decided to do it \\"on the cheap\\".)I stopped seeing Disney films for a decade. It took \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" to get me back to the theater for one, and after that I went back and saw \\"The Little Mermaid\\" also.I would see this other two films (\\"Beauty/Beast\\" and \\"Little Mermaid\\") any opportunity I could.

Boy was I suprised.It has some of that but overall there are two strong, distinct messages. One, is that it is a harsh and violent world out there. From start to finish there are guns blasting away. The movie starts by blowing away the mother fox then moves to shooting at a moving car carrying grandma and so on and on. The movie ends with an ugly, violent scene between a bear and the man. At this my toddler jumped up and began hitting the table and TV screen.The second message is blatant mysogeny. Every woman is referred to as a meddling female or empty headed female.Neither is a message I want my daughters to have.

This is a story that revolves around two \\"arch rivals;\\" a fox and a hound, who meet when they are a mere kit and a pup. They then go on to develop a special friendship that is put to the test when reality intrudes. There is one part of the movie that is so emotional that it moved both my daughter and I to tears! But fear not: the movie DOES have a HAPPY DISNEY-LIKE ENDING! This story involves a lot of action, along with many adorable, codgy, and amusing characters. In addition, the animation is beautiful; reminiscent of Bambie. But most of all, The Fox and the Hound explores the true meaning of friendship against adversity - something we all can relate to!

The video quality is not restored at all and is sadly littered with scratches, jumps and a lack of clarity similar to the earlier Gold Collection edition. There's no clear line on whether it's the correct aspect ratio also becasue Disney were making different ratios than this film is presented in at the time (Rescuers Down Under) and so it seems strange that they'd jump backwards in futureproofing considering Walt's accumen regarding the Future and technological advances which must, even after his death, still echo through the halls. I find it very sad that classics like Bambi and The Little Mermaid can be treated so well and restored beautifully - and there was NO attempt to give this easy-to-love film a treatment it deserved. The only feature on here of any worth is a 6:32 feature about film making and a static art gallery. The other extras are all off other DVDs. Very sad.

Gun-toting Amos is over the top...the bear is unnecessarily scary....we found very little of it redeeming (the last scene where Copper stops Amos from killing Tod). I did like that the widow stands her ground with grumpy mean Amos. We also felt that the romantic overtones between the two foxes was completely unnecessary for this age group.

One example is how this old man is firing his shot gun at this kind old woman in hope to hit her fox for something he never did, after that he goes to a wildlife game preserve and sets traps for this poor fox and sets fires and tries to kill whatever gets in his way. When he finally is injured and tired of fighting and has to admit this fox actually saved his life (he should have been eaten by the bear!)

Poor Tod and Copper become friends but then they are forbidden to see each other and they don't even get back together in the end. What the hell?!The music is also too low, even during the bear fight. And speaking of which, that bear with the red eyes in the climax scared the crap out me when I was a kid. I still have nightmares with that bear sometimes today. I there anything I can compliment about this film...um, not really.

WHen it was last released on video, my dad bought it for me and as I watched it, I actually CRIED! The movie is so sweet and so sad (but not sad in a bad way). You can relate to the movie because I'm sure everyone had a best friend that you are no longer friends with for whatever reason. This movie shows that even though you aren't together, you continue to be friends no matter how different you are. Great message for kids (even if they are too young to get it now, eventually they will). There is one strong weakness to this movie though. The songs are horrible. This didn't need to be a musical.

The ending sequence where the hound makes his choice is way scarier than what one would expect givin the cuteness of the cover art.The problem is, I can't see myself ever wanting to see it again, unlike some of the real Disney classics like Sleeping Beauty.So, save a buck and try seeing it before you pay for this special edition package."},{"rating":"2","title":"not too shabby","review":"This is the second copy we've owned, as the first was eaten by our VCR.

When they do not return to their 'true friend' status afterwards, it's a sad statement of the harsh reality of friendships and for that matter, truth, trust, etc... terribly fragile objects, all, and once destroyed, not the same vessels of invincibility they once seemed.Very good movie.

Maybe it's not a big deal, but not sure I want her to see it for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic [Includes some spoilers]","review":"The Fox and The hound was a movie that I watched when I was 5 and I remember liking it. I watched it recently as a refresher. Well here is my honest opinions. The Fox and the Hound is a great story, it really is but some of the dialouge seems like it was from the 50's. The animations are great, except it dosen't have a disney look to it, but more of a Don Bluth look to it in my opinion. Yet some of the images of TFATH can be scary to some kids, such as the fight scene with tod and Copper would probably frighten a 5-year-old. Simply put, most kids would enjoy the film and possibly some adults can look back to when they were younger when they saw this film in 1981. If you are disgusted with the film, then don' purchase it, or if you do then get the 25th anniversary version of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Values","review":"watching this classic once more as an adult brings with it an entire new understanding of the deep values on which this cartoon is based.

Maybe it's the cruelties of life that have hardened me, or maybe it's the fact this dvd is crap, but I regret spending $30 on this dvd. Not to say the characters aren't cute and the ending doesn't bring about a slight misting of the eyes, but let's face it this movie drags on. To be honest the read along version (an extra on the dvd) was a lot more heartwarming than the movie. Nonetheless, if you have children between the ages of 3 and 8 I'm sure they lack the skepticisms I hold against this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea of a film ruined by massive, unfair violence","review":"This film may sound like a good choice for the children because it's animated and has cute-looking animal characters. I can well imaging it's advertisement: a whole-family film about friendship and loyalty. However, this isn't quite the truth.The film begins quite adorably with many heart-warming scenes. However, it becomes quite soon clear that this isn't really the harmless kid's film one might expect. To make things clear, this is a film about hunting with a lot of crude elements that will undoubtedly disturb many in the film's target audience. One main character is a gun maniac, trying to kill the fox using some cruel and highly questionable manners.In the end, this isn't a warm children's film. In fact, there are numerous scenes that will most likely disturb many children. It works best for adult viewers who won't get upset by it's dark theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"This item was a gift, so I don't know if the quality is good or bad.","review":"This item was a gift, so I don't know if the quality is good or bad.

It has parallels with dealing with issues like racism and selfless friendship. The movie may not be the most iconic and heard of, but it is a definate must for anybody who loves Disney films. It brings back famous Disney talents. The movie is beautifully drawn and the music is very good too. A must see for a lover of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has been my favorite Disney film since I was 5","review":"This is one of the REAL Disney movies, people; to those who are reviewing it in bad taste, yes, it is not the happy-go-lucky fuzzy friendship average Disney film. It pushes real values and a sense of the real world. I have been watching this film since I was 5 and it never warped any of my values about my caution for guns or perspective on certain situations, etc. This was a good Disney movie in the sense that it didn't end the way everyone expects Disney movies to end. It wasn't predictable, but it was a touching film. It's a Disney classic and my favorite, and for those of you who think it's unsuitable for your children, look into it first before spending your 30 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked Platinum Edition?","review":"I did not expect too much out of The Fox And The Hound before seeing it, because this movie is treated like any other \\"Gold Collections\\" such as Alice In Wonderland, Melody Time, The Black Cauldron, or even collectors items such as Saludos Amigos and Fun And Funcy Free e.t.c.However, once I started to watch, I could not stop the film. I truly enjoyed the heart-warming, but still a little sad story as much as I enjoyed Pinocchio. Although there aren't great songs in it, the animation is lively and full of face-and-body-expression like the beast in Beauty And The Beast. (And for this reason, this movie is a little too frightening for young children under age 4-5.) This movie also tells a good moral and a message.I believe The Fox And The Hound as well as Pinocchio deserves more than Gold Collection but less than Platinum Edition. Therefore I put four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie -- terrible DVD!","review":"This is one of our favorite Disney films. Why the low rating? The film ratios have been changed; in other words, the DVD is full screen instead of the original theatircal ratio of 1.75:1.

They don't fall off when I get on the floor under my computers to fix cords, hit reset switches, etc. These are the most functional suspenders I've ever had.The only improvement I would like to see in this line is to offer the same hooks in the suspenders that attach to the sides of my pants, not the front and back.Anyway, I wear long sleeved button down collars to work, no tie except on an unusual occasion, and these look good.

Unfortunately, this was probably not one of his best stories. This was one of those Doctor Who adventures originally released in the 1980's that was edited to be a full length movie. This technique has never set very well with me. It also makes the episode seem ten times longer than it really is. The storyline is too slow moving that you feel like you're being lulled to sleep. My advice is get the \\"The Mind Robbers\\", \\"Tomb of the Cybermen\\" and \\"The War Games\\" instead.

Then, lately, we were presented with \\"Thalia: Grandes Exitos con Banda\\" with the same songs but over Mexican music. A few years later, we were thrown \\"Thalia: Grandes Exitos Remixes\\" ,and now we have this, which has the same songs as in the cds i laready mentioned. Truly, I'm tired of her and her old same crap. Her songs have barely made to number one, and her voice is awful. Why did we need a remake of the marvelous Alaska y Dinamara's \\" A quien le importa\\"? Who needed her to sing her dumb \\"I want you\\"? How did she even survived outside Timbiriche, where she started her career along with Paulina Rubio? Wow, lets see what EMI or Sony throws at us next! \\"Thalia: Greatest Hits: Con Bossa Nova, Lambada, Salsa, merengue, Bachata, Heavy metal, cumbia, trance................etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same again?","review":"I like some of her songs like: \\"Regresa a mi\\", \\"Entre el mar y una estrella\\" and even \\"No me enseñaste\\" and I also have some of her albums. So when I went to a music store to check this production (I was planning to buy) I noticed that some hits weren't here like \\"Gracias a Dios\\", \\"Por amor\\" and \\"Sudor\\" which was a big hit back in 1992. The only good thing here is the DVD but come on!, it's like she's releasing an album every month, since 2000 she's been releasing one every 6 or 8 months, what's that?. She should come back with a brand new album, new songs.I think that her crossover album was good, she's talented but I feel like she's burning her songs in the sense of repeting them all the time.Finally I would have added \\"Closer to you\\" that sounds very good instead of \\"Cerca de ti\\" and \\"I want you\\" instead of \\"Me pones sexy\\" which sounds ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"que es esto???","review":"esto es realmente un grandes exitos?? en español pero con titulo del disco en ingles?? no lo entiendo porque si no vienen canciones en ingles le pone greatest hits, que malinchista se ve,no compren este disco no tiren su dinero no vale la pena, es muy denigrante para los que les gusta la musica solo nos quiere quitar nuestro dinero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, terrible, not good, bad, so very bad!!!!","review":"I never liked Thalia as a singer or actress (but I have to admit that she is pretty and has a nice body).

The tracklisting by Amazon is wrong. Mind you, I'd have bought just a DVD for $20 for the videos, but it's just odd to have included a CD with only part of the songs. If you want the DVD of the videos, buy this. If you are looking for a CD of Thalia's best, buy just the Greatest Hits CD w/out DVD. I also don't understand why someone had to post a negative review about Thalia, even claiming some of these songs weren't big hits. Tu Y Yo was number one on the Billboard latin charts and they claim that it was only a minor hit. I don't really consider #1 minor. It's all relative.

What Thalia should do is take a rest and came back in a year or two with new song. personally I think that she sings better in English than Spanish.If you have other of her albums do buy this it's simply...nothing.And by the way don't even get excited with the videos are simply HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"pesimo disco","review":"esto es un disco de grandes exitos?? porfavor no lo compren no desperdicien su dinero Thalia es una estafadora no canta, no propone nada, Thalia dedicate a criar lagartos deja la musica deja de robarnos nuestro dinero.de verdad no compren este cd no gasten su dinero, tengo un amigo que se compro el disco y quedo decepcionado y tenia el disco en ingles y tambien se decepciono porque Thalia se vendio a un sonido que ni siquiera pego y fracaso.NO COMPREN ESTE DISCO DE THALIA."},{"rating":"1","title":"THALIA IS A REAL PRODUCT WITHOUT MUSICAL IDENTITY","review":"Musicly, this compilation has nothing new and exciting to offer, she is an entertainer that has no direction, the only virtue she has, is her beauty and her ability to make people feel sorry for her, trough her constant media exposure, fake news about her personal life and excesive publicty.Her musical career has gone nowhere after marriying to mogul Mottola, ex of Mariah carey, the difference is that Mariah has a REAL voice. Thalia's english debut is the less Thalia cd, trying to sound to Minogue or Lopez or Rubio.Another quality of this latin star is to do FARSE in the spanish soap operas, her career is a complete farse, a REAL PRODUCT.

To give an example, Shakira's greatest hits album (2003) was composed in its totality of number 1 hits. Unlike Shakira's this album is composed of few real hits like Arrasando, not-that-big hits like Tu y Yo, and TOTAL FLOPS like Me Pones Sexy.If she wants to release a greatest hit album, she needs to first consolidate her career as a singer, and to stop changing styles of music"},{"rating":"1","title":"mmm","review":"mmmm este cd esta mmmm ps solo para los que quieras gastar dinero a lo tonto mejor esperemos a que saque un cd con temas ineditos"},{"rating":"1","title":"QUE PORQUERIA!!!!!!!!!","review":"Please DO NOT throw your money away buying this CD.

(One example: Smith questions throughout why Daltrey kept singing Townshend's increasingly-personal and introspective songs. As if Daltrey had any real choice - a point Smith himself makes near the end of the book when he quotes Daltrey expressing his gratitude to Townshend, without whom he would have been \\"a factory worker.\\")Townshend is a genius who has spoken so eloquently for himself, to God and to anyone else who cared to listen, for more than 30 years.

Get this film and I dare you to take your eyes off the Ray Simms character he plays -- there is so much going on that it requires repeat viewings to pick it up. Nighy's performance is just one of several great ones, but you'll be amazed by the depth he brings to the role. Brian Gibson directs this with a true rock and roll heart.

The description reminded us of This Is Spinal Tap (which we love) and we greatly enjoyed the movie. Bill Nighy's clueless Ray was really wonderful and Stephen Rea as keyboardist Tony Costello was enjoyable to watch but the scene-stealer was Timothy Spall's Bilbo Baggot, the drummer. I just about fell off my seat when he finds out that his most vivid memory of touring is when the Fruit played the Hollywood Bowl--only to hear they never played there. And Billy Connolly is always a treat to watch, whatever he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"I\`m Not Too Crazy About It","review":"This british movie about a 70\`s rock band named \\"Strange Fruit\\" that makes a comeback isn\`t funny enough to be a sucessful comedy neither deep enough to qualify as a drama. It\`s a competent, at times moving picture, not too memorable but mildly enjoyable. The acting is fine, but the plot, that focuses the band members effort to became famous again, isn\`t very absorbing or grabbing.What we end up having here is a little movie about the music business, showing how those who had sucess in their youth react when they aren\`t so stellar today and have to deal with their aging process. Mildly interesting, even if it\`s another movie to watch once and be done with it.

Wonderfully hilarious, with so much to offer! For anyone who has been on the road with a rock band, listened to a rock band, or indeed, lived, this is such an enjoyable film. The poignant moments are incredibly moving, though the movie is by no means suffocated with pointless sentimentality. And yes, the humorous parts are side-splitting. The story of the aged heavy metal band that try desperately to make it back to the top after splitting up 20 years before, is one that is a great basis for a brilliant film, and it doesn't disappoint for one minute. All the performances are amazing (particularly that of Bill 'I'm not fifty' Nighy as the well meaning but slightly dim lead singer, Ray. Be prepared for a marvellous evening in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So fun, So full of heart -- the Flame Still Burns!","review":"I loved this movie! One of only a dozen or so I have had to own. There's so much about what we lose as we grow older, and even more about what we still have -- friends, experience, talent, and a kind of grown-up bull-headedness that can substitute for youthful exhuberance. This is a movie that rewards close watching, or you'll miss the hundreds of lovely small bits that form its big-hearted, hilarious tapestry.I could babble on and on, but don't miss Niall and Connolly as the bleeding black-comedy heart of this film. And the ending, when we finally find out who this guy Brian is, and why so many people were wiling to set their lives on fire for him, is stunning and revelatory, both about the characters, and about us.

It arrived today - I assumed it was going to be another WS disc but it's actually double-sided with the WS version on one side and FS on the other.

I had the vague feeling I had missed something, so I bought the DVD, and I've watched the film now 3 or 4 times. It gets better upon repeat viewings. If you watch it, REALLY watch it. There are so many throwaway lines (e.g., \\"Little Feat. One point\\") that you just won't catch if you're not paying attention.The music is just great--very believable rock written by some people from bands of the era (Foreigner, ELO, Squeeze). The actors are perfectly cast. I especially loved Bill Nighy in the role of lead singer Ray--a fragile, aging rocker who makes your heart melt with embarrassment most of the time he's on screen. If you love the old warhorse 70s bands, you'll love this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Funny","review":"Wonderful movie that is funny and poingant at the same time. One way I gauge how much I enjoy a movie is how fast the time passes. This one was over way to early for me. The obvious comparison is Spinal Tap. Still Crazy is a kinder, gentler version of that great film, with more believable and sympathetic characters.

The acting is terrific; the story will suck you in and leave you wishing you could watch five more hours with these great characters. You WILL watch it again, thanks to the director's choice to keep it colloquial. You'll want to go back and figure out lines you've missed. The music is as good as some of the best 70's stuff. Why \\"Titanic\\" was given an Oscar and not this movie is beyond me. There's heart and humor and love and human foibles. Couple that with good music and prepare to enjoy.

The plot is as old as the hills: innocent man wrongfully convicted of murder awaits excecution on death row - innocent man is saved at the last minute by the good guy(s). This movie gives you cheating wives, cheating husbands, irresponsible fathers, paper thin plot, superficial characters, and boring dialog.

How can a person be so inconsistent?"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Crime","review":"I have never been a Clint Eastwood fan, neither disliking him or liking him, however, this movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I thought it was well written, well acted and I really liked the ending. It might've been \\"predictable\\" to some but I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I thought it had a great storyline and wasn't at all predictable. (You figure it will be a 50/50 chance of how it ends and if THAT makes it predictable, then I suppose it was).

The storyline is incredibly formulaic yet still manages to have HUGE gaps. Most of the \\"characters\\" are left totally undeveloped.

But using Doyle's coaching techniques, you can inspire their support and enrollment through trust, respect, and accountability.In addition, he provides useful insight into managing employee performance to help each employee reach his/her potential by focusing on their strengths, rather than weaknesses.The wise manager will follow Jim's advice and create a team that is committed to success."},{"rating":"1","title":"chrome?","review":"the only thing i liked was that the shipping was fast. i expected the nail polish to be kind of metallic because thats how chrome nail polishes are supposed to be. but when i tried it out.... i hated it.... it wasnt chrome... it was more like glitter polish... its not that bad because it was cheap... but it wasnt at all what i expected and i dont like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"You did a great job on the CD.

The system runs fast and purr's like a kitten for a while, and then, all-of-the-sudden it won't boot. Both times for me it turned out that the problem was in the DDR1 and DDR2 banks; and now they are both dead. System still runs fine, but only if I take out two of my sticks.

This movie, however, disappointed me. In particular, it was difficult to see Jesse acting pathetic, borrowing cars and badges and more or less being someone who uses his friendships to get what he wants. This is not the character I have come to love watching. The character's untreated depression is beginning to take over as a central feature of the movie. The movie featured, in part, a storyline about a girl that has supposedly been Jesse's friend, someone we have not heard of in the past movies. There was no resolve to Jesse losing his position as police chief. The entire movie seemed poorly planned. I look forward to the next movie and hope he starts to come around because the way the character behaved in this movie was just too hard to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Tom a favour and do not watch this","review":"This is the weakest of all the Jesse Stones. It seems mostly to consist of long periods of Tom and his dog looking sad. There is a great deal of almost meaningless 'manly' talk with other characters but it leads nowhere. In order to keep us awake there is a subplot involving a girl we have not encountered before who was a great pal of Tom's. She is a dope addict slut and dies. Tom finds her pimp.(Yawn). The worst is that we expected - were even led to believe - that something would happen about Tom's reinstatement. This is unresolved apart from a hint that there may be a change of mayor.All in all a waste of the cast's considerable talent and my dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH LIKE ALL THE OTHERS","review":"I like Jesse Stone. Many of the scenes seemed like cut from the scripts of those produced prior. Could not get into it. I thought his dog had died in a past episode(?) That was confusing.

My hold at the local library took almost six months, as this episoide has been very popular in circulation. So maybe I do not know much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert B. Parker is spinning in his grave","review":"Honestly. My wife and I have enjoyed the Jesse Stone series. Until now. When it was on CBS a couple of weeks ago, we sat down to watch it and after a half-hour of moody shots of Jesse's house, too many shots of that beautiful dog (whom we love), and one-too-many dialogue scenes that even Parker would have found embarrassing - we gave up.Look, I've been a Parker fan for thirty years and I admit he was never the most complicated writer. His dialogue was his forte and those who don't like his writing says it's TOO lean and TOO sparse. That's as maybe, but Tom Selleck and crew were always good at delivering it. This time, no sale. Tom co-wrote this script, and he's just not Robert B. Parker. Time to let this series go.For fans, go back and re-watch \\"Stone Cold\\" or \\"Night Passage\\" or \\"Death in Paradise\\" - the best ones in this series. And yes, we miss Viola Davis, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Part two","review":"I agree with all the other raters who gave this only one star.

My only comment is why can't they make more than one movie a year? Tom Selleck always delivers great performances. You can rest assured his involvement in a project will keep the material clean, interesting without lowering to sexual stunts Hollywood is prone to pull for an audience. I've enjoyed this series. I hope they continue to produce this character. If Blue Bloods ever ends- get Selleck to do this for network TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Selleck in this role.","review":"I love Tom Selleck in any movie, but after reading the Jesse Stone books by Robert Parker, I feel he was made for the role.

Tom Selleck is great as Jesse Stone. Casting of the other characters is well done also. Story line is entertaining, with enough mystery to hold your interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"going downhill","review":"I think I have liked Tom Selleck in everything he's ever done. He's a likable guy and a good actor, particularly in western and cop roles. I really enjoyed the first three Jesse Stone offerings, but they started to slip after that. If the next one isn't better than than \\"No Remorse\\" and \\"Innocents Lost\\" I'm giving up on this series. Selleck should stick to acting and hire some good writers, some who can write dialogue. While they're at it throw in an interesting plot again. In particular this current installment has everyone talking in the same clipped two word responses. \\"Do you do so and so?\\" \\"I do.\\" and \\"Were you at so and so?\\" \\"I was.\\" and \\"Are you a so and so?\\" \\"I am.\\" And that's it, end of sentence. This is OK for the Stone character but not for everyone in the story. Most people don't talk like this. This affectation is so overused it becomes irritating. Give us something better than this or give up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Superlative Job","review":"This high quality series continues with no let-down whatsoever. To the contrary, the plot and ambience are satisfying in a very dramatic way, the characters are well drawn, the music is moody and the dog is fantastic as usual. For some reason, however, this film endows the actors with some quirky speech mannerisms which can be somewhat distracting. But one can easily put up with all of that given the excellent mix of cinematic sophistication and entertainment which is quite rare for a prime time television movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start but ends strong.","review":"Saw the film last night, not sure, but it looked like a new creative team, co-writer? director? It started slow and I was concerned. I own all of the Stone films and after 10 or 15 minutes of what felt like a slow maybe aimless first several scenes, I was cringing over the possible decline of a favorite franchise. Happy to say I was wrong. This installment does meander a bit in the first act but it may be intentional because from that point on everything continues to build to a nice climax and a powerful ending. Many familiar faces return for Innocents Lost and some new, potentially maddening oppositional characters are introduced. Another good one I'll be adding to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Selleck at his best!

His bed hopping is still a sore point with me, totally unnecessary, as were his exploits in previous movies. Other than that, it's too bad we have to wait a year for the next installment. The dog is truly a great actor, just follows in the footsteps of Jesse and fits his personality. One of these days, the dog may save his life. The mob boss, Gino Fish, is a plus. The banter between them is useful to both. If anything, the episodes could be longer if we have to wait a year for the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid writing, good cast.","review":"This is the penultimate in this shockingly neglected series featuring Tom Selleck.

Tom Selleck and the entire support casts (which vary) of each of the movies do an excellent job of keeping the stories interesting and moving along. Although he is at the center of each story and there is a subtext and plot running throughout each, a viewer can watch each piece independently of the other and be satisfied. The soundtrack to this series is excellent and really enhances the mood and the cinematography is stunning. I really like that Tom's portrayal of Jesse is flawed vs. perfect and yet ultimately you are rooting for him to succeed and are genuinely sorry if/when any harm comes to him and/or his cadre of loyal friends and colleagues who help him make it through the night, one day at a time. The only quibble I have is that by movie #7, I think it's time for him to really let his ex-wife and her voicemail messages go and move on for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaplan DAT w/ CD Rom","review":"I have both the 2nd edition and the 3rd edition.

GREAT MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Waste of Good Talent","review":"I love Kate Winslet. I read the book first and then saw the movie. Let me first say, the book was much better than the movie. So much of this story was left out. I didn't even think the book was that great. It has a good and interesting plot, but it's so poorly put together. You won't be missing much by not seeing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does it end?","review":"I knew I was in trouble in the first few minutes of the film. A dreamsequence of a camera following a young child down long corridors- a scene that is a straight ripoff. Long scenes with Moroccans chattering at each other in their native tongue \\"cleverly\\" unsubtitled to create an atmosphere of \\"mystery\\". Or maybe to put the audience to sleep. The plot takes so long to develop, what there is of it, that finally... well, who cares?. The movie gets pluses for photography. The scenery is excellent. Great art there. In this it reminds me of \\"The Thin Red Line\\". In fact if you liked TTRL you may like this. But if you found TTRL crashingly boring you'd best steer clear of Hideous Kinky.I like Kate Winslet a lot. I'll sit through almost anything with her in it. Anything but Hideous Kinky. How does it end anyhow? I didn't bother to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot at ALL.","review":"There are a few reasons why this movie was made. I will list them in no particular order:1.) Kate Winslet needed a vehicle to prove she's not a major studio sell-out, but an indie film babe.2.) France needed to put its name on something.3.) Someone wanted an excuse to film a dewy Winslet lounging in the Moroccan desert.4.) Someone owed someone a BIG favor.Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't even watch it on cable. It was the biggest waste of time ever. I'm even a big fan of Kate Winslet, but I was totally confused by this. Plus, what's with those children? What was she, 13 when she had them? Winslet is still a tender 24 (only a few months younger than I am), yet we were to believe that she was the mother of two school-age girls, one of which was on the cusp of puberty? Call me a skeptic, but I found that completely implausible, especially since Winslet played a 17 year-old in the last film she made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous nonsense","review":"There is no story here. The plot is conveyed entirely by the text on the back side of the DVD box. The scenery is beautiful, but that's not why one gets this movie, is it? Winslet tries her best, but there is no POINT to this movie. Scenes transition harshly and without apparent cohesiveness, as if one were jumping from Chapter 4 to Chapter 6 in a book. The two kids also seem to try to act above the script and stilted direction, but they too fall prey to a meandering script. Avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should have just been \\"Hideous\\"....","review":"The most entertaining part of this movie is the title. I wish I had just read it, smiled, and then left it on the shelf. I must say I am a fan of Kate's (long before Titanic) and I watched this movie with a diehard fan of her's. However the only word besides hideous I can use to describe this film is PAINFUL! I watched it through to the end (after all I paid good money to rent it) patiently waiting for something to happen. Waiting for something that would make me care what happens to these characters.

Alone and vulnerable in a poverty-stricken country Julia finds an ally and lover in Bilal, a local lad with a habit of thieving but as the tension between herself and her daughters, particularly the elder one, Bea, escalates Julia is forced to re-examine the practicalities and prospects of life abroad.I didn't find this film particularly good and care little for it but it could at least have taken advantage of Morrocco's beautiful scenery - but it didn't.

I admire her in those two performances and find them daring and unparalleled. In \\"Hideous\\", I not only found the editing jarring during the first thirty minutes, but I never cared for the developing relationship with Bilal, the drifter. Those moments fell flat, adding to more distraction with the story. Winslet's lack of genuine responsibility as a mom for her two daughter's well being, left me questioning her character's intellect. On the flip side, Bella Riza and Carrie Mullan as \\"Bea\\" and \\"Lucy\\" absolutely shine and do a wonderful job. I'll just have to blame it on the movie's director, not on Kate. This is a film I wanted to like, but it left me wanting to go see Holy Smoke, again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft, melodic, lyrical","review":"If you love poetry you should learn Spanish if only to be able to read the poetry of Gabriela Mistral in the original tongue.

If you have any Geography skills whatsoever you should have no trouble figuring out a big part of this poorly made horror movie.

This sequel is so bad, I don't know what I can say to caution you strongly away from it. Problem number one: There just aren't enough characters to sustain interest. Brandi, a definitely talented and charismatic actress/singer is totally wasted in her role. Jennifer Love Hewitt will grind relentlessly on your nerves, and your sympathy level for her plight will become nonexistent. Instead you will feel as if you, the viewer, are trapped on that island....and bored out of your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible movie","review":"and I thought the first one was bad. this is worse, its a wonder that this series even made it to video. the only thing that made this movie somewhat tolerable is Jennifer Love Hewitt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"We ordered them all and watched them after they all came in. It came in on time so that's always a big plus to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Comparison","review":"This movie just didn't compare to the first, which remains one of my favorite suspense films.While \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" was creative and innovative, \\"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\\" just rehashes tried and trite horror movie concepts. (Namely, small group of people isolated in a remote location with no way of escape gradually gets killed off.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This is a terrible film that was totally unnecessary and unoriginal. It is just a rehash of the first film, I Know What You Did Last Summer. The film has a cliché epilogue that contradicts what came before. I won't give it away, but you could easily guess it. I hated this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a complete waste","review":"I don't think I could be more disappointed with this film. Basically, it took everything about the first film, bastardized it, and then asked the audience to be entertained...what a waste.I personally feel that the original is a good film. It's dark and atmospheric and is definitely saying something of importance about the very nature of guilt. While it may not have functioned as well as it should have literally, it did have a fantastic atmosphere and good characters (especially the non-traditional heroine).However, the sequel is just trash. Julie is now a typical heroine. All of her strength and power is gone. Any intelligence that had been presented with the original has since disappeared. Add that on top of the fact that the film is completely empty, and you're left with a film that is garbage.All in all, any good the film may possess is totally outshined by its faults. This is the kind of film that gives the horror genre the reputation its gotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad, but pointless....and what's with the ending?","review":"this has got to be the most pointless sequel ever made.I hated the fact that it completely ignored the ending of the original. the plot did not make sense and the ending was even more ridiculous than the entire movie. I know what you did last summer was one of the few slasher films that could have and should have stayed away from a sequel. I actually want a third in the series to tie up all the loose ends and ridiculously bad ending in this one. Not bad as a slasher pic, but pretty pointless sequel...."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you hated the first...","review":"this one's even worse! Brandy is a non-actor who acts in this film (she's not even good by sitcom standards) and Jennifer Hewitt is a non-singer who sings in this film. And, whattaya know, there's more killing! Wow!! Like Friday the 13th without the cult appeal. Enjoyable only by 17 year olds able to legally get into an R rated movie by themselves for the first time.

You take an already weak plot from the original and throw away any merits it could have in this lousy sequel. Jennifer is amazingly pretty, is the only point worthwhile watching. The end was a bad joke. If they are trying to turn the killer Will into another Jason, Freddy or Myers, it won't suceed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie was terrible","review":"If you thought the first was bad, then try sitting through the second one. The cast was great but the movie it self sucked badly. I mean, why can't the killer die and never come back? I mean the people in Holly wood want to keep movies going on forever so that they can make more money, like in children of the corn they made like five movies of the same thing. If only they could make one movie with out a squal. But I guess they just don't know when to quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"No-where near as good as the first","review":"Unlike Scream 2 this film fails to live up to the amazing original film. It was un scary, predictable, poorly acted {apart from Love and Freddie Prinze}, and the screenplay was horrendous! It was not humourous in the least and where it did try to be it failed miserably. The best scene in the whole movie is the car scene when Ray and his friend are singing along to White Snake. The killing scenes where a direct copy from the first one most of the time, using the same kind of effects to achieve the scares. It's just this time they didn't work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT!!!","review":"I haven't saw a movie like this in so many years.It was much better than \\"Scream\\"or\\"Scream 2\\".It was really scary wich is a goood thing.If you need something to creep you ot this is the movie!

But as for the movie, there's too much gore and not enough scares. Features aren't as great as they are made out to be on the box... a few trailers, a short (5-10 min.) and greatly disappointing featurette that is really just an extended plug for the movie, and the music video for Hewitt's \\"How do I deal\\". Rent this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely unnecessary remake","review":"This film, like so many others out there, did not score too high on my list. Full of too much violence and profanity, it will leave the viewer feeling like a voyeur after too many glimpses into Hewitt's character's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only scary thing about this movie was brandy's acting.","review":"Even the thought of making a sequal to the wonderful movie I Know... makes me cringe. Come on! Like any of this would really happen and to the same person. The actors were terrible, there was NO chemistry between jlh and brandy. The plot made me want to puke and so did the cheezy death scenes. Hello, wheres Sarah Michelle Gellar when you need her? The people who die are the lucky ones because atleast they can get out of this terrible movie. IKWYDLS was soooooooooo much better and worth seeing, don't waste your money on this and brandy, please stick to singing and leave the acting to the proffesionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was supposed to be scary?","review":"In this terrible follow-up from the smash hit \\"I know what you did last summer\\" 4 teens are lost on an island somewhere with a killer chasing them. If you ask me, the only thing that was \\"lost\\" in this film was a plot. It was such a pathetic attempt at trying to live up to the first one that they should just leave it alone. There is way too much blood and gore in this movie which turned it off to alot of viewers. Thank god Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe bit it in the first one because even they couldn't save this movie from utter disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie!!!!","review":"I've just seen \\"I still know what you did last summer\\".

First of all, it should have been titled \\"I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago\\" or something. Secondly, this trash had more holes in it than Swiss Cheese. Third, it wasn't scary at all, just stupid. They tried to add twists, but they were very weak and dumb. The only people who liked this movie are NOT true horror fans and probably haven't hit puberty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come back, Sarah Michelle!","review":"This sad sequel to the original had a few exciting moments, but they were few and afr between. But almost all of the characters got on my nerves, and the horror scenes were rather lame anyway. Luckily at the end it picked itself up...a little. But it definitely makes you miss Ryan Phillipe and especially Sarah Michelle Gellar, the best actors and characters from the original. Is it just me or is the fisher guy not scary at all anymore? And what's with the title? I personally think I STILL KNOW is a better title all by itself, leaving off the long end."},{"rating":"2","title":"ISKWYDLS Is good!","review":"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is a good movie. But I don't think that it's as scary as I Know What You Did Last Summer. But it's still is exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth your trouble","review":"OK. This is one film that should never have been made. For starters, the film crew lost control of their weather switch, there's too much unbelievable gore, and the acting is just, well, fake. You barely have enough time to get to know each of the characters intimately before they get killed, which is just as well because I didn't feel anything when they died. To quote from Scream 2, 'sequels are inferior films' - Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze Jr in the original were far superior actors. So save $15 and a lot of trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much like the original","review":"it was too much like the original oh come on we know the same killer is on the loose after the same girl and with the same wepon the only difference is different area, group of freinds and another killer this movie is also too much like scream ( the director has a one way mind )"},{"rating":"1","title":"last summer?","review":"Although this movie isn't really worth the time to review one way or the other, I just have to point something out. If the killer in the first movie was mad about what they did \\"last summer\\", then by the time this movie happens, it's the summer before last that he was mad about. So it should be called \\"I Still Know What You Did The Summer Before Last\\". Or, if the killer is now mad about both summers, it should be \\"I Know What You Did For The Past Two Summers\\". Or, if the new killer is only mad about last summer, but indifferent to the previous summer, it should be called \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\", just like the first movie. Or, to cover all the bases, maybe it should be, \\"I Always Know What You Do In The Summer, And It Always Pisses Me Off\\". Just a thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, but funny","review":"OK. The first one was great, MUCH better than this one. This movie is pretty bad, but it's really funny! I love how the killer is so incredibly NOT SCARY in this movie. He's hilarious! Oh, and the best characters died in the first movie, so I was cheering him on the whole time, since I hate Julie and Ray. If you haven't seen this movie and you liked the first one, you might not want to see this atrocity because it might ruin IKWYDLS. And the ending is stupid in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"If ya'll hadn't seen this movie, don't plan on seeing it. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. I can't beleive I wasted my good money on this dumb boring sequel when I saw it in the theaters along time ago. The first one was better but this second one was too trashy and I thought it had bad acting too. I think they should have never made a stupid sequel to this movie because I do not want them to make a third one. We had enough movie sequels already why are we having alot of movies that have sequels? I mean I think that's dumb. Some sequels are good but some sequels can be really stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of gore, lots of predictability","review":"I really liked the first film because it focused more on suspense than gore. With the sequel, suspense took a backseat. It was basically just hooks in the eyes, throat and chins, and no curiosity as to what might happen next. Now don't get me wrong. I think Jennifer Love Hewitt is hot as hell, but the filmmakers could've made it less cheesy if they didn't have her running around in a wet t-shirt for the duration of the movie. It was such a throwback to those 80's slasher films. Also, I knew right from the beginning who the killer's accomplice was. Will Benson! That sounded a little too much like Ben Willis. I knew originality wasn't in Hollywood's dictionary, but they could've come up with a name that wasn't so obvious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometin' Kool review on Sometin' FUBAR","review":"You know, if they try to be like Friday the 13 movies with all the sequals, i would not be surprised that in 20 years, they make one where the stalker has alsymers disease and I think they should call it \\"I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID THAT SUMMER\\" -Sometin' Kool"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Still Know A Good Movie When I See One","review":"This is one of my favorite films.The acting was real good,especially Brandy (What a surprise.)The ending was one of th best.The rain made it look like a real horror movie.Even though I do agree with a couple of other reviewers the movie was kind of rushed into production (I mean I never even heard of the guy who made it.)I still was pretty good.I'm only 13 don't get me wrong but I write my own stories and probably wouldn't thought of a better script. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and By the Numbers","review":"While the first movie was a solid suspense film with high production values, this gratuitous sequel is nearly a polar opposite.Basically, \\"I Still Know...\\" is a standard teenage hack and slash with more gore, but none of the heart and earnestness of the original picture. The T&A shots of Love Hewitt are blatant and smutty in their intent (this coming from a huge Love Hewitt fan who would otherwise enjoy such scenes).One can almost see the money-grubbing Hollywood suits rubbing their hands with glee at the idea of anyone plunking their hard earned cash on this turkey.Only horror junkies would find anything redeeming here. No recommendation (rent before you buy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I thought this was a great movie. It was really entertaining, but not that scary.

His interpretations of pagan worship, Mosaic Judaism, and Greek culture rang true. He related facets of stories I'd read all my life, but never imagined could have happened.

The real deal breaker is that the \\"Genuine leather sheath\\" was actually bubble wrap taped around the head. I'm actually glad that it was missing because it motivated me to send the tool back, which I probably would not have done only because of the several other issues. It is also not the same as the one pictured in the listing. The one I got has a blue, sparkle painted finish instead of the grey head shown in the photo here. I could have ordered this one from Sears for $28 shipped but I wanted the newer model and ordering from Amazon is just more convenient. It was also pretty beat up and scuffed - not that it wouldn't end up this way after a few uses, it was just another thing that put me off about this particular order. Companies and customer service let me down all the time, I guess this is just more disappointing because I've ALWAYS been satisfied with Amazon.

It's easy and relaxing if you want an escape from aerobics, and it gives a beginner simple instruction. I didn't feel intimidated.

Basically, to paraphrase, it takes the story and plot of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, world is getting taken over by OUt World again, yadda yadda yadda blah blah blah, it's up to Liu Kang again to save the world. O.k. this one barely gets a star from me and only because the effects were pretty good, everything else was a bit lacking in some parts. Some parts meaning all of it.The costumes and sets were great but the fighting seriously took a back seat in this one. At least Cyrax and Smoke were harsh. I wouldn't bother with this one, even if it is a part of the MK series, it's still not worth it. If you saw MORTAL KOMBAT, leave it at that and be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate Mortal Kombat film? I don't think so...","review":"When I saw ''MORTAL KOMBAT'', directed by Paul Anderson, I adored the movie. So I thought that the next movie, ''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation'', would be the ultimate Mortal Kombat film. But I was wrong. The prequel of this movie is far better, and the actor that plays Rayden in this movie ... for the role. So what we have here is: Some bad cast, some bad special effects, and a boring storyline. Watch this movie only if you don't have anything else to do, or if you are nine years old, and younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would anybody like this?","review":"This is probably one of the worst \\"films\\" ever made, period. At least the first MK movie was tolerable...this one is a complete joke. I think the goal of the script was to fit in every possible character from the video games, even if they were only there for a few seconds. Every interesting turn that the movie could have taken was completely lost by the insane number of these pointless cameos. They in no way added to the movie. Apparently those involved in the making of this film forgot about two key things that tend to help movies out: plot and acting. The horrible CG of the climactic (and yet again, pointless) dragon battle at the end is worth watching simply because it will give you something to complain about for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"MK Anhilation review part 2 part 1 on mortal kombat I/mortal kombat II DVD reviews 5.5/10","review":"Continuing, When Cage is killed. When Jax asks Sonya who Johnny is Sonya never responds. it's like the 1st movie didn't matter. James Remer is ok but not great like Chris Lambert's Raiden. Jax was ok & Kitana 1 of the characters with the strongest dialog from the 1st movie in this you don't care if she lives or dies. Is the movie God awful h** no I can tell you it's half decent & it's watchable. 10-15 minutes of build up then 2-5 minutes of fight scenes the soundtrack is good again & the story somewhat follows the MK 3 storyline. So not a good sequel but it's watchable I got better things to say about Anhilation than the live action Street Fighter movies or that Double Dragon crap the Mario Movie. You know imagine if Uwe Boll directed this how bad it would have been plus John R Leonetti had no credibility as a director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low expectations help this one out, but not much","review":"One thing that this movie does that is an improvement over the previous film is that they keep the story moving. The fight scenes happen along the journey that the characters are taking to stop the merging of the two worlds. This gives a more satisfying story than the first where they just sit around and wait for the next fight to be arranged.That said, the acting is still nothing special and the special effects (especially the early generation CG effects) are laughable. Still, there is plenty of action and that will likely satisfy the target audience: fans of the plotless Mortal Kombat video games series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real bad... shouldn't have been made in the first place","review":"I watched this sequel once, and felt cheated after watching it.

I can't decide whether I like this one better or the first one. Sure the original Sonya or Raiden wasn't in it but Sandra Hess I think is the better Sonya since she is more tough in the movie. Hello anyone remember her scene with Cyrax or Mileena!!!! Sheeva and Motaro looked pretty cool,n Im glad they had more characters. The story line wasn't THAT BAD for goodness sake. The Mortal Kombat movies are the only games turned movies that try to stick to the storyline as much as possible (unlike Resident Evil to name one).All in all if ur a MK fan or not, the fight squences/martial arts should be enough for people to buy it or rent it;they're damn awesome. And of course for us ladies, looking at Jax's fine body is enough for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"kan","review":"dont listen to the bad reviews this is one of those sequles that rise above the original.the only thing wrong with this movie is that jhonny cage died and it ended.it has better vilians from the game like the 6 arm girl the horse guy scorpians cooler with two of those things coming out of his hand and sub zeros brother which is half good half bad sonys mothers the best shes good looking strong and that attack where she screams and can destroy anything even a full grown man.and kan is 50 times better than sang suan hes stronger and that mask makes him look unbeataBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Effects Beauty","review":"It is hard to describe this movie other than to say it is full of very nice but predictable fight scenes. I'd say one of the only reasons to really watch it is for the amazing special effects seen in sub-zero's brother's ice spell.He casts an ice bridge, and I swear I felt like I could cast that spell too, it doesn't look computer animated or anything!Another reason is that it's mortal kombat, and mortal kombat is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WAS JUST TOO MUCH","review":"THIS SEQUEL WAS DEFINTELY UNCALLED FOR.

THEY SHOULD'VE LET CHRISTOPHER LAMBERT PLAY RAIDEN AGAIN. THE ONLY GOOD FIGHT IN THIS ENTIRE MOVIE IS THE FIGHT BETWEEN SUB ZERO AND SCORPION. THE FILM DOES HAVE SOME OK SPECIAL EFFECTS.

This movie gave Mortal Kombat a bad name. The first movie was great with it's awesome fights, good acting, funny moments and good special effects for 1995. This one had the worst acting, fighting, and special effects. You could even tell that they were not actually hitting each other while fighting. Plus, Sonya, Raiden, and Johnny Cage were played by different people. Next time the creators of the game need to hire a professional director, instead of doing it themselves. It was like watching a made for t.v. movie. They should have never made it and I pray the rumors about MK3 are just rumors.

They killed off the funniest character from the first movie in Johnny Cage. Once again to much is focused on Lu Kang and his quest to be the best. The special effects weren't as good as the first. When the characters do there animality's it's very bad looking.Don't waste your money on the flick. Even if your a hardcore MK fan I can't see you liking this.

For one, one of the main, central characters dies in the first two minutes of this movie, and they couldn't even keep all the actors/actresses for the roles (I think they only kept two?)! The story was much more confusing and harder to follow, the actors/actresses they got to replace the original ones were, um, bad... Okay, won't sugarcoat that either, they were awful.

No...I am just kidding; I pretty much knew it was going to suck anyway which it did.

I thought of one simple idea: if they are mortals, why can't some immortals grab a gun and shoot them? How hard is that? Come on. It's weird to see how there are so many characters coming and going which offers no purpose to the overall plot.

Rather than the first movie being about good vs. evil this is more like a Mad Max type movie where Kang, Blade, Jax, Rayden and the new Sub are set to roam the outworld. Fighting whomever comes. Lots of people come too because this movie covers MK2 and MK3, causing there to be 30 second fights. Then the last fight of the movie is a three on three battle which causes you to start getting into one fight and then they cut to another pair of people fighting, it is like watching a high budget Power Rangers."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"First they didn't bring back the original Rayden, Sonya, or Johnny. then they killed Johnny without even kissing Sonya.

Only get this if your sitting home on a Saturday afternoon, with nothing on TV, you don't have a girlfriend or wife to be with, or have a slick car to drive. I bought this movie because I just like to sit in front of the TV and not think sometimes. Let me say outright this movie helps you do just that. The plot is totally incosequential. Watch the movie to see people whomping on each other if your looking for a movie that has a plot and follows the Mortal Kombat style. Watch the first one it will do you better. This one was worth it to me as I just like to veg out. The movie's campy plot will leave you wondering why you paid for this movie. So just wait for it on cable. But, if you ever just wanna kill time. Buy this movie. I leave it up to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Don't get me wrong, I am not giving it one star for being what it is. I am a huge fan of the game series and actually loved the first film. That one was well done. 'MK Annihilation' is so bad it's too hard too overlook its faults, and I've tried. This idea should have been scrapped ever since word of the original actors wouldnt return. From the pathetic treatment of the characters (Johnny Cage? C'mon) to lame attempts at using everything from the games (Sonja finding Jax with his new arms all alone was a laughable scene, and Sektor and Cyrus were underused) it just stunk all around. Only worth it for the fight scenes and enjoyable actors like Robin Shou and Talia Soto. Otherwise, stay far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Describing this movie in one word is easy.","review":"CRAP! This is basically nothing more than an hour and a half advertisement for a game! The characters fly on the screen and are gone the next! I swear the director had a checklist of every character that he had to use! (OK OK, next scene we gotta put this dude in, a lot of kids like him..........OK print it, he's in the movie, next!)The fights were ridiculous and whatever morphing techniques they used were like campy 50's sci-fi.

Play the game and you've seen the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I really enjoyed the first movie, but this follow-up was less than adequate. My first beef with the movie is the failure to use some of the characters effectively. When some characters were used, unless you played the game you had no idea who they were because they didn't name them in the movie. Some guy would just jump out and you wouldn't know who they were and they'd be gone in a flash. Plus some usage was pointless like SubZero, Scorpion, and NightWolf. Also some of the cut scenes were too choppy. Not enough real scenery was used and the created stuff was very lo tech. My last problem was the untimely demise of Johnny Cage. This was just pointless and stupid. It was a real waste of a good character especially after everything they went through in the first movie. Overall I was very disappointed and the acting wasn't that great to begin with. Please save your money and stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Bother","review":"I have seen this movie two times now the first one was in the movie theatre on opening night the second was on superchannel.

The plot is virtually non-existant. The actors (most of which have been changed) are terrible. The special effects really make this look like a straight-to-video release. The de-masking of Shao Kahn really makes him look pathetic. And this was clearly designed simply to get as many Mortal Kombat characters into a movie as possible - no-one was particularly bothered if it made any sense.

It was corny, yes, but the martial arts action was entertaining and seeing Christopher Lambert cast as Rayden definitely was a big bonus. This movie, however, turned out to be totally ridiculous.First of all, both Sonya and Rayden are played by different actors, both of whom can't act worth a darn. In fact, none of the acting is that good, and the plot is as paper thin and unconvincing as the acting is. There are a number of character appearances--too many, in fact. Many characters play a small, only momentary role in the movie that makes you wonder if the whole purpose of the movie was just to show all the characters in sequence and then end it. Rain, Sheeva, Mileena, many of the classic characters scarcely exist.So, to sum up, if you like bad acting, a thin plot, horrible special effects, and even fighting that is really, really lame, then this movie might be for you. Otherwise, avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GAME HAD BETTER ACTING","review":"This film was a flop from the origanal and the new cast that replaced soyna and rayden were terrible. The characters were also bad. You would see maybe just enough of certain fights to meet a character or two from the sequal games but they were just crammed in the movie and then dissapeared before you could blink. The ending fight scene was also terrible and the animorphs were just corny. I was hopeing to see some hard hitting martial arts like the first when Liu and Reptile battled it out but most of the cast had no real impressive skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"It is exactly as I remember from my childhood.

Bad acting (not to mention many of the original actors are not in it), cheesy fight sequences, cheap effects, and most of all, terrible plot. Even if you are obsessed with the games, the storyline of this movie can become almost unintelligible at times. Not to mention the fact that many of the characters (such as Shiva or Motaro) looked awful. Remember Goro from the original? There is an example of a well done monster; huge, mean, and intimidating. The monsters in this movie just look ridiculous. And finally, what's the deal with killing Johnny Cage in the first five minutes of the movie? Common! It's just not Mortal Kombat without Johnny Cage!

And when he turns into a mortal, the whole thing went down the drain! However I guess there were a few good bits in it. The special effects were great. And yuck well I have to say it, where did this bit of Liu and Kitana getting all kissy and mushy come in? Actually that bit was quite good, especially when she was kidnapped. (Ha,ha.)

The cast is filled with ex body builders, ex porn stars and second rate martial arts movie stars whose performances just make you want to laugh. By far one of the worst movies ever made! Steer clear!

I'm sorry I even saw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God this is horrible","review":"Being a big fan of the Mortal Kombat video game series and the first movie, I had mixed feelings when I heard Christopher Lambert would not be playing Rayden (he was great). First off, I will say this, the acting is absolutely horrid!!! The acting in the first movie was so-so, but the acting here is simply terrible, especially the actors portraying Motaro, Sheeva, Nightwolf, and Sonya. And what happened to Jax? He went from a cool kind of guy to a token black guy who makes stupid wisecracks. Speaking of stupid wisecracks, James Remar as Rayden was a bad move, the only thing worse than his wisecracks are when he tries to be serious and philosophal about destiny. Shao Khan went from a fearsome enemy from the games to an overacting villian who ain't so fearsome, and why did Johnny Cage have to be killed in the first 8 minutes? Why oh why was this movie even made? Oh well, I just hope they don't make another Mortal kombat movie as bad as this steaming piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This s*cks","review":"This movie kompletely s*cked. It had no plot, unlike the game and the first movie. The only good thing about this movie, was the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"No storyline or depth, not worth it.","review":"Ok, I have seen both movies and was an ok Mortal Kombat fan. This movie was horrible. While the first movie had character development and storyline, this had none. The first movie stuck to the theme of the game, and even if you had never played the game at all, you could have understood it. Not in MKA. This movie throws out all story, and simply makes it one fight after another after another. There is not a single explanation about any new character's story. To someone who hasn't played all of the games, like me, the characters were pointless. No one had any point or any depth, and there wasn't any real reason to fear the bad guys. They simply were cut out bad guys who ran off nothing. Watch the first movie, and stay away from this one unless all you care about is endless, pointless fighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BAD SEQUEL","review":"THIS IS A BAD SEQUEL. THE FIRST MORTAL KOMBAT MOVIE HAD GOOD GRAPHICS, AND GREAT ACTION. THIS A LOUSY MOVIE. LOUSY ACTION, NO STORY, BAD SENSE OF HUMOR. THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS ONE IS KITANA.

To anyone else,I will say,avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete let down","review":"I really liked the first movie. The fight scenes were entertaining and realistic. Johnny was amusing....all of the characters actually had to conquer something in themselves and grow. In this one, it's all about fight after fight, yet the fight scenes aren't even realistic! Granted people can't really throw fireballs, but in the simple things such as kicking, they could've done a lot better job. You want to just strangle the person for wasting so much time showing off.another major let down was the absence of Johnny. Sonja and Radin aren't even the same actors...not nearly as great as the first one. They could've done so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walking Disaster","review":"The writers apparently skipped the course in school about how to tie plot points together...or even about having any plot points. The link to the first movie doesn't make sense, the random placement of MK characters doesn't make sense, there's an attempt at a romance which is really an insult to the watcher's intelligence, etc. Hate to say it, but your average episode of Power Rangers is an upgrade from this movie.

The best video game movie ever and fun even if you never played the game. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is the worst video game movie ever made. First off, anytime you can't get the same actors to reprise there roles you know you have a bad movie. A different Sonya and a different Rayden (No way Christohper Lambert would have done this stinker... not even after Highlander 2). The plot isn't just weak, it's stupid. One of the worst sequels ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sequel!","review":"What's up with this movie?! I'll tell you what I didn't like.

The only thing I liked about the movie was their cool powers! Sighning off,A Jurassic Park fan and lover, Ciao babies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad movie, bad...","review":"I do not see this movie as a sequal to Mortal Kombat. It can't be. Where are the actors, the great hellish locations, signature moves, where are they.Instead we get lots and lots of kung-fu fighting, phony 3d Animality animations, a weak Shao Kahn, very uninteresting foot soldiers and extremly boring locations.Oh, how I hated this movie, it's one of the worst sequals, others being, Escape from L.A. and Blues Brothers 2.Avoid, really, I mean it. I don't care if they pay you to watch it, don't. Believe me, even if you're collecting garbage for a living, your time is more valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big NO!","review":"If there was an award for the worst movie of all time this movie would be a ruuner-up.

I am a big fan of the games, yet I think that this film could have been a lot better. Robin Shou is a very talented actor, he just hasn't had his big break yet. Some of the fights were good, but some of them totally sucked. Rent it if you want a predictable martial arts movie, but buy all means, DO NOT BUY THIS!! Take it from a MK fan, see the first and play the games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont wast youre time with this movie.","review":"After watching the first one I guesed that annihilation would be better I was wrong the movie was one the most dumbest movies that I have ever seen.The special effects were cheesy the fighting was like something out of power rangers. Stay away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I won't bother saying much here because most people have said it all already- although I am a fan of the games and first movie this one sucked and had no plot and did complete injustice to most of its characters. The gorgeous Talisa Soto does her best, but fails to provide a strong performance because of the weak dialogue she is given. The actor playing Shao Khan is so bad he's laughable. The only good thing is that Musetta Vander is great as Sindel and Nightwolf is good, but sadly we don't see enough of them. Avoid this lame excuse for a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much stuff in it.......","review":"I liked the first movie a lot so when the second one came out I went to see it,I jus have to say one word about it: CRAP.I have to admit the effects and the fighting scenes were not bad, but I think there was too much characters (many of them appeared for seconds) and the story went too fast, it seems like the producers saw that MK was going down in popularity so they decided to put three movies in one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viewing this movie may kill brain cells","review":"I saw the first movie 4 times in the theatre, and this one once on video. Once you get past the recasting of actors, the addition of too many new characters for the length of this film, poor dialogue, bad acting, and the lack of plot, you have a couple of really good fight scenes (and a few attractive women in leotards). But that doesn't rescue this movie from a fiery, downward spiral. The sad part was, I didn't think any movie based on a martial arts video game could be worse than Street Fighter, but this one was (but not by a whole lot). Please do not waste your time with this movie - Utterly Horrible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Understand Where The Book Was Going But....","review":"it didn't quite make it. The author's attempt to shine a light on one of the oldest but still important topic of teen sex reads like an old Afterschool Special. Between the three teenage girls in this novel, they deal with abortion, infertility, rape, and HIV. Yes these consequences are real but the stiff, outdated dialogue makes it hard to take the extreme consequences in this book seriously.Hats off for the topic and the effort put out by this author. Competition in young adult fiction is tough. There's nothing wrong with hitting heavy topics but you don't want it to bounce off of deaf ears by not making the language and storyline fit the times. Most people don't like to be preached to, that goes double for teenagers. I suggest that you choose your approach through storylines carefully. It could make the difference of your book moving off the shelves to a cash register or just being moved over in order to grab another book by someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for anyone!","review":"Great gift-I gave it to a friend of mine who likes hippos, and he loves it.

This volume is entitled \\" Arab-Israeli \\"; in reality it deals with the Israeli side. That being said, it is a worthwhile book. The anecdotal quotes are illuminating. Lush sideviews are included for most of the aircraft mentioned. If, however, you are looking for coverage of the Arab air forces, I would highly recommend the Squadron title \\" Arab Air Forces \\" by Charles Stafrace. This title covers the development of Arab air power from their earliest appearences and also has great artwork. Put these two titles together and you will get a much more balanced picture of Middle Eastern air campaigns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arab-Israeli Air Wars","review":"An excellent review of the actual air-war.

A must have for any IAF/IDF or military aviation enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided and mis-titled","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book presents the Israeli side only. The book includes only two pictures of Arab aircraft and in both cases the planes are shown being shot down; there are no pictures of Arab pilots or discussion of the Arab side. I felt duped by buying this book (it was shrink wrapped in the store so I couldn't examine it before the purchase), so I wrote to Osprey about how disappointing it was. They were sympathetic to my dislike of the book and they sent a replacement title. This book is primarily a pilot's personal memoir, not a study or survey of the Arab-Israeli air wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"the maps are absolutely fake!","review":"though the book is interesting, it's obvius that is biased far beyond the truth. there are certain things that must be respected if someone wants to talk about history. sadly, the author didn't do that, and presents maps of the partition of Palestine wich are not only inaccurate, but fake and aimed to change the past. that way, he crossed the line that makes the diference betwen history and propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtually Hot, Plot Decidedly Not!","review":"Charlie Curtis plays the computer virtual game that gains sentience and begins killing off boyfriends both in and out of her virtual world. Despite killing two people at the beginning of the movie, the company obliviously continues developing the program. There's no police invest, no reality in the movie itself (a computer program that can remotely stop brakes from working? -- yeah, right).Pretty bad, cheesy special effects, even for the time. Lots of female nudity, its only redeeming quality, but no story really.Softcore porn at its finest. Charlie Curtis has also appeared on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, per IMDB.Awful film. Not recommended.Awful movie. Subscribe to Playboy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of misinformation","review":"This book is very well written, which perhaps explains all the good reviews it has recieved. Unfortunately, this means that all those people who gave the book a good review are now walking around with incorrect information in their heads. The preferred use of artillery of the period was counter-battery fire? Wrong. Counter-battery fire was only used very rarely, and then only as a last resort when one's own artillery was significantly weaker than the enemy's, and even then only when the enemy infantry or cavalry was under cover and there were NO other targets. The fact that the author states such an obvious untruth repeatedly, as if it were gospel shows he has little understanding of his topic, and is just repeating something he read somewhere.This is just one of many mistakes, given as an example. There are plenty of well-researched books on this topic. Buy one of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jayne Mansfield was a bigger-than-life star of the 1950s","review":"Although Jayne Mansfield never reached the heights of popularity and fameof Marilyn Monroe, her films are highly entertaining, campy and great fun.I am not familiar with The Sheriff Of Fractured Jaw, but I rateWill Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (with Tony Randall) as a little gem of a Cinemascope,Technicolor comedy. As she does in all her films, Jayne playsa highly exaggerated parody of Monroe, but brings her own brand of humorand sweetness to her roles. The Girl Can't Help It (also Technicolor and Cinemascope) has a big bonus because it features some legendary music stars of the 1950s: Fats Domino, The Platters, Gene Vincent and Little Richard. This one's a must for fans of early Rock 'n Roll. I forgot to mention that sultry Julie London sings her huge pop hit, \\"Cry Me A River\\".All the films look beautiful.

I thoroughly enjoy reading Indian romances, though I am disappointed with this book. There wasn't enough substance, the suspense is in short supply, although the love making describe by Edwards between the main characters (Spirit Warrior and Denise) is captivating, then again the plot is very predicable leading up to their union and what followed. By time I read 3/4 of this novel, I was hoping I would gain more insight into the characters as there was room for Edwards to develop the main and supporting roles better. In terms of the time frame, months appeared to turn into days in the story line. I was rushed through this book. It seemed that Edwards was hurried to publish this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh...","review":"I usually get excited seeing a new Cassie Edwards book on the shelf, but this one has to dissapoint me. I'm not sure what was wrong with it, but it didn't...shine in my face. Her other works are very well-crafted and beautiful but something about this one just didn't work for me. Maybe the fact that Spirit Warrior was a shamon. It kept him so holy. What intrigued me in her other work was how \\"wild\\" the male of the story was. But, in a way, Spirit Warrior was too \\"feminine\\" for me. And although Edwards uses \\"love-at-first-sight\\" in most of her books, I think she overdid it this time.
