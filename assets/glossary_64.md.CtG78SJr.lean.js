He uses concepts in his examples without explaining them until later chapters. In the chapter where he finally attempts to explain something that he used earlier, he refers you back to the beginning chapters where he mentioned its use. His chapter on OOP should be skipped all together. His explanation of patterns is sketchie. His chapter on CGI programming is a poor introduction.The typos, grammar, and overall flow of the book demonstrate that he wasn't interested in spending the time to put some thought into the project.I have over 12 years of experience with C++ and other languages, and I think that this is one of the worst presentations I've come across in years.He really makes the learning process a lot harder than it needs to be.

Misleading.I happen to have a Canon A410 compact handy. That one fits, but with only about half an inch to spare, and that's a very small camera with a pretty modest lens projection.So, if you have a long-zoom camera and you were hoping to get even more zoom out of it by attaching it to a scope...forget this item.

However, on lead vocals, they have Paul Rodgers of Free, Bad Company and The Firm fame. He is remarkably wonderful. I think it's delightful that even though we lost Freddie, an unparalleled virtuoso, Paul has stepped in and done a respectable job that doesn't have Queen fans covering their ears. Queen does a pretty darn good job on Paul's Bad Company songs in return.

I was a Queen fan in high school/college and saw them in concert in 1982; they disappointingly just phoned in their performance. I very, very rarely listen to the old recordings anymore, as they strike me as faddish and dated. But I've been a Paul Rodgers fan since Free, and for me, he's the real thing and brings passion, sincerity, and energy to the Queen material. For me, he's the reason to buy this CD. His vocals are incredible; in his mid-50s, he's a better singer now than he was 30 years ago. (He looks a lot better now than he did then, too; get the DVD.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen - Back for more Cash","review":"Sickening - I am NOT All right now. Queen was, is and will always be Freddie Mercury, Brian May is a good guitarist, Roger Taylor is a decent Drummer and John Deacon who really cares. The bottom line is if Freddie were alive he could have toured withthe local high school band and it would be 100 times better than this GARBAGE. Paul Rodgers was ok in his day, but, his day has long passed. I agree with the other review, at least have the decency to bring along a decent lead singer. The song collecion was poor and Bohemian Rhapsody is a total joke, a 3 minute replay of the original and 2 minutes of Paul Rodgers ruining the end. They can call themselves what they want, all I know is FREDDIE IS TURNING IN HIS GRAVE - THIS IS NOT QUEEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not a classic","review":"Having been a lifelong fan, I wasn't expecting too much from this watered-down version of Queen minus the late Freddie Mercury. If \\"The show must go on\\", they should have done it with someone other than Paul Rodgers. He doesn't like to stick around in one band too long. To a degree, the album works. If for no other reason than to hear what these guys have been up to. All the hits are included on this CD however, it would have been nice to hear some new material. Paul Rodgers doesn't have the vocal range for a lot of the familiar favorites like \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Another one bites the dust\\" and \\"Radio ga ga\\". This CD is mediocre at best. If Rodgers sticks with the group past their concert tour, I'd be interested in hearing a studio album however, I wish they would drop the name. These guys are established enough already individually. I'd give it a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's driving me gaga..","review":"There is one rule you have to follow when you have to rate this cd:NEVER EXPECT SOMEONE TO SING AS WELL AS FREDDIE DID.This goes to the people who \\"trashed\\" this album with their reviews.They will have to face the fact that Brian and Roger just could not sit and cry all the time after Freddie'death.It's been 15 years now.We all felt terrible when Freddie died,but Brian and Roger are still here.When I bought this cd I was sure that Rodgers was never going to sing like Freddie.So,I gave attention to the music,which is really fantastic in many of the songs.In my opinion,Tie your mother down,I'm in love with my car,Radio GaGa,I want it all and many other songs are in their best version in this cd.All in all,we have an album that is not Queen,but the songs' versions are surely in a Queen style.Personally I liked it very much and I hope they will make another record like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Crying Shame","review":"Dont be fooled by all the other rave reviews. This is NOT a Queen album, and this band is NOT Queen. This is Brian May and Roger Taylor blatantly grovelling for money and attention. Queen's music deserves more respect than this hard rock sludge fest. I saw Queen twice in the 70s and have collected every piece of live video and audio I can get my hands on. May and Taylors playing on this piece of junk is lackluster and uninspired. If they truly were interested in being the most progressive innovative rock band they once were, they would have auditioned for a proper singer and plummed their back catalog for superior material. This is a shameless greatest hits show with a third rate Robert Plant clone who knows nothing about dramatic vocal interpretation. Spend your money on \\"On Fire At the Bowl\\" and see what Queen was really like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels like cheating on Freddie","review":"Half of the band is back, and the sound is great indeed. It may be easy to replace John Deacon, but Freddie's shoes could never be filled. Still, this is a great CD. The new Roger Taylor song \\"Say it's not true\\" is pretty much worth the price of the CD alone. Having been a fan of the band for 30 years, I couldn't help but feel nostalgic and a bit sad while listening. I admire Brian May and Roger for Rockin' on. Would have Freddie Rocked on if another member of the band had died? More than likely, yes. So we can't resent Brian & Roger for doing so. But I still can't shake the feeling that I'm cheating on Freddie. That's why I can't give this CD the full 5 stars. The other star is in heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"2/4 Queen + 1/4 Bad Co = Bad Queen!","review":"First of all, I think it is commendable that these 3 \\"blokes\\" have gotten together to record some live music. However, call it for what it is. This is NOT Queen, folks. The 4 men who made up Queen were the only incarnation that should be able to use the name \\"QUEEN.\\" It should have been called May-Taylor-Rodgers. John Deacon has respectfully and righfully so refused to do any sort of Queen reunion, including not playing at the Hall of Fame ceremony. Queen is no longer, folks.As for the cd, it is so-so at best. Rodgers is an excellent vocalist, just not doing Queen songs! Brian May has always been one of my favorite guitarists and Rodger Taylor an outstanding drummer. Memo to both of them: Write and record some newly written material of your own! You both used to be excellent songwriters."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOSTALGIC GA GA","review":"Like the live Cream release, this too comes across as a big stinky business deal. No new album, just play the old tunes for the old fans. Yuck! Boo! The sound quality of Return Of The Chumpions isn't good on the bass side of things. Actually the mix in general isn't too good. Seems like a rush job in my opinion. Maybe, I'd feel different if this was to promote a new album, but it's all nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia. On the other hand, \\"classic\\" rock band DEEP PURPLE, do have a great new album \\"Rapture of the Deep,\\" which has sold close to a million copies worldwide already. Bravo DP! Sadly, the media will promote this recycled rubbish from Queen, but ignore the new and innovative Deep Purple album.Talking about the state of the ART!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This is the worst thing Queen...er...half of Queen...have ever done. It's even worse than Hot Space. Kudos to John Deacon for sitting this one out. Paul Rodgers just cannot sing these songs, and he sounds ridiculous trying. I like the songs that Brian and Roger sing, but that's about it. If you want to hear Queen songs performed live, don't buy this. Instead, buy Queen at Wembley Stadium or Queen On Fire- Live at the Bowl. This cd is for the most hardcore Queen fans only. I'm a pretty hardcore Queen fan, and I almost hate this album. This is not Queen. This is half of Queen, that dude from Bad Company, and three other guys most people have never heard of. This cd will only make you want to hear Freddie. Let's just hope they don't do a studio album."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW COULD THEY","review":"This is absolutely the worst album that I've ever heard. I didn't even want to give it one star, but the system makes you rate the album. If you are a true Queen fan, you should not buy this album. It is painful to listen to Paul Rogers attempt to even sing a Queen song and try to \\"act\\" like Freddie Mercury."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIGGEST DISGRACE IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC","review":"This gets a - 100 score from me. And the same with the so called new joke Doors. My jaw drops when I see anyone giving this 5 stars. They definitely were not true Queen fans.

My version of MS Word didn't have the label number built into it as a template, so I had to go to Avery's website to download it. From there, I tried copying and pasting the addresses I had typed into an old label template into this new one, and it got really wonky on me. I've done the same thing many times before with other template numbers, so I'm not sure why this one was so screwy. I ended up up just re-typing all my addresses in, and then it was fine, but I wish it had been easier.Overall, this stick well and look nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful gold foil return labels with dependable templates","review":"Just ran the whole package of these labels through my color laser printer.

However, there is a regular 8.5x11 piece of paper in the box with the labels with \\"label outlines\\" to use as a test, and, for whatever reason, THAT did not conform well to the template. So when I did a trial run it was rather disappointing, but I just said, \\"Screw it.\\" And printed a (partial) sheet of labels, which came out perfect. Not sure why the trivial components of the package would be the least well implemented, but be warned. That said, the final product was great.You'll also want to use bold text on these, since the bold labels I made look MUCH better and are MUCH more readable than the more stylized, thin fonts I tried out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful series, but Zelazny had trouble ending it!","review":"This first book in the Amber series was incredible!

It got two very prestigious awards and had pretty good ratings but I wasn't impressed after reading the book. The things about the Pattern and crossing between shadows were too confusing. Corwin seem to be the only good prince and should get the crown but he wasn't too smart in trying to usurp Eric. The other books might be better and shed more light on the world of Amber but I like to be pulled into the story from the very beginning not in the middle. This book is also too sci-fi for me. I expected it to be more in the lines of knights and sorcery not Mercedes and guns.

What did people find to like? The dialogue and internal monologue is uniformly written in short, choppy simple sentences-- like a bad film noir movie. The basic premise isn't explained well enough, even once the protagonist recovers from amnesia. This leaves the readers plodding through action scenes (again with no interesting detail typically) without understanding why the battle, overall journey or any of the characters matter.

But after a while, I found Corwin, the main character, cocky and one-dimensional, and the whole description of the landscape simplistic. I felt that the author was copping out by letting them change the landscape simply by \\"thinking\\" it. And I also found it annoying that the main character could \\"grow eyes\\" after his original had been gouged out. I think good science fiction or fantasy should have some \\"rules\\" as well, not just an anything goes kind of mentality. I just could not get drawn into it, or get excited by it at all. All I felt was relief when I got to the end. I also do not see why people like it so much.

The abridgments (the editing)take a lot of language out of the works...a lot of Zelazny's little touches of charm and wit are lost for unknown reasons. It's good to see the interest, but to reiterate, I would prefer to see the unabridged versions on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy, Complex, and Well Worth the Time","review":"A man wakes up alone in a hospital with no recollection of who he is or why he is there. He learns that he has survived a car crash and no one can explain why his terrible injuries are already healed. And things start getting weirder from there.This is the first book in Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber. Each book is short, but bursting to the seams with character development, plot twists, and top of the line narration. Each book is totally absorbing and compelling, and you are never quite sure who you can trust today. This brings the fight for succession to the throne to an epic level, and the way Zelazny crafts magic in his universe is fascinating.Remember - every city is a reflection of Amber."},{"rating":"1","title":"The confusing world of biological science gets more confusin","review":"Now, granted that I did not experience the world of biological science writing before \\"the McMillan book\\", but by all that's ecological, people find this book HELPFUL?

Some of my favorites are: \\"The Eye of the Witch\\", \\"Two Little Girls\\", and \\"Father Picard\\". And, that doesn't mean that the rest aren't as good.The intro song (\\".. Witch\\") is a great way to start a new story. It's evil, it's creepy and contains all the elements King's music is known for. It sets the stage for what is about to come.I like \\"Two Little Girls\\" even though it's missing half of the band, instrument-wise. It's very creepy. \\"Father Picard\\" contains some excellent verses and chorus structure. When combined with the lyrics and characters, both of these really shine. I have always liked how King uses different vocal tones to really creep out the listener.This is a story about witches, evil, corrupt clergymen, and ancient artifacts.

Blessed be!)seems to breathe on its own power to the ears of the listener. A dark orchestra weaving a Wagnarian opera spell to mesmerize and pull you in.

Some operations are also inadequately detailed, can't think of one at the moment but occasionally you'll see \\"remove [part]\\" without any hints as to how. Not very often though and in general it's pretty idiot proof, although it's important to remember that things that might sound easy in the manual (like removing a bearing cap) can be near impossible on a 26 year old car!

The pictures were very sweet, as well. The only thing that prevents me from giving a 5-star review is that I would have liked a bit more text. The author has a nice writing style, I just wish she would have shared more of her words with the reader.Matilda Mae: The Dog Who Needed a Name"},{"rating":"1","title":"mis-led","review":"The book was compared with other books that were adult reading books/dog stories. This book is for a 3rd/4th grader. It never listed how many pages. Sample pages showed pictures etc, but I didn't realize the whole book was a picture book with a short paragraph under each picture.Missed the 30 day return, book still sits in the box, at this point I'm looking for a child to give it to.

The story is not developed in much depth, and a reader expecting something like a novel or biography will be disappointed. However, both pictures and text are well done, and the text can be read very quickly, in under an hour. And the story is touching and uplifting, as other reviewers have noted. It would be a great choice to leave on a coffee table, in guest bedrooms, office waiting rooms, etc. -- anyplace where people will find it when they have a few extra minutes and might otherwise have to thumb through old newspapers or magazines. The length is just right for those purposes and the content is much more engaging and worthwhile than many of the alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading that will grab your heart","review":"This writing is not particularly deep and was not meant to be, but it will touch you deeply.

The book: Castles their Construction and History has proven to be an incredible aid to this end. I am stationed in Europe and use the book as a guide when I travel and explore the castles in Germany, France and Italy. The book is very technical, it wastes some space giving detailed step by step descriptions of many castles but the casual reader of history will find the drawings, photos and overviews of history very interesting. The text of the book is rather dull to the non-history buff. It was very useful as a reference book while at the University of Florida."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes too technical, but very helpful!","review":"I bought this book because, well to put it plainly, I have always wanted to design a castle of my own. Having no real talent for architecture, I thought I'd see how others had done it before, and why they made the decisions they did. This book does a lot for the novice who wants to learn these things, but does so with enough illustrations to keep the readers interest through the text. I can see why another reviewer said it would make a good textbook -- it reads like one, and provides quite the education!Add it to a military history collection, a chivalric texts collection, or to your Lego room for the next time you want a more powerful castle than the kit suggests (but, putting little lego men heads on pikes at the gates may be going overboard)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very pleasant boook about castles","review":"I really like this book.

There are plenty of illustrations and photos that are referenced throughout the book. For instance, if a particular castle is discussed and there happens to be a photo or illustration about it, the author will provide the page number for you to go and look at what he is describing.This is a nice book.

There is a definite balance to the album, however, with the few mellow tunes on the disc.

Meanwhile, some of the guitar riffs are so heavy and Black Sabbath-like you can't help but smile when you hear them.But when it comes down to it, it's the songwriting I personally pay the most attention to, and Squawk delivers huge. These guys just knew how to write great songs and because of that they deserve to be remembered the same way most hard rock 70's bands deserve to be remembered- because when the 70's were over, hard rock was never the same again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder it's forgotten...","review":"Listening to this album, you'll get a clear idea why this band wa buried forever in \\"underground\\".

The book is little more than a pale imitation of John Allen Paulos' highly successful \\"Innumeracy\\" series. I decided to review this book now because I recently read another book, \\"Debunking 9/11 Myths,\\" in which Dewdney's name came up. Apparently Dewdney has spent most of his spare time over the last few years peddling ridiculous 9/11 \\"Reichstag Fire\\" type conspiracy theories. I strongly recommend that you read John Allen Paulos' \\"Innumeracy\\" or anything by Martin Gardner instead of Dewdney, who has degenerated into a crank of the highest magnitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version a Disappointment","review":"I bought this book for my Kindle because of the $2.99 price and I wanted to learn more about the Ancient Near East. The book is less of a history than an archeological account. The original book was published in 1929. Though the book is quite dated, it would still be of interest as a time capsule of archeology. It must be said, however, that the Kindle version -- which does not have the original illustrations or maps -- is a waste of money and time.I would be interested in reading the original publication with the illustrations. I cannot recommend the Kindle version."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE DVD and Elizabeth Taylor","review":"Of course, this early Elizabeth Taylor movie is good and also the Cast.

Liz really wore some nice outfits. The acting was bland, the storyline ridiculous, and the movies is only about 30 minutes long or so it seemed. The ending came so quickly it was unbelievable.

I felt the author lacked passion and maybe even her interest while writing.I'm a big fan of The Rolling Stones and only read this book out of boredom rather than interest.The author fails.She shows some photos of herself, though none at all of her WITH Brian Jones.(except for her at the house and near The Pool.)I didn't find her book convincing. It seems as though she wasn't With Brian Jones much at all, except for his tragic and mysterious death.Since her story is written so blurred and passionless, I wonder how much passion she had for him. That was about the only subject that aroused my curiosity.I notice she's written another book also about Brian Jones.I'm not buying that, Anna."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth? Who Knows?","review":"The author claims she was Brian Jones' girlfriend and knows how he died. Yet she never made any allegations when the strange death happened in 1969. Why not? She was in shock, very young and shushed up by the Rolling Stones entourage, she says. The Swedish author's name was unknown to me when I picked this up. The book is well written, if a bit demanding of belief by readers in all that she claims to have been and done back in those long ago days. What took so long to reveal these claims?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total lack of quality and style; based on imagination","review":"This book is written in extremely poor style, with amazingly little detail from someone who says she remembers it all. The writer also claims she can remember everything Brian said, but her spoken English was described as very poor by reps of the Brian Jones fan club after her visit to Cheltenham in July 2000. So how can one remember \\"everything\\" when one cannot speak the language? It's not possible. One must assume that the scenes come from Anna Wohlin's imagination. - She also describes as facts things she has absolutely no evidence for: Brian being murdered by Thorogood, her being driven out of the country by the Stones organisation, and even a baby Johanna she miscarried! None of this she has absolutely no evidence for. In short: this book is absolute rubbish, and only a fool would take the story for real."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misguided woman's fantasy","review":"As a long time Stones archivist and fan, I have read every book written about the band and the late Brian Jones, and this is probably the worst. One can only conclude that Ms. Wohlin is living in a fantasy world because much of what she writes is nonsense, contradicted by virtually everyone and everything I've ever read. The entire book reads like a badly written romance novel. This poor woman rates only brief mentions in the numerous biographies about Brian because she really only knew him for a couple of months before he died, and unbelievably, there are no pictures of her with \\"the man she will love forever\\" in her own book! And finally, she is unable to provide proof of her allegations that Brian was murdered, her testimony remaining unchanged since that terrible night.

Their format and art are unique and very coherent, and their narrative is terse, basic, and factual. And Haywood's read easier than any I'm aware of.I would also include Derek Hayes' marvelous productions, but these are more in the genre of \\"art history\\" or possibly \\"history of cartography\\". They lack strong lineal lines, but are extremely valuable and entertaining.

They cannot be pigeon-holed into a genre and can blend many styles of music into perfection. \\"Soul Of A New Machine\\" is an album that has the band back in their more raw death metal oriented days. \\"Martyr\\", the beginning track, is a great choice to kick this CD off, with a crushing death groove to it along with Burton C. Bell's amazing vocals. Also, the band incorporates industrial in their music as well, especially in tracks like \\"Self Immolation\\" and \\"Crisis\\".

That probably would have been ok, except that over the years as Napster has changed it's program, XM has done little or nothing (mostly nothing) to coordinate with Napster on the Helix/Napster interface. You can no longer use Napster to manage songlists. Napster has been as helpful as it can in suggesting work-arounds, but one technician finally told me that XM has done nothing to update its drivers in the Helix. I'm not technically proficient enough to know if that's the case or not, but that's what I've been told. I do know that if I had to do it all over again, I would NOT have bought this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible warranty service from Samsung","review":"When the radio works it is good (except for frequent loss of signal when walking with it in standalone mode, ie, no external antenna), but pray you never have a warranty problem.

Don't be discouraged if you don't get a clear sound through your car radio. I had to end up buying an additional FM Modulator to install with the car kit, along with some antenna adapters.

You can order all this online. I might have $140 in the car kit, FM modulator adapter and the antenna adapters. So be wary of local shops trying to charge you three times what it is worth. I love the portability of the helix and being able to record your favorite channels. You can use it to pick up live xm when your outside.

I mainly use it to record XM 202 from 6am-Noon, since I'm usually still asleep while my favorite show is on (You can set it to record before you go to bed). One feature I wish the Helix had (a feature that they put in TV DVR's) is \\"chasing playback\\", where you could listen to a program from the beginning while it's still recording the rest of the program.I've also had some issues where a recording session would quit just a few seconds after it started. Fortunately, I was near the radio when that happened and a quick shutdown and restart of the unit cleared that up immediately. (Apparently, the unit needs a reboot after being on for a few days. No big deal.)Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Helix."},{"rating":"2","title":"so very close","review":"The xm2go is a sweet product. The only draw back is the battery life and the recieption.

My songs on the MP3 repeat sometimes and the headphone jack is faulty causing the sound to cut out and sound bad unless you hold the cord into the unit.

The FM modulator will not work unless you use it in the car adaptor cradle.If you don't care about this then I highly recommend this radio for you. If you do care about the FM modulater, don't buy this radio, at least not until Samsung corrects their error and puts out a fix to the FM modulator problem"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Because Zero Stars Isn't An Option.","review":"Mobile radio reception is horrible.

I live in a major city with XM ground repeaters, close to a lake and my home has clear views of the southern sky. Nevertheless, my Helix would randomly lose its signal; I could go for a couple hours with clear reception but then the signal would drop-usually when a breeze came up and rustled the leaves. I spent lots of frustrated hours trying to adjust the antenna. I would have been willing to mount it outdoors, but the cable is too short.Additionally, XM would not refund my activation fee. Thus, I'm paying $9.99 to learn that their service is unreliable. Until satellite radio (and their customer service practices) enter the 21st century, I'll stick to old-fashioned radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"american standard faucet","review":"This was a \\"used\\" faucet.

I was very disappointed by its windy, ostentatious style and unclear references to obscure events and people. The author writes in a Dickensian style, but only in the sense that it appears Ms. Kelly was paid by the word. In researching the report that this book was used in, I came across three-page biographies of that fascinating medieval queen that gave me far more information in a more cohesive, concise way than this entire 450+ page book. \\"Eleanor and the four Kings\\" just gets bogged down with muddy tangents and unnecessary, minute details. The author's voice has a holier-than-thou resonsnce and assumes a certain level of complete amoebic-mindedness in the reader. I strongly reccomend steering clear of this book and looking Eleanor up in an encyclopedia or reading \\"A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great biography but rough read....","review":"This biography will probably ranked in my book, one of the best on Eleanor of Aquitaine next to the one written by Alison Weir.

With that in mind, I thought the book was well written, superbly researched and provides a great deal of insights as well as cause and effects of Eleanor's presence in history.If you are serious about understanding Eleanor of Aquitaine, I would strongly recommended this book and the one by Weir as the two books that will covered her life with justice and with completeness."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This book is more of a history of the life and times of Eleanor than a traditional biography.

The book is well structured covering subjects directly related to Eleanor and subjects that are not so directly related. Its well sourced and is willing to admit that there are things we don't know.The writing style is a bit \\"flowery\\" on occasion. And the author seems sometimes to get swept up in the romance of the era on occasion. Most of the time its ok.

The female vocals (of which there are too few) take you to another plane of emotion. Listen to the sinewy yet sweet accents of the lower brass on every composition.

Basically, he says, success for Blacks (like every other group) depends on their economic self-reliance, which in turn comes from better economic education, better support by Blacks of Black-owned businesses, etc. What was surprising and refreshing to me was to hear his attitude of bringing people together to succeed (i.e. Blacks, Whites and other groups working together) as opposed to an \\"us-vs.-them\\" mentality. I don't think the majority of the book is \\"weird,\\" at all, as one reviewer claimed. He does veer off into a weird section on the non-HIV AIDS epidemic of which I couldn't really make sense.

I think he wrote this while watching that TV series where outer space alien lizards that look like people but are really lizards are running the government and dating most of the really good-looking women. He sure doesn't offer evidence, probably because he's \\"preaching to the choir\\" and doesn't want to clutter our minds with facts.

I know there are many things on your mind...\\" Sounds like she is talking to a child and makes you feel really silly. It is a very simplistic tape and doesn't lead you into to any deep relaxation. The first exercise tells you to listen to the ocean, and then very quiet ocean sounds play. It does not flow easily as a single visualization. Also there is a 5 minute \\"disclaimer\\" telling you not to drive while listening to this CD and talking about what will be on the CD, so if you wanted to listen to it again without being very annoyed, you would have to fast forward it.

I wish it had less distractions. I wish the music were not digital, and I wish the narrator talked a lot less. If you are looking for some guides, buy something else or check out You Tube.

It is distinguished from other similar products on relaxation only by the somewhat artifical and condescending voice of Mantell. Honestly, the coyness and honey dripping from her lips are more effective of keeping you awake than in encouraging relaxation. Her voice encourages you to lie there and wonder if she is for real, and soon your mind is going a mile a minute trying to remember if you have ever heard anyone else with such cloying vocal qualities.

The woman's voice is so soothing and relaxing as well as the music. She guides you through an imagery of being on a beautiful beach. I use some of the things I've learned from this meditation during the day when I am awake. For example she says when unnecessary thoughts come up to picture them floating away down a stream.

It is much more programmable and flexible than other makes. It works well in the oven, on the grill, in the smoker. I used it to cook a brisket for 12 hours when on vacation with my family. Having this device allowed me to leave the smoker and spend time with people instead of feeling like I had to be at the smoker to check progress all day long. The temperature seems to read acurately, the transmition range, although it may not be as long as the manufacturer states, is still very long, at least 70 feet while going through walls.

This is a minor annoyance, but what really ticked me off was that the probe failed (indicating \\"HIGH\\" reading) in conditions where my MIU France unit keeps on going. Unfortunately the MIU France unit doesn't have the remote capability. I purchased about 5 extra probes for the Taylor unit directly from Taylor by mail.

Much of that depends upon the nature of their confidence and where they sit in the \\"pecking\\" order of human beings, a.k.a., to whom they were married (denoting family power), where they went to school (usually denoting family power), and what firm they are with (often denoting family power), or who they know (as a result of family power). Therefore, the ethics displayed say a lot more about who's who in family power than about the topic of morality - since it is family power not God who governs the universe. For example, if you come from the right family, you can be a judge, and many have, or even a President, provided you are not a woman.

For the first time in a century, Arab attacked Arab, sending shock waves through the Middle East and beyond. But the war drums had been beating for months. And the conflict between Kuwait and Iraq had festered for years. Were the signs ignored? Did the White House know more than it revealed?

I recently obtained this book for use with a group of four-year-olds. The book was a hit with the kids, and to my surprise, I enjoyed it even more than they did. The high contrast, sharply detailed photos show just how these fascinating structures go together. The pictures and narrative both communicate respect for the skill and hard work of the Inuit builders, a father-and-son team. I heartily recommend this book to teachers, parents, and children, and also to those interested in documentary photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a 5 star quality DVD","review":"some of the people who wrote reviews were complaining about the DVD and they're saying that it doesn't play perfectly and episodes freeze on their frames and cannot be watched, but I have this DVD and it plays perfectly good and there is nothing bad about this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 'ol Times","review":"Great series and brings back the memories of growing up with this show every week.

The one problem, and a big one, is that the dvds are defective. I tried playing them on three different players and the results were the same. The pixels were messed up on several of the shows and, in two cases, stopped playing altogether. A couple of the shows could not be watched to the end because they would start and stop and then eventually stop completely. Returning the item is too much of a headache so we decided to let it go.

On this case, you can remove the belt clip and the support on the case so it is smooth.

The biggest issue I had with it is the two outlets are so close together that it precludes the use of two AC adapters at once (regular sized plugs might work). As a single outlet, I was first able to plug in a small router to get WiFi access in my car. Later, we used it to plug in my son's Nintendo DS. We had no problems with it, but the DS plug and the router plug did not fit on the inverter at the same time.I could not hear the fan noise over the noise in the car, which included my daughter's DVD player and the radio. Other than the inability to use both outlets at once, I am happy with this product._______UPDATE 2/2/13: I plugged in a small handheld vaccuum, and the power outlet immediately ceased to function.

I hid it at one end of the house, my daughter began searching in the opposite end of the house and the transmitter said \\"You're getting warmer... (which obviously she wasn't...)\\". Half the time she just found the bear accidentally without it giving any hints at all - it just kept saying comments like \\"You're fun to play with\\" and other such statements, but nothing to help direct her to the bears location. She just ended up wandering around the house and the comments coming from the transmitter were mostly haphazard and had nothing to do with where the bear was located. So the \\"fun\\" lasted for barely 10 minutes. I would love to return it, but we already threw away the box... If your child wants this toy, I would highly suggest you try to guide her toward something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The product more or less randomly tells your child she's getting warmer, and occasionally colder. This is a useless toy that should never have been sent to market.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dissapointed!","review":"It doesn't work as it states that it should. My 6 year old doesn't even try to get it to work right anymore. At Christmas we followed the directions closely. It doesn't really tell you when you are warmer, and even when we stood right in front of it, it didn't say we had found it.

Peter does songs that are pure moronic delights from the ridiculous \\"that's the kind of sugar papa love\\" to his pathetic cover of \\"Tossin ' and turnin\\".The song selections are just pure crap for peter criss's voice. Why didn't he perform songs like \\"Black Diamond\\" and \\"Beth\\".These songs suit his voice perfectly and though they have that Kiss sound it still is the only fit for his voice.This album is equal to a day on the toilet with diarrhea.It adds up to a long day of endless chunky dumps!!!!!!It is just pure crap and Peter would've known better if he hadn't been busy boozing and drugging it up..Oh well.If you're into torture or into smelly poop then scoop this one up.It's sure to stink up your crib!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRICE VERY VERY FAIR.KISS LOVERS DREAM.","review":"product was desribed unlike product received but you get what you pay for.word to the wise if it looks too good to be true it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Trash!","review":"By far the worst blemish of all the Kiss records.

This is still the worst of the 4 Kiss solo albums by far (Ace's is the only one worth a dang). Even if you can appreciate the varied musical stylings, Criss is still a very weak drummer; and by his own admission tone deaf! I would bet my life savings most people who bought this album gave it only one listen, if that. In the days of vinyl, most Kiss fans never even turn the disc over to side 2...back into the paper sleeve it went! One star for the music with an extra star for Peter to have the b@lls to put his name on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the name is this","review":"I am a huge KISS fan, I have nothing against Peter, but no matter how many times I listen to this... I wonder what was he thinking. All the success and drugs must have really gone to his head. Now I love Jazz, Blues and Rock, but this album doesn't come close to being good in any of those. It has nothing to do with his drumming or voice, just plain bad writing, its too poppy and overdone, no good melodies or lyrics. Not even good music... when peter said he wanted to do an album not like a KISS album... he did it... but making a bad album... its no wonder why his solo album went on to do the worse of the 4. Its also no surprise that his later solo albums went on to do virtually nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I would like to hear, but........","review":"This was a letdown just like Paul and Gene's albums. Everybody now can tell that Ace was the crown jewel who was never fully realised. His album stands as a classic, away from the KISS situation. Peter's album is not bad. It just was not heavy rock. If you are a KISS fan, you need to own this, because KISS fans should own all four. At least this was a legit musical album. Gene \\"If I thought I could make more money, I'd sell insurence\\" Simmons, just got a bunch of guest stars to sing and play on his album, trying to make a blockbuster recording. Peter at least gave some effort. This is a good album, just not what a heavy rock fan listens to often."},{"rating":"1","title":"More bluesy than Kiss","review":"I've had this solo album from Peter Criss for a year or two.

In my opinion it is a fine R&B record with some soul mixed in. Peter is obviously moved by a different musical muse than his co-Kiss mates. This is not a bad thing! People need to get a grip and give this record a break. Peter's cover of \\"Tossin and Turnin\\" was great and his song \\"Kiss The Girl Goodbye\\" was very bittersweet (ever heard that term applied to Kiss?) I'm not saying that we have a masterwork on our hands here, but this is hardly the 1 star dog that so many (including fellow Kiss members unfortunately) have made it out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"I know that this is not technically a KISS album and should be treated as Peter Criss' first solo album, but it isn't that good. It sounds more like a Jazz-meets-Pop-meets-Blues album.

In my opinion, to be a definitive encyclopedia of wicca and witchcraft, ALL prominent members of the wiccan community should be included, and not just the ones who write books for Llewellyn. For a more better resource of pagan biographies, I would have to recommend Raymond Buckland's \\"The Witch Book\\" (Publisher: Visible Ink Press)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subjective Trash","review":"I thought this book was extremely subjective, showing the Craft from only a single perspective. I was quite disappointed to see some reputable people not even mentioned in the book, and yet there is a multi-page entry about the author alone.

The great things about this show are the British perspective and also the fact that no character seems sacred.

Why? Certainly not out of any respect for their fear-driven madness, but out of revulsion for the unrelenting snide tone of the author. Sure the stories border on the grotesque, but so does Ms. Rosen's smug self-righteousness.

In the castle is blood, sex and pain. No, I'm not joking. Vampires live within the castle and enjoy torturing, raping and draining victims they catch from the surrounding landscape. Some nudity, orgies and lots of guns this film. The film is always changing right before your eyes. Yet it didn't really sell very well and had to go under many other names in the USA, such as Caged Virgins, Virgins and Vampires and Dungeon of Terror. I think the thing that really kind of damages the film is, in the end, the lack of any real plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bite And Suck","review":"There's something simultaneously sexy and creepy going on here.

Don't let yourself be fooled by such adjectives as Poetic, Visually stunning, Atmospheric etc. This excuse of a film featuring two repulsive females in ugly clothes roaming senselessly around the moors in search for any excuse for some uneventful lesbian activity is not even stupid enough to invoke some laughter, even though the audience I watched it with was powerfully tempered by alcohole and some pleasure-inducing mild drugs one is allowed to mention in the net review. But no! I'm deeply considering organizing a Jean Rollain fiend club here, because the three movies I was stupid enough to order were better off unreleased or unfilmed.

I love the guitar riffs and 80's style chorus.Of course when you start comparing this album with earlier and later material, is simply falls flat on its face like a mouse that decided that the cheese on the trap looked rather tasty.There are a few other tracks that stand out but as a whole this album is one to miss.

I have to admit that as a Mathematician I have been greatly biased towards Geometry. Having been so fond of the classics of Geometry I have never given much thought to Algebra at the higher levels. What got me so interested in this book is that Bocher does not write in the dry banal style typical of most mathematics books. He has a great ability to present mathematical topics in a way that I personally believe clever high school students could learn from this.In short I would recommend this book for people who are:1. Thinking of becoming a Math Major/Minor.2. Students curious as to how \\"Math works/Algebra works\\"3. Preparing to take a course in Analysis or Linear Algebra4.

The main (and most important) point of this book was missed: the dialect in African American communities differs tremendously from location to location. There are accent situations in St. Louis (the emphasis in the 'r' when speaking) versus Chicago (the lack of the 'r' when speaking) among black people. When meeting people from New York, there's an \\"ah\\" quality in the pronunciation in words. Format is different as well. Without the location differences, this book lumps all black people into one talking category and lacks credibility. On top of that, it went on far too long in overanalyzing the 'be' in vernacular, which is not as apparent in northern cities as much as in southern states. I wish the authors would've interviewed more black people from different regions (and different classes) before writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"Benny Hill fans will be disappointed.

Why didn't we get THOSE sketches?Instead, this dvd is filled with mostly low energy bits that fail to inspire a chortle. The sound and picture quality are bad too, but the sketches themselves are the greatest insult. The worst of them is saved for last, when Benny comes out dressed as an Asian man with a supreme intolerance for all races. The issue of racial intolerance itself is an unpopular one now, but if the bit was funny, one might forgive it as a classic joke from an earlier era. It's not funny, just offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benny Hill...well ahead of his time","review":"Ah yes. Benny Hill. Now there was classic slapstick comedy at its best. Perhaps one of the coolest comedians to come out of England, Benny Hill broke new ground in his brand of humor. Often pushing the envelope with racy sexy comedy for his time, he was a refreshing comedian more or less like a modern Chaplin with his silent comedy routines/sketches. This DVD seems to include his best moments from classic shows and it looks like it's going to be very good.

He gives gripping accounts of the different battlefield scenarios his unit adapts to from the open fields to the urban streets and houses. All along the way he sees his unit and close friends slowly whittled down by battlefield attrition. When it's decided that the 1st Airborne should withdraw, he gives the reader a suspenseful account of the nighttime escape through the pouring rain and encounters with the Germans, finally reaching safety across the Rhine. This book is a must read for anyone with an interest in the battle or the view from the front line soldier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book","review":"Great book with lots of patterns....Great book with lots of patterns....Great book with lots of patterns....Great book with lots of patterns"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I wouldn't recommend this textbook for a couple of reasons:1. It is not an easy read- -Since acoustics is not the easiest topic to learn about, one should look into a textbook that better explains the information in a simpler way that will benefit more students.2. I was told to purchase this textbook for a university level acoustics course and out of the entire class, not one student seems to enjoy reading the textbook, nor seems to understand the information clearly.I'm unsure about the other acoustic textbooks that are available out there, but I hope that there is a better one for students because this one is confusing and complicated- - also, I know many others that are not fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement Blades Do Not Leak","review":"This is a continuation of a previous review:As promised, Cusinart sent me a new blade set, and I was happy to see that it does not leak.

Good, solid, heft. Nice glass pitcher, wide mouth and base, and plenty of speed/power options. And, it all comes apart for thorough cleaning.But, when making smoothies, it would leave big frozen lumps. And the wide mouth doesn't have much of a spout, so lumpy smoothies or soups don't pour well and drip down the side. Plus, it seemed un-usually loud at any setting. Within a few months, it started leaking. I traced the leak to a hair-width crack in the blade housing, which quickly became a total failure. The blade is now in two separate pieces.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender Leaks","review":"When I bought the blender, only one review referred to any problems; however, checking back now I see a few more people having the same problem as I do. The blender leaks through the shaft that drives the blades. Right into the motor on the blender. I can also smell the engine burning and am not sure if it is from the liquid that dripped into the motor or the motor is burning out. I called Cuisinart and they said that they would send me another blade. I hope that it arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I purchased this blender based on the reviews I saw.

On my first use liquid spill all over my countertop and into the blender motor. Since it was too late to return it to Amazon I called Cuisinart. They sent me a replacement seal. When we tried to put it on we couldn't get to the part. Now, for some reason I can't get the top part of the unit to sit/stay on the bottom part. IT DOES NOT WORK. Cuisinart does not answer e-mails, and when you call the reps are clueless.

The rubber feet kept coming off, so I ended up taking them all off. Lid is hard to put on. The speed control in the front is meaningless. It does not do anything. So you ended up holding the middle speed button with one hand and the blender with the other. You can not leave it and do something else.

It doesn't have a flashy design (basic black), and it has the requisite glass pitcher. The mouth is wide, the pitcher short (good for stability.)

At the price point, this blender beat many others much more expensive. It's a bit plain in looks, but it sure does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll get your money's worth!","review":"I saw a similar Cuisinart blender in the store that was [more money]. The motor was only 350W; this one is 500W. This has a dial (which I prefer); the other had a touch pad. Everything else is the same. I called Cuisinart and she confirmed that both blenders are basically the same but this one is [less expensive] even though it has a larger motor.I bought it specifically to make smoothies and it's great. I don't pre-crush the ice--just add it with the other ingredients. It is extremely easy to assemble and disassemble. On the Waring this replaced, it was almost impossible to screw the bottom on straight. It is noisy, but aren't they all! I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic blender--glad I did not spend a dime more","review":"This replaced a 450W Oster, and I was expecting a mild improvement. Wow! What a difference! The 500W motor in this blender makes the Oster look like a weakling. This blender chews through ice and frozen fruit FAST--leaving no large chunks behind---making very nice smoothies. I see no need to buy a seperate Smoothie King device as long as I have this one. Must Buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash and Burn","review":"I've had this blender for several months. The selling point was the ice crush feature. I make a lot of smoothies and throughly crushing ice was key. I loved it for a few months. But then..it burned out. It started shaking and I always had to push my hand down on the lid to keep it from shaking. Then it started leaking, not from the rubber gasket, but from the blade. Liquid slipped through and after blending, I would pour my smoothie only to notice that the liquid mixed with the motor and black liquid leaked all over. So, my $40 blender lasted 6 months. I alway thought cuisinart was the best....but I think I will try another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 month","review":"Quite a big blender, 18 speeds aren't very useful, but it worked ok... for less then two month and two dozen shakes.

In one Ojo merely moves her hands to her crotch (one supposes to indicate that she has to 'go'. And in another, Ojo holds Snowbear up higher. Boring for me and my 2 year old daughter. [There is also a pull tab which in one case lowers a stool to the ground, and in another lengthens TP hanging off a roll. Wow!]Second, where there is innovation, it is difficult to use.

Maybe a case of not handling success because despite some great songs (as Gene says now: \\"K-Tel records had great songs, doesn't matter.\\") everything about this: the cover, the content (I like \\"Two Sides,\\" \\"Torpedo Girl,\\" the reggae tinged \\"Naked City\\" and \\"Is That You?\\") just sticks out like a turd in a punch bowl; I'll never forget the agony when my bud Chris Jones told me his mom liked \\"Shandi.\\" \\"Back in Black,\\" \\"British Steel,\\" \\"Women and Children First,\\" the first Iron Maiden, and \\"Animal Magnetism\\" all came out this same year and what we got was a parody of a Kiss record, that's right...parody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than average","review":"I like this album.

The album is not a total waste at all, but is clearly one of KISS weakest efforts. It's not bad. It's almost impossible for musicians like Gene, Ace and Paul, aided by expert studio musicians and executives, to release something that \\"Bad\\". It's just not so great, that's all (but SHANDI must be praised as their worst song ever!!!0"},{"rating":"1","title":"KISS Neutered","review":"Why neutered? Because this CD doesn't have any balls. This is a very bad record and is the worst KISS album of them all, not counting the solos. None of these songs would have made it on any other KISS album. Talk to Me and Naked City are the only songs that I'd even consider as good as poor. The other disco-like songs are just dreadful. It is hard to believe that just 2 years earlier, this same bad delivered Love Gun. The only good thing about Unmasked is I now have 2 CDs I can have my kids listen to without being worried that I'm exposing them to harmful words or subject matter: Kiss Unmasked and the Chipmunks Movie Soundtrack. And yes, the Chipmunks CD is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"This album caused Kiss to lose most of their fan base for years and years. In fact, they never actually totally recovered after releasing this clunker. Its no wonder, this album is a total sell-out. Its Kiss trying to appeal to the 6 year olds and their parents that were coming to all their concerts and buying their toys. Its Kiss puking out a painfully drab hybrid of pop and disco. Basically its a disgusting blight not only on Kisstory but also on rock music in general.Recommended: Hotter Than Hell, Creatures of the Night"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every band has its tipping point","review":"Black sabbath - Never say dievan Halen - BalanceScorpions - face the heatAC/DC - Fly on the wallMetallica - loadGnR- The spaghetti incidentIt happens kids. Big Bands get a 7 to ten year run of being on top then they reach a tipping point. All of them do it.Some make comebacks some dont. One thing about KISS though, in 77 they were the best band in the world. They took all the best parts of rock and amplified it 100 fold. Check out the largo show....amazing.

I think it has some rellay great songs from this era in time, I mean it was all about disco in those days and KISS made an effort to do a rock/pop/disco album and I think they did a great job. I dare you to listen to it again and tell me that \\"Shandi\\" isn't a totally awesome song with a touch of that summer feeling when you're cruiseing down the highway blasting the radio at full speed. And what about \\"Talk To Me\\" with the lust and dizzyness between a man and a woman;), and not to mention Gene's \\"She So European\\" with that whole world feel to it and women from another continent that speak with an accent;).

There are only two good song: \\"What makes the world go round?\\" and Ace's \\"Torpedo Girl\\". Gene do nothing in this album (a disaster!).

Vini worked pretty well with them on Dynasty, but this must be their worst ever-- even The Elder is better than this bubblegum-pop with 30-seconds of flavor.Ace's songs, while not up to par with his previous efforts, are the best tracks on here. If you liked Paul's solo album, you'll probably like each of his tracks on this disc. Each one of Gene's songs are awful, and not even worth mentioning. Tracks worth sampling are Talk to Me, Torpedo Girl (the underwater version of Rocket Ride), and Is That You?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss - 'Unmasked' (Mercury) 2 1/2 stars","review":"Review no.95.Originally released in 1980,'Unmasked' was the 8th Kiss album.Certainly not their best work,but tolerable.In my humble opinion,it's simply too tame as well as just too commercial for my taste.That's not to say that some Kiss fans that haven't heard 'Unmasked' before wouldn't dig it.Remember hearing how this lp had quickly reached the 'gold record' status when it first came out,but then overnight dropped off the charts completely.Can see that drummer Anton Fig had filled in for Peter Criss.Anyway,some of the decent cuts here are \\"Is That You?\\",the lp's single \\"Shandi\\",\\"Tomorrow\\"(seem to recall a semi-lame video for this song),\\"Two Sides Of The Coin\\" and \\"Torpedo Girl\\".A second-rate hard rock sellout catalog release.Purchase at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milquetoast Kiss","review":"After rocking the nation through a progression of solid rock and roll offerings such as \\"Kiss\\", \\"Dressed to Kill\\", \\"Hotter Than Hell\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"Destroyer\\", \\"Rock and Roll Over\\" and \\"Love Gun\\", the boys released \\"Dynasty\\", which was hit and miss. Then came \\"Unmasked\\". There are a couple of decent rockers on it, but not enough to placate the faithful. It's mostly middling pop and lite-rock. Of all their albums (make-up era), this one just might be the weakest. For the newbie, get the first six studio LP's and \\"Alive\\". Truly an excellent way to initiate oneself into the Kiss Army!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is'nt that bad","review":"I admit when I first bought this album I was like \\"what the hells this pop rock crap!?\\". but then I listened to it more and the catchy tunes grew on me. it really is'nt as bad as ppl say. songs like 2 sides of the coin, and Talk to me are really cool. Ace really shines on this album.and Shandi is an Australian classic!!, I'm Australian and this is kinda our album, because the US kinda scoffed at it, but it was huge when KISS toured OZ in 1980so just give it ago, and lighten up, its a pretty cool album."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALITY CHECK ON THIS CHEESEBALL BOMB","review":"People get a hold of yourselves! The four and five star reviews for UNMASKED are, frankly, an abuse of the Amazon.com review system. Look, a five-star album is STICKY FINGERS or REVOLVER or BORN TO RUN ... not a goofy slab of ear-candy from Kiss. Even if you have a sweet tooth for power-pop, UNMASKED is a cheeseball affair. Bands like Cheap Trick and the Babys could best this platter in their sleep. Heck, the Knack does superior work.I'm giving UNMASKED two stars only because Paul Stanley seems to be having such a good time crafting catchy, featherweight ditties like TOMORROW and WHAT MAKES THE WORLD AROUND. I could never take Paul seriously as a rocker after hearing him croon a goo-fest like SHANDI with such conviction, but you have to give him an A for effort. As for Gene, it took him years to get over this wacko play for the teeny-bopper crowd. Sometimes it seems he's still traumatized."},{"rating":"1","title":"total sell out","review":"first off by this time kiss had dropped peter criss and once again use anton fig too record this. also the type of sound on here is really just disco and by this time they were a kid band. its just okay its not really that good at all only for the kiss fan who needs everything by kiss but for most kiss fams steer away from this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best...","review":"This album is usually overlooked, but has some of the best tunes KISS ever made.

I don't mean \\"Hot in the Shade\\" bad. It's actually embarassing to listen to. With the exception of \\"Naked City\\" and maybe \\"She's So European\\", the songs range from unlistenable to embarassing to unbearable. What made it worse when it came out was that Kiss had previously released \\"Dynasty\\", which was a bit weak, and then they released this in the midst of the New Wave revolution and it looked like this was going to be it for the boys. Awful, awful, awful album. Give your money to the poor before spending it on \\"Unmasked\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Crap! That's all there is to it!","review":"They might as well just have took a dump in the record jacket and sealed it up for shipping. The stench of musical poo poo was evedent from the cover art, Kiss' attempt at humor. As the last frame of the cover comic confessed...(on this LP) They Stink! Why, oh, why is this album still in print? Have they no mercy? And why, oh. why, after so many years of being a rising force in the world of rock and roll would KISS allow this embarrassment of an LP to hit the market? It sucks, it blows, it stinks, it reeks, it deserves to be hidden away where no one can ever hear it again. Compared to UNMASKED, The ELDER sounds like Led Zeppelin II. And ALL KISS fans know how horrible the ELDER was. UNMASKED should surely go down in history as the ISHTAR of record albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the Worst............Ever","review":"I own between 450 and 500 CD's. This is probably the worst of them all. I am a Kiss fan. I have every \\"paint\\" era album. This is painful to listen to. The only song worth checking out is the Ace song \\"Two sides of the Coin\\" I believe it's called. Words cannot describe how awful this album is so I'll stop now. Even Ace's songs on this album don't make it worth buying. But then again, if you are a fan you'll buy anything...that's how I ended up with this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss lost there sound here.","review":"I bought this album when I was around 12 years and found it a little lame. O.K. a lot lame. Even as a kid I remember it was just a flat album. Peter Criss didn't drum a single damn beat on it and the Kiss sound was completely lost here. Fans of the original kick-ass fire breathing, stage smashing Kiss can just skip this one.It does have some nice preformances on it especially Ace and Paul. Pauls vocals are fab as always. But the whole Kiss thing was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under rated KISS","review":"This is a cool KISS album. It features tightly written, well crafted, melodic rock songs. All the songs have cool gritty rythm guitars w/ a clean and clear production. It may be a bit different than a lot of other KISS albums, but still rocks with some pop polish. Way better than Animalize or Crazy Nights because of the songwriting. It's a must in a collection I think. Not to start out with. You should get the first seven or eight albums first."},{"rating":"1","title":"good songs with poor production?","review":"Unmasked is far from one of Kiss' best albums. It's probably near the bottom and should be considered by diehard Kiss Army members only. However, it's not a total disaster. I think there are some good songs on here, but the production is horrible. It sounds like it was recorded in a tin can on the moon, and has such an \\"80s processed\\" sound it ruins the whole album. Can this be re-recorded or something?! Is That You is a very good Kiss song. Talk to Me is decent. I also like Naked City and Tomorrow. The rest is forgettable. This was obviously done when the band was in turmoil and half the members were half gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans may not like, but it was innovative","review":"The eighties had to be a hard time for bands, music like everything else was changing and Kiss went right along with that and tried to do something original, and they did it.Fans may not like it, and later they changed back to the original sound, but if you listen to this album, which i like by the way, you hear the influences they had on later to come bands.Some guitar riffs and styles i can hear in later Bowie sounds, also bands like Journey,Boston etc. ,and i can even hear a little of the mid eighties Joan Jett.So while it may have been not to fans liking, it was innovative for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is cool","review":"Wow what can you say this really sux!

But.......","review":"Unfortunately it is straight down the dustpipe from there. I remember when I bought the original vinyl back in college. After the first listen, I put the lp back in the sleeve and it's been gathering dust there ever since. Virtually unlistenable when compared to any of the groups previous efforts. Why 2 stars instead of one? \\"Ace Frehley lead guitar!\\". The final nail in the coffin of the original KISS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look again...","review":"\\"Unmasked\\" was the third in a series of albums that marked a drastic departure from KISS' signature guitar sound--\\"Dynasty\\" and \\"Music From The Elder\\" being the others--and while it might have stiffed and gotten critical lambasting at the time, it's actually a better album than it gets credit for, and but for the production, would get five stars from me.The songwriting was much improved, by this point--\\"Easy As It Seems\\" and \\"She's So European\\" showcase this, although other tunes such as \\"Shandi\\", \\"Talk To Me\\", and \\"Two Sides Of The Coin\\" need take no truck from disgruntled fans.I for one, however, would like to see a re-mastered, RE-PRODUCED version of this record, with either Bob Ezrin, Eddie Kramer, or Ric Ocasek at the wheel. It's a little too much poppiness that permeates all the way through, and could benefit with a little more grit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, put the masks back on!","review":"What's up with the reevaluation of KISS's worst CD? The songs are among the worst Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, AND Ace Frehley ever written! Especially funny is the comment that if the cd was reproduced it would be better. Well, WAKE UP!!! KISS, Hotter Than Hell, and Dressed to kill were poorly produced but it didn't matter. They were classic cds for a couple of reasons; GREAT songwriting and GREAT performances! All the production veneer won't change the fact that the songs on Unmasked stink! Buy ANY other KISS cd. AVOID THIS ONE!!!!!!!I don't expect to get any positive votes.

I like the song \\"Is that you?\\" but other than that, I can see why the tape was a bargain bin favorite and had many birthdays in record stores.

Though it had that influence it album was still good. In 1980 KISS realeased Unmasked...it was awful. The album was the most poorly selling album since 1975.

But that's fine with me.The down is not a high loft; it is listed as only partially down, but there are no coarse feathers I can feel. The comforter is stitched through in squares; not a box quilt to maximize loft and insulation. This will not be adequate as the main warmth in winter. However, the simple stitched-through contstruction should be sturdy enough for washing, even though it says dry clean.The bottom line is this comforter is attractive and a good value.

The problem is that the index is so tiny, it is rare you will find in it the word you want, or even one near to it. So you go on a hunt. Take the word \\"primacy\\". The nearest word in the index is \\"prime\\". But this is in the section on preparedness. So perhaps \\"primary\\", but this is not in the index. Try perhaps \\"first\\". There is much there, but nothing near \\"primary\\", and with no assurance that \\"primacy\\" will be anywhere nearby. By now you have read hundreds of words and are nowhere near the word you set out to find. I rarely find anything I'm looking for in this book.

By mistake I chose the Merriam-Webster. What I found was, like some reviewers said, it was \\"bare bones\\". There weren't even entries for common words despite its advertised \\"340,000 synonyms\\" (more than Roget's!). After trying to use the Merriam-Webster a few times I realized I'd made a mistake, so I ordered the Roget's. Sure, it takes a few seconds longer to look up a word, but you get 10 times more choices.

There are no step by step lessons to demonstrate what the lesson is talking about. The book does provide some sample code, but it is presented as an example; you do not build it yourself. This book tells you what to do, but you don't get your hands dirty by actually writing codes yourself and then seeing what the code does.I will say this though. The text itself is well written and is readable enough, given the dry nature of the subject. But I do feel this is more of a reference book for beginners.

At that time, Dom had just graduated from college, so if Rose is now ten, he ought to be 32.Aside from those and similar nuisances which are calculated to drive the reader nuts, the heroine is a cypher, Dom is obnoxious, and the ending is contrived.Maybe that should have been one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrooge-Like Plot","review":"A strange film with a certain weirdnes that cycles between periods of heightened fascination and introspective periods of observation where nothing much happens.

The main character is 78 year old man, a doctor and an intellectual who on his way to receive an honorary doctorate degree from the university meets people and places along the way that help him reflect on his childhood, youth, marriage, career and reconcile all of that in preparation for the inevitable death.

York's life, this book might be just what you are looking for, but if you are curious about the war, I don't recommend it. A very small portion of the book is given to discussing Sgt. York's involvement in battle, and the rest is a rather painfully detailed account of York raising money for schools. Though his cause was always worthy, at times the reading becomes mondane with financial and political jargon. The book seems to be worth reading, but perhaps with a little scanning being done. I believe the best part of Perry's writing, is simply seeing Sgt. York's character and reading his charming letters. Ho, ho.

Now the second half begins to go deeply, actually more than deeply - intensely, deeply, deep into his life after the war.

She's one of those rare talents who manages to write with a purpose AND a passion. The first time I read her work, the thought that sprang to mind was: \\"Wow. She's writing what everyone else is only thinking.\\" Sexton has a great capacity to verbalize the unspeakable, and she does it in such a way that it scars you and heals you simultaneously. Take, for example, her \\"Transformations\\" series (the re-written fairy tales.)

Save your cash, or you'll get a \\"Killer Pain\\" in your pocketbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was very disapointed with this book. I bought Mac OS X The Missing Manual along with this book, but the Missing Manual is by far the superior book (for about the same price).This book uses full color pages, large type, and large screen captures to waste space. It could easily have been condensed into half the number of pages, or better yet, just put online in the form of a web page where something like this belongs.The tips are mostly very trivial and obvious ones - I'm not sure I came across a single one I wasn't already familliar with. I *suppose*, if you don't know any of the little keyboard tricks for navigating your mac quickly, this may be useful to you, but I think I'll be selling mine - I consider it a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"I bought the \\"Killer Tips\\" in the hope that it would help me acquaint myself with differences between Mac OS X and the previous Mac operating systems with which I consider myself reasonably familiar since I am a Mac user of moderate competence. The book did not fulfill this expectation largely because the lack of a reasonable index which has only about 500 entries, far to few to find answers quickly to the questions that arise inevitably in the process of one's switch from previous to the latest operating system, a Jaguar of spots distinctly different than its ancestors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleazeball antics from the acned classes","review":"There's a short chapter on \\"cheap tricks\\" you can play on your co-workers that would earn the author a short trip to the front door in most software engineering shops. One of them, in fact, is reserved for \\"your last day on the job.\\"In brief, the \\"joke\\" involves dropping several hundred files onto the Dock -- this is a denial of service attack -- which effectively deprives newbies of a few moments' peace of mind. The author claims that only \\"reinstalling from scratch\\" will clean up the mess. (Command-TAB, Command-Q through the list also works.)The prevention and the cure, Grasshopper, is simply to backup your system before you allow morons like this to get near it -- Carbon Copy Cloner 2.0 and an external Firewire hard disk will do nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer topic and a Killer Book","review":"This is a great book! Scott Kelby has found a way to take the best parts of teaching a complicated subject and put it all in one book. His humor starts on page one and is sprinkled throughout the book.Scott goes into detail for each iApp (as we know the Apple help sections need more help) and I constantly got the \\"oh that's how it works\\" thought. The chapters are clear and makes sense.I saw this book listed for pre order on Amazon[.com] and contacted 5 of my friends. We each bought a copy and all love it, no sharing necessary. It is a great investment. This is a book I am reading and using, it is not collecting dust in my book library.This is a must have book for anyone migrating to Jaguar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tip or two for everyone!","review":"This is a terrific book for brand new users of Mac OS X, but if you're a long time user it's value falls a bit. A lot of these tips are keyboard shortcuts and other little things that you pick up just by messing around with the OS. But there are so many hidden corners of OS X that you're bound to miss a few and that's where this book comes in.The tips cover everything from the iapps, to managing the Finder, the Dock, the Classic enoronment, icons and more. There are so many tips offered, covering so many aspects of your Mac that you're bound to run into a few things that pique your interest. I discovreed the Font Panel because of this book and it has helped me so much, that it alone makes the purchase worthwile. Thats the kind of benefit this book can give.

After years of productive computing at warp speed in OS 9 and it's predecessors, I found myself suddenly slowed to impulse against my will. That is, until OS X Killer Tips. This book quickly and logically showed me the new way and put my frustrations at ease with little things like how to get my trash back on my desktop where it clearly ought to be, along with tons of other useful tidbits. I'm a very busy person and didn't want to spend the time reading other OS X books that are twice the weight of this little jewel. The unique layout along with great graphic examples got me up to speed in no time. Thanks for helping me find my cheese Scott!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't state the obvious","review":"Scott Kelby has written a book that is beautifully typeset and in fact does contain a useful tip or two, but the majority of the content feels to me as \\"stating the obvious\\".It might be a good guide for those among us who do not adventurously explore their new environment once they made the leap from MacOS 9 (or even Windows) to MacOS X, but I really doubt if this book gets used as a reference manual after the first read.In my opinion \\"Killer Tips\\" is not a good title for this book; it's more like another \\"MacOS X, the Missing Manual\\" type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am somewhat disappointed","review":"Dont get me wrong this album is pretty good for what it was. I am a Pethead so I cant give Petra anything less than 3 or 4 stars. The thing(s) I dont like about this album is its shortness(the concert was longer). 3 songs were cut from this recording for times sake(I dont buy that). The reason I dont is because Captured In Time and Spaces is considerably longer. it is apprx 73 minutes. There wasn't much talking on this one either.Enough of my ranting. The nagative things I described have nothing to do with musicianship or even the quality of the recording, both are somthing special. The choice of the song list is preety good. They are all the classics. The rock medly is my favorite.To sum it all up. This is not my favorite Petra album(I own em all) BUT it is definently a great one reguardless of my disappointment I just wish it was longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like being there!","review":"I have become, as of late, a Petra fan. My husband has been a fan for years. We went to the Farewell concert tour in Colombus OH, and I was won over. It was wonderful! Listening to the CD is like being back there. My favorite song? Definitely, at the concert and on the CD, it's the Acoustic Set. I love the cello!!!!! It's beautiful. And \\"Jekyll & Hyde\\" is awesome also. All of the songs are well done and the medleys are very musical. It's an enjoyable, rockin' listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense story of an airline hijacking written for the teen market","review":"This is an intense story written for the teen market. Linda Logan is on a flight from Dallas to Jamaica and she notices a man behaving oddly. Even though he passes all security checks, he still frightens her. It turns out that her instincts were correct. He is one of a team of hijackers with bombs strapped to their bodies. They force the crew to simulate a crash by diving towards the sea while issuing a mayday hail. The pilot is instructed to pull out of the dive at the last second and then fly on to Belize, where the hijackers have removed the jungle growth from an old airfield.The ransom demands are issued, but Linda manages to escape and find help from an unlikely academic source. When the soldiers arrive, she bravely volunteers to go back to help free the remaining hostages. The story is tense, the action is exciting and you are relieved when the hostages are freed. I enjoyed the story and recommend it to teen audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"The first YYYs CD was brilliant; punchy, tuneful, rough and raw, and it really rocked.

And for the YYYs, get back to basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Machine","review":"The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are amazing, but aside from an unexpected \\"Pin (Remix)\\", these songs are among the band's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First of all, I am a diehard fan of the Moody Blues. For those of you whom are musicians, you will be disappointed. I guess it is pointless to blame the French on everything. The camera angles are horrible. Sixty percent of the views are backs, rear-end shots and scans behind amplifiers. Even a few of the songs beginnings and main focal melodies are shot with the cameras behind the artists, its an embarrassment of French filming altogether and is a confirmation never to use French in filmmaking.The band lipsynchs and it is obvious none of the instruments are actually plugged in, especially with the drummer tapping throughout the complete performance.If you would just like to \\"see\\" the Moody Blues during this era and learn about HOW TO NOT FILM A FAKED PERFORMANCE, this is the DVD for you, but if you expect a live and enjoyable performance of \\"Knights In White Satin\\", or \\"Questions\\", you may as well watch it from one of the archives of a TV show from that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOODIES WERE THE GREATEST.","review":"AFTER WATCHING THE DVD FOR A FEW SONGS I WONDERED, OH NO, IS THIS REALLY LIVE? I JUMPED TO AMAZON TO READ THE REVIEWS (HEY, THOSE REVIEWS ARE REALLY HELPFUL), AND SURE ENOUGH, SADLY, NO, IT'S NOT. I SHOULD MENTION SOME OF THE SONGS DO SOUND LIKE LIVE VERSIONS. AT ONE POINT, RAY AND JOHN START TO SING A LITTLE EARLY, AND IT COMES OFF AS A HONEST CONCERT MISTAKE. NEVERTHELESS, IT'S A GREAT LOOK BACK AT A AMAZING BAND AND IS AS STATED, A MUST FOR FANS OF THE MOODIES. BY THE WAY MIKE PINDER, THE BANDS NOT BEEN THE SAME SINCE YOU LEFT, SO PLEASE IF ABLE DO A STUDIO ALBUM WITH THEM, ONE MORE TIME. GOD BLESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a lot of fun for fans of the Moodies","review":"After reading some of the one-star reviews, I was hesitant about putting the disc in the DVD player. Boy, was I surprised. This DVD is a hoot, especially for those who love the music of the Moody Blues. Technically, it's reflective of the times (1970) so don't expect a state-of-the-art production. Sure, they lip-synch some of the songs, but so what? Aren't today's videos the same. It's nice to see the guys in their younger days. The playlist is excellent. I highly recommend this DVD. Just keep in mind, the DVD is from a 1970 concert, not 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Performance","review":"I received my DVD from Mike Pinder's website. Early and signed by him. It is a great DVD. I was not able to see them during the 60s and 70s. So it is nice to see what they looked and sounded like. You can't put today's standards onto something that was done in the 70s. So if you are looking for a concert as it would be recorded today, than you would be disappointed. I on the otherhand thoroughly enjoy watching it. Even with all of its flaws. So if you are a true fan, You will want to own this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live...sort of","review":"I purchased this DVD from the Mike Pinder web site, and so received it a bit early, and have just watched it. Those who are interested in purchasing it should know that it is not completely live - rather, the band is in a live setting (a small club in France) but appears to be playing/miming to backing tracks of the songs. On about half of the songs, however, at least the vocals are live, and in this situation the band sounds fantastic. Sure, it was a bit disconcerting to see obvious aspects of miming, such as Ray Thomas appearing to pretend to play a harmonica during Lazy Day, electric guitar lines sounding when Hayward was strumming an acoustic guitar, and the band having to suddenly stop playing when the songs fade out (as many do on the record). But, that said, this DVD is still worth it for the at-least-vocally-live songs where the classic Moodies really show their stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIP SYNCHED CONCERT....BEWARE RIP OFF","review":"This concert is lip synched and is a very big disapointment. The only good thing is seeing all the guys together at such a early part of their career. There are a few songs where Justin sings live to the taped music. There are no cords going to the bass guitar or the 12 string and there are times you see Ray not playing the flute but you hear him playing it. And you can see John & Graham laughing through out the concert because they are no really playing singing live. THIS DVD IS A RIP OFF!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what the...","review":"I rented this from Netflix. They didn't indicate that it was fake, which became obvious immediately. It should be illegal to market this as live, if i purchased it i would demand my money back (plus pain and suffering). What was it like to be in the 'audience' i wonder. Amazon, it is not enough just to post reviews saying this is (bad) acting, you should say so up front. You're not amazon.con are you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder it's a \\"lost performance\\"","review":"I highly doubt the group or anyone in their camp gave the approval to release this thing. Most likely a case of 50 different possible scenarios that plague veteran rock bands on a daily basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lip-sync city","review":"I loved seeing the old TV video clips of the Moodies at an early age. The French TV session was proven to be comical, however, as the Moodies horribly lip-synced to canned studio recordings of their wonderful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll probably only watch it once","review":"A very poorly filmed show of the Moody Blues performing at a dark smokey Paris bar in 1970. This is what I would call a partially live performance. All tracks are the recorded music in the background with Justin occassionally adding fresh vocals, while lip synching to others. What was the point of this show? Surprises me that if they were at their peak then, why doesn't an English taped show or concert exist? This is a truly amaterish performance and should not have been released.The camera work here is awful with far too many shots of the band from the back, you can't see much this way. The best things are the good song list and seeing the band in their younger days ... that's all.What I would like to see is the footage of the Moody Blues performing at the Isle of Whyte concert in 1970. Bring that on.Avoid this DVD at all costs. It really is as bad as other reviewers claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S NOT LIVE. THEY ARE MIMING TO RECORDINGS.","review":"This is basically The Moody Blues miming to pre-recorded music. It's \\"Live\\" only on the sole fact that there is an \\"audience\\". And on top of all that Mike Pinder is \\"playing\\" a Hammond C3 organ and not his trusty Mellotron, that was what gave the Moody Blues they're unique sound. I purchased this a while ago and returned it to the retailer with the statement that they need to put some kind of disclaimer that this is not actually a truly \\"Live\\" performance. If you're a big MB fan than I guess you need this, as there are not a lot of \\"Live\\" performances with Mike Pinder in the group but what a let down. Wait for the Classic Artists documentary The Moody Blues this spring that should have some decent live performances.So in summation: it's not a live performance, it should have remained lost"},{"rating":"1","title":"toucansam","review":"I watched this DVD tonight, and have to say that it was great! I loved seeing the original Moodies smoking, drinking, and just getting into their music. I also really enjoyed hearing some music that didn't make it into their later performances; like \\"Tortoise and the Hare\\", \\"Don't You Feel Small\\". \\"Never Comes the Day\\", and \\"Lazy Day\\". These, among many of their songs, were not part of their later concerts.Although the sound was not up to current standards, it is still a great concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP ALL THE WHINING! GREAT VINTAGE MOODY BLUES!","review":"Okay, I see this DVD has been getting some bad reviews, so I figured I'd chime in a bit. Regardless of whether it's lip-synched or not it's still classic Moody Blues and something most have never seen before. The picture and sound of this DVD are great. The song selection is also stellar. Come on, you can never get tired of listening to Nights In White Satin. And let's not forget the very subtle but attractive packaging. I love the color choices. The silver they used on this packaging, it just pops, very nice! And the background almost looks like rain. It really fits the image of the band. Definitely an A+ title, go and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice photographic pressed flower and that is all","review":"I hastily bought this on pre-order thinking Alive Plus 5 Moody Blues quality on video, well what a let down. If you like looking at the Moody Blues, this is a fine and fairly clear picture of them. For that it is fun, as for the performances, ugghh. I adore the Moody Blues and this is pale and lifeless. With a few exceptions these are just the Moodies mouthing over the studio versions of the songs and it is painful. If you sit there wondering if it's live, it is not a good sign. It is a nice memento of them in pictures and that is all. If that is enough for you, then buy it, if like it does for me, the music comes first, then save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moodies good, music company rip-off","review":"Bought this DVD when it was released and was very excited at the prospect of hearing my fellow Brummies in concert again. I saw them frequently when living in England in the sixties and seventies.After seeing this poor Moodies DVD for what it was I wrote to the music company that put it out, but they never replied. One can guess why.Yes, the Moodies are miming - or the music company synced it with studio cuts - and it's a dull combination.On top of everything the recording is in MONO!Hold onto your hard earned money, and AVOID this rip-off at all costs as there are better recordings out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Interesting Piece Of History","review":"This is a raw piece of work. The cameras are in all the wrong places and the over-dubs are apparent everywhere. But, this is the only footage from that era that I have seen.

I expect more from this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and Powerful","review":"I had been needing something compact but powerful enough to clean up small carpet and upholstery stains left by my 2 year old and my husband. I received another brand for Christmas, but didn't feel it would quite do the job. So I exchanged it for this model, and boy and I glad I did. It was easy to use and did a marvelous job with the small stains I have around the house. This model is great if you have occasional spots to clean, but don't expect it to clean entire rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks","review":"I have owned two of this product. The first one that I had, I hadn't used it very often when the head snapped off where the blue part connects. I thought that it was my own fault for pushing too hard (trying to suck all of the liquid out of the carpet). I bought another one, since that part was not a replaceable part. Now with my second one, again, not using it very often, but also past the one year warranty, the hose just broke and is also not a replaceable part. This item costs over $100 and it seems that they use poor quality of plastics or a poor design and have NOT made a durable product. I am highly disappointed in this product and will not be purchasing yet ANOTHER REPLACEMENT. I will look for a different brand until they can provide all of the necessary replacement parts for their poorly designed device."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKY Vacuum!","review":"This vacuum is a waste of money! More time spent cleaning it after use than it saves you in cleaning spots. Best to use a sponge,detergent/water solution and an old towel. DONT BUY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cleaning up after kids and pets","review":"We have had ours for at least 7 years now and the hose just split. This is after MANY uses. We have 2 dogs, one elderly and one puppy. They don't get along very well so they are regularly marking their territory throughout the house. This machine is small enough to go anywhere it is needed to clean up after those little fur balls. A replacement hose is not available and it split right at the tool handle so I can't simply tape it up. I tried and it didn't work. I am now in the market for a new one and am trying to decide which one to get. I think the hose split at the point where is had the most stress due to where you hook it onto the unit for storage.For what we paid all those years ago and how much use we got out of it, it is definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I bought this hoping to use it for spot cleaning and areas stained from high traffic. I wasn't impressed with the brush use or with the suction capabilities. The biggest problem came only after a few uses, when the suction failed altogether. The problem (after my husband took everything apart) was the heater element itself. All the water has to go through it and it had gotten clogged with calcium deposits from the water (or cleaner fluid - that came with the product). It worked briefly after getting cleaned out, but that was a royal pain to do! It clogged up again after 1 or 2 uses and finally, after taking the heating element out altogether - it works ok. It mainly just takes up room in my hall closet, because I never use it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprayer Problem","review":"I had an older Little Green, used heavily and loved it, so I bought this model and have the same problem. It's a few years old and used only a couple times. The sprayer no longer works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spray broke after 6 uses","review":"The first time I used this machine I thought it was ok. It did spread the dirt and so instead of cleaning up just the spot, I ended up doing the whole area.. Small, easy to carry. Be careful when you put it back together after cleaning--if it doesn't work, you might have the gasket on backwards. On the fifth or sixth time, the spray nozzle quit working. Haven't been able to repair it.I wouldn't buy it again. . .for the money I'd spend more and buy a full size machine or rent one. For spot cleaning, I use one of the spray and pat dry cleaners (Nature's Miracle since I'm usuallly am dealing with pet stains)."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke within first month","review":"We have had this machine 2 years and put up with the broken head that cracked after the first month. Then about 2 months ago, it stopped spraying. I guess they only make it last for the first year. I called Bissell's customer service and they said there was nothing they could do for me. Wouldn't offer a discount on a new unit. Don't bother investing in this machine if you want something that lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my little machine!","review":"I have had my little green for about 3 years maybe even longer (mine actually looks different than the one pictured...older model with no heat) and still going strong. I paid $89 at WalMart and it has paid for itself. It is EXCELLENT for the car and spot cleaning. It is definitely designed for small jobs and it is quite good at handling them. So if you are looking for an easy to use machine for small clean-ups this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"After a few uses, the spray function stopped unless I removed the scrub brush and the extraction capability was really lousy unless I really leaned on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More flavour, please","review":"As my princess loves raspberries, I figured this would be an ideal gift.Alas, her over-enthusiastic use of this product did not produce the expected result - the cheesecake didn't taste of raspberries.Worse, we both felt a little hot and bothered afterwards and needed a long, cold shower to recover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still unsurpassed!","review":"All things considered, still no biography of the life and works of Sigmund Freud equals the one by Ernest Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful but not objective","review":"This is a book on Kashmir by a friend of Benazir Bhutto, thediscredited and corrupt former prime minister of Pakistan.

It would seem that the editor just threw together a bunch of disconnected scenes. There is considerable print damage that shows up in the DVD.

To me it smells much like most other scented men's products like shaving cream, deodorant, etc. A very linear light, fresh, crisp, scent. That being said, it's not bad. They did a good job creating and fine tuning a basic fragrance, just at a price of around $1 per mL you would expect a more complex cologne. Smelling this fragrance brings back memories of high school for me. Not a bad thing, but just not what I'm looking for, definitely a fragrance for the young crowd.If you're looking for a basic, crisp, clean, fresh scent and can afford it, then this product may be good for you. If you're looking for a refined, mature, complex fragrance keep looking. I'm not a fan of this cologne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest music","review":"I can remember exactly where I was when I first heard Meco's thrilling version of Star Wars in 1977. I have followed his career as he applied his magic to other great Science Fiction movies such as Close Encounters, Empire Strikes Back, Star Trek and Return of the Jedi. I even bought his \\"Best of Meco\\", but nothing has prepared me for the awesome power of listening and remembering all four of the Star Wars films. In forty-some minutes, you can recreate all the memorable scenes from those fantastic films and get a new insight into John Williams' great themes. And those two new songs..... Cool, man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not a Meco Fan","review":"Perhaps it was my fault for not reading the reviews or description more closely, but this CD is not at all wat I expected or wanted. While the CD is fine if you want a 70's Techno-Dance version of the various themes, I would have prefered a version closer to the original. Also, in another reviewer's commentary he or she mentioned voice clips from the movie. Well those are not the originals, and I found them quite annoying especially when Meco did a very poor Yoda impersonation. This CD reminds me of one of those 60's or 70's classics CD's where the songs are poor renditions by \\"various artists\\" as opposed to the original groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven and incomplete collection","review":"I've been a fan of MECO's music since the time of Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk. This latest CD was a disappointment. The fidelity of the album is poor, surprising when considering the tracks were digitally rerecorded and remastered. Case in point: The Empire Strikes Back tracks. The album title is a misnomer: Not all songs are complete as is the case with The Force Theme, Finale, and Ewok Celebration. And at a total CD time of 41:33, it wasn't due to lack of disk space. As for the new tracks, Duel of the Fates/Augie's Municipal Band stands out as the more interesting. But all in all, I found this a half-baked album. Meco should consider rereleasing some of his earlier LPs on CD, such as Encounters of Every Kind and Music from Star Trek and The Black Hole. As dated as disco may be, MECO was responsible for some excellent music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a must-have for all Star Wars music lovers...","review":"Meco's funky Star Wars musical renditions have been all the rage since he first started making them back in 1977.

A friend from the San Francisco area loaned me this book in an effort to help me maintain a healthier diet. At first, I was skeptical. Accustomed to four course business lunches and dinners, I didn't think I would enjoy vegetarian Indian meals. How wrong I was. The dishes taste superb and the directions very easy to follow. With my wife, we have even entertained business associates from India and they too have been impressed. With its emphasis on fresh, low fat ingredients, this book has made staying on my diet a breeze. Even though I still enjoy a nice steak once in a blue moon, rice and daals, as well as other recipes from the book, have become staples of my diet. My only concern is, how can I get additional copies and has Ms. Doshi written other cookbooks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best how-to-homeschool ever","review":"Cathy Duffy is honest, dependable and reliable.

Although this book gave an in depth look at the Jewish diaspora (covering nearly half the book) and a good discussion on the definition and introduction on diasporas, it gave less coverage to many of the other diasporas.

Also included are profiles of important figures such as actor Chief Dan George, artist Norval Morrisseau, author Tomson Highway, activist Anna Mae Pictou Aquash, and politician Phil Fontaine.

All I kept thinking is that he is a musical genius- technically and creatively. Each song is great on its own- all stars in an all star lineup. Everytime I fly, as we approach landing I HAVE to be listening to TO THE END OF THE WORLD- the perfect song as the place is descending- even if the attendants tell you to shut off all electronic devices.

Enjoying the absurdity of the wordplay is enough to give these stories meaning. despite a previous reviewer saying it was infantile - it think in this era of sappy books designed to enlighten people, which hardly seems to be saving society as we know it - a dose of weird and crazed thinking may do more to impact the way people think than a straightforward native with a \\"moral.\\" Dig it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe","review":"Pseudo-hip, pseudo-funny. I thought I would like this novel, because I have liked Leyner's writing for Esquire. I was disappointed. The book tries to be too many things: beatnik, gen-x, hunter s. thompson.

It was like trying to read Finnegan's wake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but that not that funny","review":"Is Mark Leyner funny? Yup, and clever too, and \\"My Cousin, My Gasteroenterologist\\" is full of good jokes. The problem, then, is that they're buried under so much junk and pseudo-transgressive \\"genre-busting\\" that you'd never know they were there unless you look really closely, and having to put that much effort into finding humor kind of negates its value as humor. Which is a shame, because Leyner's obviously smart and has something to say about something (His short piece - not in this collection - about the Death of Postmodernism is fall-out-of-your-chair funny). Kinda just wish he'd settle down and stop congratulating himself and write a real book, one of these days. This one's an amusing diversion, and he's obviously talented, but it's not much else.

Lots of British strumpets looking fab in micro-mini skirts, boots and figure-revealing fashions, along with copious amounts of nudity in a Hammer-esque tale of witches and warlocks and sleaze, Oh My! As horror, it's hokum, though a few scenes do capture the look and feel one hopes for in movies of this nature; as exploitation it's admirable for those of us who grew up with Creepy, Eerie and Vampirella mags, Hammer and Amicus Horror flicks, Frank Frazetta and Boris Vallejo paintings.

Song's like Lunatic of god's creation, Blaspherereion and the cult Sacrificial suicide are clearly inspired by the inverted way of life and the anti-christ. Dark lord Benton's deep grunts were (and still are) a standard the for the death metal scene. Deicide only lasts half an hour, but rages at full speed throughout its playing time. I think the younger generation must check this essential release.

This album is brutal, evil, extremely violent and offensive. What amazes me is this album came out back in 1990 and still not many bands release material as extreme as this. The standout tracks would have to be \\"Sacrificial Suicide\\", \\"Dead By Dawn\\", and \\"Deicide\\". These three tracks are incredibly brutal and catchy and any true death metal fan should acknowledge these songs as true classics. While other death metal bands may have more technical ability (Suffocation, Immolation), Deicide will forever stand out as one of the pioneers of true death metal.

Hey, don't get me wrong, I love thrashing and growling, but these guys sound very samey. It's hardly distinctive. Perhaps thats because pretty much every other American death metal band tried to rip them off afterwards, but it does sound cliched. I was expecting something really distinctive, but it's nuthin that hasn't been done better by other bands.

It takes several practice applications to get the shade just right. While it does cover completely, it is not flawless. You can tell that you've covered something up on your skin.

I would probably read another of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was an easy read. One of those books that you can just read and enjoy w/o having to think too much. Sometimes that is what I really want to read. I did find myself at times disliking the woman priest. I guess just because she shouldn't have been a priest. She was in the wrong profession. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific mystery, interesting protagonists","review":"The protagonists in this mystery are realistic and people you might like to know.

She had no business playing (fairly stupid) cop; the supposed sexual tension was way out of line. Single young female priest do not hang around endlessly alone with a married man. The amount of dinners and rides she had with the lonesome police chief would have her booted out of a small town parish in a flash. Couldn't they just have a platonic friendship? Her constant meddling in the murder case was laughable, her near demise, ridiculous. The writing style was okay but it wasn't enough to make me like this book. A very medium effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual twists and turns","review":"Honestly, I wasn't sure I'd like a book with the heroine as a priest, but I soon grew to like Clare as she is down to earth and aware of today's world and it's challenges and consequences. Another twist is that the chief of police is happily married, and yet these two can't tear themselves away from each other. The mystery is tightly woven and keep the reader's attention throughout. This is the kind of book I look for. Good suspense, tough characters and realistic surroundings.Dream Walker"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good First Novel","review":"Although I'm not a fan of the mystery genre, I enjoyed this first novel, and the relationship it portrayed between a single female Episcopal Priest and the older Chief of Police. The story also gave good background for Rev. Fergusson and her profession, her church, and church relationships.A good idea for a theme, beginning with the baby Clare finds, and moving one to a well-integrated web of complexity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This Book!","review":"I loved this book and it's characters, can't wait for the next installment in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Episcopal heart","review":"A good representation of the hearts of those of us priviledged to call ourselves Episcopalian. Some suspension of disbelief required, but overall a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"As a mystery lover and avid reader, I had high hopes for this book - especially based on the reviews here. What I wound up reading was simplistic writing and dialogue that made me wonder if this writer was straining to guess how an actual conversation would go in the situations presented in the story. If you had a hard day at work, read this to unwind. If you want to read a book for adults, find another author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great story.

I'll definitely be buying more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the elements we love","review":"Julia Spencer-Fleming clearly realizes what makes a good serial - a little hint of forbidden love, of course. The tantalizing relationship between Claire Ferguson, her main-character former-helicopter-pilot-current-priest, and Russ Van Alstyne, married chief of police, keeps us coming back for more. This series is well-written, dramatic, entertaining, and complex - neither the author nor her characters shy away from timely sociatal issues nor the ambiguous fraility of the human heart.The books are taunt without being gruesome, gripping but not terrifying. In short, highly recommended. I foist this book, the first in the series, off on all of my friends and they all come back to read the second, and the third, and the fourth..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mystery!","review":"I really enjoyed this book! Filled with suspense and excitement, I had a very hard time putting it down, and was disappointed when the story ended....I wanted it to go on and on!

I hope the author will revisit these characters again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystery To Take The Chill Off","review":"An abandoned baby left on the church's doorstep on a midwinter's night. A body of a young woman found in the freezing snow. A chilling trail of clues all add up to a suspenseful winner. In The Bleak Midwinter, introduces us to Millers Kill, New York. This is the home of Russ Van Alstyne, the chief of police and his wife. Also the new priest of the Episcopal church, Clare Fergusson. The author knows how to build suspense and also handles the action very well. The Chief finds himself working closely with Clare to solve the crime of the abandoned baby. The mystery deepens when a murdered girl, possibly the baby's mother, is found murdered. The bond between the Chief and the Priest blossoms into friendship and perhaps more as the case evolves. The plot has some familiar moments, but the author carries them off well, with enough new twists to keep the story fresh and interesting. Book provide for review by the well read folks at Library Thing and Minotaur Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much 'Praise'","review":"This book started strong and the conflict/plot was a great idea, but the story failed to be a clever read, and is insulting to the reader. It becomes apparent, quickly that both the Chief of Police and the Reverand Clare are not the sharpest tools in the shed. As the story developed, I was shocked at some of the conclusions they leapt to and the silly, stupid actions the Reverand would take. I gave the book a chance, but 70% of the way through the book, the author has the Reverand run off and do something so stupid and then forces the reader to read about her stupidity for the next several pages only for the author to 'introduce' suspects and the 'killer' late in the book. The plot was poorly crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely annoying!","review":"While this book was well-written and I did finish it, it was way too improbable to be believed.No law officer would allow a civilian to continually accompany him on his duty, especially when there was danger involved, or allow her to continually interfere in an investigation without even letting him know what she was doing. No married law officer and unmarried priest would spend so much time alone together in compromising situations in a small town where everybody knows them and get away with it. No supposedly savvy and well-trained woman would remain in inappropriate clothing and transportation throughout the whole book or rush into dangerous situations alone and unprepared and without telling anyone where she was going, or confront potential bad guys with everything she knows without any protection or backup. Characters and atmosphere: interesting. Plot: totally ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It was fun to read.

I bought it mainly as a \\"coffee table\\" book because it is easy to read and understand and has great photography of sailboats and sailing scenes.It is however a good introduction to sailboats and the sailing experience. Chapter one is titled \\"Sailing for Everyone\\" and Peter Blake does and excellent job of making this book an \\"Introduction to Sailing\\" for everyone.The book discusses wind and sail power issues, how to select the right boat, buying secondhand, building yourself, and various boat types from cruisers to racing boats. He even discusses sailboat racing and tactics.This is not an \\"in depth\\" technical book or reference on all types of sailing and sailboats, but it does a good job of providing an introduction and gives you a lot of great photos to look at and use to get oriented to sailing and sailboats. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Now for Completely Different...","review":"It seems like the skinks are back and the men of the 34th will have to face them again so they ship out ready to rock and roll.

There is, however, an additional enemy.We are introduced to Admiral of the Starry Heavens Orange, the supreme naval commander of the We're Here! Navy. We're Here! is a bush league planet settled early on by a bunch of hippies. His supporting characters include Admirals Toke, Head and Crashpad. Captain Happiness is also along for the ride. Admiral Orange gets it into his head that he needs to go to war with another planet and, not incidentally, the Confederation Marines. It's a comic opera that is hilarious in its ludicrous nature.It's a relaxation break in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneventful and boring Film","review":"I am startled to see that there are hardly any 'negative' reviews ofthis routine film, on the advice of the positive reviews I bought thefilm and was utterly taken aback at how boring and amateurish itlooked.The start looked promising, an eerie promenade at an abandonedcarnival but then it went downhill from there. Most of the screen timeis taken up by inexperienced actors who can't hold a scene together and the story is tepid and unworthy for a long feature. Nothing ever reallyhappens and there are no scary moments or plot elements that make usshudder. The 'murders' look fake and are exaggerated to the point ofridiculousness. I kept waiting for something startling to happen but itnever did, just banter between dull British folk. Avoid this at allcosts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camp classic","review":"Not - on the surface - a good film. No a-list 'actors' such as Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts, neither of whom could act their way out of a paper bag, let's be frank about it. No $60 million budget. No glossy A2 posters at bus stops.But scratch the surface and you have what ranks as one of the best acted pieces of the seventies. This is in no small part due to the fact that the cast is made up of actors rather than stars. i.e. people who are actually good at acting. Sheila Keith turns in a perfomance that beggars adjectives like 'superlative'. If you don't 'get' this film, that's a pity.A lot of people don't get it.

I'm been a huge FZ fan since the '60s; have everything he's ever put out (& then some); but if I had read this book first I would never have even given him a listen. This book is more about Mr. Watson showing off his psuedo-intellectual prowess than it is about Frank Zappa. Mr. Watson attempts to psycho-analyze every word FZ wrote when FZ himself said that on most songs his lyrics existed solely to highlight the music. FZ would spend weeks writing the music then dash out the lyrics in a half hour. Mr. Watson has certainly researched FZ's music but he has researched it to death, attributing the lyrics with all sorts of hidden meaning. Come on!

I feel sick"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a good one","review":"First, I was profoundly struck by Watson' critique of Feminist Theory within Zappa's work. I saw Zappa much more of a deep thinker and an intellectual giant. Second, some of Watson's later analysis of Zappa's work seemed to be pushing the envelop to absurdity.Currently, there seems to be no formal label for Watson's brand of humor. Essentially, through a series of intellectual gyration, Watson takes classical literature (throughout the ages) and draws parallels with Zappa's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out Ben!

The album scored platinum sales status and made it to #26 on the Billboard chart.The studio band is essentially Frehley - guitars, bass, vocals and guitar synthesizer - and drummer Anton Fig, with bassist Will Lee appearing on three numbers. By keeping the musical framework simple, Frehley achieved a higher orbit than his other band members who issued solo efforts at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spaceman's most stellar effort","review":"Ace made a comment (circa 1993) in which he said, \\"when I left [KISS], they got a musical vasectomy\\", and this release backs up that argument. For better or for worse, the success of this record essentially ended his first tenure in the band, and launched his solo career.\\"Fractured Mirror\\" is the most underrated rock instrumental of the last several decades, and the rest of the album is one blistering cut after another, with lots of help from some of the musicians who would eventually form The World's Most Dangerous Band (of David Letterman fame).The best thing I could say about Ace's solo record is that if I weren't already a huge KISS mark, I'd still own it. While each of the solo records have their strong points, Ace's is the only must-own of the four."},{"rating":"2","title":"FREHLEY 78","review":"this is one of the best solo albums anyone ever associated with KISS has done. ace plays lead,rhythm,accoustic and bass guitars on every song. a talented player with a lot of promise(in 78). i bought all 4 solo albuns the day they came out and there's no denying that ace's was the best. i always liked gene's the best. but that's just my personal preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"of the solo albums.. this one comes in second","review":"Of all the 4 solo's albums recorded under the kiss flag, Ace's output was the most hard rockin' of them all. Tracks like \\"rip it out\\" and \\"ozone\\" hit the harded edge that his kiss counterparts could not reach in their solo efforts. The problem with this album is the sappy tracks like \\"new york groove\\" and \\"speeding back to my baby\\".. Although out of all the solo's released by kiss in the late days of 1978. ace had the most commercial success. This album is a recommended purchase but is tempid to the listeners taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best Kiss solo album","review":"Ace Frehley is, at best, an excruciatingly mediocre vocalist. This CD however is powerful, energetic and contains some of Ace's greatest compositions ever. Paul Stanley's album outshines it, but Gene and Peter don't even come close. Some great guitar work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"Regarded as the best of the KISS solo efforts, I feel this album isn't that great. The songs lack charisnma, and compare poorly to KISS tracks- Shock Me, Save Your Love, 2000 Man, Rocket Ride and Save Your Love. Though a talented musician and vocalist, I feel the album never gets going and besides New York Groove doesn't offer anything worthwhile. I prefer Paul Stanley and esp. Peter Criss' solo efforts to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"hum","review":"the pic shows it to be a vynal with pic on it, it wasnt. that is what i was looking for i think they should have more detail info. or a better way to contact seller"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best album in the world, but neither is this page","review":"Not really many comments for the album. Vocally, Ace was probably the weakest in the band. However, \\"New York Groove\\" hit during the disco era with it's twangy guitar riffs - great for the period. What I can't believe is the fact that there is no sound clip for the song here. Apparently, it was not an old Kiss fan who wrote this page. \\"New York Groove\\" made it to #13 in Billboard's 1979 Pop Singles chart.In addition, the Gene Simmons solo effort should be packaged with Ace's efffort for your two-album savings deal. (The Paul Stanley album had no hits that I'm aware of and my Kiss-fan friends & I hated it!) Gene Simmons' \\"Radioactive\\" only made it to #47 in the same chart during 1979, however the album itself went to #22 in Pop Albums.Just some marketing hints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Frehley","review":"Ace has a cool voice. No doubt about that. He also played some cool licks in the 70's and I'm as big a Kiss fan as anyone else. But Ace isn't a songwriter. It's amazing how many fans praise this one, and to an extent I'm glad so many enjoy it. He started off a poor kid from the street who became an idol to kids all over the world. But that's just it people. This music was aimed at KIDS. Ace has a rare gift though. By rare, I mean that it's rare that he writes anything worthwhile. Every ten years he does release one good song. In the 70's there was \\"Shock Me\\" which remains his best. In the 80's it was \\"Trouble Walkin\\". In the 90's it would be \\"Into the Void\\". Three songs total. He'll have enough good tracks for a REAL album if he lives to be 150. Maybe if he hadn't ruined his brain he could've improved since Jimmy Carter was president. Perhaps he should write a song called \\"Trouble Writing\\". The kids have grown up Ace. I hope someday that you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album for Ace","review":"This was a good album. I really enjoy it. Ace's playing is over the top although for the most part he could have had better lyrics. The song New York Groove is the highlight. Great melody and for the first time in a Kiss related realease I hear a disco beat, not that that is bad. He did it right, it rocks and it is a good dance song with a heavy beat. Good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandatory commercials are unaceptable!","review":"There is no way any DVD with mandatory commercials is going to get a good rating from me. This is one of my favorite movies, but this release was ruined by making it impossible to skip the ads at the beginning. I won't tell you to not buy this edition, but you should at least complain about it. If we accept this practice then we're saying its ok for the studios to keep sticking it to us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercials, Commercials, Commercials","review":"THIS IS A WASTE OF A DVD. IT SHOULD BE TITLED \\"DOUBLE SECRET COMMERCIAL TIME\\". What a drag. I've already sent back my copy, and bought an old video copy on ebay. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Horrible DVD","review":"I refuse to sit through advertising which can not be skipped on a DVD. And while I love this movie, I guess I will have to stick to my VHS tape. Too bad that Universal thinks they can force us to watch advertising. The worst part is, if I get a phone call half way through the movie and leave, and want to start the movie later, I have to watch the same annoying advertising again. Anytime the DVD player is turned off, it forces the advertising to be watched again. How about having those ad's as a special feature for those who want to watch them? Why force everyone to watch them?? I will boycott anything from Universal because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 Minutes of previews you HAVE TO VEW????","review":"This is an outrage. Don't buy this DVD. I've just tossed all of my Univeral DVD (about 6 - they don't make alot of good stuff thank god).Sorry, can't review the movie, never got past the forced 10 minutes of previews. Glad this was a gift too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Ripoff!","review":"Add me to the list of people who loved the original, but will not buy this post-fabricated POS loaded with commercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Placement Reigns Supreme","review":"A classic film like this one deserves so much better. The reason the DVD is called double secret probation edition is that you're forced to sit though tons of ads, without any other option, to get to the meat of the matter. You're on probation, for sure...And then, once you see the movie, you find out that the special fatures meat is like a hot dog: way lots of filler without the beef. If you're looking for good new stuff, you're out of luck.Senator and Mrs. John Blutarsky should launch a senate investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stereotyped humor at its finest.","review":"Leave your sensibilities at the door and don't get offended when your personal space is invaded by the juvenile humor in this classic 1970's comedy. The facial expressions of John Belushi capture the silliness, and watch out, you'll laugh out loud at the utter stupidity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Animal House","review":"The DVD arrived extremely fast. It was ordered for a gift, as the person indicated they always wanted this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"this movie is crazy, but a good one. the things that went on then could not be allowed anymore, but this is a good show of the frat days. shows why I did not even bother to apply for any of the frat.s It looks like this shows, even if fictitious, that sometimes, what goes around comes around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - Horrible Ads","review":"I like this movie. What I absolutely hated was the fact that I had to sitthrough endless (okay, more like 5) minutes of advertisements THAT YOUCANNOT SKIP. It is ridiculous that I have to pay for ads now."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Commercial piece of Dung!","review":"From the moment I opened up the DVD case I was let down. The only insert card on the inside case is some coupons to buy some useless [fluff]. No chapter reference card. How cheap can you get. Once I inserted the DVD, another dissapointment. You are forced to watch some [fluff] \\"Upcoming\\" commercials. These can not be Chapter searched past, fast forwarded, and you can't hit the menu button. This is even worse than Disney releases. At least you can chapter past the commercials. Thanks Universal, for a less then spectacular re-release for a great movie. You should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the regular edition!","review":"This rating is for the presentation only, not the film! What do you get for the extra $$$? A box that will sit on your shelf, a softcover booklet with some weak humor, and the movie in a regular snap-case that will find its way into your regular DVD collection(sans oversize box).What could have they done better? Publish the booklet as a mini- hardcover, included some liner notes/essays,vintage ads or reviews,included the CD soundtrack, a shotglass, postcards or some other kind of merch.Pretty half-hearted effort.Save your money and get the regular edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only giving this one-star to Universal Studios and the endless freaking commercials, not the movie.","review":"I was so excited when this special edition came out, I bought it right away. As I did with many other old faves. I might as well have been sitting in the theatre, wasting all of my popcorn and soda on the commercials and previews. By the time the main feature finally comes on, I am out of snacks and I have to pee. I will always love this movie, and the extra \\"where are they now\\" was cool. But you can find out where they are now by going online. Seriously, as another reviewer suggested, buy the original cut if you don't own this movie yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"No insert","review":"I have no qualms with the movie. My problem is with the DVD. No book or anything on the inside. What is up with that? It just takes a DVD that I purposefully waited for a special edition and makes it a little less special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!","review":"This has to go down as one of the funniest movies ever. Great inspiration to throw a Toga Party!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"See yourself and your friends on dvd ...","review":"This excellent movie is so real to life (in an exaggerated way) that you can see someone you recognize (even if the face is different). Even if you never went to college, you will see your friends from high school portrayed in this film.You need to get this movie, if only to refresh your memories of school!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious look at 60's College Life with John Belushi","review":"Popular culture satirists National Lampoon put together this bawdy look at 60's college life starring SNL's John Belushi. It was one of the most sucessful films of 1979 and helped establish Belushi in his first major screen role.Classic hilarity includes \\"Food Fight!\\", Delta House pledge week, Dean Wermer's call for \\"Double Secret Probation\\", \\"Shama Lama Ding Dong\\" by Otis Day and the Knights and much more.Eugene Oregon provides the scenic backdrop for the fictional Faber College. Some of the other name performers include Tim Matheson and Donald Sutherland. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Looney Tunes Wasn't a Cartoon...","review":"If Looney Tunes wasn't a cartoon, this movie would be the result. While I went to college in the mid Seventies rather than the mid-Sixties, I can identify with almost every aspect of this movie. I was surrounded by crazy characters who thought nothing of committing insane acts of mayhem for the sheer fun of it. We also seemed to consume massive amounts of alcohol but threw in a large amount of drugs. This is not a movie about being in college. It's a movie about surviving college. In the wildest fashion possible. I love this movie. I've been watching it since it hit the theaters, and I will probably never tire of it. It's a trip down memory lane for me. Just like my book.Bob Wayne, author[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't even own this","review":"I don't even own this, but if what the others say is true about forced advertisements and/or previews, then I want on the hatred bandwagon because that sucks hardcore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, bad DVD","review":"After reading some of the reviews here, I must say I will not spend a freakin dime on any DVD that forces you to watch advertisements. If anyonewants to purchase this movie, I recommend buying the out of print blue DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh!!","review":"Kevin Bacon's first on-screen credited appearance is in this movie. This is where the legacy of the worst actor in the world started. I heard somewhere that Belushi chugged a bottle of Jack Daniels in this movie, that it really was Jack Daniels, and didn't die. A lot of people would at least have their stomach pumped. Well, I bet this review wasn't terribly helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"For those who think that drunkenness, lewdness, and boorishness are the hallmarks of humor, this one is a classic. However, for the civilized, this is a steaming heap of trash, and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a Good Gift!","review":"It's not about the forced ads (although they didn't help) but the movie itself that I finally got to watch early December. I had seen select seens...(the funny ones) on TV multiple time (like the one where Belushi's character is in the cafeteria spitting food out of his mouth \\"I'm a zit, get it?!\\" And I thought judging by those scenes and the \\"you'll like it\\" coming from my dad that I would enjoy it and went out and bought it @ blockbuster with a gift card I had just recieved. I swear it was the most god awful thing I'd ever seen, and I don't see how anyone could say that it's a classic! I honestly don't see the humor in a bunch of immature frat boys running around looking up girls ass's and causing trouble. It's pointless, stupid, and a waste of a good gift card. (even with the select few chuckle worthy scenes) I was able to sell it, but not for nearly as much as I paid. Good riddens is all I can say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Boring","review":"I have no idea why this movie was ever popular or why anyone above the age of twelve would find it funny. There was not one genuine laugh in it. The \\"Where Are They Now\\" extra was very lame as well. Anybody want to buy my copy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reckless","review":"This \\"classic\\" both confuses and saddens me. I am one of the very few people in this world who feels like our nation's universities should be places of higher learning and striving to better oneself. Thanks to movies such as this and the horrific \\"Old School\\", colleges have become partying first, studying second. And it's heartbreaking.I can't tell you what to buy, but I can encourage you to consider what you're supporting. There are plenty of ways to view a schooling system that works, namely \\"Dead Poets Society\\". Don't contribute to the downfall of our schools. I'm just asking you to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um.. so this was the legendary \\"Animal House\\"!","review":"After receiving a flyer from a fellow college student to go toa Toga Spring Break party, I was curious and FINALLY got to see themovie that all of the other college flicks and fraternities pay homage to. I know that I am going against the grain here, but this movie was absolutely horrible! This was one of those movies that had to rely on one star to carry the entire feature. With the exception of Belushi's character, there was very little to actually laugh about, and even fewer characters to care for! Halfway through it, I had to fast forward through all of the other tired and cheap slapstick until I see Belushi's face just to get some laughs out of this! Come on guys! \\"Airplane\\" was a classic.....\\"Porky's\\" was a classic...\\" THE BLUES BROTHERS\\" will always be a classic! But \\"Animal House\\" ! This must be a guy thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"TREMENDOUSLY bad movie","review":"About a dozen reviewers were able to be honest with themselves and say this movie was not funny at all. Like a David Lynch movie, or Sun Tzu's Art Of War, it must be one of those things you have to pretend that you \\"get\\" so you can be cool. I dunno, maybe its just dated. Just because someone says its a classic doesnt mean you are compelled to laugh, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowdy, Raunchy Fun.","review":"Animal House is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The toga party is a classic scene. The road trip was funny, too. Thew grades were funny. The end was good. This movie has no point but I don't think comedies should have big lessons in them if it's like this one. Rated R for language, crude sex rrelated humor, and nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"What frat life was really like!","review":"The scene where they watched the slides of the rushees really happens in frathouses across America! \\"We need the dues!\\" A classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blutoshi (John Belushi is Bluto)","review":"I remember when Bluto put some mashed potatoes in his mouth and punched his cheeks so all of the food popped out. \\"I'm a zit, get it?\\" That was pure immortal. The late John Belushi played the disgusting Bluto and was part of the Delta House. College life was defined in the 1960's: the toga party, the snooping around, the horse trick, and much more. Kevin Bacon is also in this for some reason. Always party hard and break any guitars that deserve to be retired. John Belushi was a comic genius and will always be remembered for this great movie and \\"The Blues Brothers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER-RATED","review":"This has got to be the most-OVERRATED comedies of all time,I have no idea why everyone haved been raving about this silly SO-CALLED CULT-CLASSIC,sure that's what i expect from a movie like this and i do enjoy the genre,but the cookie-cutter script just frankly lacks BREAK-AWAY humor and the humor is too dull for my taste,I'll go with PORKYS,FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT or REVENGE of the NERDS anyday!! not to mention the LACK-LUSTER transfer of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"What a horrible movie. Obviously, I wasn't expecting an intellectual exercise or deep meaming, but I was expecting humor. Even just cheap funny gags would have been ok. It wasn't funny, not even the cheap jokes. Maybe I would have thought this was funny when I was 18."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!2","review":"This movie blows, I don't understand how you people could like this crap. The original was way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps it was funny in 1978","review":"I saw this movie recently after repeatedly being told it is the funniest movie ever created. I have to say I found it to be utterly boring and unentertaining. Honestly, not one laugh out loud moment. Perhaps this is because I never felt the need to purchase friends by joining a fraternity, or because movies have become so much more outrageous since 1978 (e.g. American Pie goes places that movie makers could not even consider in 1978).Either it is (1) overrated, (2) irrevelant, or (3) only funny to those who donned a toga and danced around like an idiot in a desperate attempt to attract friends. I don't know. In any case, I won't be watching it again. This movie just is not funny (at least not to me).If you need something of the genre/time period, go for Ridgement, Porky's, Blues Brothers, etc. They are far superior to Animal House."},{"rating":"1","title":"French point of view","review":"Let me tell you one thing about France. Most of your great movies are also famous here as most French people love American movies. So I was surprised when I heard from that movie while staying in your country whereas I had never heard from it back in France. I thought I should give it a try. I was expected a funny movie, maybe a little dated but a good funny one such as Porky's ( also famous in France )or Revenge of the nerd. The DVD came out a few days ago for a cheap price so I bought it. I am so disappointed! and confused! Why would anybody consider this movie a classic? I now understand why it was not released in France. They knew it would be a flop. Don't get me wrong, I like crazy humor but this so dumb. A few scenes are funny but most of the movie is boring. If this movie came out today for the first time, nobody would really pay attention to this joke. If you have never seen it, you should rent it first. You will thank later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The extras on this disk are laughable. By that, I don't mean that you'll laugh at them. The \\"Reunion\\" video is 20+ minutes of unscripted bore--the music video is pointless (and there, why, exactly?) The documentary is okay, but you've probably seen it on TV.The movie is, as always, very funny. But I bought it the first time, didn't you? And I fall into line right behind the people who hate the \\"locked-in\\" previews. Why should I pay for a disk that forces advertisement down my throat? I hate this trend at the movie theatre, too. Perhaps Universal would like to send me a check every time I watch their ad on my disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie is fine but...","review":"...I don't care about Universal's future releases and I resent that I can't skip their previews every time I stick in a disk that I own. It's bad enough I have to sit through 20 minutes of trash at the movie theatre, I don't want to have to do it at home, too....the \\"Class Reunion\\" extra is unfunny. I'm not even sure there was a script for it. If they weren't really going to try, why did they bother?...I already own \\"Animal House\\" on DVD. How often are they going to play this trick on DVD owners? I'm tired of buying a disc only to have it followed up by a disk with more extras a year or so later. Phooey on that. I'm not playing that game anymore. Let them eat re-releases or do it right in the first place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking","review":"This movie was most likely the first film to parody Fraternity life at College. And it sucedes greatly at doing that. Otter, Bluto, Dean Wormer, Flounder, and many others are portrayed with great hillarity. Not for pre teen kids and probably not for most senior citizens but anyone who can reminisce about the good old days of college parties will love this one. Its a classic in its own light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it and laugh.","review":"What the heck was \\"Th3e House of High Fidelity\\" talking about a few reviews back? \\"'Animal House' has not survived the advance in comedy that we are now experiencing in film today.\\"? Huh? What are those advances in comedy? Do you mind telling us?The only advance in comedy that anyone need care about is if it makes you laugh. And this movie will make you laugh.

A complete joke, and an insulting slap in the face to everyone who BOUGHT the DVD instead of downloading it.I suggest you avoid this DVD. There is no point buying, it just encourages Universal to make more DVDs with more unskippable ads. The copy I bought will be returned to the place of purchase.

Universal, long the worst DVD producer in Hollywood, has outdone themselves with this one. Who would consider sitting through five minutes of junk that cannot be forwarded past every time they want to see this film? Ridiculous.

It has all the right ingredients, a great script (with improvisations), a great director John Landis, a great cast, including the immortal John Belushi, hilarious set pieces(now simmer down a bit), shocking subject matters at the time(expletives, sex and drugs) and the \\"Goodbye Mr. Chips!\\"-like soundtrack by the great Elmer Bernstein.If you are from that period(70's), it remains a comedy classic.

There isn't a lot of soundtracks here and the main song of the movie is Louie Louie!!If the film was set in 1962 then the students and the fad had the 50's in mind.I guess this movie wasn't what I was looking for.P.S: I heard about another movie of the seventies set in the 60's called American Graffiti but is also set in 1962.Adios."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic, I say crapper","review":"The only part I remember of this movie is the Angel and devil scene, the Devil has great advice which should be appreciated by all mankind.

I deducted one star because Universal felt that it is necessary for you to have to sit through about ten minutes or so of previews before you can watch the movie. You cannot jump to the main menu! Shame! I also found that the \\"Where are they now?\\" extra feature segments are long winded and un funny. The \\"making of\\" feature is really good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way College Should be","review":"Animal House was filmed at Universal Studios and released in 1978. It run time is 109 minutes; it was filmed in color and was directed by John Landers. It starred John Belushi as Bluto the leader of Delta house fraternity and John Vernon as Dean Wormer their archrival. Animal house is classic comedy that is as funny now as it was when it debuted 25 years ago. This move may not have started some of the crazes of the late 70's and early 80's, but it definitely made them more popular. The two I remember the fondest are the food fights in every high school cafeteria inspired by Bluto's actions when he became a giant zit, and all of the Toga parties that took place on college campuses. This movie also has the classic road trip in it. Animal House is one those rare comedies that you can watch repeatedly and enjoy increasingly each time. I consider Animal House to be a must see for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible -- forced to watched series of awful trailers","review":"Here it is, Friday night, finally, after a long, hard week at the office.

No previous information warning about reproduction system.A real pitty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal House","review":"The original \\"party animal\\" teen movie (despite its \\"R\\" rating), Landis's outrageous feature-length prank has enough gross-out humor, slapstick yucks, and all-night beer chugging to put a drunken smile on anyone's face. Matheson and co-stars James Widdoes, Peter Riegert, and Bruce McGill bring sheer lunacy to their roles as leaders of a riotous frat house for rejects, losers, and academic failures. But it's Belushi's gonzo portrayal of Bluto that remains iconic, and helped make the former \\"SNL\\" cast member a bigtime comic star. Irreverent, subversive, and totally inappropriate, \\"Animal House\\" depicts the college experience most of us never had, but kind of wish we did. Watch for Kevin Bacon in a small early role as a young pledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not add something new?","review":"I've always felt that ANIMAL HOUSE was one of the funniest comedies ever filmed, and I rejoice in the widescreen format, improved mastering and the Dolby audio... but I only gave this lousy re-release two stars.Why? Well, I hope someone at Universal is reading these reviews: DUMP THE MANDATORY PREVIEWS! And what about better content? The featurettes seem hastily-made and almost amateurish. I wanted to see deleted scenes, like the legendary Stork and his slide rules -- I wanted outtakes, or more footage taken while the film was being produced.If you already own the original release (like I do), then don't bother with this unless you have to have the widescreen format or the Dolby audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comedy Classic","review":"One of the all-time comedy classics, Animal House is always a great watch. I have seen it dozens of times and still had to have my own copy on DVD after my VHS one finally wore out.

I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal House","review":"What can I say about this film? This film is a truly laugh out loud sensation that'll leave you begging for more. The film is starts out with these young college freshman that are trying to get sworn in at a local fraternity, but they end up in all kinds of misadventures along the way together. Although the film is a bit ridiculous at times, it never stops being funny. With great scenes like the Toga party, the infamous trial scene, or even the famous revenge scheme at the end, you'll never stop laughing. When I first saw this movie, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and laughed the whole night away. Overall, this is one of the greatest comedies I've ever seen.As for the DVD, you can fast forward through the advertisements at the beginning of the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating previews - boycott Universal","review":"DVDs that force one to watch previews are among the biggest annoyances of modern life. I seldom put in this DVD, simply because I know I'll be forced to sit through the same previews again. Universal, the company that made this, should seriously consider that it's creating all sorts of anger among customers, and that people subjected to this idiocy will go out of their way to avoid the company's products in the future (I plan to boycott Univeral's DVDs until this practice is changed). If it realizes this, it will remove previews from its offerings - they're sure to hurt its profits more than help. As for me, I'd like a refund, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the songs???","review":"This film is one of the films I like most. I just love the Rock and Roll era, although I was born in the 70's. And \\"Animal House\\" has the smell of that era.For the film I would give 5 stars, but for that DVD edition I give just one.Why??? Well, most of the original soundtrack was substituted by unknown songs. Sam Cooke's Twisting the Night Away, Wonderful World and Money, Let's Dance and others just disappeared from the DVD edition...I'm totally disappointed because a 50's or 60's movie MUST have songs from the period. OK...Louie Louie is there, but only Louie Louie...I think Universal had some troubles with the rights of that songs. OK...but why don't let us know it???In spite of it, the DVD is still worth of buying, but for sure the new sound track is terrible surprise for this film lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced Advertisements - don't buy this disk!","review":"This disk forces you to sit and watch appoximately 5 minutes of promotional materials for a half dozen other Universal releases - each and every time you use it!

Thanks to all the reviews posted, I'll know to stay far away from this one. One of the added major advantages to viewing DVD vs. VHS is the (usual) absence of ads and previews. Being FORCED to watch them would cause my husband to blow a gasket.

Simply wonderful!","review":"This is the best comedy of all time. I have watched hundreds of comedies, but this is the only one that I am able to watch over and over again. Every time I watch this movie, I notice something funny that I did not see before. This is well worth your time and money. The acting is superb and the script is full of originality and classic one liners. Look for a young kevin bacon in his first major role. Also observe that John vernon is playing in a comedy role. John vernon plays the college dean, but he also plays the mayor in the movie \\"dirty harry\\" and if you see both movies there is quite a contrast. This is just a wonderful movie. Here is a bit of trivia for you... John Belushi was the highest paid actor when this movie was made (he earned a mere $200,000). This movie is great.

Why substitute classic tracks which really suited the film for non-descript crappy newer songs? This has been one of my favourite films for many years - so many quotable quotes. But I can't watch the DVD version I bought because the butchered soundtrack annoys me so much. (Those who haven't seen it in original form probably won't have this problem.) There are a few versions for sale so one/some of them may have the original soundtrack - go to Belushi's canteen scene and if they are playing \\"Don't know much about history ...\\" you've got the goods.

I tend not to get to pimples in time to kill them when they are forming, but this does bring things to a head a lot faster than if you just leave it alone.

The issue was that it didn't help healing a single pimple (and I have mostly light acne).

We could hardly wait--how could it be anything but fantastic?Alas, Reindeer Room 3 is the single worst album I have ever purchased. It is so bad that it seemed to be a parody of itself (especially the accompanying DVD). I gave it to my dad for Christmas, and none of us liked a single song. We were all heartbroken.So, take my advice... do not, under any circumstances, buy this album. You will be very, very sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great bowl","review":"My mixer is 25 years old and this bowl fits perfectly. Just as nice and heavy as the original bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just not helpful at all...","review":"As an antique doll afficianado & collector, I need accurate information. Seems like this book was just thrown together to tap into the doll collectors' market, without any sense of real knowledge about antique dolls. Some info on the dolls is inaccurate or wrong. Typos. Scant and superfluous text. I do not get the sense that this author has a love for dolls nor a true knowledge to share with doll afficianados.I say, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doll book review","review":"This book does not live up to its title. It is a very superficial review of the subject. It contains an extensive amount of typographical errors; so many typos that it distracts you from the text. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Written and Edited","review":"I agree with the other reviewers: if you want accurate information, buy another book. This book was VERY poorly edited. It has some nice photos, but some of the captions are even inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Connoisser's Guide to Antique Dolls","review":"I absolutely agree with the first review. Ihe information in the book was poorly researched and the author was patronizing, at best. What bothered me the most was the lack of care regarding source checking, which could have easily been done considering all the accessible information around these days. My copy of this book is in the garage waiting to be \\"sold\\" at the next garage sale. Good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a masterwork","review":"This bit of capitolism bashing is not a bad novel, but if \\"1984\\" is worth five stars (and we all know it is) then this amusing, if somewhat forgetable, narrative can not be given half its status.Anyone who gave this book three or more stars should certainly re-evalute their opinion with the above paragraph in mind. Though, perhaps I have under-rated the book based on lofty expectations provoked by his latter work.Anyone who may have given this book five stars:Do you honestly think this first novel is the equal of a titan of literature like \\"1984\\"?It simply doesn't deserve the same status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orwell lampoons middle class respectability","review":"Gordon Comstock is an underemployed poet in 1930's London who is revolted by the commercial society in which he lives and detests what he call the \\" Money God\\". He consistently rebels against anything resembling middle-class respectabilty. Despite the efforts of his few friends, girl friend and sister he continues to sink financially and rejects their advice and offers of help. In modern terms Gordon fights relentlessly against \\"selling out\\".In the end circumstance get the better of him and he too gets absorbed in the dominant commercial culture.The aspidistra , a simple houseplant , symbolizes middle-class respectabilty and is used throughout the book as a point of reference for Gordon's distain of the money-culture.While not one of Orwell's better known works this book is well worth the time of those interested in his ideas regarding capitalism and the dominant commercial culture of his times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the great Orwell- but freshly observed and credible","review":"The hero of this work, the young would- be poet Gordon Comstock rejects the money world and money civilization he believes himself subject to. But in the course of his romantic pursuits he at last has the encounter he has been dreaming of. As a result of it young Rosemary his long- time girl friend becomes pregnant. And out of decency they both decide to marry and paradoxically in his terms ' keep the apidistra ' flying or keep the ordinary world of domestic civilized life going'.In other words ironically the happy ending of the book involves the hero reverting to be part of the system he rejects.Orwell writes so clearly and with such a sure power of perception that this ' light' work has a real value. He writes too with a great deal of non- showy humor, a humor which comes simply out of his power of description."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tedium Of Poverty","review":"It being the 100th anniversary of George Orwell I decided to read one of his books that I hadn't gotten around to yet that was recommend to me a while ago, Keep The Aspidistra Flying. It is a novel about a poet who is trying to live outside the capitalistic system with abysmal results. He vividly describes the tedium and sordidness of middle class poverty, which differs from the equally demoralizing squalid poverty of the common classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more purchases of Mr. Orwell's work.","review":"School-day nostalgia caused me to buy the book. It was a mistake; consistently depressing and often boring. Really an unpleasant little book. I will not buy any more of Mr.Orwell's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ironizes post-war British middle-class","review":"Of all his novels, this was Orwell's least favorite.It tells the story of one man's war against money and the middle-class values and ideals of 1930s London. The \\"money=bad\\" message is about as subtle as a brick over the head, and you probably will get tired of the somewhat preachy rantings of the book's anti-hero, Gordon Comstock.Yet the deptiction of post-WWI London is quite good and can provide some important insight into Orwell's better novels.As for the \\"upbeat\\" ending, it is nothing of the sort. Orwell does not sell out Gordon by leaving him set up in a \\"good\\" job, living happily in wedded bliss with his beloved Rosemary. Rather, he turns a conventional denouement (marriage and birth) on its ear. The irony that runs throughout the novel (and which is particularly acute in its ending) makes \\"Keep the Aspidistra Flying\\" worth a read, even for those who are not Orwell fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked but Overhwelming","review":"The petty nature of Gordon Comstock may seem like small potatoes compared to 1984 and Animal Farm but Comstock's life is Orwell showing us how suffocating our society is, and how suffocating our own vanity and aspirations can be.Like some sort of 1950's Seinfeld Comstock is funny, witty, sarcastic and loathesome. Readers will either root for Gordon's bitterness and refusal to get in line with all the other capitalists, and some readers (like Gordon's relations) will wonder what he's moaning about.Like the rest of Orwell's work this book is consistent in showing us how dehumanising our world can be. Orwell's critics accuse him of writing ciphers and not characters with any great depth, but Comstock is Orwell, with all the unrealistic attitudes that entails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Life, Love, Money, And Aspidistras","review":"In a capitalist society, there is no way to escape the rampant worship of money. Or is there? This is the central dilemma of Geore Orwell's Keep The Aspidistra Flying.Keep The Aspidistra Flying is the story of Gordon Comstock (\\"common stock\\"?), an idealistic young man who leaves a respectable middle-class job in an effort to free himself from what he sees as the stultifying greed of bourgeois exsistence. Like that other great English novelist, Charles Dickens, Orwell trots out a varied cast of eccentric characters to keep us entertained as he makes his points. While lacking the history-stopping power of later works such as Animal Farm and 1984, Keep The Aspidistra Flying posseses a dry wit and a heartfelt charm that is all its own. Recommended to idealistic young men (and women) everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read- George Orwell at his best","review":"Keep the Aspidara flying is a fine piece of literature. It uses beautiful symbolism and is truly great read in combination with 1984 for the two together will give you a whole picture of who George Orwell was and what he stood for. It is about the flaws of capitalism and deals with the tradgedy of poverty and how even when money is achieved the results can leave us worse off. This book is not hard to read at all. Even the symbolism is easy to understand and would be great for an English class introducing students to the use of symbolism. It reads easily and you won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Operationalization of a complex concept","review":"As I approached my dissertation, I knew that I would be using structuration as a key element, but found Giddens to be interesting at the theoretical level, but difficult to translate to the operational level. In this book, Stones does an excellent job of approaching Giddens through several lens. First, he addresses many of the critics of Giddens, and speaks to each of their issues quite nicely. He then goes on to address Giddens from an operational perspective. His 'translation' from grand theory to operational language was very helpful. Finally, Stones provides, as examples, two different case historical case studies when viewed through the structuration lens. I recommended Stones to a fellow student who is also incorporating Giddens in her dissertation, and she has reported back to me that she also found Stones to be quite valuable in her studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as a replacement - key 'sticks' a bit","review":"I purchased this as a replacement to a nearly identical item that was originally installed on an interior door and since it was simply a case of switching out the old one, the installation process was very easy.I'm sure this will get better as the key wears down, but the key doesn't enter the lock smoothly and often needs to be jiggled a bit to make it go in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the only practical how-to for t'ai chi","review":"Eager Westerners scoop up videos and books on t'ai chi hoping to learn this powerful movement form without a real, live teacher. \\"Ride the Tiger\\" is one of the few that can help you do just that! Simple, step-by-step, behaviorally specific instructions with photos and drawings are balanced with equally simple questions to self-check one's progress. The story of how the author, a nuclear physicist, was drawn to learn and then teach t'ai chi provides a unique slant on East meets West. His explanations of how it works based on his scientific understandings are especially intriguing. Qualified teachers are becoming more widely available, but in the meantime, this book is a useful tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"the real Dr Dolittle","review":"Forget about the Eddie Murphy movies - they don't convey the charm and the emotion of the books. This is a particularly good childrens' book, as it has Dr Dolittle becoming involved (against his better judgement) with a circus. The circus intends to exhibit the exoctic pushmi-pullyu, along with other unusual animals. The story of how Dr Dolittle becomes entangled in this mess and manages to rescue a seal is a classic.You can read this to your kids instead of renting the movie. Yeah, I like Eddie Murphy, too, but he did not convey an emotional connection to the animals.So get this and read this to your kids - or read it for yourself. It's a great book and a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulletproof.","review":"Everybody trashes this movie it seems, even its own director (Carreras) hated it. But how anyone can hate a movie blessed with the presence of Cushing is a tall question indeed. -He's wonderful in a rather small part, one I understand he even did more or less as a favor to Hammer boss Carreras. The action scenes involving gun-fights and car-chases are nice to watch, but because the Shaw Brothers co-produced we sadly have to endure some martial arts stuff as well. Not only is this a Hammer film with the great sir Peter, but two other faves of mine are also featured; Stuart Whitman and Anton Diffring. By no means a great movie, but most certainly not the terrible mess some would have you believe, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shatter Is Campy Fun","review":"I was upset to learn my former roomate, instead of giving me a heads up, decided to throw out my sweet sweet vhs collection. Among my precious gems was this movie, which I bought for like five bucks, now I have to go out and buy the dvd which is going for 20 bucks. People need to chillax and take this movie for what it is: a campy B movie. It's awesome in that way where it's okay to talk over a film with your friends and totally joke around, the story is questionable and the acting is a little dry but this is a movie where I hope it never gets forgotten, although it seems like its about to. I respect other peoples opinions, but if you are looking to have a good time and make silly comments with your friends than this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Slim Whitman could've been worse.","review":"Hammer studios known by most for their gripping horror films, produced this drama \\"Shatter\\". The only horror in Shatter is Stuart Whitman's acting. Shatter (Whitman) is a hitman whose government turns on him, framing him for a murder they put him up to. Mayhem and martial arts ensue. Lots of nice scenery, action, and a special appearance by Peter Cushing in his last Hammer film. Once you view this film you will understand why Whitman was cursed to play baddies in 70's television cop shows....who loves ya baby?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interpreting Revelation","review":"It is a very informative book; however It is writen more for an advanced scripture student.

A plug would only go part-way in - and at an angle! When I contacted the seller, I just got an email telling me to push the plug in harder. After my second complaint and refund request, I got the same email. It took three emails for me to get my refund.While I did finally get my money back, it was a big waste of time. My lesson? When you see a bunch of negative reviews, believe them. That many negatives don't happen by accident or by unhappy people. The negative reviews for this product (and seller) are well-deserved. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I use this to connect my computer speakers (2.1) to my Xbox 360, and I couldn't be happier with it. No hiccups at all, works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and as expected.","review":"I don't have any insight about audio plug and stuff but I gave this one a try for my setup.I have so complicated systems for my Consoles with computer. (I'm not going into details about my setup.)For my setup, I guessed(wasn't sure this coupler will work) I needed some type of connection between my consoles audio and my headphone which both have male parts attached to them.So, I researched a little and found this coupler. Well, it works perfectly, no problem whatsoever in functionality.Since its functionality is work as described, I gave 4 stars. 1 star is off because as other reviewer said, the metal thing attached to each end comes off easily. you can put it right back on but still it bugs me sometimes.Anyway, little device with great function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what it should","review":"That's right, it does exactly what it should!

They are cheap and the shipping was free, but still, it's a rip off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wothless","review":"This does not fit a 3.5 mm jack so it's utterly of no value. Since it cost me $1.27 it isn't worth sending back I guess, and I'm just out of luck. Don't bother to buy it because it is improperly made and I don't know what you could possibly use it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Considering it a donation","review":"Wow, I thought I'd chance it with the negative reviews but got stung. Writing it off as a donation to the seller since sending it back is more of a hasle. When I tried all 4, the music sounds like Karaoke. I had to pull out the plug slightly on all of them to get the full signal/connection. Very poor construction. Just lousy. Probably made in China. Stay away from these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not stereo","review":"Only produces left channel/mono sound, not stereo. Not sure whether it is the result of the cheap construction, as evidenced by the fact that a standard 3.5mm plug cannot be fully inserted and seems to go in at a slight angle rather than straight. Bottom line: Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter trash","review":"One end appeared to be functional, but the other was so askew that it was impossible to insert a miniplug. Closer inspection reveals that the inside plastic is split and forcing the inner contacts astray.This coupler also arrived with the two ends mismatched. Neither were gold-colored as the illustration indicates. Some poor chump in a third-world sweatshop is probably just grabbing random parts out of a bin and soldering them together.They also claim to be \\"ROHS (sic) Compliant\\" and have a \\"lifetime warranty\\". Since it literally arrived in a plastic bag, it's not clear how warranty claims can be made, so it's just another misleading lie to land the sale. As for RoHS compliance, it will be pretty easy to disprove that claim with a lead test swab.All-in-all, a pathetic product from a dishonest company which I can only assume is actually named \\"Cables To Go\\". It's pretty hard to screw up such a simple item, and yet they managed to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged goods","review":"I received a 3.5mm stereo coupler in the mail that was damaged. I was initially excited while opening my package, but I soon realized that I was unable to insert an extension cable into one side of the coupler. Upon further examining it I noticed that there was a piece of plastic that was wedged inside. I am thoroughly disappointed, and unfortunately at this point it wouldn't be feasible for me to send it back for a refund because I would loose money on the postage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Extras!!","review":"Bought three, of which one worked. Each of the other two connected only one channel - one, the right, the other, the left.

Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit and Miss","review":"I bought this coupler to use in conjunction with an extension cable to extend my ir sensor to my set-top box. When plugged in, I received no signal whatsoever . After tinkering with it for several minutes, I looked inside of it to see that the prongs were bent in a way that wouldn't allow a connection at all. After I bent them into shape I was able to get a signal which made the coupler finally usable. I wouldn't recommend this if you are not willing to do some work to the coupler. And, like I said in the title, It's hit and miss. Some say it works fine and some say what I've said. If you're worried about that I would not buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it works.","review":"It does exactly what I needed it to, and what I assume you need.

Once they were connected, I could not disconnect them without help.As several other reviewers have said, they allow for only one channel, which means when listening to music, I hear lots of background singers and almost no lead singers.

To get it working, I had to bend the internal contacts into the correct position with a needle.

If I pull one connector partway out I can get sound out of the left speaker, but also get a huge buzzing sound.I've tried this every way I can, but cannot get clean sound from both speakers. And this is not due to any other cables I am using as I have tested both cables in a direct mode from the amplifier through another test setup. Both cables check out fine.

Pretty much the last 50 pages or so of the book got really crazy and not in a good way. That whole deal with Janelle is senseless to me and a stretch. I just didn't like the ending. If anything the mental state of some side characters should have been explored more, Miz Holmes, Janelle, etc.Back to the ending: I felt the same way with the end of Gold Digger by this author. Although, I have my issues with her endings, I will continue to read her. This is a great book and should open people up to some things they may not have been able to explore.And this book wasn't that hot or shocking to me, but like said, an overall good read.I can't give half stars (3.5), so I went with 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breast milk ain't for everybody","review":"This book was sick and twisted, but very good.

I wish for a moment I could wander in Allison's mind cause she can come up with some good ones. This one needs to be a movie for real! In fact all of her books do and thats the honest truth of the matter. If your tired of reading the same ole same ole, I recommend this book.

When it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a rant than a review","review":"Since it's practically impossible to find VHS tapes anymore, I finally broke down and got a DVD player. So this one was my second DVD player in a two month time period. At first, I bought a Phillips player, which worked on half of one movie and nothing else so I returned it and got a Sony, figuring Sony would be better. Well, this Sony player is better (hence the extra star)...it played a whopping 6 movies before it broke on me. (the insert area broke after a month and I had to pry it open with a paperclip) And the 6 showings weren't even that great. I had just bought Planet of the Apes and the player would always shut down at a particular spot of the movie and return to the beginning--I coldn't even fast forward through the movie. On one of my TV's the picture would always go from bright to dark, bright to dark.So this time I'm gonig to dish out the extra $$ and hopefully get a DVD player that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functions are limited","review":"I bought this model several months ago, but I have not liked it since then. The problem is with available functions. Most DVD players can memorize one or more points on a DVD video program, but this one cannot. It is very inconvenient when you want to take out your DVD out of the player and put in a different one. Another problem is that the remote controller does not have number buttons, so you cannot jump to a different chapter easily. You need to press arrow buttons several times to enter numbers. That would be terribly inconvenient. Yet another problem is with programming. You cannot add a chapter to the program you are making while you are viewing your DVD at the same time. This also causes quite a lot of inconvenience. The only good thing about this DVD player is that it is more or less cheap, though it is not really the cheapest. And it is a SONY."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good while it lasted...","review":"This was my first DVD player, and it worked great, had great sound, easy setup, the Noise Reduction really cleaned up the image...(now you wonder why I am talking in the past sense)...but it stopped working after only two weeks and playing five movies. Whenever I inserted a disc it shut down or told me the disc was dirty. I'll be taking it back to the shop tomorrow, very disappointed with my first Sony DVD experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot play cd-r","review":"in spite of the perfect pictures, we are returning our unit to the store because sony has taken away the ability to play CR-r discs. you may think this is not important until you try to play that \\"special mix tape\\" from you grandson, or a short run commercial release by your favorite local band.of course this was not an oversight, as the biggest producer of commercial cd's, sony is trying to make it impossible for you to play anything except their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this dvd","review":"Save your money for something else. Featured on this dvd are some really cool superstars from the 80s. The unfortunate thing is that the dvd description leads you to believe your getting some of their best matches but you don't. What you get are matches featuring these superstars well past their prime against lowly jobbers set in it looks like high school gynmasiums and outdoor parks. The film quality is very amateur at best coming from someone's home video camera. Like I said earlier don't bother with this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will cry if you spend money on this.","review":"This is an atrocious product. It is absolute crap. The 6 matches were taped in what looks like a high school cafeteria with a very pathetic crowd.Filming took place in 2006, so these are not matches from back in the day, but a rather sorry portrait of aging legends taking on some no-namers.Audio is horrendous. Visuals are jumpy. I feel violated for having watched it. My only defense is that I rented it, and it took me less than 10 minutes to watch it on fast forward. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant read","review":"It was a good book, I'll give it that. Strong characterization helped me get close to Michelle, albeit not quite to Brad, and that's generally how the book went. The Michelle side was quite developed and fulfilling, but with Brad, I felt something was lacking and his resolution wasn't quite as satisfying.I was looking for this book to provide an African-American romance, and to be honest, I really didn't get the feeling that these characters were anything but White, or mixed, beyond the occassion mention of \\"black\\" and the picture on the front. That aside, the book delivered what it needed.Be wary though, the novel ends on page 266, but the book continues for almost a hundred pages. So don't hold back, expecting to get in it when the pages themselves dwindle down or else you'll be as surprized as I was when the story ended in spite of the sizeable chunk of pages that remained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for one box set for season 4 or 5","review":"All of you who are waiting for a one box set for either season 4 or season 5, it will never come !

I have taken several years of Spanish, and I struggled through the entire second half of the book.

The book suffers from a rather strange for an encyclopaedia presentation style (language), very low quality of illustrations and an unfortunate choice of alphabetical listing of topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisite little book","review":"I found the opening story, \\"Crocodile Tears,\\" rather disappointing, but things soon get better. \\"A Lamia in the Cevennes,\\" about an artist who finds a lovely mythical beast in his swimming pool, offers another version of the old conflict between the artist's romantic ideal and harsh reality. The artist in question refuses to make the lamia turn human, with reason, as it turns out, since the beautiful and mysterious fantastic monster turns out to be a vulgar and rather stupid woman. \\"Cold\\" is the best of the book, a fairy tale about a woman of ice and a man of the desert who fall in love, with the inevitable clash, until the two are united in a palace of glass, which unites the beauty of ice, but comes from fire. The rest are little vignettes that range from the charming to the disturbing. As a whole, a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A.S. Byatt at her best","review":"My favorite collection of short stories by Byatt. I keep wandering back to it and flipping through the pages, and then I end up reading the whole thing over again. \\"Cold\\" is fantastic. I've tried to explain it to people, and the plot sounds so cheesy, but you have to read it to understand its beauty. \\"A Lamia in the Cevennes\\" and \\"Crocodile Tears\\" were also favorites. One thing I love about her stories is that they can be so real, and have that one element that is just the opposite. A lot of great stories in here, with gorgeous descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparking collection","review":"As the other reviewers stated, this book is nothing at all like her other(magnificent) book Possession, either in style or subject, but Byatt's intensely clear and lyrical voice still comes through in this glowing collection of stories. I didn't like them all-\\"Crocodile Tears\\", the first and longest, is especially difficult to wade through-but of those I did like, mostly \\"Cold\\" and \\"A Lamia in the Ceveness\\", provide all the depth and warm, rich complexity that I've come to expect of her, and gave me the feeling of sinking deep into a world of water and light, as she deals with isolation, the battle between art, talent, and reality, and the contradictory nature of love, weaving a fairy-tale like spell. Not perfect, with the variation in the stories, but not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Admirable collection","review":"This is a curious and well done little collection of stories. The first story, \\"Crockadile Tears\\" is the best; it provides an interesting portrait of grief, or rather more of an anti-grief--I won't give any more than that away. There are a couple other gems in here, along with a couple competant but less profound works. Byatt is an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writer Perhaps Merits More Tasting","review":"Having never tasted of the nectar of Byatt's writing, I decided to test the waters with this small book containing shorter works. After an initial thrill of her writing in the opening story, \\"Crocidile Tears,\\" wowed me with her style and writing, althought disappointed by the climax and resolution of the story, I turned anxiously to the other offerings and was disappointed. The writing was still exquisite, but the story's lacked plot and resolve. I have not given up on Byatt, as she is highly rated and may be an acquired taste. I just haven't acquired it yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillfully crafted, but curiously cold","review":"Like Byatt's previous collections, this book is a well-written quick read with gorgeous visual imagery. Its focus is how characters negotiate extremes--of emotion, of circumstance, of temperature and more. But for a book subtitled \\"Stories of Fire and Ice\\" there is very little passion; and I felt little emotional engagement. The writing is exquisite, but the emotional life of the characters is not fully realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Haskins has done it again!

This is certainly one of the most important \\"chill out\\" albums ever made. But it ain't ambient in the truest sense of the word, so reviewers claiming that it is aren't completely accurate. Certain tracks, like the brilliant 9'39\\" are ambient, but much of the rest has the kind of beats and tempos that are much more associated with house music. Still, this is great stuff, and if you're inclined to investigate ambient music, this is a great way to ease into the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPACED OUT AMBIENT BLISS","review":"Let me just say this is one of the most impressive ambient-electronica releases that I have heard. The combination of ambient, ethereal atmospheres with the hint of groove type beats makes this CD stand out among the genre. Not all tracks have beats. The ones that dont are hypnotic and dreamlike. I highly recommend this for ambient fans who like a little melody in their ambience. Buy it now....."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"Despite being around for a fair old while now, this remains the classic ambient album. If you find the output of Namlook, Biosphere etc. too sparse, 76:14 is a masterpiece of melody and mood. This is the ideal disc to lend to friends who consider electronic music devoid of emotion but consider Billy Corgan wittering on about something or other to be \\"deep\\". A classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and not really ambient at all","review":"For the ambient purist, the majority of recordings described as such simply are not ambient. Unlike the original ambient records of Eno, which are designed to seep in and out of consciousness using their subtle textures and absence of beats, Global Communication's effort is typical of ambient as defined by kids who have grown up since the rise of house/rave music.The key failings of this album are (1) its textures are thick and unsubtle and (2) it is laden with beats. In short, it's too intrusive to be truly ambient - unlike Eno's 'On Land', Biosphere's 'Sunstrata', Thomas Koner's 'Nuuk' or John Foxx' 'Cathedral Oceans'.However, if you like the contradiction in terms that is ambient house, you'll probably think this is the best chill out album ever...but then you probably never heard any true ambient music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just wondreful music!","review":"I have recently purchased this cd and I must say that it's one of the best cds I ever heard. The album \\"76:14\\" is an old classic of ambient-house style but it's still actual nowadays. The sound is professional, well-mastered and fresh. Every track on this album is an amazing trip into the world of magic and atmospheric sound.As I live in Russia, there's a grest problem with getting good and qualitative music. All music shops in my native town are full of commercial music albums, mixes and compilations. So I decided to buy this cd in internet-shop (compact-discs were delivered from Moscow). And now \\"76:14\\" written by Global Communication is my favourite album. The tracks I want to mark here are \\"9:25\\", \\"8:07\\", its' shorter version \\"5:23\\" and \\"4:14\\". They are just a little wonder. Close your eyes and fly away!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can be said?","review":"How fortunate I was to be about 18 years old during the 1993-1995 heyday of Ambient and IDM music. I have all these famous artists on their original Vinyl and CD. But my purpose isn't to brag here...Nothing more can be said about this album that hasn't. While teetering on the edge of cheesy New-Age, its genius is that it never falls over that line, dripping with emotion and depth without ever becoming Enya.But seeing as how I so enjoy when others plug a recommendation that sound similar to the artist, I'll say this - you MUST pick up Pulusha's Isolation, who just happens to be this same duo. This EP (or was it a single?) is as gorgeous as 76:14. Don't know if its still in print, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best unknown artist I know of","review":"Not many people have heard of these guys but they are truely a rare, hidden gem.

The characters and scenery come alive as the authors take you through a dozen or so years of this woman's life--of her struggles, her redemption and triumph. It's about love lost and found, and the eternal spirit of a scorned, yet determined woman. After reading the first chapter, you will be hooked. I cannot get this book out of my mind. Absolutely incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inheritance by Judith Michael","review":"I read this wonderful novel twenty years ago. I wanted to read it again because of its fabulous plot, a real page turner from beginning to end. Unfortunately, I was not able to get it from Amazon because they no longer have it, just used ones and the one I got was not in good shape at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It!","review":"I am greatly surprised by the positive reviews this book generated. It started off with an interesting premise, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks trying to rise to the top of the business world, but the novel sagged midway inexplicably. The suspense and interest for me stopped. The characters became dislikable. I found it hard to generate sympathy for pampered, whiny twenty something year-olds. Yes, Laura was treated unfairly by being stripped of her inheritance, but her and Clay reacted to this as if it were a major catastrophe. Clay is a spoiled brat while Laura is cold and uninteresting. Why Paul and Wex find this bland woman so fascinating is beyond me. It also became tiresome to read about the characters' outlandishly wealthy, privileged lives. They seemed to live a fake, superficial existence. The writing team of Judith Michael succeeded in doing only one thing with this novel. They made the lives of the rich and famous look incredibly shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the opening credits","review":"featuring cookie-cutter travel log footage of Scandanavian scenery to the very last scene with 30 exhausted extras shouting \\"God Save the King\\" at three better than average actors standing ill at ease on a wooden platform, it was all pretty disasterous.I knew that it was a no go at the first syllable of the \\"narration.\\" Instead of showing us the murders of Amleth's father and brother, we were told about it. Instead of showing us the horror and mystery of Amleth's father's ghost appearing to him and telling him of his uncle's treachery, we were told about it.The poor actors were given almost nothing to play. I imagine that they were pining for Shakespeare's genius for writing superbly playable scenes and dialog. He would never have left his actors so stranded.The story and the actors deserved far better. What a total waste of celuloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could a movie with this fine cast be so horrendous?!?","review":"I was expecting a fine film, given the excellent cast and the sponsorship of so many European film groups. As it turned out, I finally found that the only way I could endure watching this film to its conclusion was by treating it as a comedy -- laughing at the unbelievably stilted dialog, the tacky costumes and sets, the population of Jutland and the English \\"armies\\" that consisted of no more than 30-40 people each, and just about every other aspect of this abysmal film. I am sure that there are more convincing productions by amateur theater groups, and there may even be better high school productions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget - not worth watching","review":"I love all of the actors in this movie... in their other movies. This movie looks as low budget as a PBS re-enactment documentary. In fact, I started to think that it was after the first 10 minutes of b-role and narration - and the actual actors being shown only in small vignettes. I'm thinking that this movie maybe was a chance for the actors to take paid vacations. You're better off watching the Mel Gibson version of Hamlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick ship - Perfect Condition","review":"What an awful \\"play\\" on Hamlet.

The movie is very slow and the plot changes all the time. Very fake settings and boring. Christian Bale is the highlight in this one but skip it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very bad","review":"This movie merits one star due to the underused cast, a brief sighting of Helen Mirren's breasts, a close up of Gabriel Byrne's gorgeous eyes, and a slightly younger Brian Cox being low-key duke-ish.People who make movies continue to mystify me. With all the talent and money it takes to create a motion picture, even a low budget motion picture, why do so many fail on an epic scale? Royal Deceit has all the finesse of a high school stage play. Not believing that a picture is worth a thousand words, viewers get voice-over explanations of events, characters, motivations.Dialogue was stilted and unpoetic, situations were contrived so naked female parts could divert attention from the poverty of the script. And if you're interested in naked female parts, let me hasten to say there aren't enough to justify even paying to rent this movie.Royal Deceit has moved to #1 on my list of Best Cast, Worst Films."},{"rating":"2","title":"I first saw Royal Deceit on TV","review":"But I began in the middle.

The duets sung by Dawn Upshaw and David Daniels are gorgeous highpoints but Lorraine Hunt (now Lieberson) steals the show with her great \\"As with rosy steps\\" and \\"Lord, to thee each night & day\\". Richard Croft (the 4th American in the 5 principal cast) is also excellent - clear and agile. The production is another matter - updated to the modern day and with the Roman governor as Richard Nixon. Need I say more? This video is worth having for the 4 musical performances noted above and for William Christie's sensitive conducting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a parody?","review":"If it is, it's not even funny. Total disgrace to Handel's wonderful work. Peter Sellars thought this piece is just not good enough the way it was originally intended by Handel, so he decides to \\"improve\\" on it.

The CW-50 prints to almost professional standards...and even though it says it can print on only 2 areas, it can actually print on all four sides of the disc, you just have to spend some time placing your images and disc correctly. For the money, this labler cant be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Printer","review":"This printer is no frills and does a good job on smooth CDs, however it's printing on textured CDs is unacceptable. Because the product description does not tell you this I have no choice but to give it 1 star. I bought a stack of 100 blank CDs and also 50 blank DVDs (I have not received the DVDs yet and hope they are not textured) and the money I saved by getting this no frills printer has now been wasted.If it weren't for this downfall the printer would be deserving of 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little printer","review":"I got one of these last week and it works great! The ribbon they provided lasted for 50 passes (if you print above and below the hole on the CD then that is only 25 CDs). I set mine to \\"very dark\\", so perhaps if I had left it on the default it would have printed even more. Anyway, it blows away all CD labeling systems (used them for years) and the ink costs about twenty cents per pass: roughly the same as the CD sticker labels. Also, you can import graphics on this thing, you have to go to \\"freeform\\" mode or something like that. However, it only prints in one color so make sure your graphic will look good that way (I tried a color photo and it looked terrible as one color).Worst thing: after printing the top of the CD, it pops out and you have to spin it around and carefully position it so it will print the bottom half evenly. I recommend only printing on the top, that way you can print roughly 50 discs with one ribbon and you don't have to spin it around every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice printer","review":"I bought this a week or so ago, it works nice. Text is clear, you will want to use larger fonts 26 or greater. I haven't tried graphics as I just wanted something to print on my DVD's/CD's without my sloppy writing. Only downfall, as is with all cheap printers, they get you on ribbons, some of the cheapest I've found were on here. And as this sells more, they will hopefully get cheaper. I printed appx 50 cd's/dvd's with one ribbon, and for the price of ribbons, thats less than 15 cents a pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio Printer Good Value","review":"This is a thermal printer. Basically it prints a label that you design onto a CD or DVD. If you burn a lot of discs and you don't know whats on them because you didnt label them this is great.

If there are any ridges, bumps, lines, or lables on the CD it will not print properly at all. The box doesn't mention anything about the surface requirements.If you plan on printin on the top and bottom of the CD you must print on the top, then the drawer will open, and you have to rotate the CD and try to align it properly to print the bottom.When you do get it to print right the quality is marginal at best.

Without a doubt, this is the worst piece of trash I have had the misfortune to purchase. Hewitt spends 1/3 of the book on his military career, 1/3 on trying to get back the stolen Diana letters from a then-fiancee, and barely 1/3 on Diana. Not much in the way of new revelations here, and I have to agree with other reviewers that Hewitt was just trying to get some more milk from the Princess Diana cash cow, that is, thankfully, drying up. Hewitt should get a life and stop trying to ride Diana's back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of time for fans of Princess Diana","review":"This book by James Hewitt contains very little new information about Princess Diana or their relationship together. It is difficult to know whether he is falsely boasting about his relationship with Diana, or hiding the truth about his relationship, because he gives very little detail about his relationship with Diana that was not already known from other sources. Most of the book is written about his experience in the Gulf War, and the recent crime story about Diana's letters stolen by Hewitt's new girlfriend. This book is well written, but unfortunately, Hewitt did not write the book about Diana that he seems to have been able to do, if he wanted to tell the whole truth. Hewitt is still keeping his secrets about Diana to himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's a Pig!","review":"THis just reinforced my thought that he's a pig.

As the late Princess is not here to refute or acknowledge the hideous claims made in this book, we must realize that we will never know the truth.

Now they've added lemon balm in it, I don't know why. In general I do not find that it's a good idea to mix too many plants in one teabag. Of course it depends on what you are mixing. Both chamomile and lavender have a very soothing effect. Lemon balm has other properties; it's not that lemon balm has negative properties but that's not what I want in my chamomile lavender tea.

The only flaw I found in it was an erroneous statement regarding Buddhism and the Dalai Lama. The book states that Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama to be the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha. This is incorrect. They believe him to be the 14th reincarnation of Chenrezig, or Kuan Yin, the Bhudda of Compassion..not, as the book implies the reincarnation of \\"The Buddha,\\" or Sidhartha Gautama. The author seems to not have grasped the fact that there are many Buddha's, indeed that the basic Buddhist belief is that we are ALL potential Buddhas.

I found this video, however, to be dry and boring. Often they are showing you a person sitting and talking about something when they could/should be showing you scenery or pastries or inside the salt mines or museum or so many other things. And it tells nothing of what the people live on today - is it entirely a tourist place where everyone works in cafes or clothing or putting on balls?What I learned from this is that they have salt mines, and coffee is always paired with pastry, and that children are brought up learning ballroom dances and etiquette and manners. And that they have a strong appreciation of the cultural arts.Pretty much a swing and a miss for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great, but the album is much better.","review":"Pyramid Song is a beautiful, beautiful song; however, the CD single may hold interest for collectors, but there's not much here to offer that you can't get on Amnesiac. The extra two tracks definitely sound like B-sides, i.e. tracks not good enough to make it onto an album. They're nice and all, but nothing to shout about. Maybe if Pyramid Song sported a different arrangement or mix it would have more to offer. Even so, I give it a pretty high rating - lesser Radiohead is still greater than the vast majority of everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible B-Sides from these sessions","review":"Pyramid Song is beautiful, but the more I listen to the B-Sides that came out of recording Kid A and Amnesiac, the more they strike me as some of the best work the band has done to date. The Amazing Sounds of Orgy takes a few listens but it is one of the best tracks - haunting vocals and beats reminiscent of a spiritual, its like halloween in new orleans. The single is worth it for this track. Kinetic is a good experimental tune, better than many of the experimental tracks that got chosen for the actual albums at least. Listen to the drum beats that close the track with headphones, great stuff. Trans Atlantic is half pure rock, half alien funeral music...interesting, and a good glimpse to the ideas they were having in the studio at the time. Fast Track is an instrumental, only traces of a song in this one, another experimental track on par with pulk/pull revolving doors. Great stuff here, but the Knives Out B-Sides are even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put it in your cart and nobody gets hurt","review":"Pyramid Song has long been a favorite of mine. Here, it comes with two extra tunes that stand a cut above the average b-sides you get on singles. Fast-Track scratches your experimental itch with just enough groove to make you switch the strobe lights on. Kinetic is so catchy and trippy that the only disappointment is that they don't give it more time to build and express itself. It starts out so strong musically with trippy delays and loops, building and then bringing in the rhythm section to set you up for when Thom delivers the first line and you feel like he's looking you straight in the eyes when he sings it. If you're on the fence about shelling out a few bucks just for two b-sides, I say \\"Put in it your cart and nobody gets hurt!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tune","review":"Radiohead is far from the norm in popular music. I think this is why many can't accept the \\"post-Bends\\" Radiohead. All their preconceptions of Radiohead have been turned upside down, as tunes like Pyramid Song appear as the first single off a new album. Radiohead are so far ahead of the game (as evident in Pyramid Song) that many listeners just don't understand it. It is a great song, but nothing like the single's you are used to hearing, even from Radiohead. Great video too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpriced, but does its job","review":"What can I say?

It's a great attempt to show what it might be like to have an Old mythic being, Taliesin, (in Welsh mythology a magical poet and shapeshifter) involve himself with a young woman and her family in contemporary England. It has some odd shifts and mysterious happenings...in some ways akin to Fowles/THE MAGUS. After reading it, I immediately began to research Celtic/Welsh myth to try to better understand some of the elusive qualities/forms Middleton had his Taliesin take. Though, I have to admit,I'm still not certain Lacey WAS Taliesin. If you know Celtic myth (which Middleton did, and published another book on) you'll probably end up like I did...reaching for the old books to help you decide whether this mysterious stranger was a good old Being, or a dangerous troublemaker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick read, but I want my time back.","review":"I found this book entirely unlikable. The two main characters are hardly enjoyable to read about. Lacy, the implied \\"hero\\" of the tale, comes across as just plain creepy. In the beginning, Jasmine seems misguided and much too foolish for her age, but, by the end, seems like a paranoid lunatic who has completely lost her marbles! The other prominent character, Roland, is just a spineless pansy and only slightly respectable. I will be the first to admit that this book could have just been lost on me because I know nothing about Welsh mythology. However, if a writer is going to focus so much on obscure tales from far away lands, I feel he has an obligation to make his story easily accessible to the common reader.

Pedro's relationship with his alleged longlost boyfriend Will is described in the sparest of terms, while other details like the weather, the architecture, and the politics of Paris are described at length. Because the characters go separate ways, many chapters contain only one of them and add to the feeling that the book is about two strangers who's lives barely intersect. Once the kidnapping occurs, the plot becomes a page-turner, providing drama in the form of the search and negotiations to get the boy back.

That's just what I believe.Also, you zim fans reading this, I'll just say this, Jhonen Vasquez said he is NO longer intrested in Invader Zim and moved on to something else. GET. OVER. IT. Stop demanding that they should bring it back. Although now, they're showing re-runs of Invader Zim on Nicktoons Network more than the ORIGINAL and on TeenNick they're showing re-runs of CLASSIC nicktoons that we all know and love!Isn't that enough for you fans?

I am really disappointed. But it won't go to waste. My older boys have the entire series in their room so the youngest is keeping this DVD for himself. So if you already own the series, don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is BS","review":"As I understand it, this DVD is an experiment to see if there are enough people willing to pay for a Zim DVD to warrant a revival of the show. The only problem being that there are already millions of people who have every episode on this set on one of the two whole series sets that have been released already, there is no reason for a hardcore fan to own this DVD except that NICK says that they might bring back the show. As an owner of the original DVD set, I really can't really justify paying for this item, not with my income, and I can see many other fans having this problem.If you do have the disposable income, and especially if you don't have the series dvds, then seriously buy this, because a shot at a renewal is so sweet. My low score is for the idea behind the DVD, not for the quality of the product, I havn't seen the DVD, nor do I know what episodes are on it, though for all of you who don't have the dvds already, I'm sure they are awesome, they are all awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, I don't give in to blackmail...","review":"I can understand wanting another season of Invader Zim.

We'll all watch a new season; and for that matter, purchase new figures based on that new season (hint, hint). They don't need to blackmail us with episodes that we already own and have watched hundreds of times... as I said before, they would make more money on collectables."},{"rating":"2","title":"A creature of pure headache!","review":"This set of episodes is a creature of pure headache!

Shikhee is Android Lust, and she is a master at what she does. This is Electro Industrial Music at its best. Shikhee blends beautiful sequences with rhythms and samples so seamlessly that I can only presume she has hard wired her cereberal cortex to her computer, drum machine and sampler. Present are the driving rhythms and grinding noise with which Industrial music has become associated, but there is not so much noise so as to drown out the melodies. Her songs range from darkly introspective to aggressive and angry, but throughout the album you will find one thing remains constant: the lyrics are raw, intelligent, and meaningful. Are you tired of industrial music that sounds like a third grader whose mother tongue is something other than English wrote the lyrics? Buy this album. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by the musical composer himself - Luis Esquilin","review":"This work is a unique look into Latin Salsa music of a by gone era that reigned within local pop culture in United States cities.

No, I do not receive any proceeds from the sale of this product, but can honestly say it is a gem of a work. The sides demonstrate uniqueness, creativity and a special resonance to salsa dance lovers. I certainly hope fans continue to enjoy the work and that they tune into other productions by yours truly...Luis Esquilin.

The doors in both were also slightly warped so they stick out unevenly - from the two packages we could not put together one really good buffet.Also, another key problem is that the unit when assembled is not solid/sturdy and it goes off square easily; this causes the doors to hang really lopsidedly and gap.The only good things I can say about it is that nothing arrived broken, and the customer service was responsive. In the end though their efforts did not help, since, as I said, the replacement unit was just as bad if not worse then the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collectable, not a toy by any means","review":"The seller was great.

Kusch writes that the police did not riot or lose control of themselves, which sounds like a stretch, until he convincingly deonstrates his argument with varied evidence and skilled articulation. It's a little slow in the begining but catches fire once the author gets into the street battles that marked the '68 convention. A tad pricey but a good look at 1968 and the police who made headlines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago blues","review":"Frank Kusch takes the reader on a blow-by-blow account of the violence between protesters and the police during the summer of 1968 in Chicago. Instead of the usual view from the anti-war movment, Kusch presents the events fromm the point of view of the cops and offers a more balanced view of that summer than anyone else. The author's account is convincing because the hyperbole is gone and the gritty facts remain. While the police are not always portrayed as angels, they come off as real men facing a possible inserection, not unthinking henchmen in blue. Battleground Chicago is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"Pigface is purely a tool for Martin Atkins to name-drop other artists that are more successful than him while exploiting them for his own financial benefit.

For the price I paid it was a steal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More uber-xena","review":"If this hadn't been uber-xena, it would have been a decent, albeit pedestrian read. Adding the repetitive mantra of \\"tall, dark-haired\\" or \\"short blond woman\\" made this yet another nauseating uber-xena fantasy.The plot was uneven - some parts were confusing and others did not follow from the previous action, while the sub-plot with the ex-boyfriend was repetitive. He could have been used for so much more than just showing up and threatening Alex in front of witnesses.There was a glimmer of potential in this book, and if the author is willing to write something not uber-xena, her next books should be even better. Until then, avoid this unless you are an uber-xena fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, and not a flowing storyline","review":"Much too long for the unbelievable storyline. Sequences are disturbing and distracting. Disappointing dialogue. I know this is her first novel, but this should be removed, reworked and possibly it will be readable. The way it is, I recommend you spend your money on Peggy J. Herring or Radclyffe. Season writers will give you a good flowing story. This one wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too long, sequences disturbing","review":"This novel was much too long and the sequences disturbing as they weren't connected well enough.

I finally settled on 4 stars because of two issues I have with this book. 1) It was sometimes difficult to determine the passage of time between sections.

This cable is small enough to fit in a speck (R) case, which does not allow for many auxiliary cords to fit in them. I found this cable to be lengthy enough for use in larger cars and reliable enough as long as it is stored correctly. Would definitely recommend this cable.EDIT.

But the quality of the product is not good. The cable was purchased for use in connecting an MP3 player to the audio jack on a car stereo. After only a couple of weeks, the sound quality started to drop off. We wondered if the connection was bad, so we disconnected and reconnected the plug, but that didn't solve the problem. It turns out that the cable has a break somewhere inside the plastic coating and the only way to get the proper sound quality is to keep moving the cable until it gets to a position where the wires connect.

I was always careful with it, when I was done using it I coiled it up and placed it in my center console. After a couple of months of light use though, it would start playing only out of one speaker or the other, or maybe not either side. I jiggled it around until it made a connection so it would work. But the wires inside the cable were clearly damaged even though the outside of the cable seemed sturdy enough.On the plus side, it was only a few dollars so not much money down the drain. On the negative side, it was only a few dollars so I probably got what I paid for.

Unfortunately, my applications are apparently no more conventional than their possessor. I want a 3.5mm audio out from, for example, a Mac Air computer, from an I-Dog, from a pocket-sized iPod speaker, and none of these cables can hack it because the casing--the plastic \\"wrapping\\" at the base of the plug--widens too far to allow the plug complete and full access to the jack on the device serving as your sound source.All you can do is keep ordering more cables with 3.5mm plugs until you land one that's small enough to fit snugly in tight places. Since they're too inexpensive to bother returning, you're likely to accumulate a mile's worth of gratuitous cables before obtaining one that fits.

By putting a softer edge on the subject, Ms Payne removes much of the stigma attached to SM, making it more palatable for a mainstream audience. If Cosmo or Mademoiselle were to write a serious book about SM, this is what I would exzpect to be the result. Ms Payne, a self described \\"Avid SM Hobbyist\\" is not a professional dominatrix, she is however the Martha Stewart of SM.Seasoned veterans of the SM scene however will find little in this book that they didn't already know. Most basic SM texts are far more advanced than Ms Paynes offering.

Fred Hammond is my favorite artist he never lets you down, it's always on fire. Why does he always have to be in my head, man it seemed like he was ministering directly at me? I am trying to pick my favorite song, but I just can't they all on the bomb. So I leaning some where in between Not Just What you Say, Loved on Me (nice beat), I will Find A Way, and It Just Gets Sweeter, and every thing else is in a close 2nd maybe a 1/2 step be hind like 1.0005.

The Anointing of God seeps through the speakers and catches your spirit and entangles you in a worship experience like none other.The songs on this CD take you through a journey if you listen carefully. It's a must have in the Fred Collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Fred Album but I wouldn't call it a Classic","review":"I like that Fred is trying to expand his boundaries and try something different, which is very evident with this album where he experiments with a more soulful sound. It was a great effort. However, this album cannot compare to the Pages Of Life, Inner Court, Spirit Of David and Speak Those Things. I prefer worshipful Fred to soulful Fred. That being said, this album is still better than most of the music out there anyway, whether secular or gospel (though he trips up a little on \\"It Just Gets Sweeter\\"). My favourites include \\"That's Why\\" (I have a problem with MusiQ's writers writing about praising God though. This trend of letting secular people write and produce music for gospel artists has got to stop), \\"Love's In Need\\", \\"Loved On Me\\", \\"How Do You Love That Way\\", and my highlight, \\"Praise Belongs To You\\". Bring back the old Fred."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a blessed man sings for Jesus every songs a hit","review":"This cd is full of timeless hits, but that's not an odd saying for artist Fred Hammond. It's hard to find a miss from him and his music. this cd hands down hits it out the park with every track complimenting the next. Great for a relaxing drive/or walk after a tought day."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Gospel Album of the Year!!!!","review":"For die-hard Fred fans as well as those who have never heard of him, this cd is the stand-alone cd of the year. Hands down. The newly saved and those who have been saved for years can find themselves in the verses of every song. This cd immaculately portrays the magnitude of God's unconditional love. If you don't know Christ, you will want to know Him after you hear this cd. Incredible!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good long ride music","review":"I personally felt that this album by Fred wasn't the most lyrically strong as far as puting out that solid christ message he's done in the majority of his previous cd's, but I love the mellowness of the album. I'm in love with neo-soul and him teaming up with musiq soulchild and taking that soulful approach, I feel, was a risk he succeeded at. When i first got it I listened to it repeatedly then chose my favorites. If you're looking for that RFC sound, wrong album choice, but I absolutely LOVE this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"As a true gospel lover and long time Fred Hammond Fan, I found that \\"Somethin 'Bout Love\\" is just not Fred's best work. I prefer his work with Radical for Christ much better. Even his early solo work is better than this. It sounds as if he's trying too hard to be contemporary or \\"cool\\". Most of the songs are pretty boring and they all sound alike. I love Fred Hammond's work but I am really disappointed with this project. But, check it out for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somethin' 'Bout Love--Fred Hammond","review":"I purchased this CD without hesitation because I am a Fred Hammond fan. I played it one time and discarded the CD. I was sooooooo disappointed. Other than \\"He Lives\\", the remaining tracks are terrible. Fred, what were you thinking? I pray that you are back in the studio working on your next project, because this definitely is not the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another anointed album!!!","review":"It doesn't matter if Fred sings with RFC or goes solo because all of his music is hot. Me myself, I am more of a worshiper so I definitely could apreciate albums like POL part 1&2 but there are certain songs on this CD that I cant help but to jam to (tracks 2, 7, 16). Dont get me wrong though because there are powerful worship songs on here also. My favorate is track 8. Fred just wants to lift up the name of God and in the process he delivers anointed music. I own all of Freds CD's and the thing that I love is that no matter what I am going through in life I can go to my collection and put on a song that ministers to my situation. Somethin Bout Love is hot and REAL just like everything else Fred puts out. Cant wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessing for everyone!!","review":"Being in a state of my mind where I felt like I wasn't loved at times and being tangled up in back-sliding with Jesus, I 've realized from listening to this wonderful music...I just want to truly apologize to god.

At first I was like \\"uhmmm what is this it's nothing like him and Radical for Christ\\". BUT I made myself listen to it over and over while studying for my college finals. Soon I was completely IN LOVE With it! I took it to work and made people listen to my favorite songs (even though they HATE Gospel). It was my favorite. Well then I moved across the country and haven't been able to find the CD since. So I purchased this one and it has been in my car's CD player for over a month now.

The warranty on labor is 90 days for this VCR.Panasonic used to make excellent (expensive) VCR's. That time has passed.

I think that VCRs are a thing from the past and the prices should be even lower. \\"good for the money\\" is not an excuse for selling this piece of junk for 60 bucks.

I will basically confirm one of the other reviews for this product. The playback is bad, except for tapes recorded on this deck. This includes any professionally recorded studio home videos. There was a tracking line towards the bottom of the screen which would not go away even when using the tracking function. I wasn't too surprised that it did this with my personally recorded tapes, since they were recorded on an old 2-head VCR. However, when I played a few official studio tapes I was shocked that it displayed the same tracking line with all of them. Now, as the other reviewer pointed out, tapes recorded on this deck play perfectly.I have since returned this VCR and bought the Samsung VR8460. So far the Samsung works perfectly on all levels. All tapes play perfectly on this deck and it is only a few dollars more than the Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewind broken within 6 months","review":"I purchased this VCR less than 6 months ago. The \\"supersonic\\" rewind was disturbing at first since it definitely sounded as if the VCR was going to launch itself right out of the TV cabinet. Well, after several months of use, the rewind is now \\"turtle slow.\\" It doesn't work. It's faster to use the Search+Rewind than the regular Rewind. Sounds like it's crunching through the tape (the Fast Forward is fine). I've owned VCRs which have lasted me for 10+ years. This is the first Panasonic I've purchased and since it will cost more to fix it than to buy a new one, it will be the last Panasonic I will purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Experience Trying to Get This CD","review":"I actually ordered a CD from Nicholas Mark's website....I was hoping to have it for my boyfriend's birthday.

This release is like a greatest hits. \\"Bitch\\" is a cool new song. I think the first song I heard by them was \\"La Guitaristic House Organisation.\\" This song is still as fresh as ever.

Luckily, the Beyond Reach website provided some samples; so I took chance. When Randle joined Larry, who was producing in Nashville, it seems like their goal was to make music that transcended the typically psychodelic hillbilly folk/rock from their younger years.Beyond Reach is a beautiful album with a variety of musical approaches and some real gems. I guess their sound has evolved. I really enjoyed the slower numbers, and appreciated some well-placed orchestration. The accompanying musicians are awesome as well. Beyond Reach also has a newer EP out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell below my expectations","review":"I had hopes for this book.

The editors have done an excellent job of clarifying that reality in their introduction and the notes which accompany each tale. I believe this is a valuable text for those who would understand Hasidism and the powerful cross currents of the Haskalah which was arriving.

Researchers and thinkers have neither followed Miller's nor Parsons's suggestions of how to do research. People into \\"complexity theory\\" ought to read this book, because I think that theory will go the same way as systems theory (i.e. the dustbin).There is however no doubt that a massive amount of work has been put into this book and that its author is intelligent.

I wound up buying the Dummies book on Interdev 6, and while it was excellent, I wound up having to pay for two books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors","review":"The author tried to make the concept simple for beginners. But the amount of errors in the sample code is unbeliveable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I've never used InterDev 6 before and was counting on this book to bring me up to speed. You will be extremely frustrated with the examples in the book because NOT MANY OF THEM WORK! Where was the editor when this book was written???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too General","review":"I skiped the first 5 chapters of this book. The author gives very little examples. Always talk about the general functions in InterDev. Very frustrating and hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Editing","review":"I found there to be a fair amount of useful information, but being new to VID, I was extremely disappointed in the fact that so few of the examples worked as expected. Without a respectable amount of programming experience, one would probably not be able to make the adjustments necessary to get some scripting examples to work at all.Overall, a careless piece of work. I've come to expect this from Sam's. Wait for a Wrox publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does more harm than good","review":"I was very excited about the new version of Interdev and this was the first book I saw written. I should have followed my own and waited for the second or third. This book is poorly written and a good number of examples don't work. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples didn't work.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I spent a lot of time trying to get the examples to work only to discover through a lot of research, that they would never work."},{"rating":"1","title":"He must have written it based on a beta version.","review":"I purchased this book and waited anxiously for it, but when I started to read it and work with some of the examples, I find that VERY FEW actually WORK. I am new to Visual InterDev, but NOT new to ASP, Databases, VBScript, SQL or JScript. A few of the examples in the book are helpful but that's rare. I would not recommend buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book If You have done some application development","review":"I have used Allaire Homesite before for writing ASP pages, recently forced myself to Visual Interdev.This book not only teaches you how to use VI, but also hints you a healthy application development throughout chapters.You might be flustrated with the lacking of examples, since they are not always available in everyday. Hold your breath for a few days (I know it is hard) and you will find one that would satisfy you.After all, this is a good book IF YOU ALREADY know some HTML and got some experience in application development. If you haven't met the criteria I have mentioned, you may have to do some studies before you make a conclusion hating this book.I certainly hope they either rename this book, or publish that under Wrox, or get some details in the preface so that people would not expect it incorrectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and confused","review":"There's very little to recommend about this book. Most chapters are filled with superfluous verbiage and far fewer hands on exercises than I expected. Some of the chapters are redundant, as if the author forgot that he already covered this ground in an earlier chapter. There is no sensible progression to the book. Concepts and techniques seem to come out of left field with no explanation of the fundamentals of what's going on. You get some exposure to the VI interface and some familiarity with the construction of a site and programming elements, but a poor explanation of underlying concepts. I found bugs in some of the code samples, and few of the more advanced examples worked. Unfortunately, the chapter on debugging comes toward the end of the book. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"More harm than good!","review":"This book has been a real disappointment. It has caused more confusion with ambiguous statements and examples that do not work. It often gives code samples for working with SQL databases. I feel that most beginners would be using Access, not SQL. I was expecting more from a Sams publication and found great benefit in Sams Teach Yourself Visual Basic 4 in 21 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant and scatter brained!","review":"The book needs a much better flow. Some of the examples will not work as presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money.","review":"I have bought quite a number of Sams Teach Yourself books in an attempt to, well, teach myself various technologies and this one \\"takes the biscuit\\". Very little works in this book, not even the updates. It has left me totaly frustrated and has diminished my confidence in anything ever published by Sams again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of fluff without much substance","review":"This book is written in a manner that is hard to follow. I often got the impression that the author was merely trying to fill up pages rather than convey a specific point. This may explain why there are very few good examples in this book. The author seems to love Microsoft and therefore objective opinions about Visual Interdev 6.0 are missing from this book. In short do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever bought!","review":"This book is so bad, I'll never buy another book by this author again, and my confidence in Sams/Macmillan publishing is seriously shaken. Unfortunately, it was the first book on Interdev I bought. Many of the examples don't work at all - and now that I've learned from other books, I see that the author is utterly ignorant of basic concepts of using Interdev. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this book does more harm than good, because it teaches many incorrect things, ignores some basics, and generally fails to accomplish anything. Not what I expect in a book I'm actually paying money for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good ideas but lacking good examples","review":"The book is not without merit but could use fewer words and better examples. I found the first 5 or 6 chapters to be full of good information and ideas. But after a while I got tired of the author telling me what he was going to tell me about later instead of just walking me through it then. I've been programming ASP manually for over a year so a lot of it was review but some of it was good. When I finally got to the meat of the book, like other readers, I couldn't get the examples to work. I had the lastest downloads but they didn't work either. And there were no readme files or instructions with the latest example files, which contained bits of text, looked like part of an email. Guess I'll try another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matching Pair","review":"I purchased the pink Secret Stylin' Doodle Bear for my 3yo niece.

Probably better for smaller babies who wouldn't understand anything going on, on the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"With compelling first-person hunting narratives","review":"In Heartsblood: Hunting, Spirituality, And Wildness In America, author, editor, and wilderness expert David Peterson provides the reader with an informed, intensely personal, candid, and occasionally unsettling exploration on the subject of hunting in American culture. Petersen documents his observations with compelling first-person hunting narratives, as he also draws upon philosophy, evolutionary theory, biology, and scholarly studies on hunters and the \\"hunting culture\\". Hunting issues are as topical as today's newspaper headlines. Heartsblood is a welcome and very highly recommended contribution to familial, environmental, and political dialogues over the role of hunters and hunting in our lives, culture, and society for both good and ill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposing the ethics of the hunter and the anti hunter","review":"There is not enough space in this review block to enlighten the uninformed as to what propells an ethical hunter. Suffice to say it is a passion...a love of the wild and things wild and finding a niche in this timeless chain for one's self. If you don't hunt, this book will help you understand why your dad or neighbour or uncle will waste countless hours in adverse freezing conditions in a deer stand or a duck blind. However, if you do hunt, this book is worth it just for the expose' of the roots of the \\"Bambi\\" syndrome and the unethical mechanisms used to discredit a heritage freedom and a nobel and ethical pursuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough read","review":"A great topic--the spirituality of hunting. A bit egotistical in approach. Only can read in short spirts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"While I agree with much of what Peterson so enthusiastically preaches and have read many of his favorite sources, I found myself hating the book. This book calls out more than any book I have ever read for a rigorous editing. It is hard to believe it was not self published. This book lacks a thesis and is poorly organized. Worse, Peterson's vocabularly is often curiously wrong and his writing style is perhaps best described as ugly. Further, it is hard to get through a paragraph without one or more parenthethical interruptions -- he even uses parenthesis inside of parenthesis! Instead of bothering with this book, read A HUNTER'S HEART (some great essays which Peterson edited but thankfully did not write) and Meditations on Hunting by Jose Ortega Y Gassett."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Mr. Petersen spends far too much time lambasting \\"slob hunters\\" (who seem to be anyone that happens to hunt differently than him) and not enough time on the notion of a hunter's spirit. (see title of book) Some of his \\"new age\\" philosophical rantings are so far \\"out there\\" he may have been \\"writing in tongues\\"...Instead of being an apologist for a sport he clearly enjoys, perhaps he could use his writing talents uniting hunters of different \\"faiths\\" (bows vs. crossbows vs. rifle vs. blackpowder etc). Maybe even write more about the vocal yet tiny fraction of Americans who actually oppose hunting under the premise animals are more important than their fellow humans. Through much of the book the author was more connected to said anti-hunters than with his fellow hunters."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt like it","review":"i found this novel to be lacking...something. something important. it seemed so TEDIOUS to me! i actually put it down w/o finishing it, & plan to donate it to a used book store. i did not find it humorous, it was boring. granted, i did not get more than 20-30 pages in, but sometimes, you just cant get into a book. you might like it, i didnt. i didnt feel it was particularly well-written, & seemed on the mundane side to me. yes, that was it\\" mundane. if you want a funny fiction novel, something completely not serious & with ridiculous characters, plot & situations, try carl hiaassen's work, & if you like sci-fi fantasy comedic novels, try the discworld series. this herding cats book was definitely disappointing. sorry i spent the money on it & on shipping. perhaps if i had kept at it, it would have gotten better, but it is just not my style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Walmart for another great movie!","review":"Our family watched this movie last week and thoroughly enjoyed it! This movie takes a look into the lives of two different families and reiterates the importance of not judging others, as found in Matthew 7:1.The acting in A Walk in My Shoes was strong and believable and the characters likeable. We also enjoyed the upbeat music throughout. The important lessons learned in this movie gave us good discussion starters. \\"Molly\\" in the movie was a little bit odd, but still likeable.

Sadly, this book I just couldnt get into and I am really sadden by that! I have read 11 minutes a few times already and some other of his novels a few times, but sadly this one just doesnt seem to grab me no matter how many times i try to return to the book.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's intentions of writing this book were not quite \\"Zahir\\"","review":"I love Paulo Coehlo's work.. with this book I got a bit impatient. sort of a drag in the middle. will still recommend it, because you always get something good out of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"his usual style","review":"I bought Zahir when it first launched and then put it on my book shelf. Two days back I suddenly picked it up to read and just finished reading it today. Unlike eleven minutes, this book is more like Paulo Coelho 's style. When you are in a miserable time especially in the relationship crisis or breakup, you will be inspired by Zahir. The search for self and broadening perspectives in life instead of being pity for self can always drive us to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!

What a waste of time & trees!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ...to say the least!","review":"I am a great admirer of Coelho's other works but this one was an utter disappointment.There was nothing obsessive except the idea of obsessiveness. I became so bored that half way through the book I almost decided not to finish it. Reading \\"11 Minutes\\" after \\"The Zahir\\" will surely not only cheer you up, but also make you wonder if the author was the same one who wrote both novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring","review":"This book has flashes of brilliance but overall is pretty dull. It would be better if the author did not mention \\"the Zahir\\" about 10,000 times.

I picked up Zahir expecting it to be just as good.But it is so self-involved, egotistical, and rambling. I came to strongly dislike the main character- and since this is supposedly a highly autobiographical work- the author. The weird philosophy/ worldview about love held no attraction for me at all.The most disturbing part about it all was that the things that I liked about the previous two books were here in The Zahir- but were amplified to the point of being cloying and obnoxious. I felt I was being bashed over the head with a hammer by the same things I had been gently nudged by in the other works.By the end, I was utterly Coelho-d out. I wish I had read The Alchemist first, since that is the one people seem to really like, but to be honest I don't think I can pick up another one of his books for a very long time, if ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was not worth wasting my time","review":"Even though it would be the last sentence of the review, i'll share the last in the very first. This is the first book i've read written by Coelho and i reckon that it'll be the last one as well. It doesn't mean the book itself is utterly hollow, there are some parts which make you ponder on some certain subjects nevertheless it's full of chiche,contradictions and repeat therein which really bores."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few books I could not finish...","review":"Having loved The Alchemist, I was excited to read The Zahir. However, after 100 pages more or less, I found the writing to be repetitive, the main character a self-absorbed, whining boor (If I were Esther, I'd leave him, too) and the whole venture with Mikhail, the supposed lover of Esther, meaningless. I did not finish the book because I felt it was going nowhere. Having spent the whole summer reading Bleak House (and loving it because there was a story there), I just couldn't waste any more time trying to finish The Zahir. I won't give up on Coelho, though. The Valkyries is of interest to me basically for its regional appeal (the Mojave desert) so I will try again to see if there is a story there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage..... boring.... it's like soap opera, dragging dragging...","review":"Depiste my previous readings of his novels - alchemist and pilgrimage, this one - zaihr - seems like a manual for yoga or soap opera that never finishes, but dragging the story... I am disappointed this novel. In addition, his view contrary to his earlier novel seemed have changed quite a bit. One summary, I have wasted my money in purchasing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book so far","review":"I'm a big Coelho fan, but this book was disapointing.To begin with, the first part is really dragging and you have to press hard to break through it. After that, you are witnessing the easy-to-read style that's so characteristic of Coelho's books. The plot is OK, but not exciting and many ideas are coming from other sources (the author gives credit to those people at the end of the book).The author is also bragging way too much about his accomplishments (the main character seems to be the author himself) to a point to which it gets irritating.The idea of Zahir in itself is fascinating and beautiful. It is the idea of love to the point of making it obsession (hence, 'A Nover of Obsession). And the author argues that everybody should experience a Zahir at least once in their lives. Can't argue with that!Overall, though his worst book so far..."},{"rating":"2","title":"i was obsessed with the novel of obsession","review":"The Zahir was the first book by Coelho that I read. A friend of mine lent it to me on a road trip, and I found myself not able to put it down. This novel was like stepping into a familiar life, as he provides all the details that you need to know. The book drew me in, and the story of the missing wife and her searching husband was good. My heart broke for the main character, who, through finding himself, solves the mystery of what happened. I promist you that you will not be able to stop reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Spiritual Rape","review":"This last novel from Coelho actually deserves no star at all.The books that came before this one, are all stellar novels, to the extent of being instant classics - genious at times.This one, however, is nothing but what the title says; a spiritual rape of the reader.Coelho claims many things in this book - amongst them, that he has found the meaning of life, the universe and everything. Which we all know to be 42... and Coelho's explanation makes just as much sense as Adams'.High-flying, lacking a storyline - and a plot, self-righteous and bragging besserwisser-ness pollute this book like a leak from a broken sewer-pipe, killing whatever joy I had for this writer and his books from the outset.The bottom line is, that it's not the worst book I've read, but it's bad, and it's definately the most disappointing book I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Indepth Look at What it Means To Love","review":"Paulo Coelhos books just get better and better, which is an amazing feat considering where he started. This book is one of the best books I have ever read as it reaches so many dimensions for the reader in it's content. Not only is it a great Novel and a touching one at that but it makes you take an indepth Journey into your own capacity for Love and what it means to you. Just as the main character in the book gets provoked by his wife to contemplate his actions in their relationship, in the greatest detail, so does Esther (the wife of the main character) manage to capture your own heart and start the search..............the search for true love.Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"I expected an action-packed novel, but got a spiritual journey of a middle aged man after his wife dissapears. The book is anti-climactic at times, but for all those that are spiritual and new-age religious, you will love it. The ending was a bit confusing and left you hanging for an explanation. But, I guess that's the effect Coelho intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Zahir","review":"We did this book in a bookclub.

This book is as good, if not better than The Alchemist. I literally can't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Based on this book alone, I would not call Coelho a writer because he doesn't deserve the title. This is some of the sloppiest, laziest prose I have ever read. The narrator has many of the same life experiences at Coelho and seems to be a poorly disguised alter ego of the author. Unfortunately he is also an arrogant fool who is not even slightly compelling. I made it to page 82 of The Zahir but will not waste any more of my time. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"It takes a bit to get into, but this is a wonderful tale of relationship from a male point of view.

Masterful writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't, Good read but not Good!","review":"Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO."},{"rating":"2","title":"It spoke to me...","review":"I will agree with other reviewers that this book is not an easy read. However, it also spoke to me on a level I had not expected, and provided a sort of therapy for which I was desperately in need. As luck would have it, I picked up the novel in the airport book store. My ex-husband had unexpectedly passed away a few weeks prior, and my daughter and I were on our way to visit his family in France. During the vacation, I found myself reading the book, and also retracing the steps of our life together, the years living abroad, the ways we changed each other and the bitterness of losing that love. This book has an emotional truth to it that helped me through a difficult time, and made me think about the difference between love and obsession."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it because I needed it","review":"I don't know how this book will stand the test of time. I don't even know if I'll continue to like it in a few years. All I know is that it was exactly what I needed at this point in my life. I may not have agreed with everything it said, but it was enough that this book provoked me to think and work things out. I never understood love and I still don't. This book brought peace to parts of me that were still hurting and how many other books can do the same?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"It is a very true adage that \\"Success sells future success\\"... and sometimes a not so good product (Zahir) is sold successfully and gets good reviews based on past books (which were excellent). I think people who gave good reviews to this book are more in love with the Paulo concept and than actually reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed attempt...","review":"This book was horrible. I have read a few of the author's other works and they were good. This attempt was a waste of time. I think the author just took the formula for all of his other books and applied it to this one.The writing is uncreative and straightforward (which can sometimes actually be a good thing). The plot is ludicrous and uninteresting. The characters are boring and difficult to become attached to. Midway through the book I really didn't care what was going to happen to any of them.Another thing about this book that confused me was the narrarator.Is it Paulo Coehlo? I assumed it was, but then when the narrarator kept talking about all the books he has sold and how everyone holds him in such high esteem I thought there was no way anyone would toot their own horn that way. Bizarre.The spirituality and metaphors are uncreative. Again, I'm sure that he just grabbed his tried and tested spirituality formula and plugged in some of the variables (location and names)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating","review":"\\"The Zahir\\" started out well, but about 100 pages into the book my interest level dropped. It, in no way, mentally stimulated me. I could not read one more page of the main character's self-indulgent and arrogant thoughts and actions. I guess, if you are the type of person that needs to love the main character in order to read a novel, then this is not your book. I couldn't stand him and I really hope that the main character isn't a reflection Paul Coelho. I almost threw this book away, but I instead donated it.

The diagrams are clear, and the writing unmarred by grammatical errors. Nonetheless, the challenge this book poses the reader is not entirely in the difficulty of the topic, but also can be blamed on the carelessness of the author.

In fact it was perhaps the best thing on TV for many years, since SHOESTRING, in fact, hardly suprising as This TOO starred Trevor Eve, perhaps the most underrated actor ever, Eve took time off the small screen to concentrate on his stage career. Much to the sadness of BBC bosses, who had a ratings winner the likes of which hasn't been seen since. At the hight of its success, Shoestring brought TV audiences of 20 Million, a figure unheard of now, and Eve quit after two series. Back for \\"Heat of The Sun\\" he doesn't disappoint his fans, episodes shown in two hour sittings flew by like you were watching a halfhour program such is the power of this story. Power, passion, romance and a slice of history, make this a very special video. Essential viewing for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another place and time ... infinitely interesting people","review":"From the bleakness of the opening scene in London, to the blaze of the Kenya sun, this series evokes romance and intrigue. Intricate plots and fascinating characters populate this unknown world. The scripts artfully present themes of justice, redemption, and vengeance. While serious and committed, Tyburn's wicked sense of humour sets him a cut above most fictional detectives. (Trevor Eve's impish grin is utterly devastating.) Supporting characters are excellently drawn and portrayed. The bad guys are all thoroughly bad. The good guys are always a bit tarnished. For me, this makes it all the more interesting, all the more worth watching. From a female perspective, the character of Emma Fitzgerald is one of the more admirable I've seen in a long time. \\"Do we even have a plan, Albert?\\" For mystery fans, for history fans, for fans of good, old-fashioned romance, this is a series for you. The only fault I can find is that it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality DVD damaged by included commercial ads","review":"This was an excellent series presented on PBS, and I was very pleased with the quality of the DVD set, but was disappointed that these DVDs require the viewer to watch tacky Traveler's Insurance advertisements.The DVD is coded so that one cannot pass the ads -- you will be forced to watch the commercials and I felt that this was (1) insulting, since I paid for the DVD, and (2) rather cheapened the viewing experience.That said, I would have given the set four stars for overall dramatic presentation and theatrical beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful series","review":"Strongly recommend if you like the BBC mysteries.

Great mystery, great music, one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling stories and great acting combine for terrific entertainment","review":"I too saw this series years ago and loved it. It's an amazing treatise on how the British went to a certain part of the world and thought they owned it, and how Tyburn comes in and treats everyone equally, to most of the \\"polite society's\\" astonishment. I have followed Trevor Eve's career since then, since I like his work so well ... \\"Waking the Dead\\" is a wonderful series that he's been in for the last 3-4 years. I first saw Susannah Harker in \\"Jewel in the crown\\" and she impressed me there. I just wish that this series had been filmed in widescreen vs full screen to get the full impact of the cinematography and the wonderful vistas of Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat of the Sun is Brilliant","review":"This is certainly the very best of Mystery, and I have watched them all. The series was brilliantly acted and filmed. Trevor Eve (who is devastatingly handome) plays a character of honor, humor, and commitment - and he actually loves a woman - how refreshing!

Being disabled doesn't mean she can't have friends, fall in love, go to college, have a full, rich life in MANY dimensions! But the book's core philosophy sees nothing for her but an inner life... and sees nothing wrong with that, either. A distasteful thought experiment, this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind's Eye is a slow read","review":"I am a Fleischman fan, but this book was a very slow read for me. Not only did it leave large gaps of time that were never filled in, but often, it did not make much sense. I found little character development and almost no cues as to the setting of the book (other than the basic nursing home scenario). Had there been a little more background given for the characters involved, it would have been easier to sympathize with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind's Eye lacks depth","review":"I love Paul Fleischman's books usually, but I found this one to be a little strange. The characters lack development and depth. The story is told in script form, like a play, which is something that I found hard to follow. I would have liked to have known a bit more about the characters themselves (background and personalities).Of course, this is not the worst book I've ever read, but because it is lacking in many areas, I can't score it higher than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd taste","review":"All artificial.

It was really about the Jesus of the bible bypassing all additives. The biblical Jesus was not concerned with church attendance, tithing, legalism, wealth, doctrines, or building mega churches. You will find in this book that Jesus was opposed to institutional religion, politics, and the abuses of the wealthy. His life was about showing the downtrodden a spiritual path to the kingdom of God where they were all welcome. His path was one of love.\\"A new instruction I have given you: Love one another. All will know that you are followers by this sign alone, that you have love for one another\\" (John 13.34-35) Oh, how we have lost our way. Read this book to find it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"after you've read papers from the Jesus Project, read this","review":"This work is for the reader who is not afraid to confront the question, is any of what is in the New Testament real.

I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"It began okay","review":"What Jesus Meant began in a promising manner; however, by the time I finished I couldn't help wondering if I had just finished a more modern and cleverly disguised manifesto of liberation theology. If Wills isn't truly embracing liberation theology, then he's certainly giving it a nod, wink, smile and pat on the back. He is also quick to point out that Jesus spent the majority of his time with \\"sinners\\" but he forgets to point out that Jesus would heal these people, instructing them to \\"sin no more\\" Jesus is reduced to an anti-religious, open minded and liberal hippie. I would recommend spending your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I read this at a friend's suggestion. I was disappointed.

Did I miss something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was extremely disappointed in Mr. Wills book. His conservative approach to a complex subject lends virtually nothing you couldn't learn in a middle school Sunday school class. For a reader seeking to understand New Testament writings, Mr. Wills ccontributes nothing of value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear...one for the choir","review":"I should have known better. I was hoping to find meaningful insights, but all Gary Wills has come up with is a different way of saying the same tired old things. He says that \\"for creating radicals, there is nothing like a reading of the gospels,\\" but don't expect anything radical here. He is singing to the choir..an evangelical/fundamentalist choir at that. So it's all about keeping strictly within the confines of a certain belief system..., belief NOT understanding. There is nothing here to broaden or deepen the reader's undestanding of God, Jesus or history. But then again, most of us want don't want that. Wherever he is, Jesus must be tearing his hair out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary Wills is a heretic.","review":"I'm quite disappointed that there are people in this world who can openly dissent from church teaching yet write and act as though the Church is the one dissenting. Wills thinks of himself as God by interpreting the bible to his own likings and to fit his own beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"More sola scriptura, if you like that","review":"The book delivers the promise on the dust jacket, of showing the Jesus who is not political or \\"religious\\" in any conventional sense. It's nice to read Jesus words anyplace, in the Bible or elsewhere.But, Wills betrays his Catholic upbringing on many pages. He finds no mention of priests, bishops, or popes in the New Testament, nor does he show any respect for any other form of organized Christian religion.He doesn't give the Catholic Church the credibility to rub two nickels together, much less to canonize the works of the Bible itself. Wills shows so much contempt for organized Christianity, as being unfaithful to Jesus. He ends up sounding to me as if he's criticizing Jesus for failing to lay down a plan for spreading the gospel. If it was not via an organized church, then what does Wills think Jesus meant?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God Gary Wills is here to set us right","review":"As a 26 year old Catholic I love Reading this guys work. It is so comical. He is a poster boy of the old guard still trying to reinterpret Christianity to serve their tired old hippie agenda. Thank God young Catholics and most of all young Priests don't fall for this hogwash. Of all this clowns books this is the worst(well Papal Sin was pretty darn dumb). In it he actualy deigns to tell us what Jesus realy meant. Because you know, two thousand years of scholarship not to mention the gospels have been wrong. The ego mania on this man knows no end. Apparently he fancies himself a lone prophet telling us the truth. Go Gary!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Succinct but persuasive","review":"This is an enjoyable book; it almost could have been subtitled Jesus for Dummies. It is a brief overview of the philosophy of Jesus. Wills makes a number of persuasive claims, to mention just three: Jesus had no political program (he would have endorsed Jefferson's wall between church and state), he had little use for formal religion, and he was a radical egalitarian (this last item will come much to the dismay and shock of Christian conservatives today who worship the free market). What Jesus Meant is a great introductory book for people wanting to learn more about Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply moving, deeply spiritual book","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It's a quick but thought-provoking read, and I plan to re-read it in the near future. In part because of his expertise in Koine, the original language of the New Testament, Wills is able to breathe life and provide insight into many well-known Biblical passages.The viewpoint is from that of a devout believer. As I was reading Wills's book, I was also reading \\"Mere Christianity\\", by C.S. Lewis, and I was struck by the similarity in outlook of the two authors. Although I recognize that some of the passages critical of church hierarchy in general and Pope Benedict XVI in particular will ruffle some feathers, Wills did not seem to stray from Scripture or interject modern political sensibilities into the Christian message. In fact, the hypocrisy of attempting to use Jesus' message for worldly purposes is one of the book's major themes.\\"What Jesus Meant\\" would be a good companion volume for anyone who is working through the New Testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pontificating","review":"Have you ever noticed how those who deny the authority of the Church Christ founded end up confering that authority upon themselves?

With several outrageously funny characters and Ms. Halliday's definite gift for comic timing, DREAM GUY fairly sparkles with good cheer... and oodles of sexual tension.While the romantic couple, Annie and Matt, stumble their way toward love, several of the secondary characters almost steal the show. Most noteworthy among some nicely sketched (often kooky) characters are Collin, the gay friend of the lead couple; Rico, every woman's dream fantasy; and Helena, Rico's Latino bombshell girlfriend.This character driven tale is wonderfully paced as well. DREAM GUY never falters, never drags. The characters and the situations they find themselves in keep this story moving along quickly.So if you like sexy, well-written romantic comedies, DREAM GUY is the book for you.Of that, I am certain.Debbie Jett, reviewerRomance Reader At Heart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My little one has be wearing and loving her pink bunny helmet since she was 6 months old!

Do not expect any customer support from the Audiovox \\"customer service\\" people. You will get mis-directions, excuses, poor response time, and of course RUDENESS from their representatives.

Readers are taken through every process of construction, from wood selection to launching. Beautifully rendered, accurate line drawings and period draughts are a bonus.

I would give 5 stars but I do not like the brushed finish on this, was hoping for something a little smoother, but don't let looks be your reason to buy a crappy lock that gets your home burglarized!!! This lock is above and beyond the cheaper products from companies like Kwikset.

And of course various ropes and strings I have lengthened successfully.The catch: Bungee cords. I went bungee-jumping with some friends (and cave diving, we cave dive for excessive water-moles) and the cable broke, but fortunately we were testing it for safety by tethering a car battery at the end, so no one was injured. We discovered it wasn't the extension cable, it was the knot (my friend was tying the b****rd, he prefers hammer knots over hooker-nose knots) and the fact that we had spilled some bacon grease on it from the Coleman's stove that morning, over all I would highly recommend this product. 5 *****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cable would not stay connected to phone","review":"Bought this cable as an extension to plug my phone in.

When I opened the package I discovered that the end that plugs into the PC was bent and the receiving end that the headphones plug into was slightly too large for a 3.5 mm input. The result was that my headphones kept disconnecting from the extension cord whenever I moved. Reading other reviews, this seems to be a common flaw in this product. Shipping back to the seller makes a more expensive purchase than buying the other extension cord available at Amazon. Save yourself time and money, buy the Maxell."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"These cables have some serious problems. I bought four, and they all reverse the left and right channels. How is that even possible if they're mass produced? For people who care about the stereo image using headphones, that's not acceptable. You can always reverse your headphones or ear buds, but you shouldn't have to.One of them also has intermittent sound in one channel if you move the cable around.So they are not great cables. I get the impression that these are the ones that failed quality control at the factory so they're unloading them at cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality cable. Avoid.","review":"The connections, both at the plug and the jack, are not built to spec and are quite loose in all of the headphone jacks and headphones I've tried.

It's awesome!There are, however, a few things to note:-Seems to be well-constructed (only time will tell)-Little tough to get headphone connector to go in, but no real biggy-Six feet seems to go a little longer than you may think, it's probably somewhere relative to your height (I only mention thisbecause I sometimes have a little trouble visualizing length of cables, so I hope this helps others who think the same way)Over all, I'm very well pleased. This cable seems to be worth more than a penny, but I'm not going to argue about that!UPDATE (12/12/10): This cable stopped working a few days ago. If it was touched, then all you could hear was static. If it wasn't positioned correctly, you could only hear one speaker.

Headphone cables are way too short for these uses on their own, so I need extension cables. They tend to go bad rather quickly. When I searched this time I found these supposed 6 foot cables. I figured that would be just about right (barely), as 3 feet is way too short, but the 12 foot cables I've been using are overkill. So I bought two of them. I just received them and they seemed rather short, so I measured. They are just barely 5 feet, including the length of the plugs on both ends. Not worth returning or complaining for a couple bucks each, but it sure is annoying. So buyer be warned, these are FIVE FOOT CABLES, not six."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works - what more do I need","review":"What can you say about an extension cord - it works.

We had no problems come up during installation and the directions were good. The fan is not whisper quiet which is okay with us, but sounds like a normal fan. It does not vibrate or make any strange noises. We are pleased with this fan and it is an excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"I have an equivelent 35 feet length of 4 inch venting to the outdoors. I have not installed the fan yet but this vent fan should be perfect for my situation. I plan to use a combination timer and humidity switch with this fan to provide maximum flexibility in occupant usage and also assure that adequate humidity control is maintained in the bathroom. My experience with doing business with this supplier was excellent and I would do business with them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, do not buy","review":"A truly terrible purchase that I regret. First, the installation bracket is impossible to work with, buy the time I managed to get fan into place the bracket bent and would not snap into place. I was forced to drill holes in the plastic housing to drill into the stud. Despite claims, there is no way to put this in without crawling into the attic. Finally, the air flow is terrible, it barely moves any air, and certainly nothing near the 90 cfm that it claims. Complete waste of money, I will replace shortly and throw away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Amazon's Error","review":"Was looking to replace all 3 fans in bathroom. Typed bathroom fan with light and this shows up. Looking at the Picture, the bright spot in the middle, assumed its light and ordered 3 of them. Go to install, none have light. Looked at details on air king website and it does not mention light. Therefore returning it. Otherwise, no issue with product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy installation! Works great!","review":"This fan was very easy to install and works great with the timer switch I bought with it. The only thing I have bad to say about it is the bracket that it mounts to on the beam is a little bit flimsy. I bent it slightly while installing it and I didn't get it back into the correct place. But even with that, the fan doesn't vibrate at all and still is pretty quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful but noisy","review":"I bought this bath fan and installed on my basement bath. I bought this as this is a high performance abs powerful bath fan however I didn't realized that this fan is quite noisy and the design doesn't allow you to fully secure it onto your ceiling stud, thus when the fan is on iit vibrates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great, First One was Defective","review":"This fan works great. It's quiet. We no longer have any steam on the mirrors. It's more effective and less noisey than the fan it was replacing.I would give it 5 out of 5, but the first one I got was defective.

It has been a difficult year for him but asa parent I feel that he is the type of person who needs to gothrough several life lessons to learn. In going through thechapters and Q&A; after each chapter, he was able to see thingsfrom different sides versus a knee-jerk response. I review hisresponses and it has been a BIG eye-opener into his thinking, hisconcerns, goals etc. More revealing than any dinner conversationwe have ever had. I would highly recommend this book as a tool for your teen to set goals and as a tool for a parent to learn more about your teens thought"},{"rating":"2","title":"New series","review":"I loved the first book in the series, so was anxious to continue the saga.

He had no real knowledge of Japanese history but got this neat idea about how he imagined it happened and then looked for facts to \\"prove\\" his point, ignoring all the things that didn't fit with what he \\"knew\\" just had to be the truth.The fact is that guns helped the three great unifiers of Japan (Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu) create a government that was strong enough to end war completely for 250 years (from 1615 to the 1860s). Guns were unnecessary and not needed, so not many were made. End of story, no mysterious Japanese reverence for the sword or resistance to modern things required.See for instance the review by Conrad Totman in _Journal of Asian Studies_, v. 39 (1980): 599-601."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technology is not a force of nature, but a human choice.","review":"This well-written, nicely illustrated, and brief volume provides solid historical evidence that technology is not a force of nature: human beings can and do decide which technologies to adopt and develop.

Since these three books are the ones that threw him into a fame as a thriller, I decided to check it out. And I didn't believe there was a volume like this! Very good deal to have your favorite author's early works packed in one hardcover, since you can't find hardcovers in any book store these days, and only online is where you can buy, but then, all of the price combined is certainly greater than this one.

He went from strength to strength with Hip Sway and then the follow up 'Groovalicious', but his maturity has really moved with the times and his melodic mix of smooth jazz with the DJ scene has created an all round and outstanding album. The melodies and the hooks all create a real smooth jazz junkies trip of melodic surprise, which leads up to the finale - 'Giant Steps'. Chris has done himself proud with this new album and has put his heart and soul into a recording which I have no problem recommending. So what are you waiting for, you know you wanna buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Express","review":"This is by far one of my best musical purchases this year! And...

I heard one of Chris's songs on a jazz channel on TV, and it caught my attention. This is unusual because I am a classic rock listener full time. But there was something about this sound - it was different. I LOVE this CD - I'm not sure I am a total convert to this type of music, but for certain times during my day, it is PERFECT. It is the type of music that you can listen to over and over again and hear something new each time.

Also, it was Donner in the original, not Donder. Other lines are out of order. One stanza has been changed completely from 'And seeing who stood there, so real and so near, While telling the tale we've already told here: ' to 'At seeing who stood there, a paw's length away, And told of the darkness and fog and delay,' REINDEER DO NOT HAVE PAWS! Also changed was 'The horrible fear that children might waken,' to 'And Santa's great worry that children might waken.' There are more, but I won't bore you with them. Why change things? Especially when it is claimed on the dust jacket that it is the original story.The pictures were quite pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - very disappointing","review":"I had a Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Little Golden Book growing up in the 70's and loved it (and my other Little Golden Books). This book, however, is nothing like the quality books they once were. First, it is at best 2/3 the size of the old little golden books. The cardboard is cheap, thin, and the book is not traditionally bound (all glue, it LOOKS like something meant to be used a few times and discarded - like something you'd pick up on a street corner in Beijing). It completely lacks charm. My kids agree - they have no interest in reading this book because the cover is hard to open, the text is crammed onto the small pages, and there are so many better alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck??","review":"Ok, I am not even sure what version I have...but it is NOT what I expected! I wanted the regular Rudolph story, instead, I got something with an abominable snow monster that eats reindeer and a mountain man that rips his teeth out?!

Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"remember this is the \\"old\\" version...","review":"Having not seen the orginal Rudolph TV show in a very long time I forgot what the story line was... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child. There are a couple of scary illustrations in this book. My 3 year old was in love with the Rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with Rudolph again because he said he \\"didn't like the scary snowman\\". Yes, I know it's a classic, but be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Story","review":"This charming re-telling of the classic TV special is dutifully captured in a Little Golden Book with its vibrant art and enchanting prose.

I disliked it intensely and thought it was too sad.First, we have the bigotry among the reindeer. They were prejudiced against any deer whose nose wasn't jet black.Then, we have poor little Herbie, the aspiring dentist whose toothy dolls with donkey teeth just aren't catching on.Lastly, we have the Island of Unwanted Toys. I found that part so upsetting. To this day, I remember saying, \\"I don't like this part. The island is where you go when you're bad, like a hospital.\\" (This was during the days when tonsillectomies were a dime a dozen). That part always made me sad and in the few times I watched this movie or read the story, I would always leave on that part.No, I didn't like this story under any conditions. I liked it better when Santa only had 8 reindeer, Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Cupid, Donder, Blitzen, Comet."},{"rating":"2","title":"very Ka-Spel","review":"Of all the Ka-Spel solo albums this is one of my favorites all because of the oh so haunting Tanith and the Lion Tree, addictive Bakersman, and the painfully real Prithee. Now that I've heard these songs and have been entranced by their creepings I can no longer live without them. If you like LPD and Edward you MUST own this album or you will never be added to the big \\"I'm an obcessed LPD fan\\" list in the heavens.His lyrics are not as dark as some of his other releases, but fear not, they're plenty dark. The music reminds me a lot of LPD's Nemesis Online album."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can find it... buy it!","review":"Edward is not diminished in the least in this solo effort. This album will leave you wondering what LPD would be without Qa-Spell. Moments of ambeint minimalism create an atmosphere of strange isolation that will actually leave you feeling quite relaxed. Buy the damn thing, it might not be around next paycheck."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best Edward Ka-Spel album, and it rules.","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of all time. I am not a huge fan of LPD or Teargarden (they're ok, but some of it is embarassing) and Edward Ka-Spel can be kind of annoying and melodramatic and whatever, but contrary to what the total goth nerd above me says, this album is amazing, way better than most other efforts by him and his contemporaries. I have had it on three different mediums and it sounds different each way. (I still miss the way the cassette sounded in my first car) Totally buy this record if you are into really good music, there is not one \\"dull\\" track on it.

After installing this unit the temperature in summer was less, the air exchanged more often, and substantially reduced condensation in rainy months. I'd say the cuddy could breathe much better with only this small, fanless unit. A Nicro 24/7 battery/fan combo is always going to be better for venting. However, this worked very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand finale for a grand teen series","review":"This is the fourth, and final book in this Circle of Friends series. What I really like about this book is that there are discussion questions in the back of the book--which opens the door to discussing pertinent issues in a Christian teen's life. For example, \\"Nicole's parents refuse to allow her to date someone who is not a Christian. Do you think that this is fair?\\" Parents, youth group leaders, may want to read these books along with their teen(s,) so they can talk about these issues that come up in the relationships in the book. In this way teens can safely apply the questions and consequences in their own relationships.

Coffey manages to place each of the perfect-game pitchers and their feats in such a context. '27 Men Out' is enjoyable and very well written. The chapters on Jim Bunning and Dennis Martinez are my favorites. Just one small correction: In the Martinez chapter, which goes into some interesting history of Latin ballplayers, Coffey mentions the supposed pitching 'prospect,' Fidel Castro. This is a common myth: Castro was never a pitcher, nor even a baseball player. Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria fully deflates this Fidel pitching myth in his excellent history of Cuban baseball, 'Pride of Havana.' Other than that, Coffey throws strikes all the way through '27 Men Out.' Each chapter is very absorbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satisfactory, but incomplete","review":"If you wish to find out more about the first perfect games, pitched by rivals Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward in a remarkable 5 day span in 1880, you will need to look elsewhere (Ronald A.

The author uses similitudes (e.g., the four 'stomachs' of time, like a cow's stomach) and excerpts from the Holy Scripture to show us that God has set aside what we call Time as a period for testing His creation and their eternal choices.

Now, almost 40 years later CD's emerge which cover various years of live Crimson. And what a selection there is, my friends! This set \\"Epitaph\\" covers 1969, with five venues from the BBC and the Fillmores East and West, to the Chesterfield Jazz Club and Plumpton Festival. In almost 4 hrs. there are 30 tracks of jazz-rock, what we remember from the first King Crimson albums. Though the cuts average 6-7 minutes, some extend up to 18 min. long. This is not studio album stuff but true improvisations, with room to stretch out. This set also comes in two parts for a tighter budget. King Crimson has gone through many reincarnations over the decades, but one fact remains--they always reach for new ways to express their vision of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"This is not a book for those interested in ghosts but a collection of very boring short stories.

I suppose they were supposed to be scary but failed in a most spectacular way. I tried to read the factual information at the end of each story but they were so brief they could have been printed on about 5 sheets of legal paper.

That message says that anyone who is presenting or communicating to today's audiences, whether that audience is comprised of one person or one thousand persons or more, MUST be authentic in their expression. Anything less is ineffective. Mr. Lane teaches the reader how to access their own authenticity and gives them the tools to express it. All speakers, from the typically terrified to the polished professional, will benefit greatly from this fresh, state-of-the-art approach. I have been a seminar leader and public speaker for about six years and Mr. Lane's teaching has changed my experience at the front of the room.

While I love her voice I just felt the songs were more reminicent of r&B they were not prayful praiseful or worshipful.

Animation is better than some other videos out there, but I probably won't let my child watch again till he's older and I will probably fast forward through the devil scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Quite disappointing! The stories move so fast that it leaves out important detail from the biblical account. The story appears to be based on a modern interpretation of the bible instead of the more classic King James version. Some important parts of the stories of the Savior are not even depicted. They use very stereotypic depictions of Satan, Judas Iscariot. Satan reminds me of the Grinch with green skin, dagger-like finger nails and red eyes. My 6 year old grandson even said, \\"...that's not the way the bible tells the story.\\" To me it doesn't matter if some children like it if it's innacurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally inaccurate!","review":"I bought this movie for my kids and I was sorely disappointed.

This manual will assist you in performing many repairs which the Haynes manual simply advises you to take to a repair shop. This is OK if you're not confident in your abilities or don't have the correct tools, but I needed guidance for more advanced repairs, and this is where the Chilton's manual excels. It has the common failing of trying to cover too many years, and this can make it somewhat confusing.

Do not be fooled. Most of the stories are reprints from other sources and vary from histories of the old west to modern times. Cooper's personal philosophy is much in evidence but few of the stories are actually about shooting and those which deal with hunting are few in number.

I wanted to see everything Heath Ledger had ever acted in, and I couldn't find Two Hands anywhere else.I'm not a big fan of black comedies, but this is a pretty good one. There are some funny bits (particularly the parts with Heath's character's dead brother--Jimmy?), some intriguing bits (parallelism between a couple characters, for instance), and some nice little pieces of continuity in the plot (the way the plot traveled actually reminded me a little of the movie Go).I'm glad I got the movie and watched it, but I don't think I'm going to buy the DVD; I may even sell my videotape. I just don't watch the show that often, and I'm not sure I want my kids to have access to a show this dark & violent at a very young age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even Rose Byrne can save this","review":"A pathetic attempt at a gritty street life story with Heath Ledger playing a dim-witted working class man hoping to move up by working for gangsta Bryan Brown (who killed Ledger's older brother -- whose corpse occasionally talks to the camera! -- I kid you not!).The main reason this failed for me was that the criminal behavior of Ledger's character and of two young boys' somehow made them virtuous.

This was not a promising start for that talented actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Academic","review":"The articles in this book are great reading. They provide thoughtful insite on many different topics. The cases, however, are completely useless without the instructors' manual.

Out of date material. Several passages in the book refer to predictions in 2010 which does not make for interesting reading in 2012. The real-world illustrations are somewhat helpful. There is no useful index. Order it on Kindle if you can so you can search for material. You won't miss anything in the Kindle version because the book is black and white which makes for a boring read compared to colorful textbooks filled with illustrations, pictures, charts, graphs, and case studies. Most of the illustrations are merely filler and serve no useful purpose. This book needs a major overhaul. Universities can surely find better textbooks to use. One of the most boring textbooks I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is great Salsa that desrves better remastering.","review":"This was an early Sonora Poncena release and includes some great tunes like \\"Pano De Lagrimas\\", \\"Na Na\\" and \\"Africa\\".

Leopold presents the big picture, painted as many small scenes. Again and again, I return to the February essay, \\"Good Oak,\\" a classic of natural history writing. Leopold is a natural historian of the old school.If recycling or climate change or energy has brought you into the conservation movement, this is the first book to read to get grounded in conservation from the ecological perspective. For those coming in from the animal rights movement, here is a book to help make sense of the consumptive side of conservation.

Michael closely researched the places talked about by Leopold and photographed them in a way that deepens the experience and the understanding of the reader of Sand County. Ken Brower, son of David Brower, provides a wonderful introduction. Together, Sewell and Brower have honored the fact that this is Leopold's journey and message for all of us. I'm certain this will be the edition that stands the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delusions of Grandeur in the Sand Hills of Wisconsin","review":"A Sand County Almanac is this man's account of his surroundings and his reflections on the human intervention within this environ he calls nature. However peaceful it may sound, Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac is a cluttered work of non-fiction where the author cannot decide whether to be a phenologist, conservationist, or philosopher. Leopold uses this work to talk down to his audience of \`booksmarts' and point out that traditional education is worsening this country while contradicting many of his arguments along the way. A Sand County Almanac is blindly revered by some scholars who delve too deep into a broken philosophy and scrambled themes of a lived man with eighty acres of land in the sand hills of Wisconsin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corrected reveiw.","review":"Team player was more than helpful to correct the problem.

Leopold's \\"Land Ethic\\" is the basic principle on which all responsible conservation action should take place.

The connections and combinations of the sefirot are discussed effectively also.The Tree of Life diagrams were very helpful.The meditative visualizations have been an aid in calming the mind.The Glossary is excellent for explaining terms on the subject and the notes for each chapter are also very helpful.While this book is easy to understand its also one of those books that you need to keep handy and re-read it to fully appreciate the material in it.I wouldn't categorize this book as a \\"primer\\", its more detailed.I also recommend this book for a reader of any persuasion that wants to know what Kabbalah is and how it applies to everyday life in this age."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Serious Students of the Somme Only","review":"I found this book of interest only as a contemporary description of the Somme battlefield as it existed shortly after the battle. The language used is poetic to be sure, but the description is repetitive and frankly a bit boring. There's only so many ways you can describe a tree-lined stream. The introductionary chapters contain a brief history of the battle of the Somme, and Masefield's tour guide makes up less than half the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced & Insightful","review":"Lippman's biography is balanced, fair and an enjoyable read. You'll come away with a clear sense of Albright's strengths and special qualities as well as her weaknesses as a leader. You'll learn how her style differs from that of Christopher and Powell. I would have liked a little more clarity and depth on how she justified women's issues as a foreign policy imperative. Her comments about enslavement of women and the likelihood of war under women political leaders hinted at her views. I suspect, however, there's more to her arguments than the book covered. Albright's perspective and the national security establishment's reaction to it may color our relations with Arab allies, the Chinese and other important global players. I also would have liked to explore more how her personal history influenced her views on the Middle East. Lippman kept mentioning that Albright showed unusually little compassion for Palestinians yet I never learned why."},{"rating":"1","title":"no stars","review":"I bought this book hoping that this book would shed some additional light on Dreamweaver MX templates.

Director Taylor Hackford has had an uneven career, but this stands as one of his best movies so far. Quaid is the a star college football player who marries the homecoming queen (Jessica Lange) and SLOWLY comes to realize that the fame and glory of his college days won't carry him in the real world of professional football and the years after. Lange gets top billing (contractually), but it is Quaid's movie. This should have been his Oscar-nominated performance.Hackford (or careful editing) pulls back before certain moments fall into sappy sentimentality. But the period detail is meticulous and perfect, and certain pressings of this video come with the dialog-only (no music) trailer for 1989's \\"Batman\\", one of the unintentionally best movie trailers ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh . . .","review":"The metal is quite thin and so is the nonstick surface.

He could bring a serious theme to his silly, zany cast of characers and make it work. This movie doesn't work. Not only have original songs been abandoned, but it's a meaningless spoof of every sci-fi movie ever created.

In typical modern movie fashion, there were even men with automatic weapons running around.This is a Hollywood bastardization of family feel-good quality entertainment that Jim Henson always strived for. Henson would definitely not have approved.A talented supporting cast is wasted, as well.We end up not really caring about anyone in this very thinly-plotted disaster. I saw this today on HBO, and frankly stopped paying attention after 45 minutes.A huge disappointment to someone who could not miss a weekly Muppet Show episode when he was growing up. This movie is simply not that funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Also Like It!","review":"This movie is incredibly funny and, I thought, really equaled the best of the earlier Muppet films. My fifteen-month-old son loves the physical comedy, and my four-year-old nephew adores the story. I love to watch it to, as a great deal of the pop culture references and funny lines are meant for adults (my favorite line: \\"You tell him and I will smack you. I will smack you like a bad, bad donkey, okay?\\") A good buy for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And romantic,okay?","review":"I adore this movie! Sure,there are moments that are less than exciting,but,all in all,it's mupperific fun! I loved the scene with Rentro having the marshmallow fluff all over his paw patting his boss on the back. Oh,and I thought Pepe was just so cool,okay? I was also glad to see that they are giving more attention to newer characters. Fozzy just doesn't seem funny anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to get down with your bad selves!","review":"The combination of the 70's funk tunes and muppet humor is a winner. My kids and have watched this several times. It is not the best muppet film but still pretty good. I wonder what Jim Henson would have done with it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One small step for Gonzo, one giant leap for the frog.","review":"Although this isn't the best of Muppet humor, all the elements were there. I laughed till I cried at some spots, other spots I couldn't wait to get on with it. I admit the ending was a little disappointing, but if you want a fun movie, and if you're a muppet fan, see it. I can't wait to buy the video and watch it with my wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Fun","review":"I absolutely loved this entertaining muppet adventure. Great for the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"An alien?","review":"I rally did like this move, I love the Muppets but, I was very surprised that they said Gonzo is an alien. Only because I remember the Jim Henson movie, \\"The Great Santa Claus Switch\\" (1970, I was born until '82 but have still seen this movie). This is the FIRST time Gonzo was ever featured. Anyway, in that movie they say he is a Frackel (no not Fraggle) he was a bit of an outsider to the Frackles because he did not have the trademark large teeth, and lived in a cigar box. It's said that Jim Henson liked the little outsider so much he added him as a permanent cast.So..what is Gonzo...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muppets from Crap","review":"I'm a fan of The Muppet Show and some of the Muppets' older movies, but this one is pretty weak. The plot is thin and pretty boring. But I was probably most disturbed by how they made Miss Piggy to be so flighty and shallow; she may have been self-absorbed in previous incarnations, but here she seems to have the depth of Jessica Simpson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff, but it's less about bikes than you might expect.","review":"I'll say this right up front: \\"Full Throttle\\" is a damn good movie. The only thing is, if you're looking for a roadracing movie where the racing is primary and the plot is secondary, try \\"Race for Glory\\" instead. \\"Full Throttle\\" is less about bikes and more about relationships. Namely, the relationship between Joe, the street racing king; Annie, Joe's long-suffering girlfriend; and new guy David, and up-and-coming racer who befriends Joe.The street-racing scenes are more than decent, but where the movie shines is in the drama department. Andy Lau (Joe) looks suitably tortured as he recovers from a debilitating crash, attempts to reconcile with his father, and tries to stop sabotaging his relationship with Annie.Without the convincing dramatic elements, the movie would not have held up, and while I would have preferred more racing, I found \\"Full Throttle\\" to be a solid piece of work. You can't ask for more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hong Kong, fast bikes, fun with rebels,,,","review":"Good flick, i actaully saw this a while ago and a friend reminded me of it, so i had to pick it up.

As for sound, \\"Most Dangerous Game\\" was sharper with higher frenquencies more obvious. \\"And Then There Were None\\" had sound more soft and not as sharp.

It had the \\"Spin Free\\" sickness. The motor ran but nothing else happened. I mailed it back to the factory store in NY City ($12.00 in shipping) only to find out that they didn't have any crome models in stock and would not for several months.They refunded [the cost of the grinder] very cheerfully but no mention about any shipping charges ($27.00 total, $15.00 Express shipping from Amazon and $12.00 to NY). I'm not a happy camper. I would not buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of Bodum's Name","review":"I was so happy when I received this as a gift, but that very shortly turned to disappointment. The timer knob fell off after three uses and now comes off every time the machine is used. The grind adjustment does not work. No matter how the adjustment is turned, all grinds come out the same size. This is an extremely poorly made product, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control problems","review":"On the recommendation of a friend, bought two of these, one to replace my Braun which was noisy, messy, and slow; the other as a gift for someone without a grinder. The \\"gift\\" grinding range went from drip to very course It could not grind fine enough for espresso. Then after about 6 months the clutch mechanism broke so the motor continued to run but grinding halted. He got frustrated and threw it away. Mine is still running but unlike the other, the grind ranges from powder to drip. Can not get a grind course enough for a french press. I continue to use it but am looking for one that can grind a full range from espresso fine to french press course. The Solis Maestro Plus is so advertised but appears to be made by the same manufacturer as the Bodum so gives me pause. I'll live with it for now, but am not happy with mine and embarrassed over the one that broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quinteto de Buenos Aires","review":"It is a brave attempt by recently deceased Spanish writer Vasquez Montalban to depict the post-dictatorship scene in Buenos Aires. The country was economically ruined, and despite cosmetic democracy, the hard liners still very much in charge. His detective Pepe Carvalho makes a circuitous attempt to make contact with a former revolutionary, now underground to persuade him to return to Spain, his adoptive country. Montalban description of Buenos Aires is almost cinematographic. He captures the flavor of Buenos Aires like no other non-Argentine writer could. The narrative is however rather repetitive and at times painfully slow, punctuated by moments of gruesome violence. Montalban, one of the late 20th century best mystery writers, could have done some serious editing on this particular work to improve readability. For those readers familiar with the Buenos Aires of the 80's, the book will no doubt bring back twinges of nostalgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT","review":"WOW...Snak King Popcorn is really good, and it's Crunchy, Yum!

Dozens of murders, overly-dramatic descriptions, and a climax that it is anything but. His leading character hardly spends more than a few moments investigating yet miraculously solves a baffling crime. Patterson has really stretched himself thin on this one. It is a true page-turner in that you keep turning pages to see if anything interesting will ever happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrillier?....Where?","review":"This book was not good at all. It didn't thrill me whatsoever. It wasn't amazingly clever or even that interesting. I'm sorry I even read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Patterson the time to actually write another classic!","review":"An unfortunate waste of time... This is certainly not the classic Patterson we eagerly await! The story line is just a short step up from Nancy Drew, and any observant mystery reader will figure out soon enough who the villians are, since so few new characters appear in the book! Although the book appears to be 392 pages, there are WIDE margins, double spacing, and each 1-2 page chapter starts another new page! Save your money and go to the library. This one-afternoon read is NOT worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a sorry example of good fiction.","review":"Yes, the authors are creative in keeping suspense alive, and they build on this strength by packing more suspense into 344 pages than you'd think could be done. But to accomplish this they move the story along at a fast clip (at times readers have to gasp for breath!), and dropped character development for the bane of today's popular fiction: the overuse of metaphors.But the book's real undoing is its unbelievably at critical moments. Whenever the suspense reached its apex the story became preposterous. Or, if you prefer: implausible, cockamamie, dubious, far-fetched, beyond belief, flaky, incredible, kooky, phony, or screwy. For example, try explaining the jury's verdict in light of its questions to the judge, and how a \\"pretty, dark-haired girl of about eight\\" inexplicably acquires wisdom and courage seldom even seen among adults.- John Ambrose, Falls Church, VA"},{"rating":"2","title":"4th of July","review":"Very enjoyable - typical James Patterson - suspense and turns at every corner. Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced police procedural","review":"San Francisco Detective Lindsay Boxer is back in one of the best books in this series. Lindsay is in pursuit of the person responsible for a series of murders which have a similar MO to an unsolved case which she worked on many years ago. While working on this case, Lindsay and her old partner Inspector Jacobi end up chasing a suspicious vehicle. The vehicle is being driven by an underage teenager who poses a severe threat to the two police officers. Lindsay fires in self-defense, and before she knows it, the teenager's father is suing her. An emotional trial ensues and Lindsay's whole future is in jeopardy. Without giving away any more of the plot, I'll just say that the action is fast and furious, and Patterson again does a good job of mixing the private and professional lives of his characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks To Maxine Paetro","review":"This is an excellent mystery story and I can only say thanks to Maxine Paetro. She obviously wrote a great deal of this book because Patterson has never written this well. Of the four books in the series this one is the best.

A little predictable towards the end, but still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"4th of July","review":"Excellent series of books. If you haven't yet read them, start at the beginning with \\"1st to Die\\". Patterson's Women's Murder Club series is great, and they're all very quick reads (with very short chapters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have loved reading James Patterson books, and I've read quite a number of them. This book, 4th of July, however, was a huge disappointment. I am convinced that James Patterson did not write this book but it was written primarily by the other name on the cover, Maxine Paetro. First of all, the story is written from a female detective's point of view. Then the \\"love scenes\\" appear to have been written by a female. I've read thousands of books and I truly believe that Maxine wrote the majority of this book. There were even some areas where the chronological time line was out of sequence and I had to read and re-read those parts then just go on and ignore those parts because they never did fit in. This was the first book I've read in the Women's Murder Club series and it will be the last. I will, however, continue to look forward to books that James Patterson has actually written himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"The only redeeming value of this book is it did make me care about the protagonist, Lindsay Boxer, through most of it. Otherwise, it is simply awful. The crucial crime with which the novel opens and \\"trial\\" is hopelessly unrealistic -- downright goofy. And the \\"solution\\" to the string of crimes that occupies most of the book, revealed at the end, is a joke, with no reasonable predicates. Don't waste $2 on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I learned a lesson!","review":"The main thing I got from this book is to NEVER again buy a favorite author's book which has been co-authored with an \\"unknown\\".I find it hard to believe James Patterson wrote or even okayed the ending of this book. The plot held my interest up to nearly the end. When the first killer was revealed, I accepted it because I suspected him myself, and his psychosis was fairly well brought out. But the other two? I actually laughed (in derision) because it was as if the writer decided, \\"Oops! I'm running long on this story...better wrap it up NOW!\\" The ending is so poorly done, with no explanation given for the murders being so excessively brutal; and what is the likelihood of three \\"psychotic\\" killers working together?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Suspenseful and really good reading.

Great suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping as always.","review":"James Patterson enjoys his sub-plots more than most and 4th of July is no exception. It sways between a tense life changing court case and the confused panic of a seemingly disjointed murder spree that ensured the last hundred pages were read at a near-frantic pace. While the murder case is plot enough the key focus is on Lindsey's internal struggle and Patterson shows off his gift for character development which matches his one for building suspense.Another gem worthy of the series and a must for any JP fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay for strong women","review":"interestibg plot, well written, am enjoying the whole series. i like the characters, especiaally the women, who are strong and smart. makes me want to take a self-defence class, or work out, or something. great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"4th of July","review":"This book i must say wasn't the best JP book i've ever read and i found that about half way through it slowed down a little but like all JP books the ending was thrilling and i was and i was glad to have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best among the three","review":"i've read three james' novels so far, and this one seems the best among them. the courtroom scenes were tense and the atmosphere that james created was the kind that made me feel breathless. the serial murders case was so much more justified than those in the other two novels i read (honeymoon, and london bridges). it's a good read. will definitely read more women's murder club books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nailbiter","review":"I was going to save this for my summer reading but it was just too tempting to let sit around.

Worse, it was written in the fashion of an Encyclopedia Brown \\"mystery investigation.\\" and ended much like a Scooby Doo cartoon! James Patterson's only contribution to this novel was his name. The writing (which seemed to be an attempt at an adjective/analogy lesson) was so inferior to many of his past novels.Honeymoon, another of Patterson's recent mysteries and co-authored by Howard Roughan, is another example of why great authors should stick to doing the writing solo.I'll pass on any future book that Patterson simply lends his name to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the trash can.

I was on vacation at a cabin and this was on the shelf. I got about half way through and I had to stop. It was all just false. Unrealistic situations, unrealistic characters, needlessly violent. The whole thing seemed like it was off the top of his head. He writes a lot I guess and it shows. This one probably took him a weekend. That's pretty easy when every description, every character and situation has just the shallowest of thought put into it. I guess I'm being pretty harsh, but it goes to show just because you sell millions of copies doesn't mean it's quality. Sorry to all the fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to take on vacation","review":"Although I generally prefer true crime, I took a break with this one and was pleased.

I read 3 books a week, so I can't afford to waste money for a larger book with the same story. Does it add anything to the book? No, just more cost. I refuse to buy this book on principle. Maybe if my library has the hardcover I will borrow it from them, but I refuse to put more money in the publishers' coffers when they aren't offering this in the normal paperback size. If it was really for the reader's benefit that they offer the larger size, they would offer both sizes to better serve the consumer.

The overall plot was OK, but Patterson didn't seem to utilize the \\"Women's Murder Club\\" as much as before - the remaining members seemed an afterthought. The addition of a new 4th member was totally unexpected, and it seemed not really thought out very well. She just seemed to show up with no significant character or background developement. Of course, that leaves something to be developed for the next book...Seeing as I read this a month ago, I can't even remember the romantic interest that was introduced so I have to assume (at least to me) that it wasn't that important to the story line!

The thing about this genious called Damien Storm, is that it is so wrong that it's right. Damien Storm is a one-man Metal orchestra who has the strangest music and image imaginable. Wearing 1920s style horror film masks with extremely large, phallic noses, singing in a high pitched, eerie vocal tone that goes completely out of key on many occasions, as does his guitar solos, Damien Storm is deffinitely an aquired taste. What would possess anyone to look or sound like this? Possibly a true genious? The greatest idea in Metal history? I cannot compare this demon to any other band. It is 100% originality at its best. I hope this review helped. You can visit Damien on the web at [local website]"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's horror alright....

However, the changes to this album are in two categories: merengues and authors. For \\"Juego de Amor\\", his 12th studio album, Antony makes changes that signify if he still has the right stuff.For starters, the album contains 10 songs, 5 bachata and 5 merengues. He wrote 5 songs and the other 5 were from other authors including Enrique Feliz, known for \\"Por tu Amor\\", by Joe Veras. The bachatas are still on the slow path as from the past few albums.The merengues are still \\"Mayimbe-flavored\\" with now saxophones included (The previous album included a piano set for the merengues).As for the tracks, all the bachatas except \\"Brindo por tu cumpleaños\\" (HORRIBLE) are good. All the merengues are good, including a Part 2 of Alegre Conga from the previous album.Overall, getting other writers for the album seems a little weird in that Antony usually writes all his songs. The album will be a success b/c it's \\"Tu Mayimbe OtRa Vez\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this infected CD","review":"Do not buy this CD or any other CD either made by Sony or labeled \\"Copy Protected\\".

I decided to try the Extended Pleasures. Wow I think they worked a little too good, as I had trouble reaching climax. They have benzocane in them which makes you fairly numb, and I think that they're a little thicker than normal condoms. IMO they should have a touch less benzocane and be a little thinner.After you put it on you should wait a minute as it takes the benzocane about a minute to take full effect. Then go to town..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use only if you are a \\"1 minute man\\"","review":"This particular type of condom has an ingredient called benzocane which REALLY numbs your genitals. I found it REALLY difficult to climax after any amount of time. With the extra long time it took, my partner became dry and it was uncomfortable. In fact, if you're not EXTREMELY excited, it's very easy to become limp just by putting the stupid thing on. Go with this condom if you're the type who gets off in under a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use at your own risk","review":"The numbing agent works, yes; my partner lost all feeling for about an hour. To quote him, \\"I could probably hack it off right now and not feel it.\\" Obviously, that reduced action to nothing until he regained feeling. The product works well enough to the point where you no longer need a condom; if you end up with a pack, think about giving it as a gag gift to that macho jock guy at your high school reunion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of a good time","review":"I gave it 2 stars because it does what it says it does, but about as enjoyable as eating a really good steak just after having novocaine injected into your mouth.

The stories are deep, witty and humorous in a classic way. The Usurper and Other Stories, Master Man and other Stories, Union Muzhik-- are fine and hilarious books to read.Anton Chekhov the world master of short stories gives one a witty insight of man and his way of life than any writer I have come across.

About halfway through, it just lost all momentum and sputtered to a dead halt. I wonder if the author was bored with all her money and spare time and decided to become a writer to ease her rich b**ch boredom! To be fair, there were some good descriptive passages of India, but that's about all I could say of redeeming value.

The language is splendid, exhuberant with a sensuous and nearly spiritual ability to evoke the look of things. The writing reminded me of \\"Beloved\\" because of its richness and the way memory permeates the present. The story is often painfully honest and will touch anyone who ever had a hard time dealing with a parent. One really feels that this is a human condition, LIFE, presented in such a rich way that our own lives are enriched by the book. This book can be savoured slowly like some of the delicious foods that it describes. A mother's anguish at her sometimes difficult relationship with her daughter leads Ms. Hadley to take stock of her life, and its meaning, of her character, its flaws and its triumphs. I consider this a masterpiece - a touch of Rabelais, a touch of Proust and Toni Morrison and Jung. And yet it is entirely original. Thank you and Brava."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell than no fury like a mother scorned!","review":"This book is an affront to the sacred trust between a mother and daughter. Ms.Hadley has no idea of how monstrous her betrayal of her daughter is in the self-serving, whining journey. I am skeptical as to the facts of this book and feel that it should be classified as fantasy/fiction.I can't imagine what would motivate a person to write such a book about one's child. I have a daughter and I would never in a million years write such an obscene and innapropriate book.I think Ms.Hadley should take the proceeds from this book and get a better therapist or psychiatrist. Obviously, for all the therapy she supposedly has had and which she brags about in the book, it doesn't seem to have done her a bit of good.Shame shame shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE RIGHT TEMPTATION","review":"This film will keep your attention however, if you watch the trailer first, you'll know everything.

If you avoid this feature, even at the rental counter, you will have yielded to...The Right Temptation. 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic, cheapo movie...","review":"Not exactly a high-budget blockbuster here, despite the three high-profile main actors. Rebecca DeMornay plays a complex character who seems to be juggling toughness, street smarts and independence with a vulnerability and sensitivity to the idea of relationships. Interesting enough, but then she just ends up being DUMB in the end. In fact, the whole end is dumb, with one eventful (but predictable) scene and the rest of the movie just fizzling out--blah. Keifer Sutherland plays the macho main role who handily takes on five gangbangers at once with a crowbar (and conveniently for him, none of the gangbangers had any knives or guns to defend themselves with against the 160 lb. businessman Sutherland character--yeah, right). He would have been wasted in a flash in real life, c'mon!Just a pretty lame movie, overall. The story was overall pretty good, but some of the more farfetched scenes and the weak ending just kind of ruined it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Mediocre Film Noir","review":"Promising cast let down by frankly awful screenplay. Poor directing meant that dramatic tension was noticeable by its almost complete absence, and character development was also weak.

Why are they so mediocre in comparison?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Show on TV","review":"I was first introduced to this show by a friend in the USA (I'm in Australia) who asked if I'd seen it. No, I hadn't. Then I saw an episode on cable in a hotel and I knew what he was talking about.The situations are great - lots of improv but you'd never know it - it's very natural.This show is the funniest on tv, I bought a multi-region DVD player just so I could watch this. I know some Cops who have seen it and they say it's funny as hell. You can't get much better than that. Lot's of \\"in\\" jokes for real Cops too.

The digital picture quality is absolutely perfect on an HDTV home theatre system. It's like being there, the picture is so wonderful. All the technical aspects of this set are outstanding. Anyone who has seen this show knows how terrific and funny it is so I won't go on about that but the set is worth every penny. Just one comment about those reviewers who are upset about the cursing being bleeped and the nudity being blurred, that is the whole point of the show...to be a parody of \\"Cops\\"; it is meant to be seen as \\"censored\\". Easily, the best comedy show ever produced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny Show, Great DVD","review":"When this show first came on Comedy Central I didn't much care for it. After awhile it started growing on me. The other night I desided to buy this box set. I couldn't beleve how funny the show really was.

I would not buy from this distributor again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Comedy Central Fare","review":"Reno 911 isn't original, but it is often funny. It reminds me of Police Academy in many ways as well as Mad TV. The show is an improvised spoof of the reality show Cops, but if you really want to see a police show satire that rocks the house then buy Sledge Hammer: Season One! After more than a decade, Sledge remains the politically incorrect cop who can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of funny, but lame overall","review":"If you like to see stupid people doing even stupider things, you will love Reno 911. I do applaud the cast on trying to keep things fresh (which always isn't easy w/ an improvised show). Overall though, I'd have to say it gets boring after repeat viewing.On a side note, the show is not filmed in Reno (the Palm trees are a dead giveaway), nor does in particularly reflect Reno in any realistic sense. Not that it needs to as the show itself is a farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'e Even Funnier than \\"Cops...\\"","review":"For the longest time I always felt that the funniest sitcom on TV was Cops. Where else do you see trailer park trash, redneck lovers in bars and crossdressing hookers on one show? Oh, wait, Jerry Springer, Maury, Ricki Lake... Well anywho at first glance the show looks like a rip-off of Cops. It seems, at first, almost to be real, but whooo! Thank the lord its not a real police department.The first season is very funny. It is a little rough in spots, but all in all it is a hysterical look at police shows, our desire to watch 'real' TV, and the lengths some people actually would go to get on national TV. It is offensive, yes, but what good satire isn't going to offend someone. People who are thin skinned stay away. Opened minded enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why aren't they in order?","review":"First things first: Reno 911! is one of the funniest shows on television. The DVD looks and sounds great, has very funny commentary tracks (especially the hidden one), and the deleted scenes/alternate takes are great.But, for some reason, the DVD does not have the shows in their original airing order. Why is this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAND HELD CAMERA DISAPPOINTS","review":"I understand the spoof of Rescue 911 and even the wildly moving hand held camera during the chase scenes, but when the camera is bouncing around while doing an interview, then that is way too much. Makes the series basically unwatchable. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weigel - an unfortunate looking woman, \\"confused\\" Dangle...","review":"...And a hooker, pile of garbage that would make even Satan weep, just some of the things that make this show memorable. The first time I watched it, I thought \\"Well, it's funny.\\" Then I watched more of it, and realized that this is a masterpiece of improv. Buy this if you haven't.To some that claim they paid too much for this to have the nudity and cursing cut out, I have a following message: This is why you buy it at Wal-Mart the week it comes out, when it's $15, not $25.Also, I feel that the fact they blur out nudity and cut out cursing is great because it gives it more of a sense of reality show we see on TV, like the Cops.All in all, just an awesome show, great season one - even with Mexican werewolves sneaking into the country and selling extacy to kids - and even a better season two coming up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This show is one of the funniest on comedy central today. It's full of over-the-top, sick humor that just keeps you laughing through each episode. Definately worth buying the first season on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wet-Your-Pants-Funny","review":"If you like the show RENO 911 then OF COURSE you will like this DVD. I buy very very few tv shows on DVD, but this set is worth the money.

Before I sent my order I listened to some of the samplers. I wanted to hear the Pretender but couldn't because JB was yapping away with some low-class putdowns about how the USA might not be the greatest country in the world and commenting about a group that wanted to Sail Away from here. Then I remembered that JB has often done the liberal California thing when talking about the military and the government of the United States. I thought that if he felt that way and wanted us all to know it then I would show him how I felt and not buy his stuff. Brown, Raitt, Springsteen, et al should just shut up and sing.

This master of the insipid and banal had the gall to say that Joni Mitchell is \\"a bitter old woman who never had a great album\\".

Good show."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As They've Always Been","review":"This is the first CD from Jackson Browne of acoustic live material, in what I hope becomes a long running series of volumes. His voice is still as crisp as when these songs were first recorded. The sparse sound of only a piano or guitar really highlight how well written and thought out the lyrics are. The production is perfect with great sound quality, and they gave the introductions their own tracks. This avoids having to listen to a minute or more of Jackson talking. If you are fan you owe it to yourself to pick this is up. Jackson Browne is timeless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"i saw jackson Browne do an acoustic show a few years ago, and it was one of the best concerts i've ever seen. So i was really looking forward to this cd. And it was really satisfying, until Jackson Browne got to the political parts. It almost ruined the experience for me. If he had left that part out, and just concentrated on the music, this would be a perfect cd. As it is, parts of it sound like another disgruntled LA musician, which is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less talking ... more Lindley","review":"We could do without the dumb quote about the election..and without Lindley these songs are much less interesting.. boring like the last Springsteen album...I guess both are a result of post-election depression..can do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Same old songs with live background noise.

I threw my cd out the window along highway I20."},{"rating":"2","title":"New treatment of some true classics","review":"Back in 1977, I can recall Jackson Browne talking about Running On Empty, and how much he enjoyed the concept of putting out a live album of all new material. While the songs on this record are not new, they sound so, stripped down to a voice and guitar or keyboard. From his first release in '72, Jackson has been one of our most literate singer/songwriters, and on this collection of songs tapped from his recent solo/acoustic tour, his writing skills could not be more evident. These performances reveal an artist of rare talent, compassion and conviction. As great as he's always been, this may be Jackson Browne at his best: alone and fully revealed, a mature artist revisiting a trail he helped to blaze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating","review":"Like some of the other people who have reviewed this CD, I went to see JB perform during his live acoustic tour. I think the music on this recording is very true to that experience. You get a really good sense of what it was like to be there. More importantly, I think this CD gives you an idea of what the core of each song is, without the extra instrumentation and added background vocals. You feel like you are hearing the songs as they were written. Whether this is true or not is, of course, impossible for me to say, but you do get new insights by listening to this wonderful and intimate CD. This one is a must for JB fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singular Solo effort","review":"A singer, a guitar, and a piano. Live, intimate, and breathtakingly beautiful. Jackson Browne has long possessed one of the most purest voices in rock n roll and this disc showcases the beauty of not only that voice, but of the music and lyrics he has written. When I saw that this disc included \\"For A Dancer\\", I had to have it. For me it is a personally wrenching song that reminds me of a long ago love, a dancer who committed suicide at the age of 22. This version brought tears to my eyes.Other standout cuts include \\"For Everyman\\", \\"The Pretender\\", \\"The Barricades of Heaven\\" , \\"Fountain of Sorrow\\" and \\"The Birds of St. Marks\\". This is not a light album. He has always been a writer who can make a dark song beautiful, and that is what he has done here. This is a hauntingly personal, beautiful, nakedly honest and intimate disc.The best news is that this is titled Vol 1. May there be many more to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This CD is a must have for all Jackson Browne fans. \\"Solo Acoustic\\" starts out just like the KC show I attended. The lights went down and a second later JB walked out, picked up a guitar and started playing one of my favorites, \\"The Barricades of Heaven\\". The audience on this recording is quiet and respectful, unlike the crowd in KC which was loud and obnoxious.The songs on this CD are drawn from every decade of Jackson's catalogue of 30+ years, including a previously unreleased track, the haunting \\"The Birds of St. Marks\\". Jackson is in fine voice here as he accompanies himself on guitar or piano, and the CD includes some delightful self-depricating stage banter. My favorite tune here is \\"Lives in the Balance\\", a song with lyrics as relevent today as they were 17 years ago when another war-making Republican was president.My only gripe is, it could have been longer, but I plan to savor this one while I eagerly await Volume 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I am 19 years old and a huge Jackson Browne fan, His first album and Late for the sky are among my favorite albums of all time. When i heard of a new cd coming out i was thrilled, and now thats its out i am not disapointed. This is a beautiful and moving cd. If you like jackson browne in the studio you'll love him live. Great album and i'll be waiting for volume 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative and Inspiring","review":"I now realize the right way to listen to Jackson Browne. Just his voice and a guitar or piano. For 40 years he has written and performed powerful songs and anthems, and whether you agree or disagree with his political views, he sings every lyric with conviction. His rendition of 'Looking East' is worth getting the entire CD, or just download that song. You will be transformed in that 5 and a half minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Springsteen for intellectuals","review":"Awesome CD. Excellent songs, voice, and sound. The acoustic setup takes away most of the 'retro' feel that comes with the original recordings and the result is a much more contemporary sounding collection of pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"jackson browne fan","review":"The Solo Acoustic vol. 1 cd makes me anxious for vol.2. Delightful low key venue and great acoustic versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music with a conscience","review":"Solo Acoustic, Vol.What an amazingly brilliant album. The funny intros are also an insightful look at the soul of a popular singer, and the talent displayed on this CD just floored me. I live in Australia, and its impossible to find down here, sadly, so of course, go to Amazon. Hey Jackson, good luck to you and David on the Chinese version.If there were a six star rating, this is one for me. Best of his many albums.

In her writing debut, Wanza McInnis weaves an in-your-face tale of a group of young people struggling to learn the truth about themselves, their relationships and Jesus Christ. If you're looking for some goody-goody Christian fiction, you won't find it here--Dominick Willis, the minister of music has a main girlfriend, an undercover girlfriend and now he wants to marry Ebony Johnson, up-and-coming youth minister.As Dom lies and fronts to get what he wants, both he and Eb have to analyze their Christian walk. Is having a man worth scandalizing your good name? Is having the woman you want worth giving up your comfortable, pretty-on-the-outside relationship?Read Sunday Morning and find out . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GO GIRL! TELL IT LIKE IT REALLY IS!!","review":"THIS BOOK IS VERY INSPIRING TO ME, BECAUSE IT GIVES ME A DIFFERENT INSIGHT OF WHAT OTHERS THINK AND FEEL ABOUT THEIR CHRISTIAN LIFE. SUNDAY MORNING GAVE ME MOTIVATION TO GET MY LIFE BACK ON TRACK. I HAD A LOT OF IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CHARACTER EBONY JOHNSON. IT'S DEFINITELY A BOOK THAT I BELIEVE EVERY CHRISTIAN WILL ENJOY READING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk About Keeping it Real?","review":"This girl has hit the nail on the head with grace. I have never read anything like this. It let's you see church from the darkside but yet encourages you stay there if you're in it and get in it if you are not. There are so many \\"Ebony Johnson's\\" out there needing to read this book. Pass it along. It's easy reading and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Sure makes church life seem like \\"real life\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice really captures the spirit of a dying empire.","review":"Shute has a fluid writing style, and keeps the reader moving along, but to what purpose? It is such a period piece, celebrating the stiff upper lip to the nth-degree. Disparaging those silly women on the death march who weakly gave into showing their suffering. The good children never whimpered once Mother is laid to her final rest. This book is a touchstone for understanding the romance of the British middle classes at mid-century. It perfectly details the arrogance of the Great White conqueror."},{"rating":"1","title":"It brought me to tears- of boredom","review":"As the title says above, it was so boring I'm amazed i even finished reading the book without falling into a Coma. In fact, the only reason I read this book was for an english assignment, and have regreted it ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous","review":"Although this book has its interesting points, all value is totally washed away by the drudgery of facts completely insignificant to the story. It drags on about very boring things that have absolutely no relevance (how good she is at making shoes, etc). The romance is quite artifical also, as Joe and Jean knew each other in the war for a very short time. Undying love as shown in the book cannot convincingly develop in this short span. There is no chemistry between these characters; they are in love with the symbolism that the other provides. Painful to read, utter dribble. As I said, its has good points, but by the time the book was over I wanted to shoot myself from boredom. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Town like Alice","review":"I first saw this on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS and loved it. I then listened to it on tape and it was very true to the production. It is one of the classic love stories of our time. It gives Rhett and Scarlett a run for the money. A true classic and probably my favorite love story. It has all the elements, love, passion, war, separation and never disappoints. I can not recommend it any higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top ten favorites","review":"I was so pleased that when I searched for this book there was a Kindle version. I have probably read this book about 10 times during my life and everytime it is a pleasure. Sadness and joy and romance and a little unrequited love all wrapped up in a very well told story. The march through Malaysia is a riveting account. Jean is a complex character who does not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not judge a cover....","review":"I ordered this copy of \\"Alice\\" because of it's unusual cover....

I have never experienced this before -"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read!","review":"I am a reader; I devour books. A Town Like Alice is one of my very favorites. I come back to it time and again, whenever I need to lose myself in the heat of Malaysia or the dust of Australia. This book is so well written that I can feel the stones in the road as Jean marches along with the other women in their \\"Death March\\". I can feel the despair she feels when she believes Joe to be dead and her intense joy when she discovers that he is still alive. The story is timeless. My mother-in-law,who was a bride during World War II, first introduced me to this book saying that it was her all time favorite, and even though I came of age in the 70's, the book speaks to me as well. Its message of love's survival in the face of desperate odds gives us all a sense of hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my word, this is a wonderful book!","review":"This is a beautifully written story, cleverly and very poignantly told from the point of view of a 70-something man - a careful, considerate London solicitor who is the trustee (with broad discretionary powers) of a will that leaves a considerable sum of money (but not a lump sum, due to the conditions of the will) to a young woman.Jean Paget is that young woman, and she is an extraordinary person, making her story very compelling reading.The weaving of the threads of her life - her WWII experiences as a prisoner of the Japanese in Malaya; her fateful encounter with Australian Joe Harmon; the inheritance that allows her to leave the mundane working world; her interaction with solicitor Noel Strachan; and her search for her true destiny - is done in the most masterful way.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is deeply satisfying reading. It is everything a novel should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, Inspiring Town Like Alice","review":"A few books are worth reading and re-reading. This is one. My copy was worn out so I bought another. I have loaned or given it to many friends, each who have responded as I did. A timeless story of determination, dignity, and inspiration, A Town Like Alice makes life easier to live now. Granted, the horror and pain were based on a real historical account. But the hope and love unfold in such a way that they flow into today, as a calming relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic will they- won't they tale with a nice twist.","review":"This book opens in Malaysia during WW2, with descriptions based on Shute's own experiences in Indonesia during the war. In a chance encounter an English Girl and an Australian soldier meet and feel something special exists between them.After the war, each attempts to contact the other. They travel the world to find out if their memories of that defining moment are real, or were a personal illusion, not held by the other person.A real heart rending tale of true romance set in a passionate backdrop of war and the aftermath, and the wild spaces of central Australia. This is not just an Australian classic, it is a classic! A relly good memorable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is it so rare to meet a good person in a novel anymore?","review":"I think _A Town Like Alice_ is near the top of my all-time favorite book list, too (along with _To Kill a Mockingbird_ and _The Catcher in the Rye_). What strikes me about it and many of Shute's books is the quiet heroism of its characters. Good, strong people who work hard at improving the world and shine through the pages with a commonsense morality and unconscious courage. I proselytize this book heavily, picking it up whenever I'm at a used book store and passing it along. The whole narrator device is a bit off-putting at first (my sister-in-law and brother listened to it on tape and almost gave up near the beginning), but the book picks up speed if you keep with it (my sister-in-law and brother ended up LOVING it). The video is also good--I'm buying that today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story telling","review":"I'm always in search of the next read. I kept seeing A Town Like Alice on favorite books' lists, so I gave it a shot. It is good, especially the story telling. Some of the characters started to wear on me by the end of the story, like the anal English attorney, but maybe they were meant to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be patient after page 235!","review":"When it comes to WW II, I have no idea about the troubles that happened in Asia. The story was very different and interesting to me. I read up to page ~ 235 very fast. I did not even sleep, it was so engrossing. But after page 235, there is almost nothing about the romance, it is only about stuff that have absolutely no relevance. I read the rest in 2 or 3 days, it was so boring. At that point, I only wanted to finish the book. I can't believe how such a nice story turned into a nightmare.I don't agree that the description of Japanese soldiers is racist. It is so obvious that the author is careful and emphasizes how humane they really are by repeating \\"doing their best\\" and \\"carrying children\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both the book and the movie..","review":"Nevil Shute writes in such a fashion that it would do well on required reading for students. So historically graphic of a terrible time in our world. I would recommend reading the book before seeing the movie because the Australian and British accents are so strong, they are hard to understand; however, knowing the storyline helps understand the dialect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Town Like Alice","review":"Although I've read this book heaps before, I still enjoyed it on the Kindle. Recommended as a good read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can this be called boring?","review":"I came across this book by accident, never having heard of it before. I just loved it. I don't think it is totally unreal, that Joe and Jean fell in love. I have read quite a few unrealistic 'undying love' scenarios, and this wasn't one of them. I thought it was stupid the way the film (at least one of them) didn't talk about building up a town like Alice at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, no knockout ending","review":"This book caught my attention cos part of the story is set in my country. However, I did not finish reading it. Like reviewers Jean and Belle, I found the beginning and middle interesting but there was no -- to borrow a term from James Scott Bell -- \\"knockout ending.\\" After Jean and Joe met in Australia, the pace started to bog down. Also, I'm puzzled how a London typist can fall in love with a cattle station manager -- considering not only the differences in their backgrounds but also the limited time they had spent together while being prisoners of the Japanese. The author also used several fictitious towns in Malaysia which puts off Malaysian readers like me. He should have consulted a map to bring more reality to the march by Jean and the other women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the mini series, loved the book more.","review":"The book filled in details that, of course, TV shows or movies can't due to time restraints. I also preferred what happened in the book to the films trumped up dramatic moments. A nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Town like Alice","review":"The book started by holding your interest. Never lost that quality. I thoroughly enjoyed the book all the way to the end.Well written, no swearing or sexual context. Good Book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Town Like Alice - Timeless","review":"Read this book the first time probably 30 years ago. My Mom got me reading many of Nevil Shute's novels. I'm re-reading it and it still is a wonderful story. I love Nevil Shute's down-to-earth writing style. Even though this book was written in 1950, it is truly timeless. His characters tend to be very ordinary people, doing very extraordinary things. Mainly set in Britain and Australia. A Town Like Alice was also made into a miniseries in 1981 and part of Masterpiece Theatre. Nevil Shute's other profession was an aeronautical engineer.

Pick up a Nevil Shute novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scattered Attentions","review":"Mr. Parmet's version of the Nixon biography was very much scattered in many different directions. I did find the story of Richard Nixon quite interesting - when he bothered to talk about it. The course of the book was slow going to start with. Add in the fact there was 2/3 of too much in-depth information not necessary to the bi-line, to only 1/3 about the man himself. I found myself often losing focus throughout the book. My opinion is there has got to be a better Nixon biography out there to read, and my advice would be to find it. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better Nixon biographies","review":"I consider this biography to be a disappointment. It is not a \\"true\\" catalogue of Nixon's life nor is it an interpretation of his presidency. Nor is it a portrait of \\"Nixon's America\\" as the title implies. Whatever this book is, it will not enlighten the reader about who Richard Nixon was or his term in office. There has to be a better book on this subject. I hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caresses my 17 Gen 4 like a diaper on a baby's butt","review":"The straps were not fun to try and adjust but once that process was over it fit well.

Reading through the book nowadays brings back memories of the Bulls and Jordan before they won a title. I recommend that all Jordan and Bulls fans read this book to learn what the infamous \\"Jordan Rules\\" are all about. This book tells a lot more of what happened in the 1990-91 to all members of the Bulls, not just Jordan. You get a look into a young Scottie Pippen's life, and learn where Phil Jackson and the rest came from. You'll feel sympathy for Cartwright and Paxson, and you'd wish Krause never had anything to do with the Bulls. I know that some parts of this book are exaggerated, but it still brings us the closest to the greatest athlete to ever walk this earth. Since it doesn't look like Michael is coming back this year, this may be as close as you'll ever get to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!!!!!!!","review":"If you are a Jordan's fan - this is the book for you!

Kilcher's reading of Chief Joseph is murdered on this DVD for a better version see the link on my website [...] links to a youtube from Sundance 2009.There are huge topics watered down or omitted by this presentation. Where is Haymarket ? Where is Alexander Berkman? Why is Ellsberg included ? So many other thoughts ran through my head watching this.

The matcha is a deep green color and had a very fine grain, there was hardly a difference between this and ridiculously expensive \\"ceremonial grade\\" matcha. This matcha, as long as it is properly sifted and mixed properly, will make beautiful drinks.I will definitely be ordering more of this when I run out but that won't be for a while- I ordered the 8oz bag. :)I can't wait to make matcha sugar cookies, and mocha cupcakes with matcha frosting.

I purchased this to drink every morning and to use in cooking and frappuccinos.

The movie starts off amiably enough with a slapstick fight scene, and our wannabes try to muscle in with Captain Amazing, a corporate-sponsored superhero(this gives the filmmakers a chance to advertise . . .). But after then, the jokes are so lame and this movie is done with such glumness that the cast look positively embarassed and depressed throughout. Any laughs engendered by this turkey are at it rather than with it. However it gets two stars as it is such chronic trash it is somehow entertaining, a bit like HOWARD THE DUCK from 1986(remember THAT! ). And to think LAWRENCE GORDON, the man behind EXECUTIVE DECISION and the DIE HARD movies produced this nonsense. I suppose in a few years it'll become a cult classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just about the worst film ever made","review":"This has got to be the worst movie ever made. Plenty of money and talent in a film dubbed as a comedy. Timing was abysmal.

Do not confuse a hilarious storyline with a poorly executed film. If you like dry humor, great... but the preview implied drop-dead hilarity and the film delivered the deadest dead-pan, poorly timed jokes on record.If you're really super drunk, the movie is probably pretty funny, but if you're laughing out loud during this film, I've got to wonder... what other movies have you seen in your life? If you're one who thinks \\"Dumb & Dumber,\\" \\"Me, Myself & Irene\\" and \\"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\\" are the best comedies ever made, then this film should be a hoot.If you've seen good parodies like \\"George Lucas in Love\\" or \\"Spaceballs,\\" however and \\"got the joke,\\" then this movie will require a labotomy to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Movie","review":"Gotta love a Super Hero movie that doesn't take itself seriously.

Its chock full of super silliness but also retains a surprising human dimension. The not so super heroes have a home life at odds with their calling, and you have to admire the dedication of the men and women who battle crime armed with no real powers what-so-ever! Geoffrey Rush is hilarious as Casanova Frankenstein (surely the silliest villain name ever) and celebrity cameos pop up everywhere. With such a high quality cast, this should have been a huge film, but it wasn't. It probably isn't consistently funny enough for the mainstream, which is a shame. This film is one of my Saturday night beer films, and makes a nice double bill with anything featuring Jay and Silent Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the smartest humor ever","review":"I think one reason why this movie gets mixed reviews is the level of humor. It can be very dry and deep and I'm not sure the average movie-goer is likely to catch all the jokes on the first run. Multiple viewings often lead to deeper enjoyment. I'll provide just one example of a joke in the movie that tends to go over most heads but that I find brilliant and hilarious:While searching for more super heroes to add to their team, the budding Mystery Men run through a list of current crime-fighters.\\"We could get ...

Maybe not quite a four, but fun.","review":"Mystery Men is an amusing movie, and well worth watching. Sure, it has a semi-schmaltzy ending. But, the concept is fun; the performances are spot on; and the story is inventive and silly. William Macy plays the deadpan \\"Shoveller,\\" a man who wields a shovel like D'Artagnon with his blade; Paul Reubens, as the spleen, has nuclear-power flatulence; Ben Stiller is Furious--not strong, just furious; etc. They must rise to the supreme challenge after the reigning superhero, a corporate-sponsored, Ken Doll-esque Greg Kinnear, gets vaporized by one of the good guys. Geoffrey Rush, as the villain, Casanova Frankenstein, puts his hi-tech disco powers to work on a plan of mass destruction. Can six quasi-heroes defeat him relying strictly on non-lethal weapons--like a blame thrower and tornado in a can--and flying silverware?Pleasant fun and ripe for a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Laughed from time-to-time.

In Champion City, Captain Amazing is losing sponsers as all the bad guys are locked away. He needs the sponsers back, so he appeals to the parole board to let out his foe Casanova Frankstein. However Captain Amazing is set-up and held in Frankenstein castle as a prisoner. So here comes the Mystery Men - Mr.Furious who couldn't beat his way out of a wet paper bag. Spleen who has Superman power flatulence. The Shovler is level-headed family man out prove his wife wrong about his crime fighting ability. The Bowler chick who has dear dad's skull inside a custom made bowling ball....Like Mighty Mouse they're out too save the day and rescue Captain Amazing.I found the movie too corny and stupid.

A group of motley 'superheros' with useless powers complete with Batman-like sound effects and settings. Add a great cast and you have all the ingredients, right? Wrong - a hundred times wrong. You still need a decent script and director, folks, and 'MM' has neither.One reviewer boldly pointed out that those giving Mystery Men bad reviews can't see the movie for the superhero spoof that it is. That's not it - it's simply not a funny or entertaining flick no matter how you look at it. Don't get me wrong - the movie will provide laughs for the 13 and under group.

I warn anyone interested in renting or buying this to think again. On paper, maybe it seemed like a good idea. Another high concept Hollywood movie gone wrong. Misfit superheroes attempt to rescue Captain Amazing, battle disco-loving bad guys, and try and save the city from Casanova Frankenstein (Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush!). The Mystery Men are guys with lame special powers such as fork-throwing and farting. The problem with \\"Mystery Men\\" is that it isn't funny or exciting. It parodies the Batman series (which didn't take itself seriously anyway), but doesn't contain any laughs or action scenes worth watching. The creators of this film concentrated on making it look good, hired a good cast, and then did nothing else. \\"Mystery Men\\" is a two-plus hour endurance test.

Where did they get the title Mystery Men to begin with? There is nothing mysterious about them at all. So a person can aim, and fart on command, and another thinks he can become invisible.

It has good direction and set design, and decent performances, but far, far too few funny bits to support it's running time. Perhaps if you watch the movie in 30 minute segments it won't be so bad but if you do it all in one sitting you will be bored. There are definitely some entertaining parts but they are buried under lots of dull set-up.

It would be interesting to find the original script online and check out the differences.MYSTERY MEN has a cool idea and a great cast.

It is NOT a superhero film, it is a SPOOF of superhero films... so reviewer complaints about things like plot holes and unbelievable characters are completely missing the point. The script definitely could have been stronger, and there are quite a few dry spots, but they're made up for by very strong performances from the main actors -- Hank Azaria could get laughs if he were reading from a phone book (he voiced the little bat sidekick in 'Anastasia', certainly one of the funniest animated characters ever). If you enjoy the Ben Stiller/Janeane Garofalo cynical-outsider comedy style, you will not be wasting your time on this movie, I promise. If the writers had concentrated on that angle and left out the sophomoric slapstick and bodily-emission humor, the result would have been much funnier, but you can't have everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst movie I've ever seen....","review":"...but close.Sorry to all those people who found this an entertaining movie, but I thought it was a big pile of steaming poo.Saying that, I have watched it twice.

It struck me that they wanted to make a campy movie, but also wanted a serious movie, and in that they fail. The script and director look like they are trying to strive for a live action film a la \\"The Tick\\" cartoon series, but they wanted a plot under it all that is more like \\"Batman\\".

The comedy fell into two ballparks, blatantly obvious slapstick and subtle comedy thats so subtle its not even there. Theres one high point though, and thats the nonsical and nihilistic philosopher The Sphinx. His cliched sayings are the biggest and only laughs in the whole film. The quality of the DVD transfer is very high, and the added extra are quite varied (deleted scenes, origin of chars etc...).

I use Nikon lenses, and all of them have circular polarizers, and admittedly most are Nikon polarizers, and all will allow the lens cap to fit over them. After 28 years using polarizers on all my lenses I had yet to run across one which would not accept the lens cap. Which means that a person has to remove the polarizer to replace the lens cap.... not amusing out in the field, or anywhere for that matter. The attributes of the thing seem excellent - appearance, construction, optical quality, value - all good. But not accepting the lens cap is a deal breaker for me. If you only use a polarizer occasionally, I suppose you wouldn't be bothered by this, but I keep them attached to my lenses nearly 100% of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"'The Wedding Bargain' was my first Alexander book and I was engrossed from about the first page.

The book did have some information, but for the most part it was outdated and very biased. Being a new mom and wanting to find a single unbiased informative source for cloth diapering this was definitely not it.Luckily when I ordered this title I also purchased a instructional diaper DVD, Everything Cloth Diaper. This product was great because it covered different types of cloth diapers and brands so you could see all the diverse options. I think the best part was all the instructions on diaper folds. Actually watching someone do it in front of you as opposed to trying to follow drawings made the whole process alot less frustrating. If you want to purchase this book it does have some helpful info, but overall I enjoyed the DVD much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not overly impressed.","review":"I received a copy of \\"Diaper Changes\\" and found it to be totally biased against mothers like myself who still choose to cloth diaper the (old-fashioned) way meaning folding, pins, and rubber pants.

Since the unit is suspended by rubber bushings the ground has to be internal to the harness and without it you get nothing from the unit. You'd think A-1 might spend a couple of bucks on the packaging considering the $135+ retail price.

Kind of technical -- not greatly impressive guitar work and no insane schredding, but the band holds down a groove very well and manages to keep the songs very very interesting with some chilling riffs and melodies. Sometimes they remind me of In Flames, at other times Amon Amarth.The vocals remind me a little of early soilwork, which is a good thing. I usually cannot stand growling vocals through an entire CD, but this guy's voice rides along with the instruments perfectly.I would recommend downloading the MP3 of their website first to see if this is your type of music.

Three men set out to make a name for themselves by making a radio show. Their misadventures and drama makes up the bulk of the story. The movie's good. After some consideration, I thought about strange parallels between Banana Club and Douglas Coupland's _Microserfs_ (also a good read, by the way). Banana Club is, above most else, a comedy, and should be treated as such. I liked the movie: I found it entertaining and (occasionally) enlightening. I have but one thing against Banana Club: at times, it seems too sappy. That minor nit aside, if you want to see a slice of Chinese city-culture and have a few laughs at the same time, give this movie a go.

They are the product of what I have always called \\"The Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome.\\" These reviewers are simply afraid of perhaps revealing a lack of erudition or understanding if they say that Berkoff's treatment of Wilde's SALOME is just asinine. I am an actor with approximately 160 plays and musicals under my belt in addition to some 80 opera productions, and from both the standpoint of the performer and the viewer I feel quite confident in saying that this production is utter drivel.

I love the workout. I wanted to do it at home also and relied on reviews to choose a video. The people who raved about this one must be friends with Hilary Burnett. She rushes through every exercise and does not give instructions on how or what to do. The viewer is supposed to just follow, I guess. I was able to follow the exercises just because I know what I am doing but would not have had a clue otherwise except to try to follow her fast moves and changes with no instruction. I have heard good things about Jennifer Kries and Moira Stott-I think I will ditch this video and try theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This video was supposed to be levels 1 & 2 but I must be at level -5. I found that it is mostly watching her do her thing and telling you virtualy nothing. You have to be Gumby to be able to do her stretches. I will have to limber up quite a bit more before I can find this video useful, and it is impossible to watch the screen and do everything she is doing at the same time! Anyway, its not for me, or anyone who is just begining Pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I didn't enjoy this tape at all.

The beginning part was okay and necessary, but the ending stretching thing was stupid.

The production quality is poor (filmed in the author's living room)and the number of exercises showcased is scant at best.

It has a Berserker class and a Runecaster class, both interesting Warrior classes. There is also a half-troll race. AD&D is well suited to a Viking style campaign, and this resource is better presented than any of the other HR series. I doubt you'd have any trouble converting this to either 1st or 3rd edition (though as I'm writing this, 3rd ed. is still a few months away). Just remember, this is a game resource, not a real historical reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely rises from the muck of obscurity","review":"This is not a good book. If you want to govern a Viking-esque campaign, I would advise you to get several books on Norse history and literature, but not this God-awful thing. The culture is presented in such a quaint way that unless I knew that the mediocrity was TSR's fault, I could swear that the Vikings led the most tedious lives in the world. The rune magic system is unwieldy and repulsive ( indeed, the only time I remember it being called upon is the fact that it is used by the Ice Linnorm dragons from the First Annual Compendium Appendix).

I couldn't help the overall feeling that the heroine just wasn't good enough for the hero. I still felt that way at the end of the book as well. There was just too deep a chasm between the two. He was patient, mature, responsible and understanding. Though he wasn't the most intuitive, he was sensitive. She, however, was stubborn, self-absorbed and had a ridiculously awful habit of not listening. She literally steamrolled right over-top of him trying to talk many times in the book.

I just hate it when she redoes the same old story again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but feels more like a Howard imitation than a Tanith Lee book","review":"This book begins like a Tanith Lee book, with many mysterious characters stabbing each other in the back. It even gets better once Rehgor grows up and starts serving his half-brother (unknowing) who wants to destroy Rehgor's people, but somewhere in the middle it begins to fade into a standard sword and sorcery fantasy. And while those are fun, there's only one Robert Howard.However there are enough Lee elements to this book to keep her diehard readers entertained. It's just a little too derivative to recommend wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books I've ever laid eyes on -- I tore it to pieces","review":"Usually I love Tanith Lee books. So when this book started out with a rape scene, I kept reading, thinking it would get better. But not long after that was another rape scene, and then another, with different characters. Rape is the worst thing you can do to a human being, and while I think it is permissable to have it occur in a story, it is not at all okay to use it as sex scenes and glorify it. I became so furious with the book that I ripped it to shreds.I'm really appalled that Tanith would write such a disgusting and perverted book -- but she has written other books that are amazingly wonderful, so don't let this review turn you off of her writing completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recalling Historic Cunard Liners","review":"As a source of both information and rare photographs, few books can equal Picture History of the Cunard Line. This book includes many little known facts about some of the most famous ships in maritime history. Yet,while it recalls the careers of the better known Cunarders,it also addresses many of the Companies less remembered ships. The great Aquitania who's lengthy term of service included duties throughout both World Wars is finally given the attention it deserves. Virtually all of the companies intermediate steamers are reviewed as well. Because this book encompasses so many of Cunards' ships; and because it presents over 180 of the best photographs ever published on this subject, it should be a treasured addition to any collection. I highly recommend it to all readers particularly those with just a general interest in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"Thank you for this wonderful, wonderful book.

I wouldn't buy another, I don't think much of this coffee maker.It's a messy machine to use. The clean up of the upper chamber is just a pain in the butt. That would be okay, I guess, but it doesn't make good coffee and wastes a lot of grounds. The coffee it brews is weak and thin. For me to get a decent cup of coffee, it takes 7 coffee measures (about 7 tablespoons) to get anything out of a full pot of coffee.It's very entertaining to watch, tho. And I find that if I pre-wet the grounds with a mug of very hot water, it does improve the taste of the coffee.

The upper bowl is easy to keep clean from coffee residue, how ever the bottom bowl is a NIGHTMARE to clean since some of the electricalis concealed in it. My small hand will not fit thru the lip opening to cleanse the bowl with ease, coffee residue and soap suds catch under the lip, coffee residue seeps between the area where the bowl is attached to the part of the heat unit.Needs to go back to the drawing board to come up with an immersible carafeThe only redeeming quality is a Great cup of coffee, I no longer use my Bodum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my God?!","review":"I plugged it in and followed the instructions and it erupted coffee and grounds through the vents all over the counter!

And, a few minutes after brewing I clean the unit by hand and never in the dishwasher! I am worried about two things: 1) Warranty: I bought the unit on EBAY and there is no \\"a guarantee certificate must be completely filled out by the seller at time of purchase\\" and no sales receipt of any kind 2) The filter needs changed every three months per instructions but an extra one is not included so where the heck am I going to get a new one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful coffee, easy to clean, fun to watch, a little expensive","review":"My Bodum Santos Mini Coffee maker is fast brewing, easy to use and clean, and fun to watch it brew. It has a semi-permanent nylon filter that can be removed for cleaning if you want - but I leave mine in during cleaning. I simply go to over to the sink and rinse out the upper part of the Santos which holds the grounds and quickly wipe the sides with a sponge. Time to completion of cleaning, 20 to 30 seconds at most. The 30 second cleaning is well worth the quality of coffee produced. I found the Mini produces about 3 to 4 normally large cups of coffee at most. Someone must be using really small coffee cups for them to list this as a 5 cup coffee maker (all coffee makers over rate their capacity though)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality!","review":"The On/Off switch broke after two months as well as one side of the hinge for the lid. We prefer the flavor of the coffee from vacuum brewing versus drip or French press but have been disappointed with the quality and design of the Bodum unit.

We have been quite disappointed with the unit basically wearing out after three months of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for money","review":"I have had a mini-Bodum for about 5 years. It brews an excellent pot of coffee--although I find the measure spoon (1 measure per cup) is too strong for my taste--I use about 1/3 less. (I get the best results with Starbucks Verona coffee ground on no. 5 setting.)Yes, the machine will break eventually--I had to replace the nylon filter after 4 years, and finally the rubber vacuum seal failed on the original pot, so I bought a new unit. Never had problems with the heating unit. But what do you expect? It's made of plastic. For $60 I can afford to replace the unit every 4-5 years.Bottom line, its better than drip coffee, and a whole lot cheaper than buying an automatic espresso machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Bother","review":"Where do I start. The terrible customer service at Santos or the short life of the coffee maker. This unit is very hard to clean. The coffee pot has a small opening and can only be rinsed out. You can't submerge it because of the electrical connection to the base. My unit only lasted bout 5 months and when I called Santos to explain that it just quit working, they told be that it was too bad (basically). So as the consumer story goes, I will never purchase a Santos product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Bought this pot with high expectations and was very disapointed.

If you're one of the thousands of people who have neighbors over for coffee and conversation it is sure to spark discussion for a minute or two, but it stops there. There are a few shortcomings to this. The coffee it makes is ok, not great, quite frankly other ones I've owned including Krups, Black and Decker and Cuisinart make better cups of coffee. The Bodum doesn't burn your coffee because it shuts off after about 15 minutes, but then how do you keep what's left hot? You need to use a separate insulated carafe. Next problem is cleaning it. You need a bottle brush and you have to be very careful not to scratch the clear plastic pot not to mention you can't get the bottom wet because of the metal contacts to the heating element. For the money, you are better off buying a full featured coffee maker with an insulated carafe like I did. This one is just a gimmick."},{"rating":"2","title":"After a year of use for my 12 cup machine","review":"Yes, it's true, the machine makes excellent coffee.The warmer does a great job of holding the coffeee for several hours without ruining it.It's fun to watch it's volcanic show in action.Distractors are:The need to replace the nylon filter ($4.50 ea.) every 5 months or so when a small tear unexpectedly allows grounds to leak into your coffee.For a satisfactory strength of coffee I have to use a lot more coffee than I used to. Almost double the amount of my drip system !Finer grinds leave too much sediment in the finished brew.You must make at least 6 cups of coffee minimum in the full size unit.But far worse is that after a year, leaks have developed in the base, which means it's gonna have to be replaced soon. I'll be checking on the warranty next week .Still, I like it enough to re-invest in a mini Santos, hoping the quality of manufacture has improved in the base, and that I can use less coffee with the smaller unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good recipes, lame advice","review":"I got a few great recipes from this book but other than that I found the advice to be unhelpful and lame.

Where?","review":"I must admit I dislike calling this work a real performance since it is not more than a series of MIDI sequences (there are many other sequences - and better - in the world!).Interpretation of the great \\"Art of the Fugue\\" here is sometimes poetic; the sound is nice, not excellent, and often the Author falls into something ridicolous, such as too much staccato at the end of Contrapuncto I after a lot of well balanced phrasings; or when he marks each theme with a lot of flourishes which have no sense in piano music, above all in the Disklavier music, etc.But the biggest mistake is to compare these \\"performances\\" with the Glenn Gould ones (see from the web). Also these are too metrical, too sequenced, too false. Sorry; and Gould was not a machine as the Author thinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinionated and inaccurate.

My experience was similar to that of a previous reviewer, the arm with the blades fell off the axle and was therefore useless. I understand an occasional defect, but the worst part was Bodum's customer service. They very rudely informed me that they weren't interested in hearing from me unless I had a receipt. I asked, \\"Are you telling me that most people actually save their receipts when they buy a coffee grinder?\\", to which they curtly replied, \\"Yes, everybody else does\\". I can't believe that this is true, and I think they should stand behind their product a little better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!

It is also difficult to consistently get a reliable grind. After about a year of use the button stopped working so it had to be turned on and off by unplugging it. Overall the design of this type of coffee grinder is not ideal. I would suggest that regular coffee drinkers get a burr type grinder with a hopper and grind storage box."},{"rating":"1","title":"grinds evenly but... blade came off after minimal use","review":"I bought this grinder on the recommendation of a coffee web site who claimed it ground more evenly than the Braun. First the pluses. It does grind more evenly. The cord also wraps nicely beneath the base in a nice bit of engineering.Now for the negatives compared to the Braun: 1) much louder, 2) awkward shape to hold (\\"art for art's sake\\"), 3) takes longer to grind, 4) lid too shallow to hold ground coffee ; creates much more mess.But the main reason for this review is about the build quality. I was stunned to see that the blade came loose from the shaft after barely any use! We grind maybe four cups a day of beans and within a couple months the blade started to be loose. I'm not sure what went wrong, maybe the piece situated right under the blade, which seems to have be gone and disintegrated. Was this just a rotten apple in a good bunch? All I can say is my old Braun is still going strong after ten years of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible grinder","review":"It works, but barely. Doesn't grind well. Has an unusually short cord that requires unplugging to empty every time. I am going to replace this with a Krups which I've owned in the past and always worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinder lid arrived broken","review":"The grinder itself is fine but the plastic lid was crumbling when I took it out of the box, which unfortunately was after the return period expired. So there are chips of plastic missing along the bottom of the lid. You'd think a company would want to look at such a thing to improve their product. I'd opt for a grinder with rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Curves, Function Does Not Follow","review":"It looks nice but:1) The motor doesn't really hold up, and a burning electrical smell is common after minimal use (not that you are supposed to grind for more than 20 - 30 seconds at a time, still it has problems)2) The lid is useless as a storage or transfer container. By accident I often move the grinds to the lid thinking that I'll scoop from here, only to have it overflow.3) The plastic is of poor quality. 1 of 3 of these started cracking like crazy.4) For the price you can do much better, if you have to get this style of grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice","review":"So, got this one at whole foods.I was in a hurry to make me a coffee I guess.The button is now permanently stuck on \\"on\\".

It grinds coffee reasonably, though not entirely evenly in all circumstances.About a year after I got this grinder, I dropped the lid and it nearly shattered, although the plastic still held together well enough for the grinder to function. Over the years, it's gradually lost a few more shards of plastic, and finally it reached the point where I was ready to replace the entire thing. Sadly, neither Amazon nor the Bodum website sell replacement lids.And so, I thought, that was that.I emailed Bodum's customer service department in search of somewhere I could buy a new lid. Within a few hours, I'd heard from a CS representative who told me that, while Bodum doesn't sell replacement lids, they would happily send me a new one free of charge. How awesome is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Go Elsewhere","review":"I don't normally write reviews, but I feel so strongly about this coffee grinder, that I will.I had this coffee grinder for a year. I used it occasionally, as I sometimes would be lazy and use pre-ground. A year into having this thing, it's broken. Just off the top there.Next up, this thing is a gigantic pain to clean. There are two crevices inside of it which collect coffee grinds. They're too small for a normal dishrag, so you end up having to use a Q-Tip or some other small device to clean. Let me tell you, that is exactly what I want to do in the morning after making myself a cup of coffee.Lastly, the cord placement is at the bottom of the grinder and you have to pull very hard to get the cord to come out and stretch.Overall, this is a horrible product and I would advise against purchasing it for any reason besides wasting your money and aggravating yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this coffee grinder from Whole Foods and had it for about 2 years. It started to making this crackle/pop noise. Then one day it just died. The blade appeared to be broken off. I ran out and bought another one because I needed coffee immediately. The second one I bought lasted just under 6 months. And did the same exact thing. And is now useless. I didn't think I would need to save the receipt so I can't bring it back.I've also had similar experiences as others.*I have to shake the maker to get a consistent grind*It only grinds enough for 8 cups*The tip comes off too easily.

Removing the coffee requires a tiny spoon or a brush, and even then is incomplete, leaving dregs in the grinder to turn rancid and spoil the flavor of future coffee, and a mess on the counter. I've used several less expensive models that were lots less trouble. Also, the body of the grinder is too fat to pick up securely with one hand, creating a tendency to drop it and make an even bigger mess. It looks like very little thought went into this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, poor materials.","review":"I purchased this coffee grinder in July of 2003. I love the design and the color matches our other teal accented kitchen items perfectly. It does a decent job of ginding coffee, but after only 5 months, of once a day use, it started to develop vertical stress cracks in the plastic casing around the top. As of right now (January 2004), more cracks have developed and the initial cracks have become even longer (going down below the interior stainless steel \\"bowl\\"). Because of all the cracks, the lid now fits very loosely, and I'm afraid that with more use, the cracks will continue to extend downward, rendering the entire unit unusable. The stainless steel cased version may be the way to go, but since we don't have any stainless steel accessories in our kitchen, I will be replacing my grinder with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, Fell Apart on me (twice!)","review":"We bought this grinder for our office, and used it for about 2 months, grinding at most 2-3 times a day on weekdays, and then the part that holds the blade onto the center axle cracked and fell off, leaving the axle spinning uselessly while the blade didnt move. We assumed it was a one-time fluke since Bodum is normally an excellent company, and purchased the same model again. Guess what? The second one lasted maybe 3 months, and then the SAME problem occurred, with the main attachment for the blade just falling apart and eventually flying off and leaving us with another useless hunk of plastic and metal. We purchased both grinders at Whole Foods, I dont know if they distribute a different version of the same model or what but its really a poor excuse for a grinder, especially considering that Bodum is a company that specializes in all things Coffee and Tea.On the plus side, it did grind the coffee nicely...while it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed coffee grinder","review":"This coffee grinder is very inconvenient to use--getting the ground coffee out of the machine is difficult and messy.

The lip that extends from the lid into the body is far too short: it is impossible to open the grinder without spilling grounds on the counter. The button is a flimsy plastic that sometimes catches on its tracks, feeling like it's going to break if you push it. The cord winding base is also quite flimsy, easily popping out when you're trying to place it on a surface. Overall, the whole thing is an embarrassing exercise in industrial design. Get the Krups: it's the same or less money, is a simple pleasure to use and clean, and will last for many years.

(There was a real trend in the beginning of the twentieth century of writers trying to self-consciously \\"bring back romance\\".)This is a book in the Graustark series. Again, it's romantic adventure in an imaginary, but supposedly \\"actual\\" country. (I always imagine these places as being somewhere near Latvia or Lithuania.)

Progressives, moderates by temperate and nature, could not embrace the extremism inherent in its boldest initiatives.

Critical scenes are missing, with Synergy imposing its own fade outs on entire sections. Even the previous reviewer who called this version \\"passable,\\" noted the gaps in continuity. Visually, the print is much softer than Alpha's, with many jumps and splices, with much more of the picture area cropped off, and it goes in and out of focus.

Well, Alpha Video transfers tend to be inferior, but this surpasses their usual race to the bottom. about 20% of the picture is missing on the left side, which is odd considering that fitting it to the TV format meant only trimming it from 1.37 to 1.33. So what they've done is taken some off either the top or bottom as well as the left side. Titles and credits are offset to one side, and not by just a smidgen. The video quality is totally sub-par; obviously, they haven't made the least effort at restoring the film.

My class never quite finished it, but I had no trouble reading the later chapters on my own. I still have a copy of Chung's book, but it only has one remotely interesting thing in it that I remember, which was Laplace's calculation of the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow.Bottom line: if you're unfortunate enough to end up with a professor who is still using Chung's book (I used it in 1997) ... run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality","review":"The book is very low quality and pages are so thin they were already starting to tear out of spiral book just from shipping and they are so thin they are see-thru and it would be impossible to write on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift idea","review":"This is a Christmas gift for \\"grandparents\\" to our new daughter.

The sound and production sounds better on this C.D. , and a female back-up singer nicely assists Brent on several tunes.

It explains physical chemistry in a way that makes perfect sense. I used it for my chemical engineering thermodynamics I class. While other people contented themselves with memorizing really long equations and formulas, I was able to derive them by reading McQuarrie's book. I found that my chemical engineering textbook just spat out an equation out of nowhere and told us to know it, this book starts out with the chemistry, explains the theory, and clearly shows how to get to the equation.

The chapters on quantum chemistry and laughable. Poor job handling theories and background to various ideas. Bad diagrams (black and white), poor unit notation, and terrible sentence structure.

Also, the text is punctuated with various \\"Math Chapters\\", which serve as refreshers for the upcoming material. This aspect is nice because, let's face it, not all of us use anything beyond algebra on a daily basis.The text is also presented in a rather compartmentalized fashion, so that a professor who wishes to begin a course at chapter 16 can do so without requiring that the material from the previous 15 chapters be rigorously understood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is totally awesome! we are currently using Atkins, which does not even compare to this book.

Not until the end when the camera perspective goes to FPS style can you see some rather generic zombie like creatures along with a few more demon-like silhouettes.There's only two semi-satisfying monster encounters; first, where the hero fights a dog like creature and of course *Spoiler* the end fight with the infected Sarge (The Rock).

And as far as the Rock is concerened, many people think he is a sub par actor, however his performance in the movie is excellent. And for people who dislike him, I personally don't like the guy. But if it makes you feel any better he as an ass is the movie and eventually bad things happen to him. I dont want to say anymore except SEE THIS MOVIE if you like SCI-fi thrillers. A++ in my opinion. Only downside is it seems kinda short. But there are always sequals!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why even call it Doom?","review":"In the original game, a research facility on Mars opens a portal to hell and you being the lone survivor needs to get out. I'm guessing instead of sticking with a horror/action movie that could have been good they just decided to completely change the entire premise. Instead of Mars, it's a space station. Instead of a lone survivor, it's a 'team' sent there. Instead of a portal to Hell, it's a virus. Let's see a virus strain that's messed everyone up and a team is sent in to fix it....sounds a lot like Resident Evil doesn't it. Original! This is another movie meant for 15 year old boys that more interested in action than actual storyline.I say if your going to do a video game movie, at least keep it true to the original storyline that way if it bombs (like this movie did) the game fans will at least be somewhat happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst video game movie","review":"We rented this movie, knowing it wouldn't be an Oscar winner or anything. I've seen some bad movies based on video games and comic books, but this took the cake. It was so lame! We thought it would at least be entertaining...no luck there. The best part about it was when it ended. What a relief!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend","review":"Now that many of the regular actions heroes are getting older or are on their \\"way out\\", The Rock must make most of this opportunity to establish himslef as the next action hero but somehow that doesn't seem to be happening inspite of his potential. Doom is a good example of this. Looks as though the movie was made to ride on the success of the popular PC game. The plot, special fx and cast are not bad but the action is stale and mediocre. The zombies and creatures are poor imitations from earlier horror and action movies and fail to impress. The Rock in the end switching his role to become the bad guy was another let down. Check out \\"The Rundown\\" (a.k.a \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" in the UK, Australia and Asia) and you'll be convinced The Rock can be the next big action hero but certainly not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my time","review":"This is an awful movie. avoid at all costs.

Something about this film also really made me sleepy watching it both times.(Eyesofchaos dot com)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good","review":"See, i'm of the opinion that the original plotline for Doom, a lone space marine up against the forces of Hell, COULD have made a great movie. It would be a one man show mostly, but that's when a creative script could add in additional characters. Creating this whole team of marines is just retreading old ground. And the special effects just aren't that special. It was disappointing on pretty much every level. and while i really like Rock, his acting abilities are lacking (fortunately he knows this and isn't deterred).The great, horrible monsters from the original games are completely ignored, when they should have been showcased as the real attractors. They were in the video game, they should have been in the video game movie. The cacodemons, the fireball imps, the Barons of Hell, the rocket launching Cyberdemon, everything has been stripped out and we're left with low budget[...].Maybe Doom 2 can pull a miracle out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doom","review":"It's not the greatest sci-fi horror movie ever, but I liked it. I'd say it's the second best film adaption of a video game after Resident Evil: Apocalypse.

A pretty decent videogame adaption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is bad","review":"No sense in trying to be unique here, so I'll just say it. Doom sucks. It's even worse than AvP, if you can fathom that. It's not just becuase the characters are lame, the dialogue is gag-inducing, the plot is stupid, and the special FX are overused. I hated this movie becuase it was not entertaining in any sense of the word. It's not scary or fun, not even in a stupid kinda way like the Dawn of the Dead remake (which is good, by the way). This movie is probably the worst movie ever. Yes, even worse than Tremors 3. It is a total rip-off of Aliens that should have never been green lighted. Film critics complain about to many remakes, when they really should be complaining about the amount of video game based films. Seriously, have they made a good one yet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Confuse Doom with Resident Evil shall we?","review":"This movie is not based upon the popular Doom games at all. It does have the UAC, it does have the BFG 9000 and it does have blood and gore...but this isn't Doom. In the game, the monsters came from hell and are not borrowed from Resident Evil. In the game, there's no mention of a \\"super being\\" ever being on Mars. In the game, they didn't experiment on people to produce a \\"super being\\". The idea of experiments changing people into monsters comes from Resident Evil and not Doom. Do NOT confuse Doom with Resident Evil and do not make a movie of it. The movie is more based on Resident Evil than it is on Doom. And The Rock should be embrassed being in a movie that's NOT base on the game of the same name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant Holloywood Jerks!","review":"This garbage movie is a perfect example of the jerks in Hollywood who think they know everything!

A bunch of marines are called to a research facility on Mars that is accessed from a portal on Earth. When they get there they find that the scientists have been attacked by some kind of creature and are now transforming.Sadly, there is nothing original in this movie. Marines going in to investigate a distress call: check. Special effects monsters: check. Scientists doing secret, ill-advised work: check. Lighting so dark you can't see what's going on: check. Humans transforming into murderous creatures: check.There is nothing here you haven't seen before in a better movie and worst of all it's a pretty dull ride. There is no suspense, no surprises, just one rote scene after another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot up effects are okay","review":"In the end it is not the special effects that make a movie but the story.

The character development is non-exsistent, along with a relevant story. They tried too hard to make it known that the movie was based on a video game, which was a horrible idea. Ok, we get it. Doom was a video game. The whole \\"first person\\" view towards the end was laughable and made the movie ten times worse, which I thought wasn't humanly possible. Oh, well. At least I saw the movie for free. I feel bad for the people that had to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie's title should really be called DUMB","review":"As much as I like good sci-fi/action flicks, this one was a real nose-picker. Here's the recycled plot: soldiers try to kill aliens (which are really hyper-geneticized humans created by messing around with alien DNA.) I don't think Hollywood's producers have figured out, yet, that you can't make an engrossing, 90-minute movie from a 3-minute videogame; special effects alone can't make an entertaining film...and they weren't all that great in the film, either.I think the most annoying problem with the movie is nearly _everything_ happens in dark corridors and rooms. Don't trained soldiers have enough brains to turn on any lights? And the \\"nano walls\\"--why are they there except for a lame plot device?Give this film a pass--it's not even worth the DVD to pirate it. ;>"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is stupid...","review":"It's worse than Alien vs. Predator.

I dont want to know who and why decided to change the way it should be, but it just doesnt work. No Cyberdemon in Doom movie? What a shame... This movie does not deserve its title. And without demonspawn from hell - well, it is just another Aliens clone. Do yourself a favor and watch Resident Evil instead - where \\"genetic experimentation\\" idea really works. Not to mention that Resident Evil is much better movie overall - no yawning through half of the movie for action to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"Maybe Doom the video game is an excellent video game classic for fans of that type of game. However, Doom the movie doesn't hit the mark for fans of this type of film. It's not the worse film in this genre by any means but it doesn't have that certain ingredient that say Resident Evil has that lifts that movie up to an above average rating. Check Doom the movie out but don't expect anything special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another game movie down the drain","review":"Sure this movie have some big name actors and actresses in it, but because we see these big action stars going at it with \\"Mutants\\" does it really match what the story and plot from the game? The answer is no. I admit I like the whole moving and no stopping but the story in it sucked. It did not follow off what it was really intend to be, an experiment with the teleporter that sent them to hell, not genetic's. Also the whole plot took place on mars not earth. The whole movie looks more like \\"Resident Evil\\". I think they got their story mix up with \\"Resident Evil\\" over \\"Doom\\" itself. I agree with the critics on this. I'm not normally agreeing with them but this movie is an exception. I'm glad I saw it from a friends copy rather wastingabout $20 on it and then be disappointed. So for those who have not played the game this movie would be just another action/horror. But for those who have, it isn't worth seeing and just stick with the game itself to be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays true to game","review":"This movie stayed true to the Doom game, at least in spirit they could have implemented the first person shooter during 60% of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOOM (Unrated Edition) [HD DVD]","review":"Good movie.

That aside, this movie is one of the most fun films I have ever watched. It may not be based on the plot of doom, but it sure as heck is based on the principle. When I see the title DOOM, I expect to see lots of action, big guns, and lots of blood. I don't expect to see deep plots or character turns. DOOM delivered exactly what I expected in these categories. All of the characters are fun to watch, and the military precision of the squad is awesome(you will actually see people reloading their weapons).

If you want to have a great time, this one is definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic formula = Good fun movie","review":"Is it predictable? Sure! Cliched? Absolutely!

Sonja Wilde's part, where she is obviously white or pale, is not very believable when she tells an employer she is part black so she can't get a job. James Franciscus overacts as her racist husband, but his script is at fault. The story needed some compelling event where she could admit she was part black and he could try to accept it (ex. the baby lived and resembled him as the real father) but instead he only rants and raves that she shouldn't socialize with black people. A bit too long where our bride must lie about her black father with no DVD extras to relieve the tedium."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perils of Passing Lite","review":"This movie comes off like a cautionary film screened for junior high girls during health class. The narrative is about as sophisticated as a beach-blanket flick, with flat, coarsely drawn caricatures and a simplistic, predictable plot. The dialogue is so juvenile that the fewer lines a player has, the more credible is his/her performance.The passing protagonist speaks with an unaccountably Mexican-sounding accent, creating a constant subconscious perception that she is Hispanic. Moreover, her thespian skills are barely passable and glaringly so in the presence of otherwise competent actors.The only interesting scene in the movie is one in which the protagonist boogies down a bit too heartily at a country-clubbish dance. The action descends into utter farce as her priggish husband and in-laws react in a silly, stereotypical parody of uptight white folks.Otherwise, the film is watchable only as a curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I bought these as a goldbox offering - for ~$70.

It functions perfectly well, so what complaints can you have there? The device is small and can be attached to a lanyard for carrying around. Because it uses default Bluetooth stacks, you don't need to install the software that comes included on XP and Vista, but it is still recommended because drivers are always better than Plug and Play.

Today, sixty years later since becoming a World War II Luftwaffe Fighter Pilot Mr. Dulias is now able to reflect back on his lifetime experiences both as a civilian in Germany, then in America, and also as having been a Prisoner of War in the Gulags of Russia. He shares his life story with you in a most personal way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile read","review":"I purchased this book after meeting Mr. Dulias and hearing him speak about his life and experiences in WWII. I found this book to be very interesting and informative. Not only does it give details about the war and the atrocities that were committed in the Russian POW camps, but a unique perspective into the very real life of Gottfried. The true story of his experiences growing up in Germany during that era, becoming a member of the Hitler Youth as well as his personal life history make the reader truly understand the man behind the story. You come away from the book with a better understanding of the lives of many of the people of Nazi Germany who were trying to be patriotic to their country, but were also attempting to live normal lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gottfried Dulias might be a fraud","review":"Like many, I first encountered Herr Dulias at a local airshow and bought his book. Beyond the fact that it's a thoroughly unedited heap of typos, there are deeper questions among expert historians as to his legitimacy. His accounts of air warfare are scanty at best. Even in the book \\"The German Aces Speak,\\" there's no mention of Dulias anywhere in the seemingly thorough accounting of all German WW2 pilots' victories.Dr. Jochen Prien, JG 53 historian, puts it rather succinctly in this string:[...]Another enterprising soul, Thijs Lepstra, has undertaken a point-by-point examination of Dulias' account -- with disappointing findings:[...]So ... there's that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, needs more aviation content and more editing","review":"While the story is interesting, this book is poorly written. It is a shame because I think told properly, this could be much more engaging. Its not surprising this book is published by Author House - other more traditional publishing companies would probably not take the book in its current form.The subtitle of the book indicates it is the story of a World War II Luftwaffe Fighter Pilot. As such, one might expect there to be more content related to flying.

I always enjoy and find it quite informitive to hear what the other side went through.I feel it is very important to understand BOTH sides in these things. My Son who is 30, has also taken a firm interest in the times of WWll. I think this is very important for the younger people to also never forget what WWll was all about, from BOTH sides.

There was nothing at all worthwhile about him. The movie sets him up as being a survivor only by very contrived writing. He is able to raid a gang only because the gang is the apocalyptic equivalent of the Keystone Cops. He waves his gun around in town - this will get a loner shot 100% of the time.The \\"choice\\" he makes between the girl and the dog is also contrived. If you actually stop to think for a moment (warning, having a mind and using it destroys any chance of ejoying this film!), he had plenty of choices (there was food right behind that door if he made a quick raid).Frankly, the only way I can see that this movie would have any appeal is if your emotional development stopped at 12, and you like having sex with women, but really dislike women themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic!","review":"I don't like long reviews that go into too much detail, so with that in mind...I've seen this movie many times before and wanted a copy for myself.

The director just had a low budget. The concept however is great. Vic, a young loner in a post-apocalyptic world travels with his telepathic dog in a symbiotic relationship searching for food and women. The harshness of the above ground post-nuclear nightmare is contrasted with the absurdly conformist underground community of 'Topeka' where painted smiles, plaid shirts, family values and hypocrisy rule. Vic is forced to choose between a Roussean (absolute institutional power) or Burkean (no institutions) nightmare.

You definitely need to be in the right frame of mind for this one, which usually means a beer or two. I actually found a website where you can watch the entire movie streaming online, and that was a treat until I got the DVD.

Martin Lawrence was at his best and the participating actors were just as successful as he was in amusing their audience. Impregnated with comdey and action, Blue Streak's writers and directors definately accomplished what they had intended; to humour the viewing public.Deliberate omission of parts of the scenes from the film, which I fould most interesting was done in order that I would not spoil the excitement for intended viewers. You must view it for yourself. Do not let anyone tell you about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie in the world! Martin is HILARIOUS!!","review":"This is tied in my opinion as one of the 2 best Martin Lawrence movies (the other being \\"Nothing to Lose\\"). Martin hides a jewel in a building that is under construction when the police arrive at the robbery. After spending 2 years in jail, he returns to the building to find out that a police station has been built there. This movie is about his hilarious quest to impersonate an officer for the LAPD and try and get his jewel back. Coupled with the hilarious Dave Chappelle, this movie is a must for anyone who enjoys Martin Lawrence, the Chappelle Show, Crank Yankers, or anything else that involves either of these characters. Eddie Murphy's replacement has arrived! If you want comedy, get this movie!!!

Blue Streak has his signiture all over it after i seen it today. *spoiler* i have to admit that the bank robbery at the beginning is not believeble or just plain stupid. If a crook is going to double cross his partners in crime, DON'T DO IT DURING THE CRIME!!!! Like this guy shot his partner up on the roof with a gun while Martin was still in the process of stealing the diamond. Doesn't he think the sound might cause some suspicion? And when the body landed on the cop car, that guy was still trying to get the diamond with the police aftering both of them at his point...just stupid. They can learn a few things on double crossing from the 'The Italian Job' movie.

So he Rips off Eddie Murphy... Get Over It, he's a funny man. (even though Big Momma was sub-par) Martin Stars as a criminal who stashes a diamond in a construction sight when he gets arrested. On his release he finds the construction sight has been turned into a Police Station.This of course provides the comedian with ample comic fodder and the audience with alot of laughs. The Supporting Cast are Great (Highlights are William Forsythe and Dave Chappelle) and the Action Set Pieces are on Par with any Big Action Film.The Pacing is Perfect so the film never lags, and the direction is spot on. Martin's Pizza Delivery Boy is the Films only weak link as that scene provides no real laughs at all, only Simpathy laughs. That scene is the reason this film gets a 4 instead of a 5. Other than that it's a near perfect Comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"We've Seen This Before","review":"A familiar plot: a likeable crook, clueless cops, incompetant henchmen, and a fortune to be gained. How many times can anybody see the same thing again? This film brings nothing fresh to this situation.

Tom Jones is the rare exception. His writing may be spartan (as another reviewer noted), but that's because his diction is concise, his words aptly chosen.Of the couple of hundred books I've read on nautical subjects this is one I return to regularly. The clarity of thinking and expression is exceptional.It's about economical, practical voyaging on 2 or 3 hulls. Rather than an exhaustive list of production multihulls and their features, it is about voyaging, what to bring along, what not to, heavy and fine weather sailing, and multihull design.I find it far better than other books on multihulls."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit misleading title, with a tidbits of useful information","review":"If you thinking about buying this book for tips on cruising in a multihull it will be extremely disappointed. If your thinking about buying and cruising in a multihull it will give some food for thought about what you need for a boat.It's an average book that reads more into design instead of what the title leads you to believe and some of the information is out of date for the faster designs by K. Hughes, J. Shuttleworth, D. Newick. Chris White has a book (amazon has it for sale) which is far better and suggested reading by most Multihull fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"An excellent book about mutihulls, practical, for people who want to sail. Not for people who sail one week a year and have $200,000 holes in the water or people who want air conditioning and tv in their boats. If you want to experience sailing and the ocean, this is the book for you. This book will tell you what you need, what works and doesn't, and how to be safe, written by a man who has done some hard thinking on the subject. Entertaining and enjoyable reading.

His emphasis on the militaristic indirect approach to military engagements, and how it coincides with what he calls the \\"grand\\" strategy is definetely worth the attention of any tactician, as well as any history buff. Hart's book has very smooth transition between his topics of discussion, and even readers who are fairly new to the subject of war can pick this book up and understand it. Strategy can also be applied to everyday situations, and would be a great read for business adventurists.

We put the print through a scene for scene color correction and complete sound design and believe this is the finest print of this movie on the market. Nothing Sacred - an older film - starring Carole Lombard also filmed in Technicolor was a bit worn but through color correction and sound design we believe we have restored it to close to it's original beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Restoration","review":"Nothing Sacred, one of the best screwball comedies ever, looks much better in this Marengo Films restoration than the version on Alpha films. This restoration has better contrast, finer detail and a smoother, more correct color. And, of course, you have the added benefit of the original A Star Is Born.Do not be misled by the jacket that indicates Nothing Sacred is in B&W;, it is not. Both are early Technicolor films. There is some image loss, but that is to be expected in films that are 70 years old. Neither film was given the Wizard of Oz treatment.At this price, its a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for press/drip coffee, not espresso","review":"I bought this coffee grinder because I had heard that burr grinders were good for grinding beans for espresso. Maybe other burr grinders are, but this one is not. It produces perfectly acceptable grinding for use in a french press or a drip coffee maker, but even on the finest grind setting, it comes nowhere near a fine enough grind to make espresso. Also, I have noticed that the grinds are not very uniform in size; on the finest setting there is some finely ground coffee but there are also a lot of larger grounds. I don't notice any obvious improvement in coffee flavor over my whirly-blade grinder. The search for a good coffee grinder goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I've been grinding coffee for two decades and have used a variety of burr grinders from Italy and Germany. This unit was always slow, noisy, and messy. Now after one year the timer knob has fallen off and the grinding has slowed to a halt. I've cleaned the unit with no effect and can only think the gears are slipping??? It is now in the trash and will be my last Bodum product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bodum 5670 Antigua Burr Grinder","review":"2 stars is maybe a little misleading. This grinder produces a beautiful, consistent grind. It introduced me to the importance of grind not only in producing a good cup of coffee, but in getting the most from your beans. However:The bean bowl is inexplicably huge. You can only use the full grinding cycle for 2 consecutive runs or the motor will overheat. Plan accordingly. Within a short period of time, the locking tabs on the bowl broke off, meaning I could no longer easily adjust the grind and I had to hold the bean bowl in place while grinding. Nevertheless, I continued to grind coffee for about 16 months until it recently died for good. Static electricity was also a problem. I was not happy with Bodum documentation or service.If you are very careful with the bean bowl and can figure out how to keep the bean grind path clean, then you can get along with this grinder. You can't knock the consistency of grind on this machine and the rich flavors it produces."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stopped working","review":"I purchased this product in April 2003. It worked great until last week. The motor runs but the grinder does not turn.

Could it be that there are some quality issues with Bodum products?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grind","review":"The major problem with this unit is that it does not grind fine enough.

We are now stuck with a boat anchor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over substance, apparent on unpacking the new unit","review":"I'm in the camp with reviewers whose comments on this product range from slightly disparaging to foaming at the mouth. The hopper is so flimsy that you need to be more careful than I was while extracting it from its packaging prior to first use, unless you also want the cheap plastic to break before you even plug it in.Static is a constant problem (not sure whether this problem is specific to Bodium though).And after less than a month, the machine just stopped working. When I turn the timer, I can hear the mechanical timer rotating, but the gears don't turn. I know the outlet is ok because I had to revert to the old blade grinder. And the timer knob is every bit as flimsy as described.I still prefer the conical burr grinder such as this one is, but I'd probably buy a heftier one next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy.","review":"Do not buy this coffee grinder.

Don't make my mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this unit and manufacturer","review":"I had mine for 6 months, used maybe twice a week, and it just stopped working. I took it apart, and they use a steel helical gear on the shaft of the motor which meshes with a PLASTIC gear in the gear box. Sure enough, the teeth on the plastic gear were sheared off, creating a dead spot on the gear. Really poor design (all metal gears or a clutch would be better).Bodum doesn't sell parts online, but I'm not into replacing a gear every 6 months. Interestingly, Bodum sells the unit online for less than here. Maybe they are trying to dump them.Avoid this unit at any price, and think carefully about other Bodum products which might share weak engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars for this Grinder","review":"Absolutely the worst grinder made... knobs will vibrate off, coffee hopper will never fit correctly, huge static electricity build up so coffee dust will fly out of hopper and create a mess everyplace on the unit, the grinder teeth never grind cleanly there is always a teaspoon of coffee waiting to fall when the hopper is pulled out!

More landmine photos, render-safe procedures, equipment.Otherwise, still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"His finest hour","review":"John Martyn committed a few good albums to vinyl in the early 70's, before drug addiction stole his guitar and songwriting skills and destroyed his marriage. This is far and away his best: every song is memorable, from the bluesy title tune and the sensuous \\"Go Down Easy\\" to the melancholy \\"Man in the Station.\\" \\"May You Never\\" is a wonderful evocation of what friendship is all about (a rarity, when love songs are a dime a dozen), and the final track showcases Martyn's guitar skills well although the tune itself is rather so-so. I was introduced to this album by a British friend in the 80's, and still find it a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I learned about Solid Air after researching more about Nick Drake. Any true fan of Nick will probably know about this album - and after listening to a few samples decided to take the plunge.I started to search for this album on vinyl - my preference but for some reason just could not find it. I was sort of under the impression that this album was John's masterpiece and (much like Van Morrison's Astral Week's) also very hard to find on vinyl (in my area anyway).I wish I had waited and purchased this on vinyl for $5 or so because much like BOC Agents of Fortune - Solid Air just doesn't seem to belong on the album. It is so much different - it's hard to explain.If you are looking for that Solid Air feeling - just buy the song itself and save your money, IMHO the rest of the album isn't worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Magnificence","review":"At a little more than 34 minutes, the original SOLID AIR is a pretty short CD. It's worth spending the couple of extra dollars for this version, not particularly because of the extra track, but for the remastering and the sleevenotes, which are substantial.John Martyn should be much better known in the States than he is, and this album, along with the currently unavailable ONE WORLD, are his masterpieces. Just listen to the title track, the defining piece on this album, for double-bassist Danny Thompson's long sliding notes, for Martyn's slurred vocals wandering in and out of the mix, and for the occasional vibraphone in the background. It's not quite jazz, folk or rock, but it is a wonderful tribute to Martyn's friend Nick Drake, who died 18 months after this LP was originally released. 'Don't Want to Know' should also be mandatory chill-out listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This album never fails to send shivers up my spine whenever I listen to it. The quality of singing is so exceptional, that it completely overshadows that of other songwriters. The tunes and arrangement blend together to create a haunting ambience around each of the songs. \\"Man in the station\\" is a wonderful example of this. I would stick my neck out and say that this is the best rock album ever by a solo artist, and I say this after having listened to a lot of Van Morrison, Tim Buckley, Laura Nyro et al. If you are looking for a masterpiece, this CD is what you should get your hands on."},{"rating":"2","title":"John's the man","review":"he performs like no other... simply his best album, (yes Gunther I know you like Grace & DAnger more) but here he still has the more unsophisticated style.A MUST for anyone who appreciates John!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Civil War buffs","review":"This is a good book for anyone wanting to know more about the\\"Western\\" war battles in the Civil War.

Tom Piccirilli talks to the readers of this book--and he doesn't talk down. He discusses the business of writing and he makes it fun. The book covers everything from where to get ideas to networking to writer's block, but he never claims to hold the ultimate secret to being a fantastic writer. That's what makes this book so great. Tom is sincere in what he says and it comes through wonderfully. Told in a down-to-earth style, it seems like he's talking directly to you.With chapter titles like \\"Technique, Style and Watching Bob's Face Get Eaten,\\" it's sure to make you smile--or even laugh out loud--as you're reading. It's nice to know that a professional can remain grounded after being so successful.All beginning writers should give this a try. It's a fun read that's packed with helpful advice--and not very expensive at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"The yoga section is very slow & monotonous, talking, and feels forced.

I listen to my iPod 9-11 hours a day at my workplace, and have found this case indespensible for the protection that it offers. Aside from a few scratches on the back, (From use in a speaker and not this case) you would not know that my 60 gig ipod was bought the month that the 5th gens were introduced. After numerous drops and spills on the job, in the outdoors and two hunting trips and at least two drops in the water while fishing, (it floats by the way and is waterproof) this case has proven to be the finest rough and tumble case on the market. It's few drawbacks: size, not able to use the hold switch (not quite sure why this is a issue for some people) and not able to use the dock connector are inconsequential for this great product. If you have a iPod this is the best insurance you can buy for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Otter protective case for ipod video","review":"So, I bought this protective case for my ipod and seems very sturdy. I have not tried it to see if it works when it rains, yet, but don't want to take my chances if that's possible. The downside of the product is that it cannot be used for workouts at the gym which is the only reason why I bought an ipod in the first place. There is no way to reach the hold buttom, and I have to open the case to turn it on and off, and that's becoming a hassle when going to the gym. The other problem is, since I had to leave the ipod without the \\"hold\\" buttom off after my workout, I can't see wether the ipod is still playing or not and can't see if it has been turned off. The ipod is very sensitive and can turn itself on just by the wheel touching anything (in this case it was the seat or my car). So my ipod got discharged. I think this is a good product but don't recommend it if you use it to go and do your workouts with it indoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for one thing","review":"This product does keep moisture out, but it renders the ipod so huge and clunky that I can not wear it on my arm or carry it easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdiest case yet!","review":"I need a case that was \\"horse proof\\" more than waterproof for the long days when I'm riding. I like to listen to music and I wanted to protect my ipod in case I fell, and it certainly sees like this one will do the trick. Stays on my belt, no problem there. The case is heavier than I would like for everyday use, but it's by far the best I've seen when it comes to protection in my sport. Haven't tried it in the water, but I'm sure I won't be let down. The click wheel is surprisingly easy to use; I was expecting a battle there, but no problems, and the videos are nice and clear as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accident-prone, yet my iPod still works!","review":"I've had an otterbox for my iPod for a year now and I love it! At first I thought its size was a bit cumbersome, but it hooks on the back of a bathing suit or sports bra (sorry, guys) and stays put. I can even fit it in a pocket, albeit a bit awkwardly. I used it last summer to swim in Lake Michigan, I used it in the winter in the pool, and I've had it out in the rain. I've dropped my iPod an embarrassing number of times, and this case has held up and kept my iPod in perfect condition. You would be hard-pressed to find someone who's been harder on this case than I, and it's held up like a dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Product...a little Bulky, but it does the trick","review":"My first iPod was ruined when it went into a lake with me while walleye fishing...I wasn't going to let that happen again. I received the Otterbox, stuck two cottonballs in it (without the iPod, of course) and then submerged it in the sink for about 14 hours. Not a drop of water got in and the cotton balls were bone-dry. It protects the iPod and that is my main concern...but it is a little on the large side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, high quality and very tustworthy","review":"I'm a kayacer and this waterproof unit is a must for me. It is very high quality, easy to use and has an excelent name.

As with most ascetical literature, there are many things that we find to be \\"hard sayings\\" today because of our softness. However, if viewed as a challenge to improve rather than an unreachable goal, even these hard sayings can be immensely insightful. There are also many interesting metaphors and idiomatic sayings that will make the teachings (re)memorable.

Either way, it becomes an exercise in frustration. This book solves this problem by selecting short daily devotional readings from a variety of authors and then updating the translation. The readings are short (usually a couple paragraphs) and are helpful in making the most out of your devotional time (it's amazing how little human problems change over the centuries!). As you might expect, some of the readings will speak to you more powerfully than others. But at a minimum, the excerpts reveal the rich tradition of thought that underlies Christianity.

From the hoo-hah I expected something worth reading, but it was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly conceived, tepid, falls flat....","review":"I'm a lifelong Democrat, and found this to be badly written, sophomoric and overly bombastic in tone without delivering anything substantial to the long-suffering reader who manages to slog though it.The authors seem quite pleased with themselves, and that's well transmitted through every paragraph. Pilger and Palast are much more satisfying and well-informed reads. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unimpressed","review":"This book says the big problem with the Dems is they have no ideas. OK so far. They point out how the Repubs have put together a vast machine, involving think tanks, training centers, a right wing media, and coordinated messaging. Yup, that's true. They point out that the Dems not only have no ideas, but they run their campaigns in fundamentally wrong ways, such as going to the same few consultants, concentrating on a few states and a few races and not running nationally...dead right.But...in more than 200 pages, I can't find a single idea. Not one. They keep saying that there's hope, that the Democrats can work this out, can become the majority party again. But they don't give a single clue as to the ideas that would lead us there.Don't buy this book. Buy Joe Klein's book.

I don't believe the netroots alone will save the Republic (and neither do they, I bet) but I believe that the philosophy outlined in this book -- a people-based philosophy -- is a step in the right direction.This is a very quick read, so it's easily worth the purchase or loan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necessary Book","review":"The book was prescient in predicting the growing power of the netroots and how the traditional media was failing to offer the insight or outlet that many were finding on the web.

It is at times very spiritual, humorous, witty, emotionally moving and a wonderful testament of love, friendship, hope and a stunning example of the Christian faith.

I was expecting another biographical type of movie. This was quite different. The one-person show could not have been better! A unique approach to the subject of John's Gospel. My attention was totally captured with the serious, yet humorous, and sometimes moving banter of John. His musings and conversation were well written, and well played."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTLEY OUTSTANDING...A MUST SEE!","review":"Dean Jones' protrayal of Jesus' deciple John as an old man in exile, is extremely well done. Not only that, I would say it was one of the best performances I have ever seen. I alway's enjoyed Mr. Jones' acting and the movies he has made, so when I saw him interviewed prior to the film being shown on TV, I thought, \\"Well, I'll see a little bit of it and then go to bed.\\" But 90 minutes later, I knew I had to get a copy for myself, for my son, and for my parents. After watching it once again, I loaned it to a friend and she wants to borrow it again to show her Sunday school class. It is now on loan to a man in my office...and all of this in just 2 weeks.

I saw St. John's exile in a totally new light than I had seen it before. It's one thing to read the Biblical account of St. John directly from Scripture, but when its brought to life by such an excellent actor, words begin to paint vivid pictures that never leave the mind. Dean's drama of Christ's crucifiction within the view point of St. John was more accurate and stirring than any mult-actor movie I've seen. I would strongly recommend this to everyone. This is one video you MUST see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Jones - the best he's ever been","review":"This video shipped in a timely fashion and in perfect condition.There is a flaw in the video but it's the exact same flaw that's in my friends copy too and since it was originally recorded live, I'm sure it's just a flaw in the video master itself.Anyway, if you haven't seen this.

The topics addressed include work and leisure, music, seeing, sculpture, celebration, and contemplation.The book's title is taken from St. Augustine's remark that \\"only he who loves can sing,\\" and if there is an underlying theme to these occasional pieces it is that art and love, aesthetics and spirituality, cannot be divorced. A sample quote: \\"Contemplation is visual perception prompted by loving acceptance.\\"Due to their brevity, these essays can only be suggestive.

It was too long, the acting wasn't very good and it was boring at times. To me it was a recreation of the documentary which is pointless to redo. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because the background story, in the beginning of the film, got my attention. If I'm going to sit for 2 hours and watch a movie about Woodstock I'd rather just watch the real thing via the documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant comedy classic","review":"Taking Woodstock is one of the most tender, funny films I have seen in many moons.

Story line is two stars. Overall four stars if you like me appreciate attention to detail when recreating a period feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story, some great visuals...","review":"Ang Lee tells a great story.this time is no different, the film progresses and the story unfolds and looks completely different every 10 min. the movie takes off and it is rather engaging from the start.I only have 2 complaints: the kiss between Demetri Martin and the guy he likes- um FAKE?!?! it could have been SO hot, but it was obviously not even the actors... WHAT HAPPENED? after that the film sputters a bit- then the Paul Dano scene could have been a bit more graphic- I mean, we all know what they did, but it could have been painted a bit better- there again, I wonder if Demetri Martin chickened out....Overall, the story is great... and I give it 4 stars, but these 2 parts really missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The director certainly tries his best to capture the feeling of the Woodstock phenomenon / festival from a periphery. The film is well shot. However, the script examines the phenomenon through the lens of a money-driven family and major events through their son who is coming to grips with a whole bunch of non-Woodstock related events. Homosexuality, interpersonal relationships, career etc. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Personally, I could care less what this uninspired actor/comic does. Liev Schreiber is one of the few actors in the film who keeps you from turning off the whole thing. In short - there was nothing of Woodstock in there to hang your floppy hat on. No sequences of musicians, no staged behind-the-scene sequences. Nothing, other than a drug-induced scene in a van where there is some Woodstock music played against a dreamscape of LSD inspired visions. Slap in some nudity, some tie-dye, some eccentric people and call it movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable film","review":"I saw this in the theater and thought it was quite enjoyable and fun. It was well made, directed, and acted, with many funny moments. It was also endearing as the Elliot character really learns who he is. The best thing about this movie...they stuck to the story of how Woodstock ended up in this town. No actors dressed up to look like the musicians who played Woodstock. I was concerned it would turn into a what musician can we throw in and such, but it wasn't thankfully.Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet tempered, personal, human -- everything contemporary audiences don't get and don't want.","review":"After a second viewing, I think it's not just good, it's Lee's masterpiece. Elliot's acid trip is as beautiful a piece of filmmaking as I've ever seen. But what's really wonderful is how the story sneaks up on you, adn you realize it's about the flowering of a human soul.*A charmer, and probably a small classic. The antipathy in some of the low starred reviews is inexplicable. The film moves gently from scene to scene, gradually revealing surprising things about the characters, but always with a compassion and affection for them that sets Ang Lee apart from other contemporary directors, who seem to delight in hating the people in their own films, and maybe hating humanity. Watch this after a monster fest like \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" and you'll see the difference between a pretentious poseur and an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone who writes for the stage should get this book.","review":"I've been telling everyone about Dana's amazing book.The biggest surprise for me was that it's very readable--even enjoyable. It's not only a reference book to turn to when you have a question. I've read it through twice and gone back to specific sections when I needed them.It's already saved me from making a couple of big mistakes, gotten me off my duff to take care of some business I'd let slip and given me direction in areas I never quite understood.Give it to a friend - student, novice, mid-career or even established playwright, lyricist, theater composer or book writer - for his or her birthday. It'll be the best present they'll get."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nasty Truth","review":"One of the other reviews said it, unfortunately, well: the books of this type are nicely done and comprehensive in their way but you're fooling yourself if you really think these are going to help you get a play produced. And it's not just a matter of writing a good script; you'll never know because most of these markets will never even respond, no matter how carefully you adhere to their guidelines. I've submitted to the Victory Gardens Theatre multiple times - a theatre that proposes to advocate local playwrights, of which I am one - and I have yet to even get a response. And, yes, a SASE was enclosed each time. I get the impression that there's a nice and sizable trash-can near their in-box! Anyway, you'll find a lot of \\"oh-thou-had-better-be-professional-when-submitting-to-us-because-we're-quite-impressed-with-ourselves\\" type attitudes, but the likeliness that they'll act professionally in return is minimal."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's who you know","review":"I'm sure this is a very nice book, just like the Writer's Market books about agents and publishers. The problem with these books is that unless you have a close personal friend in the publishing business or the theatre world, you will never get anything published or produced. No book can help you do that. It's a matter of luck and coincidence, and if you weren't lucky enough to go to college with someone in the business, you're out in the cold, and no book will alter that fact for you. Have a nice day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally A Zoids Manga","review":"The first installment of the Zoids manga \\"Chaotic Century\\" tells the story of Van, a boy who wants to become a great Zoid pilot like his dad; and Zeke, a strange Zoid that befriends Van. Things turn nasty when a strange man in black appears, but you will have to read it to find out more. Overall this first installment was, although way to short to be called a manga in my opinion, a good read. If you like Zoids then you will like this manga. If not then you may want to seek a lenghier and more fulfilling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated sonero and album.","review":"Monguito el Unico was one of Cuba's greatest soneros and one of the representatives of the Cuabn son montuno sound. This album oozes just that in this album and the track \\"Donde Esta Tu Montuno\\" with great music, a cocky attitude and nice lyrics. He also mixes it up with beautiful guanguanco as with \\"Flora\\", and my favorite \\"Sé Tu Historia\\" which talks about a \\"cucarachita\\" way before Roena released \\"Cucarachita Cucarachon\\" (an apparent shot at Olivencia by Sammy el Rolo Gonzalez.) Overall, Monguito displays some great music and excellent soneos which was one of the reasons Pacheco had him in his group. The album is a must have for fans of the Cuban sound and those who love soneos. It's a shame this album has not been remastered (although their is a French version available, I don't count it as a remastering) nor given the recognition it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"So, there's some nice stories about Funakoshi and his masters, all with some kind of morality in them. Well, not that bad. Than there's the presentation of Ten No Kata. So, that's interesting because this Kata is not practiced anymore formally in the JKA and few karatekas even know it exists, and personnaly I think it's a great method of training basics. So at least the book shows this kata, but the performer has (seems to me) a very weak technique compared to the performer in karate-do kyohan the master's text (see this title). Sometimes the postures and techniques seem to be shocking for modern shotokan standards. Maybe it has to do with the evolution of shotokan since the book was written, but then again the performer in kyohan looks much more the way we are used to for modern shotokan karate-Do. All in all, I was a bit disappointed with this book. I give it 2 stars for the Ten No Kata and maybe a little nit for the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shotokan","review":"A good book fom the Master to the beginning student.It will help you to understand the beginnings of Shotokan Karate and will help you decide on the best style of martial art for you to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Picture Does Not Belong?","review":"A book about Anybody for Somebody and tales and trials of Someone looking for Something in a land that is Anywhere, but we all have been there, I am not sure where, but its Somewhere.

What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic language, engaging fiction","review":"Bandler does a wonderful job at circular, enigmatic, and yet satisfying fiction. He does an even better job at showing beautiful uses of hypnotic language and hypnotic metaphors. The entire book is also a wonderful hypnotic cure for ennui, both by being entertaining and by being a powerful set of hypnotic suggestions for exactly that purpose.A beautiful demonstration of Ericksonian principles wrapped into a package any child (any almost any adult) will love; in that respect, the book is a little like Grimm's Fairy Tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the critic","review":"This book is written like a fairy tale. Adults may have to let go of their preconceptions in order to enjoy this one.

It is mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and other such details, but it is not something I will watch again. (If Jack & Meg were telling their own story, THAT would be worth it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This is a short film but enjoyable if you like old films of square dancing.

I would like one just like this but made in sometime in this century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still recommended reading!","review":"A great deal of research and archaeological findings have taken place since this classic was first published. Nevertheless, I recommend this comprehensive volume for its wealth of description of Celtic iconography and other evidence. Scholars may justifiably differ with some of Ross' conclusions, and her work is not popular with those who believe that the Celts did not have a culture distinct from their Indo-European neighbors. However, she remains a careful scholar who shares her evidence and insights in a fashion that even newbies will find interesting and highly readable. To learn about more recent findings, also take a look at the works of Barry Cunliffe."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE don't read this book!","review":"This book is firmly entrenched in 1930's archaeological theory.

DO NOT read this book if you want to learn anything about the 'real' Celts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Little Gem","review":"This wonderfully understated book begs for a cover-to-cover non-stop read. Parental indifference and neglect result in great miracles. Fascinating characters hop on at every bend in the road. The rarest of butterflies flits by and a most dignified dog always takes the front seat. The King and Queen of England drop in and a well-meaning letter from Winston Churchill causes an uproar. Hopefully Mike Leigh has already read \\"The Two Pound Tram\\" and is working on obtaining funding for the film. Most memorable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Slow to start, weak ending. The middle is a bit hard to put down when there's action, and I found myself gritting my teeth trying to get through totally inane \\"Which boy should I be kissing?\\" type conversations to get to the good parts. The book could have easily been cut down at least 50 pages, and would have benefited greatly from it. \\"Tomorrow When The War Began\\" is not a terrible book, but it's not great either. If the blurb interested you, I would recommend \\"The Hunger Games\\" over this book any day.

In fact, it was often tough to pick up.Maybe it was the teen-aged girl perspective. I just could not get into it.Maybe it was the Aussie perspective. They didn't seem to care that their country was just invaded. In fact, they seemed to blame their western way of life for causing it.Maybe it was the lack of a villain. They, whoever \\"they\\" were (never identified, and no curiosity whatsoever as to who \\"they\\" were), were certainly never identified as the bad guys.I feel sorry for a society that thinks so little of itself that they have to force themselves to defend it. This liberal disease seems to be infecting the entire English-speaking world. It would be a shame if it wasn't so sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd, inconsistent, and just plain terrible","review":"I fail to understand why everyone loves this book so much. The characters are zero-dimensional. The plot is ludicrous and fantastic at best- absurd at worst. The invaders are completely unrealistic and unbelievable, even for one-dimensional figureheads of evil. The dialogue is sickening. The action is stilted and unrealistic. None of the main characters are even remotely likeable. The list goes on for ever, but I will stop it here by saying: Tomorrow, When the War Began is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking me back to my childhood","review":"I was a teenager when the Tomorrow series became a huge seller.

It's written for children, not adults. The characters of this novel are teens. That's OK, except they ruin the story because of their normal behavior. They can't drive a car very well, they think about sex immaturely and usually at inappropriate times, they know very little about how things work, their feelings are always hurt, sleep is a big deal as is eating, and they don't know about guns or warfare. So if you want to read about a group of clowns saving the Aussies, dive in.

In fact,it was one of the best books I have ever read. Informative to the hilt, it takes the reader through the life of Catherine II from her birth to her death, with excerps from her Memoires and correspondences over the years. It read like some romance novels I've experienced, full of Court intrigue and brimming with affairs. Catherine the Great was truly deserving of her title. I would highly recommend this book to everybody. Even if you don't like biography, I guarantee you won't realize you're reading one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb and fascinating read!","review":"Catherine the Great was a wonderful read. It masterfully followed the intrigues of court life and all its complexities. One learned a great deal of information regarding Catherine, some through personal letters of her own.

Anyone interested in Russian history, or even someone merely interested in a twisting tale such as one you might find in a work of fiction--Catherine is definitely a go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This is so awesome! The songs are so powerful - from the desperateness of \\"God Help Me\\" to the hopeful \\"You Are Loved\\" to the simplicity of \\"Thank You\\" - and the music is great. This is NOT a headache maker, as some might say, and the singing is wonderful, though quite different from previous St. James albums. All in all, this CD is great! A reccomendation for ANY Christian, wheather they like St. James or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I Had One Chance To Tell You Something - you are loved!","review":"I looked forward to this CD all year and was thrilled when I got it. It's her best with \\"Transform\\" almost right behind it.The title of the CD comes from the song \\"You Are Loved\\" and the story behind it was on a friend of Rebecca's with whom they had lost contact, and after talking to a mutual friend, she found out he had really fallen away and was deep into drugs. She wrote the song and the message became the theme of the whole album - God's love and living it.The songs \\"God Help Me\\", \\"Shadowlands\\", \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" and \\"Forgive Me\\" also enforce that same theme with amazing credibility.I have to say, I love every song, with the exception of \\"Thank You\\", but even that is slightly growing on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful CD!","review":"This is a wonderful CD! I never really listened to Rebecca St. James in the past, but when I was on the computer one day, I came across this CD. And for some reason, I just bought it. I hadn't even heard any of the songs before. I don't regret my decision to buy this CD at all! I've listened to it every day since it came in the mail. Each song is written beautifully, every one talking in some way about Jesus, some even about her personal struggles with the Lord. I highly recommend this CD for anyone! There's probably a more rock edge to it than her other CD's, but I like that. Great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album","review":"What can I say, I am a fan of Rebecca St. James. I love listening to all of her music, and I could not wait to buy her next album. Her music always moves me and the rock edge makes it appealing to those who like popular secular music.If you like Newsboys, Jars of Clay and different Christian Music then any of Rebecca's albums are a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I was hoping for!","review":"This may be Rebecca's best album yet, making it well worth the long wait. Musically and lyrically it is totally solid. With tracks like \\"God Help Me\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"You Are Loved\\", and \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", Rebecca comes storming out the gate with catchy, melodic rock tracks reminiscent of her \\"God\\" album. Softer tracks like the ballad \\"I Need You\\", and \\"Lest I Forget\\" balance out the mix. To me the only minor miscue is \\"Thank You\\", as the chorus is a little too repetitive. No matter, this album is more than worth the price, get it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal for the money","review":"I got these speakers to add the ability to share sound with another person while using a portable dvd player or an mp3 player. They are completely dependant on the amount of volume produced by the device so they can be a little quiet if the device doesn't put out a lot of volume. On the other hand, they work, don't require batteries, fold up to a small size and do the job. I worry a little that the cord that plugs into the devices may get pinched since it fits in a groove on the outside of the case, but then a retractable cord would have increased the price and possibly the weight of the speakers. If you need substantially volume, you will need to get powered speakers.All in all, though these are a good buy for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for desk jockeys","review":"Audiophiles will find these speakers vile. But desk jockeys will find them convenient: you'll never put the phone receiver to your ear only to bump up against your earbuds.

Mine lasted one year for a product that has a two year warranty. I spoke to Bodum and they know there is a continuing problem with the switch. Since this problem has been around since at least 2002, it is Amazing that Bodum hasn't asked STRIX (maker of the # P69 switch) for a different switch for the kettle.

But the worst was the other day when the plastic on the base where the prongs connect from the kettle just started to melt. I don't know how it happened, but it is now no longer usable due to the acrid stench of melting plastic when it is in use.While this kettle worked, we loved it.

When I was first shopping for an electrice tea kettle I didn't want this one because the heating element is exposed to the water (my roommate had a similar kettle and with time deposits start to form on the element. Looks very gross, but Bodum supplies you with instructions on how to clean.)After looking around for awhile, I decided to purchase this machine (in the black) because the size was good, considering I am the only person using it, and it fits well on my desk. I figure I can keep the heating element clean for the most part, but at $20 I can't really complain. It heats the water fast and has a nice design. The cord is a bit of a pain for me, since I'm keeping it on my desk that has about 400 other cords around it, but if you're just leaving it on your kitchen counter it shouldn't be too much of a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, for a short time.","review":"Product lasted for about 20 months before the kettle's connector to the base failed (shorted and the plastic mount melted!).

This book is not as fresh, as precedents, it is not as interesting as precedents and it is not as good as precedents. Characters of both \\"lovers\\" are not well design, character of Ayla becomes soft and, so to say, wishy-washy, rhythm becomes slow and imagination falls to none.

Ayla's accent is continuously described as too small to notice...but everyone does the instant she opens her mouth. Everyone in the book is just great, except for the token one-dimensional bad-guy who turns good in the end.These savages are so elegant, we expect to see a pre-historic Martha Stewart behind the next mammoth hide.

Of course, in true soap-opera fashion, Ayla falls for another man, thereby making Jondalar wild with jealousy, so much so that in one particular scene he all but rapes her (what a mature response). Naturally, this convinces her that he loves her and at the end of the novel, she walks out on the man she is supposed to marry (leaves him at the prehistoric version of the altar) and runs after her one and only love. Although I didn't like the plot, I did like Ayla as a character and this book pretty much ruined her. Of course, the book takes after 'The Valley of Horses' in its copious sex scenes, which make you wonder if these are necessary for the book to sell. They probably are"},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it across the room","review":"Good lord, this is one of the worst books I've ever read.

I thought I was reading a Danielle Steele novel!\\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" and \\"Valley of Horses\\" were interesting, with \\"Valley\\" coming in a late second due to the overwhelming romantic drama that occurs once the two main characters meet. But \\"Mammoth\\" was no better than a soap opera, and the male protagonist, Jondolar, had to be one of the most irritating, feeble males to grace the literary world.Good grief!

It was the same way with all the other three, and of all of them, \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\" is my favorite. It tells of the heroine, Ayla, and all of her troubles and hardships in her first meeting with other people of her own kind. With her many inventions, different types of medicines, tame animals, and breathtaking beauty, she is awed, and immediatly accepted to the Mamutoi though some people have trouble with her Clan (flathead) background. All-in-all, this is a wonderful, exciting book, and I would reccomend it to anyone over the age of 12. And may I say that I have been waiting for the fifth book in the series for over TWO YEARS! So if you read this, Ms. Auel, your book is two years over-due. Where is it?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared with it's predacessors - very mediocre","review":"Most reviewers agree that Clan of the Cave Bear - and to a lesser extent, Valley of the Horses - are masterpieces. Fun, engaging, luxurious in their premise, polemics and details. Mammoth Hunters degerates into a soap-opera-ish love-triangle that becomes tiresome rather quickly - and then down-right annoying. For diehard fans of the first two installations of the Earth's Children series - don't expect the wonder and depth... but being addicts, you won't be able to resist - and will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am re-reading the series in preparation for the finale. I think I will lightly skim the last half of this one. Auel falls in love wirh her own words as so many authors do around book numer 3.

If they don't get better, I'm not buying the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Auel weaved together a society in her imagination. Not many could accomplish that task! Of course the love triangle was too much like a soap opera for my taste, which is why I read instead of tuning in to the soap operas. But the Mammouth Hunters were absolutely fasinating. I really wish she would write a book just devoted to them with no Ayla. It was my favorite book of the series. I prefer the society of the Mammouth Hunters to the Zelandoni in book five. The fact that Ayla gets a chance to interact with people is quite refreshing after the descriptive solitude in Valley of Horses. Auel teased me by not giving me more of the characters in Mammouth. I would have liked much more on Vincavec for starters. But all in all, if you want a good read, this is the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Most of the book is about a big argument between Ayla and Jondalar.

Having loved Clan of the Cave Bear, I really wanted this series to keep me captive. However, about half way through Valley of Horses and continuing well into Mammoth Hunters, the author goes from story teller to erotic novelist. The amount of explicit sex in these books should get an advisor warning on the cover. I found myself skipping the sex scenes to look for a plot that wasn't there. The love triangle was absurd and intangible. I was sorely disappointed with the direction the author went in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very good","review":"The book is great.

The characters were like-able and well constructed. The second book was fine, but predictable and romance novel-ish. The plot drowns in descriptions. The Mammoth Hunters however, was downright painful. Pages and pages of angst, all of it contrived and repetitive. I was practically grinding my teeth in agony over the never-ending Ayla/Jondalar/Ranec love triangle. Nothing in this book is new, and all of it is predictable. Only until the last few chapters did the story finally pick up and move on (literally). If you want to know the plot, read the book jacket, and it will tell you everything you need to know. Then move on to the next book and hope it is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read","review":"One of the first reviews I saw concerning The Mammoth Hunters ranted on and on about how bad it is and how he will not buy/read any of the others. I will admit that the sex is a bit over done, but the basic story line is still excellent.The reviewer seemed to be criticizing Mrs. Auel for using her imagination in weaving a great story around what we have been able to piece together about life and conditions during that period of our history.Anyone who doesn't read the entire \\"Earth's Children\\" series is missing a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dead Horse Beaters - A Radical Manifesto","review":"Book 3 of the EC Series and the author has a time tested character, milieu, and style. By this book, however, the formula is wearing thin even, apparently, for the author. No longer satisfied with spinning a good yarn, in Mammoth Hunters the author abandons both the pretext of pure fiction and subtlety of delivery. The story takes a distant back seat to moral soapbox and is now merely a weak medium by which to promote the author's social, political, and economic views.While no literature stands completely divorced from the convictions of the author, few outside of political tracts and religious parables so brazenly and unapologetically beat the reader about the head and neck. Mammoth Hunters is a heavy-handed exercise in the author's literary self-indulgence.Love it or hate it, your appreciation of this book with probably depend more on your social and political leanings than on your enjoyment of the first two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Books","review":"Both my husband and I love these books by Auel.

Her \\"pets\\" and \\"discoveries\\" impress the Mammoth Hunters, and she is warmly accepted into their group.A love triangle develops between Ayla, Jondalar and one of the Mammoth Hunters. This part of the story is a bit frustrating since it is a misunderstanding that drags on and on until the very end.However, I liked this book, even better than the first two books. The characters are basically good, kind people, however there is strong prejudice against the \\"clan\\" people that must be overcome. This seems to be a strong message throughout the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous quality on Kindle version","review":"I am re-reading the Earth's Children series in anticipation on the new book in March. Aside from being very irritated that all but one of the series is available on Kindle in the US (what is that?) I have to comment on the awful quality. I could have typed each of these books over into a pdf and sent it to my Kindle with fewer errors. If I hadn't already read the series and known the characters, I would have been unable to get through it because of the distracting errors (I think \\"and\\" is typed \\"arid\\" every other line of the book - especially distracting in a novel describing an environment!)I loved this series the first time through and am VERY upset that using my Kindle to re-read them has detracted from the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good but getting blander....","review":"The third installment in Auel's Earth's Childrens series really begins to slow the whole story down. The focus of the plot is on Ayla having to choose between Jondalar and Ranec, the dark-skinned carver who loves Ayla almost to the point of suffocation. Much of the book is focused on love-making or flint-knapping and did get rather dull as the pages went on. However, the book was still good, don't get me wrong. The only problem I have, starting with this book, is that Ayla's character just doesn't seem to develop at all. She's the perfect goody-two shoes that she's always been and, it seems, she's so beautiful that every man on the planet wants her. I honestly believe that this book and the fourth book could have been combined into one. However, this thired installment is essential and, though it is yet a little slower then the previous book, it is still captivating at certain parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auel Review Earths Childres","review":"Its hard to believe I started reading this in the 80's.

Ayla finally meets her kind, a tribe of Mammoth hunters who are dazzled by her skills as a witch doctor.The heroine discovers their hatred against what they call \\"flat heads\\" They accept the fact she was raised by them. Finally the annoying character of Jondalar is threatenned by a black man who wants to marry Ayla. Terrible blow to his arrogant pride i bet.What I didn't like about this book is the recurrent love story between Ayla and Jondalar, and the way she sacrifices everything for him in order to get to Southern France (where his tribe lives). I guess even prehistoric people didn't have common sense at times..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the most boring entry in the series","review":"While the other books involve some fascinating action, in this one Ayla and her improbably handsome, impossibly boring boyfriend Jondalar settle down with some nice Mamutoi and learn about peace, love, and acceptance. And sex.Most of the plot is Ayla Sleeps with Hunky Blond Guy, Ayla Sleeps with Hunky Black Guy, Ayla Rescues Yet Another Animal, Ayla Teaches People To Be Tolerant of Differences.Yuck. At least the anthropological detail is interesting. Now I'll know how to skin a mammoth, next time I get lost in the prehistoric wilderness.I did enjoy it, but not that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"This book makes me want to take a shower. Not a cold one. A cleansing one. With lye soap. Where graphic sex was somehow appropriate in the \\"Valley of Horses\\" because it was Ayla's initiation into her own sexuality, it is so overboard here that you just turn the page, and if you don't do that, then you can predict exactly how many paragraphs it will take for who to do what to whom and by what point on the page someone will be overtaken by earth-shattering bliss. We've known Ayla for three books now, but Jondalar's character degenerates into nothing but a Dirk Diggler stud and he really comes across as not too smart. As if that's not bad enough, if Ayla and Jondalar aren't keeping you and everyone else in Mammoth Cave up all night tossing and turning with disgust, then Ayla's affair with Ranec won't give you a break either. Auel has done her characters a real disservice by reducing them to people who become so paralyzed by sexual pleasure that they can't do anything else until finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, bad Kindle edition","review":"The book itself, while not as good as the first two in the series, is entertaining and enjoyable, but the Kindle edition is full of very distracting errors. Obvious typos, spelling and punctuation errors, words capitalized in the middle of sentences, quotation marks either missing when a character is speaking or present when no one is speaking, and paragraphs running together are just a few of the problems. One of my favorite errors is when the wrong homonym is used: \\"Ayla was pleased that the Mamutoi had excepted her.\\" Accepted, not excepted. If the Mamutoi had excepted her the novel would have been very different.I'm really annoyed that I paid full price for such a sloppy edition of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for school libraries...","review":"i first read this book when i was 13. my parents wouldn't allow me to have pornography, but that's okay, i had the mammoth hunters :-)~ i was really interested in the primitive culture, but quickly realised there was nothing primitive about it - ayla and company could easily fit in our 20th century world. by the end of the book i expected ayla to be mastering calculus and fashioning bronze tools - clearly such a gifted girl should be the head of a matriachal society."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely NOT FOR ME","review":"I bought this book for a friend who is thoroughly enjoying reading it.

I think it's just wrong to charge somebody money for something they didn't even bother to spell check."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story loses its way","review":"I LOVED Books 1 and 2. This one begins nicely, and holds much promise, but the presentation of one of the main characters (Jondalar) deteriorates so much that it then becomes difficult to enjoy the decent portrayal of many other characters in the book. Plus the plot concerning their relationship deteriorates and is poorly treated, then hastily patched together. It is as if the main story about Ayla was so prodigious a task that the author could not properly interweave the subplot of her love interests. Very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Sequel","review":"I was thrilled to discover that the book following The Clan of the Cave Bear(which I thought was fantastic) was both captivating and interesting.

'The Clan of the Cave Bear' was pretty good - it's idea was original, it was very well written, and the main character was very easy to identify with. I've read 'The Valley of the Horses' mainly because I was wondering how Ayla was doing after being banned from the Clan... I think that this book was trying to show the \\"Others'\\" reaction to Ayla - some would like her instantly, some would grow to like her... Jean Auel just doesn't manage to give this story a life of its own, and it remains flat and 2 dimensional - all the people's reactions were to be expected from what I gathered about the others in 'The Valley of Horses'.Some other reader described the love triangle of this book as 'soap opera-ish'.

Investiagting journalist who looks into a local Marian miracle ends up going to the Vatican and to Medjugorje, Bosnia.There in Medjugorje he undergoes something of a conversion, meeting some of the visionaries and the saintly priest Fr Slavko.However, the book descends into the mess of the authors life and the book becomes something of a self therapy session.As if that weren't bad enough, he moves on from Medjugorje and looks at less authentic visions such as Scotsdale USA: lumping all these things together takes away from what should have been the thrust of the book: Medjugorje and the Vatican.So in the end I wish that the book had been edited and cleaned up. I wouldn't reccomend this book to someone who is wanting to look at Medjugorje: for that, read a real professional investigative journalist's work, 'Spark from Heaven: the Mystery of the Madonna of Medjugorje' by Mary Craig."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Have The Original Album","review":"Love this album from start to finish I'm looking to extend my collection with 16 and Absolutely Mad this is my MOOD MUSICPeace, Coop"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but do not absorb moisture!","review":"The towels are attractive, but you have to take so much time to dry a dish with them, they are too time consuming to use.

A tragedy of such dimensions should torment our collective conscience. This is exactly why it deserves a better telling than Ms. Hecht is able to offer us. The writing is amateurish and the text cries out for the editing it appears not to have been subjected to. Easy streamlining and the correction of some grammatical errors would make the book more readable and more powerful. Ms. Hecht's devotion to the cause of the Lost Boys is clearly sincere and praiseworthy, however, and she does deserve thanks for contributing to making us aware of the atrocities that go on in the world while we turn the other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset on all accounts","review":"Great on several fronts:- Comfortable on your ear- Lightweight- Great sound quality- Great battery lifeThe only reason I took one star off is the headset produces a slight cracking sound if it is not in direct line of sight of the phone, but I think most headsets do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best BT","review":"This is by far the best bluetooth device I have ever purchased.

While the sound quality was pretty good (surprisingly full bass for buds), i.e. definitely better than the stock white buds that come with your ipod, they were simply too uncomfortable to use. After purchasing a pair of Sennheiser HD-555 (HIGHLY recommend), I've come to associate Sennheiser with not just superb quality but putting serious thought into form and comfort as well. The MX51 was a serious letdown. With the foam pads, the buds fit...ok at best, (a little bit too snug for me), but the sound quality is much better with the pads. Unfortunately the foam pads fall off very easily and I lost them within a couple weeks. Without the foam pads, the buds dig into my ear, particularly the black rubber/plastic ring around the front of the buds. Thus, I find I can only wear them for maybe 10 minutes at a time before I notice that my ears are in pain and have a ring shaped indentation in them. Ouchies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound OK but ... ouch.","review":"Bought these as a replacement for my iPod headphones that came with my 3rd gen Nano.The Sennheisers just plain hurt.

Ow!I ran back to the car and went right to Target to pick up a pair of iPod buds. They sounded just as good as the Sennheisers but were a ton more comfortable.(Sure I like nice audio - I run a Denon receiver at home with B&W; speakers.

For $45 for three, you are better off investing in a much better tool to do the job. I guess if you had a 12\\" spot to redo, this tool might be good for you. However, my husband purchased the Fein Multimaster tool (that he saw at the same time on TV as an informercial) for $260 and is absolutely AMAZED at the speed and efficiency at which the tool removes grout--not to mention in a clean and consise manner.

I took a chance and when the [...] dollar shipping blade arrived, it was the same as the GGHDB Blade! Apparently they give a price break to Home Depot (as in HDB)and not to their other distributors.

This tool definitely creates dust, although it creates the least of all the methods I did try. I did switch over to a dremel type tool with a diamond grout cutting blade that lasted much longer and was a better option for me as I had a big removal job (300 s.f) I cannot recommend the Grout Grabber unless you have a small job such as bathroom floor or shower stall.Was very happy with the service from the Flooring Connection who sold the extra blades for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works But It's ...","review":"This is an easy way to remove a lot of grout and mortar in a short time....

It is in no way believable. The mother is supposed to be gay and then both her daughters are gay, come on this is not real. The lesbianism is played for all it's worth.

Our Technivorm performed worse after being treated with Cleancaf: it sputtered and wheezed a lot, and took longer to brew a pot.

This provides a very real world for the protaganist, Chris Parsons. While some conspiracy theories can seem far-fetched, Peter Spring weaves quite a believeable story.

Not familiar with Houston, I decided to at least give it a good listen. Well, i am so glad it was free. Not to be too harsh, but this is a typical singer, with a typical sound. None of the cuts really moved me. There are a few slow jams, and some rap, but other than that I don't think this cd will break any records or receive any awards. I was just not feeling this guy. Maybe his next effort will be better. But I do give the guy his props for having a cd out, However, Houston we have a problem. 1*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Houston has a some pretty good joints on this album. Of course yall know the Radio played out \\"I Like That\\", which is still good, but he also has some pretty decent joints from Hip Hop, Reggae, and R&B/Soul. I believe his mellow R&B joints were his best on his cd, especially the songs \\"Ain't Nothing Wrong\\", \\"What you say\\", and my favorite, \\"She Is\\". I also like the personal \\"Didn't Give a Damn\\". Pretty good and ends with the short track \\"It's Already Written pt. 2 (Thunder)\\", and thats a pretty decent joint where u can hear thunder and Houston singing \\"Thunder\\" Talking bout God, and puts his tribute to God.

It is obvious that Wolberg did not read Harry Potter Books and is clueless about Wicca Witchcraft. How dare he insult Harry Potter. He compares Harry to Wicca and Witchcraft. His point is........... Apparently Wohberg gets his information about the craft (wicca or otherwise) from Propaganda Grimms Brother Fairy tales that turn Wise old women healers into a mean evil witches and helping animals into boggymen. How sad that Wolberg promotes his Christian Spiritual beliefs by demonizing another's Spiritual Path. Nevertheless, there is freedom of the press. Wolberg has a constitutional right to write such a silly book. My inclination is to use the book to build a campfire for a Harry Potter hotdog and smores party.

I've never found a book to be so disappointing and frustrating. Nozick seems to have an \\"instinct for the capillary.\\" It's maddening how he'll start out on a topic that offers some promise and then go off on a tangent about one or more trivial aspects related to that topic. To give one example: He has a chapter on parenting. Not being a parent myself, I was still interested in hearing about the process of bringing another person into the world, the sacrifices, the joys and disappointments, and how it does or does not give meaning to one's life, etc. etc. Instead, I got a chapter devoted primarily to how inheritance laws should be fashioned.

I don't have a lot of experience with digital cameras yet, but having been a semi-professonal film photographer for a long time, I'd say the image quality here is very good. You have to eat up lots of memory, of course, but that's a given. With this camera, you also have to be willing to go through some fairly intricate \\"on screen\\" menus if you want to deviate from the default settings. The defaults are fine for most purposes, though. My only complaint is that while the manual is multilingual, it is not very helpful. It tells you the obvious, but does NOT tell you that if you enable X function, you will disable Y and Z functions. Although I've taken many photos that I'm pleased with, I STILL have to figure out how to enable some of the features. I'll use the 800 number once the holidays are over. Overall, great camera, mediocre manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awsome camera - 5 years ago!","review":"My parents gave me this camera five years ago when my daughter was born. Not having any real experience with cameras, I am just now learning to use the manual settings on it. Even so, I have taken some studio quality images using just the auto settings, but the images don't print well any larger than about a 5X7. My two biggest complaints are the lag time between pressing the button and the shot actually being taken, and the lens cover. I really liked the way my 35 mm had a lens cover that opened automatically when the camera was turned on, since about half the time, even after 5 years, I forget to take it off. My parents specifically bought a camera that had a viewfinder, but I must say I never use it.However, I have decided I need to upgrade for more pixels.

Like most newbies, I am constantly looking for new recipes to try. Davd Line provides plenty of good, straightforward recipes--especially for British style brews.You have to do some work to use this book if you are primarily an extract brewer (converting the all-grain amounts to extract amounts is the biggest problem, but that is simple if you look around for conversion tables). Some of the ingredients he uses (such as barley syrup) are not common in the U.S. But despite these drawbacks, the book provides the homebrewer with an excellent source of solid recipes often obtained from the breweries themselves.I highly recommend this to someone who is looking for new recipes to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"An older work full of info","review":"Dave Line originally published this book in 1978, a year before his death. While a lot has changed, and some of the terms may seem a bit unusual for those of us on the American side of the pond, there really is a lot of good information here. Of particular note is the number of great recipes here; though since the use of malt extracts were not as common twenty-five years ago, most of the recipes include raw grains and hops instead of the liquidized and pelletized versions more common today. Thus, without a knowledge of how to figure the conversion ratios, newcomers such as myself may find themselves doing things a bit more of the \\"old-fashioned\\" way. This is fine by me, but might be something to bear in mind if you are just getting your toes wet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a stage three book","review":"The first stage for a homebrewer is probably Brewing Better Beers by Ken Shales. Relatively straightforward, you can brew a good drinkable beer. The second stage would be something like Home Brewed Beers and Stouts by C J J Berry. Quite a lot of information here, some a little dated (in the 1970 edition), and again basic recipes. The third level is this book where you really start to use quite specific recipes. I was given this book in 1984 and it is the only one I use now. The guys at the Home Brew shop in Culver City, CA have been tremendously helpful in suggesting alternatives to ingredients listed in the recipes but not available in California. Having said that, I have just been given Brew Your Own British Real Ale by Graham Wheeler and Roger Protz which seems to be at a fourth level. Helpfully, it gives malt extract versions to grain recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fine!","review":"Put this in the hubby's truck it works just fine, his only compliant is that the light level isn't adjustable."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent reading; provides an insight into the dualism","review":"This book is an excellent book.

Louis Robey as Mikki Foster, and John D. LeMay as Ryan Dallion.When I tell horror fans about it today, very few can recall it. I can remember many stories from the series including the vampire's cape, cupid's arrow, etc...I'm only giving the DVD 4 stars since I read today that there are no extra features.

It looks as if someone taped the episodes from a (non-digital) TV broadcast onto VHS, and then transferred the VHS onto a DVD. I've seen a bootleg version of the series that was taped during a F13th marathon and it was no worse than these DVDs. The images are grainy and fuzzy and the colors are faded, imprecise, and far too dark. I have shows on DVD that were taped in the 1950s and the images are crisp and the colors vibrant.

There are dozens of surviving film clips of Musical Hall artists, but almost none of them are included here. There are a few brief moments of Gus Elen, Harry Champion, and the wonderful Lily Morris, and of later variety performers (Tommy Trinder, George Formby, Gracie Fields) but most of the DVD is devoted to two elderly gentlemen reminiscing about how wonderful it all was. The producers should withdraw this, and re-issue it with many of the surviving film clips included: as it is, it gives an unfortunate impression of having been made on the cheap. As Gus Elen would have said \\"It's a great big shame\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Terrific material, but not very good documentary.

It would have definately been a bit more interesting to them, then, I'm sure. I'll readily agree that it's a bit hard to read, at first (I personally read it five times in a year, each time picking up more than I did in the last read), and indeed Gibson's style may seem a bit drawn out at times. But then again, so were some of Herbert's novels. It captured my imagination, all those years ago, and did throughout _Count Zero_ and _Mona Lisa Overdrive_. Always one of the first on my list of recommended reading to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible!!!!!","review":"Anyone interested in becoming familiar with the Cyberpunk genre should not read this book. Gibson trys to place to much information in an already confusing world. A novice sci-fi reader would be lost in all the information. Definitley not what was suspected. Anyone who wants to read real cyberpunk should read Rudy Rucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried...","review":"Shallow, unlikable characters. Dimly described world with the exception of the vivid descriptions of drug highs. Weakly threaded storyline. Ridiculous amount of useless jargon. I wanted to like this book.

I am also a pretty open-minded and forgiving reader who enjoys a full gamut of what society considers \\"high\\" or \\"lowbrow\\" writing.This book was awful.

I wish I could have seen why others admire it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"I just don't understand the hype surrounding this book. It must be for some of the ideas in the book, because it is certainly not for the writing or plot. The writing is jagged, disoriented & aimless. And it's not as if I have to have fully formed, straight forward sentences to be drawn into a book. Chuck Palahniuk's writing style is not the most straight forward either, but it makes sense. I just could never truly envision the scenes depicted in Neuromancer because Gibson (at least in this book) doesn't seem to be able to paint a scene. Read 2001 by Arthur C. Clarke if you want to read a book by someone who knows about imagery, read Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson if you want modern Cyberpunk, & read Philip K. Dick if you want the REAL father of Cyberpunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal waste of time","review":"I really tried to get through this book, but half way through I just couldn't continue.

I have tried twice now, with several years between attempts, to read this book in its entirety, but I cannot. I don't understand what the \\"sensation\\" is about this book. To me it's just a chaotic jangle of images. And, frankly, it's boring. Maybe it was indeed cutting edge as a \\"cyber punk\\" novel when it first came out, maybe getting \\"jacked\\" into cyberspace was a new concept then, but this novel does nothing for me. There's nothing the author says that is insightful or thought-provoking, in my opinion. Good luck. Apparently many people give this book rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"When I got this book, I thought I was in for a delight. William Gibson is probably the most famous science fiction writer alive, and Neuromancer got rave reviews from everyone. However, after I finished reading the first page, I was lost already. The plot was almost impossible to decipher because Gibson does not introduce his characters. Basically, a random person will show up and end up being one of the main characters. Gibson's choppy desrcriptions didn't help either. I despise this book with a passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this mess of a book - Read \\"Snow Crash\\" instead","review":"I can't believe that this piece of trash is considered a \\"classic\\". Gibson cannot write to save his life! I surmise Gibson's objectives in this book as follow: - Do a really bad imitation of Hemingway style- In place of plots, throw in heaps of incoherent and cliched episodes- In place of characters, throw in the most cliched and stereotyped cut-outs possible- Confuse the heck out of readers, and they'll respect you as a 'visionary'For the paragon of cyberpunk, read \\"Snow Crash\\". If you want to know what I consider a supreme example of sci-fi (with great plot and characters), read \\"Ender's Game\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"I simply don't understand the allure of \\"Neuromancer.\\" Anyone involved with the publication of this book should take a refresher course in English. If William Gibson can get published, anyone can.It isn't Gibson's story line that's necessarily bad, just his writing. His descriptive efforts are typically wasted because they are, for the most part, unintelligible. It was very hard to picture what much of anything looked like excepting, perhaps, the Sprawl. The whole novel just seemed like a first draft.Hey, that which doesn't kill me only makes me stronger (and pickier)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not even finish it!","review":"This is the only book that I have started, and not finish. I really hated doing this, but I had no desire to see what happened after I was half way through. The book is written in strange prose with unusal terms, which make the book hard to follow. I bought this book because of all the praise which it recieved from the Amazon readers, I found it really bizarre. It may have been innovative in its time but I find it rather weird. Their is much better SF to read (aka Ender's Game)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have now words to describe...","review":"Many of the reviewers have said it amazingly well:1) Nothing is explained, I have no clue what the hell is going on.2) Very uninteresting plot and charactersSure, it had a great idea that could have inspired the Matrix...but I will take the Matrix any day over this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"William Gibson has a problem with clarity.","review":"In Neuromancer, William Gibson creates a setting that is at once fantastic and reasonable. The characters are perfectly jaded to the novel's advanced technology - plug in the toaster, jack into the matrix, ho humm. Unfortunately, when the narrator has seen it all before, he doesn't spend a lot of time describing what's happening. Gibson's narrator gives you a vague patchwork of the plot - it feels like a drunk's telling you about the movie he just watched. Further, Gibson makes no effort to tell the reader who is speaking. Gibson uses characters he doesn't introduce. Gibson rambles for so long you forget what he is writing about. Don't get me wrong - I feel that a reader should have to work with a book to understand it, but Gibson doesn't even give us a fighting chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing read, yet somewhat disjointed.","review":"Gibson's stark, distopian vision of the future is vivid and gratifying; the descriptions are fantastically detailed. Yet the jumpy, disjointed style and fast pace with which the plot moves can make the narrative hard to follow. In addition, Gibson's style keeps the reader one step behind the story's characters, and often keeps important information secret until absoluetly necessary. Overall, Neuromancer is a satisfying and evocative novel, and certainly worthy of its many praises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow, visualize, or believe","review":"I really tried. Got about a quarter of the way in and then realized I didn't remember anything that got me to that point in the story. I was just reading the words in order and not retaining anything. It just didn't excite me or engage me. Too many characters are shuffled in and out without explanation or reason. Had to flip back to previous pages to remember who they were and where from. The dialogue is very vague with regards to who is speaking and who they are speaking too. I put it down and looked up the plot on wikipedia to orient myself and try to continue. I was even more confused by the plot summary there. Sorry, not gonna finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've got Spy-Tech!","review":"If you're a fan of science fiction, or think you might want to explore the sub-genre of cyberpunk fiction, Neuromancer is an essential read. However, this doesn't mean it's the greatest read you'll ever experience.Neuromancer features a convoluted plot and a host of characters so flat you'll be able to distinguish them only by their signiture traits (I admit, I found it pretty tough to keep them all straight).Neuromancer's best selling-point, however, is its phenomenal world-building and speculative technology. Gibson represents cyberspace in the graphical \\"Lawnmower Man\\" vein which has all but died in more recent literature (see Tad Williams' Otherland for a more recent stab at this depiction); the city (district?) of Chiba, on the other hand, where the action begins, is vividly detailed and vibrant.Enjoy the book's love of technology, deal with the plot and characters. It's a short, fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is IT","review":"So much has been said about this, so I'll be brief.Whether or not this is the ORIGINAL book of the genre, which is only something debatable on vague rumors of short stories published in university papers and other such weak claims, doesn't really matter...because this is the definitive work of CP.The Matrix. Terminator. Etc. Most everything after Neuromancer and some other Gibson works borrowed generously from them.I would recommend this book whether you like CP or not...if you're already a CP fan, you've either read this, or you really can't say you know much about the genre. If you haven't, read it...even if you've read other cyberpunk books and didn't like them....this is the rare book that tarnscends it's category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult read.","review":"I read often, and love reading. Something about this book made reading it very difficult. The storyline jumps around often (and skips over events) and there are so many characters that it's had to follow.

I've read this book four times, and it is one of my favorites. Of course anyone who claims he is the greatest writer of the 20th centuary needs a head-check. The style is kind of strange, but I think one should view this book as free verse poetry. Its a style of reading that is better visualized and experienced rather than \\"read\\" like a typical book.

I was taken in by the action and enamored with the setting, but the characters weren't even decent people.

The book is worth reading for no other reason than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book that Started the Cyberpunk Revolution","review":"In 'Mona Lisa Overdrive,' Gibson writes about a documentary called 'Antarctica Starts Here.' 'Neuromancer' could easily be titled 'Cyberpunk Starts Here.' Tag along with Case, Molly, and Dixie Flatline as they careen through a distopian future, where real life is an approximation of cyberspace, and the only signposts are written in Gibson's trademark prose. This book has been copied and rehashed so many times that it will probably seem familiar, even if you've never read it. But \`Neuromancer' is the source. Every major idea in the cyberpunk/technogoth genre started with this book. To call \`Neuromancer' brilliant would be six kinds of understatement. It's crazy, riveting, amazing, enlightening, and a lot of fun. If you've never read it, prepare for a weird but delicious treat. I've read it about six times, and I'm still not tired of it.Jeff Edwards, Author of 'Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but completely shallow","review":"Hot chicks with bio-mod razor nails? Shallow characters, shallow world. None of the humor, quirkiness, and philosophical insights as authors like Philip K. Dick, Lem, or Alfred Bester. Mostly style, very little substance. If Cyberpunk were a type of Rock & Roll it'd be 80's glam, lipstick & hair bands. Oodles of D&D; Nerd 'Cool Factor'with hardly the philosophical intrigue of the highly derivative Matrix trilogy. While I'm sure this is blasphemy to the cyberpunk fans everywhere, the chip on my shoulder left by books like Neuromancer and Snow Crash is taking Geek Chic at face value, and realizing there's nothing behind the curtain--nothing beneath the sunken eyes of drug addicts and biotech junkies.More deserving of a comic book than a novel! Then again, I can see why this would have had more impact in the 1980s when it was originally published."},{"rating":"2","title":"He does not write for such ninnies as cannot read","review":"The many negative reviews of this unparalleled work all have the same complaints: the book is confusing, they can't follow the story, it's boring, and so on, and so on.

On reading the book, the use of technospeak and just the poor American English and grammar made it a slog to get through. I had to log on when back from holiday to see if I was alone to find the writing style hard work and the lack of a clear plot and non existent characters.

I believe that the movie was just absolutely fantastic and amazing and any other adjective that I can think of (Just not at the moment). So, I picked up this book from the library to see what it was all about.It was pretty good basically sums it up. It had innovative settings and ideas and was generally awesome all around, but I just didn't like how sometimes certain technologies were never explained or were only barely mentioned. That's fine if it is just mentioned in passing, but when you linger on them and detail them without saying what they actually do, that kind of frustrated me.Other than that, this book was what I like to call perfect.

I just finished reading it again, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it's weathered the intervening decades very well. This book created a genre by envisioning a wired world when, at the time, microcomputer's barely existed and ARPANET hadn't even started the move away from the Defense/Academic community to become the internet. It's truly amazing that such a book is still worthwhile today. It does have some minor problems with the characters and pacing, but those are insignificant compared to its historical significance.

In my opinion, it's not worth the 4 and 5 stars I've been seeing in the reviews when compared to other sci-fi masterpieces! The characters were shallow and there wasn't anything to like in them.

Well, no.. At best this might be somewhat entertaining to the average wannabe computer nerd but for me... it just doesn't work. Gibson admits he knows practically nothing about computer science, AI, etc.. and this book proves it with flying colors.

I found it hard to understand from the very beginning. The characters and plots were just thrown at the reader without much of an explanation, and I was lost throughout most of the story. I didn't find the whole idea of the book very appealing, either. I was disinterested from the start, which is probably due to the fact that I had no idea what was happening or what had happened in the book. Overall, I would say that for all the good reviews the book had, I was disappointed with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A razor bladed tongue and a dirty future","review":"sentences were sharp and brief; if the future could get any darker, then we are truly doomed. I enjoyed Gibson's rapier style and his simplistic method of getting emotion from his characters.

You know they call it \\"important\\", \\"master-piece\\" etc., but you also know you'll never like it because it is beyond of being readable and enjoyable.When you read 200 pages of \\"Neuromancer\\" you still won't have a clue what is all about, who's fighting who, where, how and why? This book may pass only as a travesty of its own genre.

So, when I began reading this book I was probably bias in many ways. However, when I actually got into this novel, I realized that it was not my bias that was the problem; it was the book. The only way you can enjoy this story is if you are a computer techy, or if you happen to know the japanese language. I spent half of my time online looking for a freaking japanese dictionary so I could understand what the author was talking about. And, by the time I actually got back to the book, I had forgotten what I had previously read. If the author had provided a glossary of terms for incomprehensible language he used, then perhaps the story would have been easier to follow. But, he failed to do this and in the process lost much of his audience. Do not read this book if you do not have time to spend with it. Do not read this book if you value your sanity. In fact...just don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A jargon-filled comic book","review":"Absolutely unreadable; I couldn't force myself farther than 100 pages into this morass. The \\"story,\\" such as it is, has all the depth and interest of a video game with pretentious techno-babble commentary. Worse yet, the book takes itself *so* seriously. There's not even the unintentional humor one sometimes finds in spectacular flops like _The Bridges of Madison County_ or _Plan 9 From Outer Space_. _Neuromancer_ is leaden and plodding; an absolute dud. This is the kind of book that leads people to erroneously dismiss science fiction as shallow, nerdy drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a minute! What just happened?","review":"This could have been a good book. It had likable characters with interesting backgrounds and it was filled with new ideas and storylines. What went wrong? I don't think the author was able to fully express those things through the writing. There was a lack of description when there was high action and sometimes no transition between scenes. I often found myself asking, \\"What just happened?\\" About halfway through the book I had to go to the Wikipedia entry for the book to find out what was going on. I think that shows an issue in how the book was written if the audience cannot understand what is happening. Maybe this story would be a better fit for a movie or a different author."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"Quite frankly, it pains me to give this book even one star, but there's nothing lower.Picture the worst spaghetti western you've ever seen. Now get rid of the horses and hats and replace them with computers. There, now you have Neuromancer. The plot is so cliched it hurts. A lot. With a flat plot and characters that are hard to give a damn about, I was left feeling completely bamboozled by the people who said this book was a masterpiece of cyberpunk.If you want a great book of the cyberpunk genre, read Snow Crash, by Neal Stephenson instead.And for those who said it was a mind-rattling, brilliant book: read \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\". Then we'll talk about mind-rattling brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inexplicably overrated, awful pulp","review":"I tried to read this book as I was lead to believe that it's similar to Philip K. Dick's writings. First time I could not progress further than about 50 pages. The writing was so awful, the story so forced, cliched- like a pretentious Barbara Cartland. But I tried again a few months later. I lasted to some love/sex scene, which made me laugh and throw this garbage away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"If you want to know how seriously this book should be taken, you have only to look at the kind of people who give it rave reviews. I'm afraid that an endless series of techno-jargon does not a novel make, and the fact that the jargon is never explained confirms the book's pretentiousness. When a new item of tech-terminology is introduced and not elaborated on, the reader can only conclude either that the author is being lazy or that he is hoping a simple-minded readership will assume that he knows better than them. The whole novel is suffused with the sensation of the author chancing his arm.Neuromancer is an uninteresting, unimaginative and ultimately daft book whose inexplicable popularity is just further evidence that the tendency to mistake opacity for profundity is becoming as common in fiction as it is in literary criticism.

Those of you truly practiced in this technique have obviously noted the enhanced perception of literary nuance that goes in concert with reading and yoga. Each pose becomes the conduit through which the words reach through your body and into reality. In downward facing dog, the nature of the pose creates a lane from your chops to your knave - out of which each world flows into the multicolor universe.I picked up this book recently because I couldn't recall if I had ever read it before or not. In the library of infinity that is my knowledge, it is sometimes hard to recall everything I have consumed. In particular, I wondered why I had never read this whole series of books.Now I know why.

How can you not at least get those few pages right? The editor that handled this should be ashamed of himself/herself and fired on the spot. This tainted my entire experience because I found a hideous typo before I even got into the book. I hate typos and in an anniversary edition of the book, it is a true shame.Lousy editing on this edition, no doubt about it.

Well, after the first time, you start noticing all those sentences that Neal should have either added to, taken awayfrom, or left out entirely.Sure, Stephenson is more friendly to the MTV generation and all of those \\"JAVA is God\\" people, but for great writing and prophetic utterances, look to Neuromancer.Not to mention Molly, THE coolest character from any book ever written, plays a key role in NM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vision, but not much else.","review":"The plot was weak, really weak.

I am used to reading books with a preface or something that gives you a little idea as to what is happening at the beginning of the book.

It's true that much of Gibson's lingo and technology is not clearly defined or explained. This is because Gibson wants the book to read like a novel, not a VCR instruction manual. Any less exposition would be incomprehensible, but any more would be terribly condescending, making the reader feel like a tourist in Gibson's future rather than a participant.

For the first 1/2 of the book there is no plot...just a patchwork of picaresque scenes. Once Gibson finally decides to move the plot forward, he immediately falls into SF cliche.I was quite disappointed with this book, as I do enjoy Neal Stephenson's and Bruce Boston's works and decided to give the \\"father of cyberpunk\\" a try.I guess if great style is your thing (a la Tom Robbins or, dare I say :-) Robert Stone) you might get something out of this, but if real characters and an inventive plot are among the things you can't do without, pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story poorly written","review":"The plotline itself wasn't bad.

I read fiction to transport myself out of my day to day world an into someone else's. Gibson's world in Neuromancer was dreadfully dull and grimy. The plot and characters were so disjointed that I started thinking about things I needed to do at work - or whether or not I fed the dog. It's time to put this book down and watch my fingernails grow.Yes, there are very cool and prescient concepts explored in this book. Gibson should be credited for his contributions to this genre.

I think that Gibson's later work -Count Zero, etc.- was much much better. While Gibson's was the first science fiction book to coin \\"firsts\\" such as the words \\"cyberspace\\" and \\"jacking\\" into the Net, consider that at the time it was originally published -1984- the entire genre of science fiction during that timeframe SUCKED. While I'll agree that Gibson singlehandedly took the genre off life support, Neuromancer left me largely unimpressed. It borrowed heavily from a title published in 1974 entitled Dhalgren. And had more people taken notice of this book, then I doubt Neuromancer would have won the accolades that it did.

I couldn't care less what happened to any of the characters and was most relieved when I finished the book.The jargon is way out of my league (this coming from an Engineering graduate with a fair background in computers) and it is never explained. Gibson should have used a similar style to Michael Crichton's Great Train Robbery where he explains the mental sentiment of the time and helped the reader understand the setting. Instead he assumes the reader knows what he's talking about, and crams a lot of the jargon into a dense mess that was mostly incoherent to me.If possible find an excerpt of this book and read it.

These attributes also apply to science fiction. True, a book like Neuromancer tries to \\"push the envelope\\" by diving into a story where reality as we know it is spun on its head. But I expect the author to help ease the reader into understanding his alternate reality. Mr Gibson seemingly chose not to do this, ... Reading Neuromancer is akin to completing a jigsaw puzzle without a completed picture to guide you, and in the end one discovers several pieces are missing. I assume Mr Gibson understands the complete picture. ...

The characters were weak. There was no spark of romance. It was unreal. People don't fall in love with people they have only fantasized about. There was no ambiance of Seattle or the Northwest. When I pick up a Nora Roberts book I feel transported away to whatever locale and into the lives of her characters. There was no feeling of escape to this story.

I have never bought a record (out of hundreds over the years) that I can remember enjoying any more than this one, \\"Bandera\\". It is absolutely a superb album from start to finish. Lloyd Maines production is a strong plus. Do yourself a favor-if you like John Prine or Robert Earl Keen, you will flip over this CD.

It's true that \\"Bandera\\" is less polished than his later two CDs, which are also great. However, *this* is the one I keep popping in the CD player. \\"Desperate Times\\" is quite a song, \\"Red Letter Day\\" really sticks in my head ....

He brought a copy of his second album Life of the Party and I immediately fell in love with it. I then got a copy of Bandera and I loved it even more.. This guy has to me what Steve Earle had in his early years, with Guitar Town and Exit 0.. This is an album about every day people getting caught up in the act of trying to live in this old world. Charlie Robison is an outstanding songwriter and a great singer as well.. If you like real country music with a twist and some soul get this album.. I listen to it all the time and I have been for over a year now.. I rank it right up there with Guitar Town.. It is well worth the bucks.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up and Comer","review":"This CD is great and the only thing better than listening to this and laughing with friends is listening to him live at a Texas bar.

But willing to give the benefit of the doubt I moved on to this 2nd book way of Amazon and after having read it felt his second had yet to redeem the first. It suffers from poor editing, poor image reproduction and questionable image use. The stories are so so and I felt the print quality of it didn't justify the price whatsoever in the end.

After a straightforward introduction, expert Ethan Wilde leads us through a number of detailed scripts for use in apps like Filemaker and your browser. However, this book cannot be called a tutorial in any true sense of the word, and anyone looking for a reasonably comprehensive guide (as in Visual Quickstart's excellent volume for HTML 4) should look elsewhere. Several useful links for future learning are provided, but through no fault of the author, the carefully explained examples may not be relevant to even a plurality of users. Both OS9x and OSX are explored; given the limitations of space, this only further dilutes the final result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I hoped","review":"This book deals not so much with a broad understanding of Applescript as much as it does how to do some basic things in different applications. The introductory section is great, but some of the really needed things for folks doing real automation, like creating and saving files under multiple names, printing files to multiple printers or appending files are not even touched. The examples are given good context, which is a plus, but I'm not sure this title was worth the cash, especially since a lot of the application titles have new versions out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor examples","review":"If you really want to understand Applescript I highly recommend you don't do like I did and waste your money on a poorly written guide. This book has a great lack of examples which actually show you the syntax of anything and you can waste hours trying to find out how to even code a simple path string in this book, which I did last week. I took my first programming classes 30 years ago in college. There are many poorly written computer books out there and this one is a classic in that category.

My initial impression was that it was too OS 9 specific, and that it would be better to wait for an OS X version. I've since spent more time with it and my first impression was wrong.The book was printed in 2002, so I don't think we'll see the next edition until 2004. That's too long to go without this book. Even if you live in the OS X world, there's more than enough OS X or global AppleScript content to justify the purchase.I've found the examples to be quite clear and very helpful. If it had more OS X coverage I'd give it five stars, but it well deserves a four star rating. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"Unclear if my problems learning AppleScript from this book stem from the book itself or from the language.Programming concepts are very faintly discussed. Should you, the reader, ever dare to diverge from recipes in the text, you'll have to search online to find more thorough discussion of the language. And then, you'll be sifting through all the tutorials that date from pre-OS X.Seek another book if you can find one, or better yet, stick to a real programming language like Perl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synopsis","review":"If you do not yet have a chess rating and are not particularly interested in competing in chess tournaments then this is the book for you!

People on the receiving end will be convinced you have either stepped into a wind tunnel, or perhaps you have suddenly been struck with emphyzema. This also extends to voice activated calling, which becomes little more than standing in acorner hiding from the wind and screaming the same three words over and over causing everyone nearby to move asiduously away from you.

I use it at work, it is very very good. or for a bigger version go for the Vitesse 7-Cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing!","review":"I have read the other reviews (and did before I bought mine), but I also have friends who have owned these and never had trouble. Mine has operated very well for the past 7 months without a hitch. I use it daily, as a complete tea addict and caffeine hound. It heats a full kettle of water in about 3 or 4 minutes and the kettle itself is simple and tasteful enough to bring out of the kitchen to refill teacups with hot water for guests. As opposed to many of those short, fat little bulbous kettles that don't suit anyone's decore.Perhaps there was a bad batch of these and I'm the only one that got lucky? Who knows, but I would buy it again in a minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third in the series - Ami's story","review":"The third in this series from Denise Hampton. In this story it is Ami's time to find a new love. But, along the way she must also deal with the advances of a King who wants all that he desires in his bed. The King also likes to play games with his subjects, as a way of amusement. Ami on the other hand is drawn to this hired knight but at the same time he is but a commoner and therefore below her station. If you liked the first 2 you will also enjoy this one. In fact I liked this one as much as I did the first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Warrior's Game","review":"The quality of this book was below stated condition. I will not buy again!!!!!!!

He now wants to look for his warrior father so that he would be able to be highly respected and change his name of his 14th birthday to a name more proper for a man, but the only thing he knows about his father is that he has a chrysanthemun tattoo and a he is a Heike warrior.I thought this book was quite good. It had many dialogues, a good storyline, and some action. Most of all, I liked how the book was easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very good book","review":"I recommend this to students and teachers because it was a very good book. This book is about a Japanese teenage boy in Feudalk Japan. His mother died and he is on a journey to find his father.

I recommend it to every one.","review":"This is a great book. I recommend this to teacher to assign to their students. The reason why is for teachers who are teaching their students about feudal Japan. It is action packed book. I recommend it to students and children who enjoy knight-like sumarai. I really enjoy this book. I have this book at least three times. I also recommend this to people who want to learn about the life of feudal Japan. This book is about a boy named Muna, a boy looking for his father. Dreaming about how his father looks like. He lives on the information that his father is a samarai warrior. He looks for a sign of the chrysanthemum. He sneaks on a ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Novel we expected...","review":"My seventh grade English class found this Novel to be difficult to understand and enjoy. Not only did they find this Novel dry and rather boring, but also confusing. Although we discussed the details surrounding Muna, his father--a samurai warrior with a chrysanthemum tattoo on his arm, and the wars between the Genki and Heike clans, is was difficult for my students to really plunged themselves into this book. All in all, they couldn't wait to finish.Each year I assign this Novel I notice the same results: students seem to lack interest in the characters and adventure. Unlike Beowulf, by Robert Nye, Sign lacks a really \\"hero.\\" The amoral and seemingly selfish acts of Muna allow the reader few feelings other then pity. Indeed, an excellent alternative to this Novel would be The Giver."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever read...","review":"This is the worse book I have ever read! I am an avid reader and know a lot about books. But this is the absolute worst! I hated it! Thank heavens it was so short! The ending is totally unsatisfying and seems like Katherine Paterson hated the book too and just wanted to finish it. Depressing things happen to the characters-- especially that girl--and it is just no good at all. If I could give it less then 1 star, I would. I want to tell everyone thinking of reading this book, DON'T! So awful. I hate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible......terrible.....terrible.....terrible....book :P","review":"I would agree with the first review that this book would not be good for students. I am doing a revision of lists of reading books for a prep school and honestly this book would not be choice.

I would definetly recommend the GIVER and Lois Lowry, a fabulous author, of whom I've met."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written brain candy.","review":"I've read too many coming of age 5th grade school reading and this book really clinches it. I read it thinking, is this what were giving to our children? This book never made me think or use my imagination, it even provides pictures! Also, the necessary \\"happy ending\\" confirmed my belief that Katherine Paterson is just a bad writer. If you want to give your students a coming of age children/young adult book buy \\"The Giver\\" a book that really opened new worlds to me when I was in 5th Grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly not the best book in the world....................","review":"I didn't like this book very much. I like the fact that it took place in feudal Japan. The rest of the book could definatly be better. The book also leave a lot of loose ends. Like what happened to certain characters and if they are sure what some people said is true. The book was about a boy named Muna. At first Muna doesn't like his name because it means \\"no name\\". His mother recently passed away and he is look for his dad, a big tall samurai. His mom also told him that his dad has a tatoo of a chrysanthemum on his shoulder. Muna meets a guy named Takanobu. Takanobu takes care of Muna on thier way to the capital. Then there is a fire and Takanobu dies. Then he meets a swordmaker named Fukuji. Fukuji takes care of him for a year. But then .........oh no!! I said too much. You have to read the book to find out what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muna is on a journey to find his father after his mom dies.","review":"This book was good because the author described the book. This book was about a boy, Muna, whos mother died and told him to look for his father. I think there should be more action because it was kind of boring because there wasn't enough fighting. This book was good to read because it was nicely written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was poorly written.","review":"I didn't really enjoy reading this book. I thought the story was pretty boring and that some parts of the story was confusing. Like did Muna really find his father? Was Takanobu his father? I don't know because I got confused at that part of the story. I think the author should of wrote this book less confusing so I or others that got confused could of understood parts of the story better. Steven Yum, ASI"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, at best","review":"_Sign of the Chrysanthemum_ is a halfhearted stab at _Johnny Tremain_, set in feudal Japan. Again, young lad searches for his identity and his father. Again, young lad is swept up in political events beyond his understanding. Unfortunately, the writing is nowhere near as vivid, nor are the characters nearly as sympathetic in _Sign_.There's got to be a better look into feudal Japan for young readers than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the key books for an enjoyable Cambodia trip","review":"This book proved great for navigating Cambodia. While some of the information is, inevitably, a bit dated, it did help me get around much easier than if I was left to my own devices.The other books that helped me a lot wereGuide to Cambodia: The Temples of AngkorandAngkor Essential: four articles about Angkor past and present.Finally, to really appreciate what life in ancient Angkor was actually like, I strongly recommend a novel,God King of Angkor: A Novel of Tyrannyby Gregory A.

Good for the basics and information, actually the best that I could find.It however was not fully updated. The update mainly has to do with prices.

We hired a driver that pointed us to the right direction for 3 days, 2 nights. Although the book was helpful, if you want to know the vast history and symbology surrounding these massive temples, i recommend hiring a guide. Cambodia is very hot and humid, so trying to read the descriptions in 100 degrees weather while sweating profusely is not such a great idea. The book gives a good background and orientation of the area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I need","review":"We are about to leave for SE ASia and I haven't finished reading all the hard copy books I bought in order to bone up on all that we will see.

I understand that hotel prices change over time, but prices I bought this book fresh off the press last month. Prices at Renakse are now a whopping $76-100/night and they have been since the end of 2004.The author's writing style is great, but you may want to pick up an older version of the book (4th edition seems just the same as this one when I read it before getting this one) and save the extra bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Rough Guide","review":"In the group I was traveling with we had both the Rough Guide and the Lonely Planet guide and we consistently found the Rough Guide superior to the Lonely Planet in terms of narration, history, accuracy, ease of use, and better maps.

Neither book was entirely comprehensive but the Rough Guide was a must have to point you in the right direction to find more info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonely Planet has lost it.","review":"LP used to be the leader, especially in SE Asia. The frame of this book was written quite well and I'm sure a long time ago it would have been informative, but alas this book hasn't been properly updated in maybe a decade so pretty much everything is outdated and misleading. LP continues to rake in money selling books but they don't take the responsibility of keeping them up to date even though they continue to re-package them with glossy new cover photos as \\"new editions\\" but they contain almost no new data. Based on this principle I would not recommend to buy LP any longer and specifically the Cambodia guide. My experience traveling to Cambodia with the LP guide changed my opinion about Lonely Planet forever. Get a clue LP!

Bobby Valentin's subsequent Fania releases \\"Algo Nuevo\\" (1970), \\"Rompecabezas\\" (1972), \\"Soy Boricua\\" (1973) and the absolute classics \\"Rey Del Bajo\\" and \\"In Motion\\" (both 1974) were all much better and more enjoyable Salsa albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"conditioner","review":"did not like the smellit did not leave my hair soft and shinylike the for color treated hair product more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work well with my hair","review":"I have fine, straight, long, smooth hair, and when I used this product with the Fekkai Full Volume Shampoo, it left my hair feeling clumpy, sticky, and almost brittle.

No. Other classics on here are the sing-a-long \\"I Just Wanna\\", \\"Domino\\", and \\"God Gave Rock & Roll To You II\\". We also get the typical \\"love\\" songs like \\"Take It Off\\" and \\"Spit\\". Major fans of this disc might also like \\"Alive III\\". Overall, in the midst of the alternative revolution, Kiss still delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"KISS has Revenge!","review":"This is a very good CD. I believe there is one CD you must own from the post-makeup years, Revenge. \\"Unholy\\" has a hook that stays in your head all day long. So does the anthemic \\"God Gave Rock N Roll To You II\\", that has the best electric guitar intro ever. \\"I Just Wanna\\" sounds like KISS from the 70's. \\"Domino\\" is a great song that compares to Christine Sixteen. Bruce's guitar really shines here. KISS packs a surprise on this album, \\"Carr Jam 1981\\", which shows that Eric was such a great drummer. Buy this album, it's worth the cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"revenge","review":"This is by far the best album KISS has released since Creatures. The songs are evil, dirty and hard hitting. Well done. It's a shame they didn't follow this formula for future releases. At least they had a quality guitarist and drummer on this one and not the outdated playing of Ace & Peter. Sorry, when their early stuff came out I was only like 4 or 5, but Eric Singer blows Peter Cris out of the water.

This album is the home of the cheese anthem \\"God Gave Rock and Roll To You\\" sure to get any suburban ... thinking that by listening to Kiss instead of doing homework, his life will somehow get better. The song \\"I Just Wanna\\" is pure Spinal Tap material. The joke to the song of course is that when Paul Stanley sings \\"I just wanna forget you\\" he pauses during the word \\"forget\\" to make you think he might say the big F-word. Oooh Paul, how menacing. Why not have the nerve to actually say the F-word? And, the song \\"Domino\\" actually makes me hope that there is indeed a hell and that Gene Simmons gets to spend an eternity rotting in it. Not for any of his immoral behavior, but for the fact that song is so [darn] stupid and juvenile.

Fans of melodic metal got a kick butt record here. With the classic song 'god gave rock and rool to you 2\\" and 'unholy' on it you just can't go wrong. The band was still able to put out a really great cd in 92 and thrash was just sidebar at that time. If only things would go back to the great melodic metal. Anyways; the band had put out a number of huge selling 1980's discs ,although'made in the shade' was my least favorite of that decade but it was still a decent disc by any standard, so it was great to see them follow that up with this one. If you are a fan of melodic metal and don't give a whit about thrashy style or such then this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Crazy Nights/Hot In The Shade","review":"I feel embarrassed for Kiss. This is supposed to be a comeback album? It's really just boring. Much better albums exist out there. Hell, Kiss made a lot better albums. Anything pre-solo is great. Anything post The Elder through Animalize is damn good. Anything after Animalize is just is plain awful except for Revenge. It's not terrible like Crazy Nights or Hot In The Shade but there really aren't any redeeming qualities about it either. If you liked this album that's great and you are welcome to.

The album is contrite and obvious. They seemed content to become [copy] artists, stealing from everyone including Zeppelin and Metallica. The CD completely lacks the soul of earlier Kiss albums.

It makes a great coaster, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVENGE Sadly isn't good","review":"First off, I'm a HUGE KISS fan but I draw the line at Creatures of the Night, once they took the make-up off, i stopped listening. I always dug the song 'Domino' though and figured after all these years that i'd give REVENGE a chance since i've always heard it's where 'Creatures' left off...But this CD sounds just like the other late 80's stuff they did, just a little grittier which doesn't make it any better. This CD is just a little too much of what I didn't like about KISS in the mid to late 80's. When i listen to these songs it's hard not to imagine Paul Stanley in Neon Pink/Green prancing around Crazy Nights-style.

The average reader will be able to guess at the ending about a paragraph into the story. Second, the \\"dangerous women\\" seem to be stuck on sadism against men originating in lack of or too much of - you got it, sex. And finally, apart from one or two selections, the shorts derive their plot line from mainly noirish elements...cops, tough guys...bleak urban landscapes, and yes...dangerous femmes fatales...give me a break.You want dangerous women?

Unfortunately, the horrendously loud grinder would wake the whole household and seemed to take forever to dribble out a small pot of coffee. After a few uses, I tossed it in a cabinet ... generally underwhelmed. I recently got a Cuisinart Grind & Brew and absolutely love it. The grinding process is a little noisy, but not unreasonably so, and it lasts only a few seconds. Heavenly brew fills the thermal carafe in minutes. Even my husband, who initially didn't see the point of getting a coffeemaker with a grinding feature, now is a convert. He likes it so much, he wishes we had bought the 12-cup maker instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex, not hot enough, hard to clean","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother and returned it within a few days.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST coffee maker!","review":"Well, it sounds like a good idea to have coffee grinder and coffee maker all in one, but Cuisinart did NOT get it right. The grinding function is completely high maintenance. You have to wash out all the grinding parts after ever use and you end up wasting coffee because that compartment gets wet while brewing causing the newly ground coffee to stick to it. Also, plan on waking up the whole family when you're making your morning coffee, because the grinder is SO loud. And if that's not bad enough, the compartment that holds the freshly ground coffee often pops open while the coffee is brewing spewing coffee & grinds all over the place. Seriously, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one!","review":"This is the worst design for a grind and brew coffee machine. Not only do the coffee grinds get all over the inside and outside of the machine, making it a total mess, but so does the water. So you end up with a wet mess of coffee grinds every time you brew a cup of coffee. The mess builds up in the grinder and prevents it from spinning. So you get a good cup of coffee at the expense of spending 15 minuntes of cleaning and maintenence every time you use this machine. Not worth the $150 or less that it sells for!**Check out the Melita grind and brew that sells for under $100. Its got a much better design and makes great coffee.

Using the grind option makes very weak coffee so you have to fill the basket with more coffee so there's no point. Without the grind option it's just another coffee maker.

Everytime you pour water out of it (or coffee) you are GUARANTEED to spill a little on the countertops. Next, the steam does not escape this machine at all, so you have to open the thing up after every pot to dry it out.My wife and I have had the coffee machine for a little over 2 years. After about 6 months, we had to start figuring out a way to trick the machine into grinding and brewing -- it involved turning the \\"on\\" switch a little to the left, then quickly to the right.

Well, lets start with the grinder. The grinding unit is plastic with a coarse finish, that the grinds cling to, causing probably 1/3 of them to remain in the grinder. This requires you to disassemble the grinder and clean it thoroughly for every pot. This issue also causes the coffee to be very weak. The grinder makes an ungodly amount of noise (it literally scares small children). Grinds will get caught in the latch for the basket causing it to spring open while brewing. This, in turn, causes the brew-pause valve to close, even though water continues to reach the basket, overflowing it all over the floor. Try grinding your own beans? Don't grind them too fine, and make sure you don't put in enough for a decent pot of coffee as it will overflow the basket.On the plus side?1. Digital clock keeps decent time2. The Carafe is actually very nice3.

But the most irritating characteristic of this machine is that you never, ever know when it's going to overflow all over itself and the counter - ruining the entire pot of coffee. Just as another reviewer stated...it will do it 2-3 mornings in a week and then go another 2-3 weeks before doing it again. And yes, we use the same grind each time, same brand of coffee, same amount of water and always place the filter basket as the instruction booklet warns. We've cleaned up our last mess today.

Everyday you have to clean the grinder because it gets wet during brewing, the basket and of course, the carafe. But wait, there's more!

The second has an entirely different problem...it doesn't brew all 12 cups at once! I do everything I need to do to make a full pot of coffee and it will brew three and then beep that it's done and I have to start it again (without the grinder) and it brews another couple of cups and beeps and then I have to do it a couple more times before it fills up! I've tried cleaning it and anything I can think of and it doesn't improve. So, since it takes about a half an hour to brew one pot of coffee, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Although I tend to agree with the criticims expressed in other reviews regarding the need to clean the machine after every use, i'm wondering what those buyers were thinking before they made their purchase. Of course you have to clean this machine after every use! If you don't want to hassle with making coffee, stick with a simple drip machine. However, doing that means you will miss out on the superior java this machine produces. It's simple to use, simple to take apart, and easy to clean. It's important, however, to ensure the grinding \\"basket\\" is DRY before you start the machine. Otherwise, the ground coffee tends to stick in the grind basket. My only complaint, so far, is it's next to impossible to completely empty the coffee pot without first taking off the lid. Not a big problem, though.

The Macy's people wouldn't take it back, the Cuisinart people said they can only offer me 20% off a new same item (super idea! same crappy product!) from them and now I'm stuck with this DEFECTIVE coffeemaker. I haven't done anything to it except make coffee as a normal person would, I even went above and beyond to de-calcify it as they say and yet, NOTHING WORKS! DO NOT buy this item!

I thought it was a much nicer version than the standard coffee maker I used before....that is until I used it for a couple weeks. Things I can't stand about this model: 1) You can't store beans in it, so you have to load the necessary beans everytime you brew. 2) This is by far the LOUDEST coffee grinder I have ever heard (think airline engine loud!). 3) The unit itself leaks from somewhere (still haven't figured out where, but we keep finding water nearby). 4) The coffee pot/carafe itself is poorly designed, as it is extremely slow to pour coffee and a bit awkward. Unfortunately for us, we tossed the box and paperwork, so we're stuck with it. Don't make the same mistake.

I am over it and switching brands for my new coffee maker.I love the way this Cuisinart coffee maker looks, and how little space it takes up on the counter. I like the grind and brew features, it's easy to program, not that much of drag to clean, though oyou have ot work to get the coffee oils and dust out of the carafe lid; but the thermal carafe is a hassle to pour from--I end up having to completely invert it!I am VERY disappointed in the reservoir leak problem, and since I am 3 for 3 with this machine, making one 6 pot cup a day, I just can't recommend it--unless you want to give a wedding gift to a couple you don't care for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Coffee","review":"We got this as a gift and were excited, but ultimately disappointed.I would rather have the old $15 Mr.Coffee back.

Rinsing will not clean the accumulated coffee from the bean reservoir or the chute. You must clean with either a sponge, paper towel, or your finger to scrape the residue. And, if you use an oily coffee like Starbucks, the buildup is just awful. It takes literally 5-7 minutes to clean the parts (properly) on this coffeemaker. The machine does produce good coffee. The upside is I'm drinking less coffee now because you don't dare have a second pot in the morning, unless you're on vacation and not in a hurry.

The one thing I really do like about the machine is the thermos carafe, it keeps the coffee hot for hours and doesn't burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably weak coffee","review":"This makes the absolute worst coffee I have ever had. Even filling the grinder to the maximum and putting in only a half carafe of water, the coffee comes out a pale brown with only a vague bitter flavor. No flavor of coffee at all. This is with the same French Roast beans we always use.I am absolutely stunned at how bad it is. We are definitely going back to our old coffee machine and giving this away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to do this but...","review":"This is a beautiful machine-- will probably be better on a movie set rather than in your kitchen. This is a great company that makes a great food processor, but the coffee from this machine taste bad there's no other way to say that... lukewarm at its hottest and very metallic! Machine is very difficult to clean , and there are a lot of parts to clean. After one week with this machine we returned it, and went back to using our mostly plastic [money maount]Braun drip machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks all over when pouring...be careful!","review":"I bought this coffee maker for my husband for Christmas. It makes great coffee but the carafe leaks when pouring. I badly scalded my hand and will not let guest pour their own coffee in fear that they will also get hurt. They need to come up with a fix for this problem as I see alot of complaints from other consumers regarding the leaking. It does make excellent coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart DGB-6000BC Grind and Brew","review":"Bad, bad, bad. Company not helpful at all. Condensation in grinder causes beans to not filter through to basket. More than half the time coffee beans are overground since they stick in the grinder and turn to powder. They must be scraped out. It's a mess and a real disappointment. On the other hand, if you grind the beans separately and add them (a hassle that should not have to happen), the coffeemaker does have the ability to brew very good tasting coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker!!! Very happy!","review":"This coffee maker is awesome! Got the thermal version for Christmas and couldn't be more pleased. Read other reviews about poor coffee and wonder if someone got a defective unit, because mine is very good. First pot was a little funny tasting, but I've learned to expect that on a brand new coffee maker. After about 5 pots brewed, the coffee tastes great. Also, making minor adjustments in amount of beans and switching to paper filters probably helped. I think the reusable metal filters allow the water to pass too quickly, and you get better results with paper. Anyway, it works great, it is a snap to clean. Parts are dishwasher safe. The thermal pot stays piping hot for hours with no burner beneath it. And an added bonus, you can take the pot around the house, set it anywhere as it is cool to the touch within minutes of brewing, while keeping the coffee hot. Can also use with pre-ground coffee. I have no negatives to report."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy it!!!!","review":"This model was a Christmas gift. I don't use it very often because it is so unpredictable and makes such a mess. Coffee doesn't flow into the pot, rather on the counter and on the floor! The first pot I made soaked the instruction book and the warranty card. I dried the book and read it carefully to see what I did wrong. There were two possibilities - too fine of coffee and placement of the filter basket. Even following the instruction book (which you shouldn't have to do for a coffee maker!) its performance is erratic. Sometimes a great cup of coffee, other times coffee soaked up in the towels I wrap around and under it never knowing when it's going to leak. Here's the worst part - I went online to Cuisinart, explained the problem and asked for their advice. They never even responded. That says a LOT too. Do yourself a favor and pick another model."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Expensive Mistake","review":"Sounds great. Grinds, brews, and keeps the coffee warm.The grinder sounds like an air-raid siren (at 5 am) and doesn't grind the coffee well enough to get a good cup of coffee (I spend too much on beans to drink Sanka). Okay, fine. I used my old grinder and put grounds in the basket. The basket pops open and gets grounds and coffee everywhere. This thing has \\"blown-up\\" so many times I just can't count any more.

At first glance the unit looks sharp (hence the 1 star) and we were looking forward to using our new toy. Here is what we found after our first week of use:1) Grinder sounds like a contractor in your kitchen sawing your kitchen table in half...yes..its that loud!2) Ok..so why do we buy coffee makers? For good coffee right? Well this brewed \\"coffee flavored\\" water. It was nasty and we even threw in an extra helping of beans than the recommended amount...WEAK!!!3) Now what? Yup..you have to break down the whole thing and clean it out...including the nasty slick sludge that accumulates in the grinding station. What a pain!!!Bottom line, we boxed it up and got a full refund for this joke of a coffee maker...DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a coffee machine, it's a job!!!!!!!","review":"The manufacturer made a terrible mistake putting the grinder right inside of the machine. This grinder, because of the steam, gets coated after one use and needs to be cleaned and fully dried if you don't want clogging to be a problem. Ok, I admit after all the work getting the maching together, the coffee comes out great, but with working and the kids, I dont have the time that this machine requires, to spend on cleaning, drying and setting and it up. Oh, and God forbid you drop a few beans inside while setting it up!!!

I was very disappointed in the carafe as it leaks and does not keep the coffee warm. Customer service is very rude as well. They can not replace any defective parts for a while since the coffe maker is new and they don't have them (after waiting on hold for 45 min)and she made me feel dumb even for calling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective out of the box!","review":"Got this for Christmas.

I do agree the thermal pot Does Not keep coffee hot as advertised. I wanted the thermal pot to avoid the taste of \\"cooked coffee\\" if I lingered over a pot rather than consume immediately and was totally disappointed. By the time i went back for my second cup 20-30 mins later it had cooled to barely tepid.I tried several times- used hot water over cold, not good.Boiled water to heat carafe prior to brewing, so inconvenient.Finally I decided to just return it and continue shopping for a machine that gets better reviews.I will say my service through Amazon was excellent though. Both in quick delivery of product and in the return service."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This...When It Turns On!","review":"I quickly became accustomed to the 30 second long, noisy grinder; to cleaning the grinder after each use; to making sure that the spring loaded basket was firmly closed so that it didn't pop out and send all the water on the kitchen counter. Why? Because the quality of the coffee and the amount of time it stays hot and fresh in the pot was unsurpassed. Now after 3 (4?) years all the wonderful things are still there but when I turn the knob, nothing happens. Now, to find a small appliance repairman. Does anyone do that anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Cleanup, Look Elsewhere","review":"The mess! The mess! The clean-up is TERRIBLE and steals all the joy from your cups of coffee.Prepare for 10+ minutes of clean-up EVERY time you brew: 6 parts total, 2 of which (the grinder & grinder-lid) are plastered with WET OILY COFFEE DUST in every nook and cranny. This stuff STICKS, and requires dedicated sponge-work to get into all the corners where it lodges.This isn't \\"optional\\" cleaning either -- it's necessary for EVERY POT.Also, beware the grinder lid: There's a tiny rubber nub that can pop out during cleaning. If you lose it, no more grinding. It serves no discernible purpose. Idiotic designEventually, you will give up using the grind-and-brew features and revert to using a standalone grinder except when showing off toys for company.The Good: Makes tasty hot coffee directly from beans -- it does in-fact work.I'd say it takes approximates 5x as much cleanup/prep time as my old traditional coffee maker. I'd never buy this model again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe doesn't keep coffee hot","review":"According to the manual, the insulated thermal carafe is supposed to keep the coffee pipping hot for hours. NOT TRUE. The machine turns off, and the plate only supports the carafe, it doesn't heat it. The coffee is only hot enough for the first cup, and after that I have to tell my guests to place their coffee in the microwave. Disappointing. Well, if there's no heat source, how is it going to keep it hot? A metal carafe it's not like the old style glass lined thermal bottles (those worked!). If the objetive is to avoid burnt coffee, the manufacturer could perhaps have taken advantage of the programming function, and allow the user to select how long the plate should be on. After all, what's technology for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this coffee maker is possessed!","review":"We stopped using the grinder a long time ago since it really doesn't grind the coffee fine enough and often leaves very large chunks of coffee bean, and yes, it's really noisy.The big problem is that it unpredictably \\"blows up\\" - the door with the coffee basket flies open and hot water, coffee grounds and coffee go all over the counter and the floor. We're sure it's possessed by an evil spirit! If you want to make coffee, you're got to stand with it and babysit this machine every time unless you want a big mess!I'm surprised this machine is still on the market AND I'm surprised that Cuisinart designed such a bad coffee maker and hasn't fixed it!(It would be great if Cuisinart could take these back and replace them with coffee makers that really do work well) What's great about it? Insulated thermal carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much trouble","review":"After using this coffee maker for just one week, I give up.Making coffee a consistant strenght is impossible. One day it is too strong the next it is too weak.The machine itself is a pain to use.You have to dissasemble it after every use to clean it (too many pieces!)and be sure all parts are dry before you make another pot.I'm going back to my old $20 Braun and separate grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee, sleek design","review":"I like this coffee machine a great deal. It's makes good coffee -- for a home brew. It is easy to clean as the parts pop out. They might have calibrated the water tank, but that is not a problem once you guage how much you need after you use it. Looks very sleek and understated. It blends in nicely with my kitchen's decor and is good looking enough that I can bring it to the dinner table, even when I have guests. The one drawback is that, people who want to warm it up in a microwave, will not be able to do so because it is made of metal. But, if you brew and drink immediately, as I do, it is a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This appliance needs a complete redesign. Many places on it are actually impossible to clean - they are inaccessible to toothbrushes, Q-tips, etc. and much of the exposed area is very difficult to reach to wipe off. Coffee grounds get down in the water reservoir and are very difficult to remove. I recommend using a separate coffee grinder until a new, cleanable model comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"Have had the coffee pot for over one year and it continues to frustrate me. The carafe leaks when you pour coffee, so you end up with coffee all over the counter. In addition, it overflows while brewing about 25% of the time, so you really have to watch it. Started brewing coffee with the lid off the carafe to reduce spills while brewing. In summary, it's not worth the effort to fool with it any longer. Nice looking piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed well at all","review":"I bought this machine less than a year ago and did not like it from the start. The grinder is so messy and poorly designed. The moisture from the brewing process collects in the grinder and makes a mess that has to be cleaned every night before putting more beans in for the next day's brewing. The carafe is also designed poorly, and pours out very slow and drips everywhere. I'm constantly cleaning this machine.To make matters worse, it has completely stopped working (the water does not heat up) and now I have to pay to ship it to be fixed, when all I want is my money back.Choose another machine to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like cold coffe this is the coffe pot for you","review":"This coffee pot is nice looking, but is not functional.

Also, the coffee pot leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"If you're looking for an excellent cup of coffee as soon as you wake up with minimal hassle, look elsewhere.The grind is quite coarse and has no coarseness adjustment. Add the fact that it uses a basket filter instead of a cone type and you end up with a cup of coffee that is frankly not very good when compared to my 10-year old Braun cone type maker.Also, look for a grinder/brewer designed so that steam does not rise up into the grinder assembly. It's a pain to clean and if you don't do it right away, the muck dries in the grinder and makes it even harder to clean.The only feature that I really like is the thermal carafe. It keeps the coffee hot for a long time without burning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe leaks; TWICE","review":"I have had two of these coffee makers over the last three years. It was the most expensive coffee maker I have ever purchased, but I was very happy with the looks and the coffe it made. Unfortunately, after about 1 1/2 years it started to leak, especially when it was set up on a timer over night. Since it was under warranty, Cuisinart sent a replacement. Now two years later I have the same problem and it is getting worse. I have since found complaints of the same issue on other customer reviews. Cuisinart will not replace it again and there is no repair center to send it to. I am happy with its function but its reliability is poor. To compare, I had a medium priced Krups coffeemaker that I sent in for repair and had it returned within a week for just a $25 fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect it to die after a year (we've had two of these!)","review":"I can't stress enough that you need to avoid this product. It starts out great, but doesn't seem to be very durable.Our first one broke within a year - it had a manufacturing issue that meant it poured coffee all over your countertop, instead of into the carafe. Our friends had the same problem with theirs. Cuisinart replaced it, but NOT for free.The replacement worked fine, until about a year after we got it. Then, the grinder dropped dead. I've cleaned it, lubricated it, you name it - but the grinder just won't grind any more. A quick google search for this model and \\"won't grind\\" brings up plenty of results."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating machine","review":"Like others below, I was totally frustrated by trying to pour the last 1-3 cups of coffee. The lid always leaked, no matter what I tried. Also, just opening the top up was a two handed job, as was removing the plastic top where you put in the beans - everything seemed to stick and be hard to work. I called Cuisinart - they offered to take back the machine in trade on another Cuisinart product - they did not tell me there is a newly designed carafe or offer to send any replacement parts. My old $20 grinder and $20 coffeemaker are far less trouble and do just as well in the coffemaking department."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE AFRAID -- VERY AFRAID","review":"Clean looks is all you get with this waist of money.

NO LUCKThe grinder is way too small for even 9 cups of coffee, unless you like yours to look like Tea. Cleanup is a pain in the A...Our former (12yr old but now dead) Krupps, brewed the best coffee. Even when we had guests over for dinner, everyone would always comment on how good the coffee was.We ended up getting out the old dusty $12.99 Mr. Coffee, coffee maker, and at least enjoyed fairly good cup of coffee.So, Purpose totally defeated. Maybe the company should stick to food processors.Thats my opinion and I'm sticking to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffee Maker EVER!","review":"We were so excited to find that Cusinart had a thermal coffee maker that also integrated the grinding of the beans. We got it for Xmas 2002 and have been disappointed ever since. The coffee does not stay warm...we eventually bought a separate carafe to pour our coffee into..it is only the first cup that is somewhat warm. Once you pour yourself a cup of coffee the pot leaks all over the place. We are constantly wiping up coffee from our counter. Plus it is extremely dirty and hard to clean. In the first few months we used it, the filter portion of the machine had gotten so dirty that pushing the eject button did not work. We would have to force the filter open each day.We just purchased the Miletta Mill & Brew unit for a mere $50.00 and we are beyond satisfied. I cannot believe we wasted $150.00 on this coffee maker!

About six months ago I started using it daily instead of just on weekends. What a disappointment. Its basket door randomly pops open during brewing (yet when I try to spring it open between uses, it sticks) and it leaks from the bottom, issues that shouldn't be occurring in a 3-yr-old coffeemaker, let alone a premium-brand coffeemaker. I'll admit, I was attracted by its looks. But if this thing were a human being, it would be a supermodel -- all beauty, negligible substance. WhatEVER. I'm buying a new coffeemaker, this week.

Coffee overflowed 3 times in a span of one month. Turned out a check valve in the carafe lid sticks, causing the coffee to overflow. Lid design is such that impossible to clean the valve area. Forcefully removed the valve cover and removed the valve. The valve cover, required to open the valve in the ground coffee basket above, is now reattached with duct tape. Looks like hell. And of course the coffee cools down faster. Stopped using the grinder because it takes at least 1/2 hour to clean the grinder area, even using a tooth brush. Water level is very difficullt to see. By far the worst appliance I ever purchased.

In theory, it is great to have a grider and coffee maker all in one product. However in practice, the design makes it a pain to make coffee. Each time, you need to clean the filter and the lid on top of the filter, the two pieces that make up the grinder as well as the coffee pot. You also need to dry the two pieces that make up the grinder. Otherwise, the coffee grounds get stuck in the grinder and the channel that leads to the filter, eventually blocking the entire channel.

It just failed completely, with the electronics working in random sequence - on, off, program, grinder, off, grinder, off, etc. etc. Now I cannot brew coffee because I cannot shut off the grinder, and the brewer will not start until the grinder shuts off. I thought the grinder would be a nice feature, but the grind is very course, and the noise will wake you from sleep.... a gimmick.In my opinion, a product costing this amount of money, should last longer than 18 months or so.

The good: it makes pretty good coffee, though I'd prefer a cone filter. It's nice to wake up to the sound of coffee being ground. I used a metal filter and it worked better with this machine than with others I have owned.The bad: This is a design flaw that may have been fixed in other models, but check before you buy. The steam from the brewing coffee goes up into the grinding chamber, making a tough mud of the remaining coffee dust.This requires regular washing. Also, the door holding the basket tends to pop open on its own, creating a shower of grounds or coffee on your counter and inside the machine. I am only using it now as an temporary grinder to make coffee in a french press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rico's view!","review":"Loved this coffee maker at first.

If your're lazy and love great coffee, this is not the machine for you. First of all there are two design flaws. A) it is too tall, it will not fit under most 18 inch cabinets; B) you cannot brew two consecutive pots as the grinder is housed with a unsecure lid within the percolator. This causes the grinder to accumulate all the steam from brewing, thus leaving the grinder completely saturated. Anyone who grinds thier own coffee, knows a wet grinder is not a good thing. As a result of this, you have two extra parts to clean in addition to the standard coffee basket and pot. Lastly, the grinder is wickedly loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're better off with a separate grinder","review":"A lot of moisture gets in the grinder, requiring that it be cleaned after each use.

Also, make sure the filter basket is tightly secured and latched, because if it is not, again coffee grinds and liquid is giong to go all over the place and make a huge mess.The noise from the grinder is ridiculous.

Cuisinart is clearly aware of the problems of this machine but they keep on selling them. Does not mean you have to fall for it though. I'll not use the grinder again. Amazon should consider removing it from their list as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A NIGHTMARE OF A COFFEE POT","review":"I purchased this pot to replace a Melitta Grind and Brew with Thermal Carafe that is no longer manufactured. It is difficult to use - hard to clean, has a tendancy for the coffee grounds to overflow and clog the carafe opening causing coffee to spill all over the counter, etc. Recently the mill stopped grinding altogether and I thought I'd keep it anyway and just grind the beans separately but after the third overflow in two weeks we are chucking this baby out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money...","review":"We got this item and now it leaks water all over the place, it brews half pot, and the clock/timer has gone out. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM. In addition the Company does not stand by their product, their customer care rep. was rude and did not care or gave to much interest. He said he can't do anything for us on this. So if you do decide to go this product anyway, be ready in a little while to replace this Item, Model DGB-600BC. Thanks All, I just don't want this same thing to happen to people who buy this item after all it's not cheap either, THIS IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL. Very unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make a full pot of coffee!","review":"I'm very disappointed in this coffee maker. It loves to overflow if you make a full pot of coffee--what a mess!

The grind function only holds enough for maybe.....5 or 6 cups of coffee MAX, and even then, it grinds it so fine that 20% of it sticks to the sides and the rest is for brewing, which makes WEAK COFFEE (not to mention the noise wakes up the neighborhood, it's a little intense).However, I'm salvaging it - I grind my beans in a separate grinder, and I can turn off the grind function, and brew it this way, and it tastes GREAT. The thermal carafe is good b/c it does stay hot, but pours so slowly you always think you're out of coffee - pretty weird.In sum, if you like strong coffee, get a Cuisinart without the brewing function and save some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee pot review","review":"Was a huge pain to have to clean it every day, every part, and it ended up breaking after a year.

I make coffee daily, and vary between 4 cups and full 12 cups. The carafe keeps it nice and hot, and the chrome makes it safe for a clumsy person like me. I prefer to use pre-ground coffee, and Mr Coffee filters at the grocery store fit perfectly. It is easy to program: I set up at night, and wake to the wafting smells of brewing coffee.Drawback: The bean grinder is loud, but hard to complain when it make the perfect coffee! If you use the measure for beans, it works perfectly. It is messy to clean, and it steams up and makes the grinder gummy, so you want to clean within 2 hours, don't wait overnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Enough","review":"I also almost did not buy this based on certain reviews. So far, I am glad I did. It meets my criteria - I want to wake up to the smell of brewed coffee, and did not want to pre grind or buy ground coffee.

It is only six months old so I cannot vouch for its longevity yet, but I hope it continues to perform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great when it worked","review":"We had this coffee maker for under two months when it started to malfunction. After searching online I found that there is a known problem with only a partial pot brewing. Pushing the \\"1-4 Cups\\" button results in an entire pot brewing.A $100 coffee maker that doesn't function properly after two months was disappointing. What was horrendously frustrating was the customer service Cuisinart provided. They charged me shipping for the replacement and to send back the defective unit. A few months into owning the new unit and the same problem is starting to crop up.Today I checked the status of my mail-in rebate and it was rejected. Straw, meet my broken back.

It is most horrible in every way that other reviewers have mentioned. I can even handle the jumbo jet like noize it makes it's the mess that I can't deal with anymore. It's a big hassle and several paper towels just to make a pot of coffee; not to mention the condition of my counter top when we start pouring.

The coffee it produces is outstanding -- on par with any drip you might get from a specialty store. The metal-clad carafe will keep the brew hot for several hours without the need for a warming plate.The machine has a steam problem when it comes to the grinder, which causes build up of \\"coffee muck\\" to accumulate in the grinder, the cup, the feeder, and on top of the drip guard. These rinse out quickly if you remove and rinse right after the coffee is brewed, taking only about thirty seconds to complete the job.I've owned several different kinds of coffee makers, and this one produces the best tasting coffee so far. I'd prefer it if the lid was a little more sturdy-feeling, and they really should do something with that steam back up into the grinder. Those are the only things keeping me from giving this a five star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Improvement","review":"I've been using this product for almost a year now. I'm not very happy with it for the following reasons:1. Coffee is not hot enough, so I always have to warm up the pot with hot water which defeats the purpose of having it automatically make coffee.2. Grinder plastic parts are cracking3. Potential for huge mess: Life is hectic in my house, and occasionally, I forget to put the basket in the maker. There are just too many parts to assemble and although this is my fault, the machine should not allow me to turn it on if there's a missing part. It's happened about three times since I have it, and this morning was the last.4.

Typically it makes great coffee but about once a week we end up with brewed coffee all over the counter top! I've read the problem is caused if you don't snap the brewing basket in just the right way. But it's not easy to determine when it's snapped in just right. One more mess and it's in the trash and I'm back to a simple old fashioned perculator!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible coffee maker!","review":"I am very dissatisfied with this coffee maker. It makes lousy coffee. To get the strength typical in other coffee makers, substantially more coffee is required. The grinder doesn't grind enough, so I am now grinding my own beans and putting them in the coffee maker. There are many parts that need to be taken out and cleaned after each use, which makes the whole process tedious and time-consuming. Because of the way various parts pop up and swing out, I'm waiting for something to break. The thermo caraffe needs to be heated with hot water, so using the timer for morning coffee produces less than desirable temperature retention. I would not recommend this product unless you like weak coffee and have lots of time to spend setting everything up. This is a real disappointment from Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like \\"real\\" coffee try Malitta.","review":"If you like \\"real\\" coffee and not \\"tea\\" then pass this up.I fill the container with as much beans as possible and the coffee always comes out very WEAK. I have to add instant coffee to make it stronger. I have tried everything to remedy this problem to no avail.I cannot wait until this machine breaks so I can justify buying the Malitta grinder coffee maker again, which makes a much better cup of coffee.

I've had it for two years but didn't use it till a year ago when my 10 year old faithful Bunn finally died. First off, it's grinder is so loud you wouldn't need an alarm clock to wake you in the morning. It doesn't grind all the beans so your final cup of coffee is a bit weak. If you don't scrub and check the basket every time you use it, it clogs up and leaks all over the counter. The door for the basket pops open for no reason at all and it leaks. When you pour water in the tank, it leaks. The carafe is not made for pouring and it leaks. Get the picture? It leaks from all over the place. It is programmed to stay on for 2 hours but turns itself off whenever it feels like it. Sometimes it doesn't even turn on or you go to get a cup of coffee and its turned off half way thru the process. It's going in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating MESS","review":"My sister passed on this coffee maker as she never used it. My husband loves the grind capability, but I HATE the mess. 2 out of 3 times it overflows all over my counter, down the sides, onto the floor... inevitably when we are entertaining. I have tried scrupulously measuring the grounds, but it still overflows. The pot is undrinkable because it is full of grounds. It works fine if you are making less than 8 cups, I suppose, but I need to be able to serve coffee to guests without embarrassing clean-ups/grounds/delays. I HATE this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy! Messy!","review":"I've never had to clean a coffee maker so much. My previous grinder/brew machine was from Melitta, which never required this much cleaning. The Cuisinart leaves a mud puddle in the grinder area after every use, creating sludge that is hard to clean off. The mud puddles under the grinder basket, up inside of it and it is difficult to clean and dry this area. The water chamber is awkward and there are just too many parts. Yes, once cleaned it works nicely, but it is a royal pain in the behind. I think I might just go back to a Melitta."},{"rating":"1","title":"BACK TO BASICS","review":"I was really looking forward to not having to grind a bunch of beans and store them for use in my current Cusinart paper filter coffeemaker. Now, I have to get beans out twice a day (I drink coffee in the morning and at night) and have to clean the top grinder unit and clean out the filter unit before each use. This coffeemaker is very irritating. The carafe hold 50 oz. of coffee which isn't that much if you use a typical 8 oz. coffee cup. The carafe needs to be tilted at a much steeper angle, which in itself isn't a problem. But, it is almost impossible to get all of the coffee out of the carafe. So I really don't even get the full 50 oz. I am almost ready to change to become a tea drinker! If this unit cost maybe $40 the irritations would be acceptable, but for $120-$130 I consider it a rip off. I would like to see Cusinart recall this coffeemaker and refund everyones money! I'm going back to my paper filer, ground coffee only, coffeemaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud as an airplane, weak coffee","review":"The grinder is so loud that it wakes up the entire house.

The coffee tastes wonderful and the thermal pot keeps it hot and fresh for much longer than I expected. A pot left from breakfast was still hot after lunch. The clean-up process really is not bad. The grinder gets condensation from the hot water area so it does have to be wiped out daily but it's not a big deal at all - you have to wash out the filter anyway, so what?

The cleanup is very involved. Some areas that need daily cleaning are completely inaccessable . Using pre ground coffee it seems to not allow the coffee enough time to go thru the filter . This results in the grinds and hot water pooling till overflow then spilling internally over many fused plastic parts. You cannot even clean them because they cannot be removed. And yes this muck drips over the caraffe and onto the burner and starts to burn. Unbelieveable. Even though you may not use the grinder you still have to break it down and clean the condensate out of it . Very poor. This product is junk. If you dont believe me buy one and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"We've had the machine for 3yrs now. We have abandoned the coffee gind feature because of the cleanup required each time.

I thought it would be great to wake up to coffee already made every morning... and it was for the first two days, then you start to dread getting it set up the night before. It really is a long process. There are too many parts you have to have clean and dry completely every single time you want some coffee.It might not seem like such a chore if the coffee you got from this machine was amazing, but that's not the case. It's just coffee. No better than what I brewed in my 15+ year old Braun. I use bottled water every time, so maybe I would have noticed a difference if I used tap water since this machine has the filter and my old one does not.I am going back to my old Braun and will take this one out when the person who gave it to me comes over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for me, could be better","review":"I gave it a four stars almost a year and half ago. Today had to change it to 2 star as it simply stopped working. This is the first coffee maker I had so I don't know how long a coffee maker is supposed to last. Still 3 years used only lightly - mostly at weekends, I'd expect any kitchen utility shall survive longer than this.--Below my original review---------I've had it for two years. It's my first grind and brew so I had no comparison. However as a consumer I felt there should be better ones. I bought it because of its name Cuisinart. It looks very elegant in the kitchen. The biggest drawback is it is really hard to clean if you Grind coffee. Thermo Coffee pot does not really keep coffee hot/Warm. When coffee is ready, you better drink right away. But overall it does work. It makes coffee. It can grind. I set the timer before going to bed and when I wake up coffee is waiting for me.

It makes it difficult to brew multiple pots throughout the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy for the Second Time","review":"This was my second time purchasing this coffeemaker. The first one made great coffee; I used to prefer plunge pot coffee, but this tastes nearly as good without all the \\"mud\\" in my cup. I love that it's programmable - I wake up to fresh brew 7 days a week, and it's loud enough to work as a good back-up alarm. The thermal pot works really well - coffee stays hot enough for at least 4-5 hours, although it rarely lasts that long in my house.My only complaint with my first machine was that it only lasted three years, but I never had a problem with it until the day it died. This model is almost identical and has been performing exactly the same as my old machine, so I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive piece of junk","review":"Do not buy this coffee pot.

The unit is extremely attractive on my kitchen counter and the thermos caraffe is very handy. On mornings when I'm running late I just grab it and take it with me to work.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!","review":"I'm so disappointed in this piece of crap AND with CUISNART! THIS IS THE WORST DESIGN ever! Aside from the fact that there are way to many parts to put together just to make a pot of coffee, it has to be PERFECTLY DRY or else your coffee will be weak. We were so frustrated with the grind feature we ended up going back to grinding our own coffee and turning the grind feature off. The coffee pot now just malfunctioned and we awoke this morning to a floor filled with coffee grinds and coffee. VERY UPSET and tired and all we want is a cup of coffee we gave the piece of crap another whirl after 30 minutes of cleaning up the kitchen. IT DID IT AGAIN!NEVER AGAIN will I spend so much on a Coffee pot. We had another Cuisinart Coffee pot fail. We will never go with their brand again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this item leaks!","review":"I bought this coffee pot because it looks great! Cuisinart has a reputable name, too, and with the built in grinder, I thought I had it made! But like others have said, it is a pain to clean. But beyond that- the carafe leaks EVERYTIME we pour a cup of coffee. No matter what we do. And from time to time, the filter gets clogged up with coffee grounds, and it does result in spilled coffee everywhere. I lost 10 cups of coffee all on my counters and in my cupboard- of course, when company was over. Not a mess I wanted to deal with. Save your money and do not buy this leaky, hard to clean coffee maker. You will only be looking for a better model in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coffee but there are drawbacks","review":"This purchase was to upgrade from a previous grind and brew Cuisinart that I had for many years. The new one is sturdier and looks better. The thermal carafe is good and bad. It holds the temperature well for short periods, but tends to loose the heat over time. The pour is extremely slow, but okay once you get used to it. Filling the chamber with water from the carafe is sloppy. Unless you pour very slowly, water runs down the side of the carafe and all over the counter. Overall it is a good coffee maker, but there are some drawbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy it again","review":"I purchased this little number about three months ago, and in that amount of time on maybe twelve early mornings I have shuffled with half closed eyes to grab my conveniently prepared morning jolt only to find A MESS IN MY KITCHEN BECAUSE THE *^&(%^&( BASKET POPS OUT!!!!!

He specifically wanted a grinder machine. I can't believe some of the negative reviews! He loves it. Yes, when it grinds the beans it makes noise. Duh! But that only lasts mere seconds. Also, yes, you must clean it. I do it daily and it takes only 2 or 3 minutes. As far as the slow pour, that is the reason the carafe keeps it so hot, but its not like it takes 10 minutes to pour a cup of coffee or anything. If you are that cranky in the morning that you can't wait a few more seconds for a nice hot cup of coffee to pour or are too lazy to just take off the lid and pour then I don't think any coffee maker will suit you.The only thing I would change is being able to see how much water is being filled without having to look directly down into the area where you pour the water. But that is sooo minor. Love the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"skeptical","review":"After reading the terrible reviews of this coffee maker I was skeptical of ordering. Once I received the pot and had used it for a few weeks I realized that if all of the grinding parts are rinsed after each use and the carafe lid is put on correctly, this pot brews a great cup of coffee each time it is used.

A brewed cup of coffee from freshly ground beans is a delight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"makes 1950s coffee even from great beans","review":"Anyone who grinds beans is going to want good coffee.

Construction is excellent making the grind and brew easy to use and the automatic timing feature lets you prepare the unit the night before and have hot steaming coffee at a specific time in the morning. This unit with the thermal carafe is an improvement over the older models with a glass carafe and hot plate as the coffee stays hot and does not \\"boil down\\" because of the heating from the hot plate.I liked mine so much I bought one for my aunt who is a real Norweign coffee drinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used it two weeks and it's going back!","review":"what an awful coffeemaker.

I was so excited when I finally got it, but boy...was I wrong. It is very complicated to get it programed. It was very unclear...also there are too many parts to it and too hard to clean. The most dissapointing part was the thermal caraf. It took at least about 30 seconds for a full cup to be poured...it was so slow. There is no adjustment to the lid. What a waste of time and money. I wish I had read all the reviews before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive to keep replacing","review":"This is my second grind & brew to own and I love them while they work. They make great coffee and I don't even mind the hassle involved in cleaning them. What I do mind is that both machines have died due to the same problem ... they will not stay on. No one should have to turn on the coffee maker 5 or more times just to get a half pot of coffee brewed. The bottom line ... this machine is too expensive to replace every 2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps Shorting Out","review":"We are now on our third Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew. The product worked great for about 6 weeks then it began to stop brewing after only 1-2 cups of water had passed over the grinds. We would have to continously restrart the unit only to have the brewing process quit time and time again. Cuisinart customer service (which had us on hold for 45 minutes) said that they had not heard of this problem, but I was surprised to see that another reviewer on this web site had the same problem. We sent the unit back twice at Cuisinart's expense only to receive another coffeemaker that experienced the same problem. Don't waste your time or money with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even THINK about buying this piece of junk!","review":"If your idea of a good time is to spend an hour cleaning coffee grounds out of EVERYTHING after every pot is brewed, go ahead and buy this little beauty. On the other hand, if you like coffee that doesn't contain 6 parts grounds to every cup of drinkable coffee, a coffee maker that doesn't have to be completely disassembled, steam cleaned, and reassembled with each use, a coffee maker that doesn't sound like a jet has just landed in the kitchen ... well, then, my friend ... keep looking. This machine deserves a class action suit. But, since that takes too much time, I just threw mine in the trash --- don't even bother to recycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"$150 MESS ON MY COUNTERTOP","review":"I paid $150 for what I thought was a high end product. What I got was the worst engineered appliance I have ever purchased. With each brew about 1/2\\" cup of water leaks out of the top, bottom and all 4 sides. I can't use the grind feature because steam from the brewing process causes the grinder mechanism to become completely clogged. The filter basket has numerous mechanical parts that can't be removed for cleaning. I contacted Cuisinart but received no help. I don't understand how a product with so many flaws could make it to the market. I'm also puzzled how they still continue to sell a product that is defective. Please read all the reviews. I'm not the only one with these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!!","review":"Please take my advice and buy another coffee maker! Made excellent coffee...at the beginning.

TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Improvement","review":"The thermal carafe dose a wonderful job of keeping the coffee hot.

Nice concept, poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"I was so excited to get a combo machine! No longer would I have to grind my beans and then put them in the coffee maker. I would also have a thermos so my coffee would stay warmer longer. But, this machine was not as good as I imagined. Yes, the beans do grind. But, if you're making a six cup pot of coffee it continues to grind for a 10 cup pot. The coffee did taste good. But, clean up was a lot more than I imagined. I thought I could every once in awhile clean out the grinder like I do my stand alone. But, after brewing a cup of coffee the steam gets in the grinder so you have to clean it up to avoid it ruining the grinder. Too much of a hassle so it went back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster the most labor intensive coffeemaker out there","review":"If you have the time to clean every part of this coffeemaker everyday, then this is the coffeemaker for you. You have to clean the grinder, grinder blades and the intricate top to the grinder after every, I mean, every use. Only for people with a lot of time on their hands and like to get them wet.This is the biggest rip-off out there. I am not the only person that feels this way-two other people in my neighborhood threw theirs out as well. The trashmen must have a treasure trove of Cuisinart Grind and Brews, God knows they don't have time to clean them after every use either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nightmare to clean","review":"Buy this coffeemaker and you may find yourself going to Starbuck's just to avoid cleaning it.

The grinder is right above the filter, and every time you use the unit, steam from the brewing process gets into the grinder making a mess out of the grinder compartment that is a lot of work to clean.I use about as much water for brewing as for cleaning the unit. Also, there's about 2 tbsp of coffee grounds that get stuck in various part of the grinder which don't get used in the brewing. That's a lot of waste of perfectly good coffee.And having a flat round filter rather than a cone filter, I found the coffee doesn't taste as round and strong as what I'm used to from my old Krups machine.If it wouldn't be such a pain, I'd take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the best","review":"This product makes great coffee. But if ease of use is your priority this is a zero. It is loud. If you program the timer for morning coffee you wont need an alarm. It grinds for an eternity. To add insult to injury there are six separate parts you need to wash each time you use the pot. Dont make my mistake. Buy a separate grinder and coffee maker. This one is a looser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Coffee + Big Mess","review":"I bought this as a present for my wife, who liked the idea of putting beans in the resevoir, setting the timer and waking up to a delicious cup of coffee. Unfortunately, the grinder works, but it does not allow you to set fineness to your taste. Steam rises from the brewing area and moistens the grinding part, so you have to clean a bunch of soggy coffee grounds out of the top of the maker every night in addition to cleaning the filter and the carafe. Worst, the filter basket is prone to popping out on its own in the middle of the brewing process, sending coffee streaming down the counter and onto the floor. Finally, the carafe leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stressful!","review":"Well, I opened the front door, threw the entire coffeemaker out the door and watched it smash all over the front sidewalk!!!!! IT felt great too! I have had this since September. Since then the grind drawer has popped open no less than four times during brewing and flooded the counter. You cannot use this machine unless all SIX annoying pieces are in place. Hard to see how much water you have poured and this past weekend I did not have the carafe lid on tight and the entire pot of hot coffee spilled all over the counter, floor, and new rug. Out the door it went! I hated this thing from day one.

This phone number is to a NO CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT.If you don't mind your coffee maker only lasting a couple of years then Cuisinart might be for you.Buyer beware, you are on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly great; but a great failure instead","review":"I have owned and used this item for about five years now. As noted elsewhere here, when this product works well it produces great coffee with admirable qualities. I love the gold filter, the thermos, and the programmable grind and brew. But come on! About 1 in 30 brews results in a coffee catastrophe, where maybe half the coffee ends up in the thermos and the rest goes everywhere else you don't want it to be. To make it more irksome, I have been unable to find any trigger for this horror. This morning, I had fully cleaned the unit, dropped the kids off to school, and I returned to spend 30 minutes cleaning drawers that were full of coffee plus the cupboards and the floor. Today was the last time. It's in the trash can and I'm shopping for a new machine with no regrets. And yes, cleaning the unit was a pain but normally the chore was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This coffee maker work great!","review":"The only gripe would be moisture getting into the grinder, but this is easily fixed by leaving the top open after brewing for it to dry out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Bad Product","review":"I thought this machine would be fantastic. Put in beans, set timer, go to bed, and wake up to a fresh pot of coffee. The first pot of coffee was great! Every pot after that required thorough cleaning of the grinder. Cuisenart needs to improve the design of the machine so the steam does not seap into the grinder area. I thought I'd let it sit and dry and it would be ready to go the next morning, but that never happened. I ended up returning the machine and buying a Krups (which I love)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but doesn't work well in practice","review":"We ended up returning this one. It was a pain to clean, but the biggest problem is that we couldn't get a good cup of coffee out of the darn thing. We called customer support and they said that certain beans will not work well with the non-adjustable grinder that is built into the machine. Per their advise, we ordered some Dunkin Doughnuts beans and this helped a bit, but there was still a pronounced bitter after-taste to the coffee. We could tolerate the high price and cleaning hastle if the end result was great. But since it wasn't, we chose a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I thought it would be so cool not to be cleaning my grinds up everyday.

We never have a \\"burned\\" or \\"old\\" taste to the coffee, as it is stored in a thermos. The only negative is that we have found that the coffee maker only lasts a couple of years before having to be replaced. Otherwise, it is definitely an A+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs More Engineering","review":"Product is well built, but its primary feature -- integral coffee grinder -- fails to do the job. While most of the coffee ends up in the filter basket, the average grain size is 5 to 20 times larger than that of coffee ground in a separate grinder. Consequently about 33% more coffee is needed to achieve a desired strength and, even with this this much extra coffee, the flavor is substantially inferior. I've stopped using the internal grinder, but the apparatus needs to be installed each time, even to brew pre-ground coffee. Set-up and clean-up are thus more complicated than with other, less expensive products."},{"rating":"2","title":"DECENT COFFEE MAKER","review":"I think the coffee comes out tasting really good and it is HOT. The biggest downfall is you have to clean it every single time thoroughly. It does steam up so if you pre-make your coffee the night before you have to dry the machine in additiont to cleaning.

If you forget to put the lid on the carafe... no alarm...lot more water. The machine will alarm if you don't close the top lid or forget to put the grinder basket in...neither cause a water disaster.

I bought the more expensive chrome version.Anyhow, worked fine for 1st week. Then coffee started to overflow around the basket and missed the carafe - made a mess. Problem is that the coffee cannot seem to filter quickly enough through the basket with a filter when you make a more than a 7-cup pot of coffee. The basket is a mesh filter-like container which makes a paper filter optional. But if you do not use the paper filter small coffee grounds are let through.Another problem is that the 'pause' feature, that is when you remove the carafe to get a cup while it is still brewing, does not work at all. You pull the carafe away and it continues to drip.I am sending my coffee maker back, and as an aside, Amazon's return polices are great and hassle-free. (first time I have ever had to return anything to Amazon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant idea, horrible engineering","review":"Awful to keep clean, noisy, coffee filter door occassionally pops open brewing coffee all over the floor. After having this product for two years, the grinder sticks and it's difficult to remove it to clean it.

After two years of every-day-use, a water leak started to show at the top, right (where the grounds are kept). According to online blogs and reviews, this happens often.

It worked great for a while and then all of a sudden it only brewed 1/2 cup of coffee, even when there was water left to be filtered. At the time, my husband and I lived in a place where there was extremely hard water, therefore, we thought it must be the hard water that caused it to break, so we set out to buy a new one since we loved it so much. Not even 1.5 years later and now living in another house with normal water, the 2nd one is doing the same thing- only brewing 1/2 pot! For the price we paid, I was hoping to get many years out of this coffee maker. It looks great, has amazing features, but all that is short lived. I am hesitant on even buying the brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"To add to numerous complaints about this machine posted on Amazon, the timer does not work - it blinks lights and the LCD screen and then turns the machine off. Even manual operation is not possible. The machine needs to be unplugged for an hour or so to be usable again.

I was pleasantly surprised by the improvement through the years. The thermos previously was very slow when pouring coffee and the update has a very good flow. Additionally, the grinder, grinder cover and basket lid all are improved. Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself. This works, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer. A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket. My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive. However, it does require more cleaning than a typical coffee maker. I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done. This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Maintenance","review":"Very disappointed with the amount of cleaning required. And it's a messy job. Condensation builds in the grinder with each use causing excessive accumulation of ground coffee that sticks to the inside of the grinding chamber and other places. Even whole beans will stick to the side of the chamber. You have to take the grinder out and wash it. Water alone will not do it though. You have to wipe the remaining residue away with a paper towel. Say good bye to clean finger nails. Have owned a few self grinders. None of them came close in maintenance. The basket chamber also has a cheap plastic construction.

Three water pumps later we are in the market for a coffee maker that WORKS. Cuisinart is unresponsive by phone, but if you pay $10 to ship their poorly manufactured machine to them, a new replacement unit can be yours. And then you wait a few months and the coffee will not be made in the morning, it will take 4 separate tries to get your coffee OR, added bonus, some mornings all 10 cups of water will be all over your counter and down the fronts of your cabinets.It is awkward to fill and the grinder is better than an alarm clock at waking you.Steer clear of this coffee maker (and anything else Cuisinart as far as I'm concerned.)

They offered to let me ship it at my expense. They would check it out and then charge me to repair it. Ridiculous considering the price of the maker. They should stand behind their products. I went out and bought another coffeemaker. I have the Mr. Coffee FT series and it's great. I recommend it. It's fast, the coffee is hot and actually gets hotter the longer it's in the carafe.

Not too long after owning it, it began to shut off before it finished brewing the coffee; we had to continually restart it to get it to brew the full pot. Now, the clock shuts off the minute it finishes a pot. So we have to unplug it and replug it in to brew anymore coffee.We have been taking good care of the maker. We clean it quite regularly, and all these problems have occurred in less than a year. This is something I would expect from a thirty-dollar maker, but it's unfortunate to have wasted all this money. Even without the mechanical problems, it is a hassle to make coffee with this product.

Already the swing out filter holder/cup area sticks and you have to shove it in - it no longer pops out when you press the button on the side.- The coffee is weak!

I think I am done with the grind and brews, just too messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I have had trouble with this coffeemaker from the beginning. It is hard to clean, and I have a daily struggle to get the coffee grinder part loose from the machine. The latest malfunction is that it brews only part of the water. I have to push the on button three times to brew all of the water through the coffee to make a full pot. I spent so much money on it I wish it was worth it, and now I am shopping for another machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of trouble","review":"I have had the DGB-600BC for 4 weeks. I use the grind and brew feature as an alarm clock because it is so loud. But that is not my main concern. I am not that pleased with the coffee (I use a high quality bean). Another concern is the cleaning process. It takes at least 5 minutes to clean it after each use. You need to use a brush and soap then you will not be able to get all the grounds out. One good feature is that you can put the parts in the upper rack of your dishwasher, but I do not run my dishwasher every day. I have gotten better flavor from a cheap Black & Decker BrewMaster. The coffee does stay hot, but I do not believe it stays hot for 8 hours as some claim. I usually drink it within 30 minutes and it is beginning to cool down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wear hearing protection.","review":"Overall I hate this coffee maker but my biggest complaint is how loud the grinder is. It was so unexpectedly loud, I actually jumped back when the grinder came on. Also the lid is very difficult to move from lock to unlock and vice versa. Also difficult to take off lid for cleaning purposes. Both of these things are enough to make me want to return it ASAP! You are forced to clean the bean grinder every time because moisture gets in there. The coffee was hot and not too bad tasting, I'll give it that. After I return this, I'll probably get the Cuisinart coffee maker without the grinding feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had two -- They are awful","review":"I've had two of these things and they both leaked like crazy. The first one just stopped working after a year and a couple months. My wife bought another one in a rush for a party, and it started leaking within a month of buying it.Definitely choose another coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow up review","review":"This is a follow up review from a year ago. Basically, this machine is a lot of work. There have been at least a half a dozen times when I've forgotten the lid or made some other minor mistake that resulted in coffee pouring out all over the counter. I also agree with other reviews about the carafe. I always pour my coffee over the sink; otherwise, there's always a spill. If you want to be able to have coffee without any work at an instant's notice, get a super automatic espresso machine. I just got a Capresso C1000. It makes coffee and dumps the residual grounds into a reservoir. No cleaning. No programmimg. Just get up in the morning and press a button. Yes, it's expensive, but if you want great coffee and convience, there's no beating a super automatic espresso machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice design, great functionality. Perfect coffee maker","review":"This coffee maker was everything I needed, and in a stylish design. The coffemaker has a grinder built in, all kinds of features such as the charcoal filter for the water to ensure that your coffee tastes good each and every cup. Cuisinart is known for good products, and this is another example of a great product from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The product was listed in Good condition; however, it came covered in coffee grounds, had broken filter, charcoal bag burst open and did not brew a hot cup of coffee. I was to afraid to send the product back and just took it as a loss, will not buy used items on-line again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stay hot","review":"We were given this machine and had heard rave reviews. The coffee never stays hot and the flavor is not good, no matter if you use the $$$ coffee beans or the cheap ones. The clean up is a pain. The condensation gets in the grinder so it cakes and gets wet and wastes beans. The programing is easy and the noise is loud, but not as big of an issue compared to the pot getting cold after a few hours. We have tried brewing with filtered water and using the charcoal filters, with no charcoal filter and only filtered water and no matter what the coffee just isn't that good. Now we are searching for a new machine...need good flavor and it to stay hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used Cuisinart coffemaker","review":"I was very unhappy with the item because of the missing parts that I had to order and being used I understand that it would look that way, but this one was filthy. I had to dismantle it and clean all parts. I didn't get the manual with it so I had to contact the Cuisinart Company to get one. The coffeemaker couldn't be used until the parts that I ordered arrived.I'm very happy with it now. It's a great coffemaker.Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew. This has been discontinued item from the Company.I'm usually very happy with the items I buy from Amazon, minus the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Overpriced","review":"1. Too much hassle to clean the grinder...literally a 10 minute process just to \\"reset\\" the whole thing to make coffee.2. Carafe pours so slowly you'd swear it was waiting for you to deposit money first.Skip this thing...It's a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"not easy to use","review":"i recomend to buy something else. you cant see how much coffee is in the pot!does not fit under my upper cabinets even though the dimesions said it did!my wife hates it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Coffee Maker That Ruined Christmas","review":"After reading all the positive reviews on this site, I ran out and bought one as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. What a disappointment. The coffee tastes like hot water with a brown crayon dipped in it. Why won't the machine allow you to adjust the grind size? Definitely a case of one gadget trying to do too many things and failing miserably. We're sticking with our old Krups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeewwww...","review":"This product, which I think is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned, has been returned. It had some good reviews here - did these folks EVER use the product?Each session of use requires you to do about a 20 minute cleaning session, since the steam makes a grimy, sludgy mess in the grinder, and throughout the interal parts of the unit.Grounds slip past the included filter, and into the pot. Its really tall, so it was hard to even get the coffee and water into the machine for my 5' tall wife. The top wouldn't open while unit was under the cupboards on the counter - it opens UP and so must me moved everytime you want to do anything with it.Shame on Cuisinart for allowing a product this poor to make it through testing.Amazing that such a good compnay could makes such a lousy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL PRODUCT","review":"There are too many faults with this proudct to list them all. I will stick with the highlights1. No measurement markings in the carafe. If you can not put this pot by the sink, dont buy it.2. Awful product to clean - Seven parts to clean per brew!3. Pooring rate is painfully slow4. Makes a weak cup of coffee with minimal water and a full grinder of beans.I am still looking for the right coffee pot but this product is an engineering/design disaster. If zero stars was an option I would do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did someone say tea?","review":"Thats what the coffee looks like after it brews!After many days searching for a coffeemaker I stumbled upon this one at Williams Sonoma, paid more there by the way. Well it\\"s going back to them tomorrow.PRO's, there really is none except if you are looking for something pretty to sit on your countertop for decoratation.CONS, many . This brews the weakest coffee I have ever had. I even resorted to rebrewing the pot it made and still no taste,The coffee comes out a light yellowbrown see-thru color, not dark and rich.The water level is a bit hard to read.Coffee does NOT stay hot for more then 10 minutes,Does not seal shut, had steam coming out in places it never ever should .Clock is impossible to readReady beep, well lets say don't wander more then 5 feet away to hear it!LOTS & LOTS of coffee grinds ended up in my cup , disgustingThis model should have been pulled from shelfs a year ago."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(f,null,y(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-cec8b4d9"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/64.md","filePath":"glossary/64.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/64.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
