Everything else - hundreds of examples - worked great, and required no reference to any outside source. The quality of the 'Dummies' books is variable, but this one is a winner. It is very well organized, and answered a lot of questions I have had about general programming for years, clearly and concisely. Wang is not only a talented programmer.

Worse yet, the software on the CD is too old to run on any machine running Windows XP or newer.

I've been forced to try and learn how to correct some of the most basic mistakes off of the internet, but it has really hampered my ability to learn this programming language, especially as the programs get more complex.This is the 4th and most recent addition.

The book does not have ANY program. It just motivates you to fast. Having been written by a madical doctor, I expected it to be somehow more scientific (some statistics, some FACTS like: out of 72 people whom we supervised from 1993 to 1995, 58 decreased their ureic acid an average of 35% after 10 days of fasting...). The whole book could be summarized in the following sentence: \\"Fasting greatly helps detoxification which in turn helps with diseases and aches caused by toxins in the body\\".

I think Dr. Fuhrman could've used a better editor, if in fact he had one at all. There was poor grammar, wandering topics, and the same points being repeated. I found it painful to read.As a side note, from a practical perspective I wouldn't recommend multi-day fasts as tool for losing weight. As Dr. Fuhrman notes, people often become extremely irritable. So, for someone who wishes to lose weight, an intermittent fasting regiment would work better if you still wish to remain functional at work.

I was shocked with how long Dr. Fuhrman suggests fasting, although to his credit it is always recommended to be under a doctors supervision. If you are sick and at wits end, it may be worth looking at, but it is highly involved and must be with doctors supervision. I love Dr. Fuhrman's other nutrition books, however, and think he is fantastic overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-Science","review":"The basic problem with this book is that, like much of what passes for health knowledge, it is based on anecdotal evidence. Thus, because a particular therapy seemed to help, or even genuinely helped, one person, does not make it a valid scientific method. There is no doubt that eating more vegtetables and fruits is good for you. Fasting may have some good benefits. But the book is woefully lacking in any valid scientific proof. For instance, there is a claim that fasting helps reduce build-ups in coronary arteries. If this is true, it would be fairly easy to run a scientific study doing before and after scans of those arteries using the lastest, non-invasive procedures that are available. Beware of following advise merely because someone has a MD degree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Perhaps the most authoritative book on fasting written. It is comprehensive, detailed, and well documented. Therapeutic fasting is well presented as an alternative regimen to drug therapy. However, appropriate caveats are given about care of a physician for fasts lasting longer than 3 days. Also, recommendations about optimal diet to accompany the fast are presented. The author favors a low protein, low fat, high fiber vegetarian diet as a precursor to the fast. All in all, a solid book. I think that the book would have benefited from more detail on how a patient can recognize and distinguish healthful symptoms of fasting from harmful ones. Doctors hide the ball all too often (though Dr. Fuhrman is less guilty of this than most physicians)instead of empowering patient to diagnose and treat their own conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotes galore!","review":"Crazy as it sounds... don't buy this book if you are already interested in trying a fast.

There are chapters on connecting one-on-one, taking other points of view, and working in diverse groups. Once the concepts are out of the way, the authors provide lots of examples and case studies to build on the learning.Bottom line...these concepts have helped me connect better through greater awareness of cues I had been missing.

I found this re-telling of the odyssey in cartoon format to be perfect for my four year old. It tells the rather violent episodes of the odyssey in a less violent and gentle way. The music and voices are heroic and exciting. The animation is realistic and well done.

I agree with most of the reviews I've read here. My only beef with the DVD is that the UFC altered the entrance music for St.Pierre and Serra, which also drowned-out the respective cheering and booing. May not seem like a big deal, but if you were there in person and want to relive the event as it was...it's just not the same. The more I watch it the more I dislike the UFC's decision on this. What is a GSP entrance without rap music 'en francais' afterall? Or Serra's Rocky themed entrance, since that was his whole build-up to the fight. That being said I assume there is a reason involving money (royalties) that the music is not there. Dosen't compare to the live experiance, but no DVD would. I'll still give it 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PPV, Missing some video","review":"The fights are great on this DVD. A must-buy for any UFC fan. I was disappointed to see the UFC edit preview/storyline for Serra/GSP2. The preview before the main event included more Serra/GSP interviews including the \\" HE crossed the Line \\" by GSP. That was the whole point for their fight, Serra talking trash and him crossing the line and the UFC edited that out?

Of course, that's still true of most Eastern Orthodox \\"authorities\\" working in English to this day, and small surprise, since most of them are produced by the institution on which he and others of his generation (particularly Florovsky) left their mark so indelibly and where they left such a questionable legacy, St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"It seemed like a very nice bathtub accessory; tried the sounds first and was looking forward to using it in the tub.

They are really good actors, and I love their TV characters! Kudos to the writers of this show. Love the humor, it is what keeps it all interesting and funny; and, it will provide longevity for the show!It was wonderful to get that horrible Hardman person out of the law firm. Harvey was right, he hadn't and wasn't planning to change for the better. Thus, the good guys won!! At least for now anyway.Love you Gabriel............you play a great Harvey Spector and love this persona.Please, someone tell me what song is playing when Harvey visits his father's grave in the episode before last.

Gabriel Macht (Harvey) fits his role perfectly. I reserve 5 stars for MM. However, this series has gotten better & better with each season.

There is still the ongoing repartee between senior lawyer Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht) and his prot��g�� Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), the beautiful but always-serious head of the firm Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) casts her spell -but now we have the return of the old partner Daniel Hardman (David Constabile) to stir up trouble. Themes are more serious, the women play a more important part - Sarah Rafferty and Meghan Markle - and the nemesis Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) is as wily and oily and repulsive as ever. The storylines continue through episodes and the writing seems to be better fleshed out this year. Good wines are better with age and that is the case with this series.

The HP LJ 8550n has excellent print quality, reasonable print speeds, and a high capacity for upgrade. Unfortunately, it's also a constant problem. Even lovingly maintained, this printer is a royal pain in the pocketbook. In the course of 6mo, I've had to replace 1 formatter ($1500), 1 duplexer ($200), 3 transfer kits ($300), and countless other parts that shouldn't be replaced that often.

I loved musicals; I loved \\"Jumbo.\\" I have always enjoyed the music of Doris Day, especially that she recorded in the 60's. Her voice, her music, holds up well all of these years later. As someone put across in a recent bio, she may be the best of the girl singers. I'm ordering a new copy of the \\"Jumbo\\" soundtrack because, though it was included on an 8-CD set I bought in the late 90's as a gift to myself...eight discs of my favorite Doris Day music...the final cut, \\"Sawdust, Spangles, and Dreams,\\" is damaged...and I just have to have that number. Doris was in fine voice, very mature and lovely voice, from l960 until most of her recording ended in the later 60's. She has left us this lovely legacy of some of the best music ever written. What more can one ask for. See the movie, if you haven't; it's schmaltzy, but it's pretty. Then relive the loveliness of the film over and over again on CD.

The noise isolation is AMAZING, for not being noise cancelation headphones they work so well, I never imagined that $38 headphones could sound so good, DON'T PASS THESE UP, even if you go with a more expensive pair, buy these as a backup!

The product (when still functioning) was to my liking, as they canceled out noise and had a decent bass boost. However after about 6-7 months of using them (not even frequently, I might add) the wire right at the base of the headphones needed to be toyed with in order to not get static, or just the right headphone.

This pair failed within 3 months. The left earphone still works fine, but the right earphone has such little sound coming out of it that it is hard to tell it is even playing. This makes the headphones almost useless and really unpleasant to use. I've never had headphones fail so quickly and am really disappointed.

Most of the earbuds I was looking at were $50 and up, I didn't expect to find such quality earbuds at such a low price. I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality of these earbuds. They have a deep rich sound which is great for the bass heavy music that I listen to. I've had them for almost a year and they work just as well as the day I bought them.

You can get some colors for cheaper, if you're not dead set on the black or white. The bass is punchy and the mids and highs are well represented. Listening to music through these earbuds just make music listening sooo much better! However... there's one downside. Where the wire goes into the earbuds and to the 1/8\\" connection... it's not very secure. I've had to buy several of these pairs because of how easily the connections get ruined. However, this time I got smart and put some duct tape around those connections to help secure them. If you don't mind putting a little bit of duct tape on your ear buds... I definitely suggest them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, extremely poor durability","review":"Good sound, good noise reduction (with a good bud fit), but horrible durability. I liked my first pair, but after a couple months, the wire started coming off the jack, rendering it useless. I ultimately bought a second pair (believing that I may have caused the cord issue through my habit of wrapping the cord around my hand to secure my ipod). And although I avoided the cord separation issue the second time around, again the sound started malfunctioning after 2 months. Sound fading in an out, one bud went dead, and finally it stopped working altogether.All in all, it's good while it lasts, but they've skimped on quality, durable materials. Certainly not worth the premium over cheaper earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbuds for the money","review":"Very pleased with these earbuds.

I was quite pleased since I wouldn't expect to get more than a year our of my earbuds with constant use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific upgrade from basic ipod earbuds","review":"I never realized how much a pair of better earbuds could do for the quality of music.

The sound quality is perfect and the low end is much stronger than any other pair I've tried. It's like having a sound studio in your head. Like any other earbud, there is the issue of pushing them in a little too far and closing off the sound, but the three sets of interchangeable earpieces solves that problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, bad quality","review":"Compared to the stock earphones they are great.

Previously, I owned theJBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)and they just weren't that great. I bought them because of the good reviews and the lower price, but the bass was no good and they didn't really seal with my ear - allowing a lot of ambient noise in. The sound quality of these headphones is much better, though. I use them in my ipod touch to listen to all different styles of music - rock, classical, dance and hip-hop and I have to say that I'm pleased with them for all types of music. I'm sure there are better headphones out there, but for the price, these are a perfect fit for me. I also used them for watching movies on my touch and the sound is just awesome.

The first two, it seems perhaps ear wax got stuck in the bud, or else it just stopped working (I couldn't see anything, but could hear sound from the back of the earphone). No amount of cleaning would fix it. For the third, the jack seems to be going.Obviously, I love the sound and fit of these things.

After these, I bought a $1.97 pair from walmart. They just stopped working the other day. The sound wasn't as great, but it was pretty nice, and they kept working for the same amount of time.

Even so, I'm using the V-MODAs right this minute and I'm very pleased with them. They fit my ears right out of the package, frequency response is good, the bass is great, and they seriously block outside noises (which could be a good or bad thing, what with a wife and child in the house).

So I decided to try these because they just have Bass on theor name. They arrived late and after trying them with different songs I regret of buying these headphones, they sound so loud and cheap, I couldn't enjoy any music with them. I deffinitely don't reccomend these at all. A pair of cheap headphones which sound really great were Sony Mdr-Ed12Lp, they are cheaper and you can enjoy any kind of music with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick butt, except....","review":"These were the best headphones I have ever had the joy of using to listen with! I loved it! The sound was so crisp and clear, the noise cancellation really worked! They fit so comfortably in my ear, and they don't fall out unless you want them to. I will definitely buy this again, except there is one thing you should be aware of. I had not owned them for more than 4 months, when one headphone quit working. I was very disappointed. After all that time of enjoying highest quality all around, without emptying my bank account for it, they break after normal use. I believe that this was a fluke, and I am already purchasing a replacement, but be aware of this, and keep the warranty, which I didn't.

I thought the smaller form factor would make them more attractive for when I traveled.I was wrong. The sound quality is not comparable. The Bose headphones are significantly better, even in terms of bass, which was surprising considering all the bass hype and reviews. The comfort is also not comparable. The Bose headphones are way more comfortable. This may be subjective, because all of the included ear pieces appear to large for my ears, and thus they fit uncomfortably, but I'm not sure.Overall, decent headphone, but no better than the ones included with my iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick something else - bad sound and bad fit","review":"Very disappointed in these earbuds.

They took a short while to get used to and I quickly realized how much I like them. My prior set had a connection plug about chest level. I guess it was there to enable to you keep them in your ears and walk away from your player but this never made sense to me and the weight of the connector was too much to keep them in. Also, contrary to one review, I LIKE the fact that the cords are equal length to each ear. The other design puts all the cord weight on one ear which can pull it loose. I also find the little cord winder incredibly handy!My only problem is these are apparently tasty! My dog bit the heads off them so I'm going back on Amazon right now to order a new pair!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great even after 2 1/2 years, but no option for earbud replacements","review":"I paid $19.99 for these in late 2008. Great option for inexpensive, high quality earphones. They are still going strong! At one point the case on one earbud came apart while in a bag under heavy equipment. They did snap back together easily though. My only complaint is the lack of options if one loses a rubber earpiece. Since it only comes with 3 sizes, large, medium and small, you get stuck using a size that doesn't fit correctly.Comes with small rubber piece to conveniently wrap the long cable keeping it organized.V-moda where can I get an earpiece replacement?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought these earbuds about 6 months ago, and they broke already.

But, after a month of using them, one of the speakers began to randomly stop working and then start working again, and the next day both speakers started doing it until they both died completely. It was probably a defective pair, so if you decide on buying this, be warned that it probably won't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"These head phones have ear pieces that easily fall apart.

I've used them while commuting to and from school on the train. They provided excellent sound isolation, from the people, and the train. I've also used them at work, I worked in receiving/stockroom so it would get boring sometimes and listening to tunes would make the time go by faster. They so far have survived from vigorous use, 3+ hours a day of listening, rain and snow from walking from class to class, and dust and dirt while at work. They have begun to fail a bit, from where the connector and wire meet. This is due from me rolling them up all the time after use. Besides this, they have served me well and would not hesitate to buy another set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good product...","review":"For the price (now about $15-$19 depending on color), these ear buds can't be beat. Once you tweak the EQ on your mp3 player, these ear buds ring with surprising depth and clarity. You can get both great clear high tones and deep, tight bass with these little guys. I've spent 4 times the cost of this purchase to get sound quality that is hard pressed to beat these little guys. My only concern is their durability. This is my second set after my daughter ruined my first set after a hand full of uses. It's hard to say whether the failure was due to mishandling on her part or a lack of durability on the part of these ear buds. However, since these guys are now so inexpensive, I bought a back up set as well. If used gently, and you spend the time to tweak your EQ, you really can't beat the insane value for these ear buds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"I'm not sure how/why people are so high on these. I've used everything from nice Bose phones down to some that came free with other equipment. Honestly, these sound much worse that the stock pair that came with my Sansa mp3 player.

Anyway, don't buy these, unless you want garbage, then go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely fragile and flimsy","review":"i bought this back in 2008, then after 5 months only the left side worked. so i sent it in and got another one, same thing happened after another 6 months. still, i assumed i just had bad luck with defective products cuz the reviews were so good. so i ordered another pair, they too broke down after 9 months with only one earbud working, so i sent it in under the warranty and it just broke again. i will NEVER buy from VMODA again, it is the most UNDURABLE headphone i have ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken six times","review":"While the sound was good for it's price, I will never buy this again. All 6 pairs (or even more, I lost track) have either completely broken, got sound muffled, or one piece does not emit sound. I bought one, that broke, warranty covered it, it broke again. I bought a 3rd one, broke, 4th one broke, warranted 5th one broke, then after another month my 6th one broke. I'm tired of spending $30 every month. I regret buying this and now I have moved on to the utterly amazing Klipsch Image S4s, which sounds on par with Shure SE310 and many others worth 3 times its $80 dollar value. While it may seem expensive, it is actually a lot cheaper since it will last you longer, compared to my 6 pairs which lasted me about 8 months for about $140 + $60 warranty covered ones. Honestly, just avoid these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap shoddy construction","review":"I bought the Bling-bling Black. What can I say? I love the sound. Crisp clear highs and midrange and the low deep rich bass. The construction? HATED IT!! Where the cord comes out of the plug is the major weak spot and is not compatible with an active lifestyle. The connection where the plug meets the cord allows for too much movement at the joint hense the wire connection breaks inside the insulation. Results either the right or left plug stops working or both. In my case it was always the right plug. This is my 5th pair of headphones in less than a year. Every single pair died within a few months of purchase. You'd think for the price you pay for them, there'd be sturdier concstruction an active lifestyle. and hold up to V-Moda really needs to rethink this design flaw. Overall my rating is 5 stars for sound and 2 for construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...While they lasted","review":"These are a great sounding earbuds!

My friend used his at his home and the right side just fell apart, although he was able to put it back together, the quality of the build just doesn't justify the price tag.

However, over the past couple of weeks, the sound has been spotty in the right ear. This afternoon the sound shut off completely in the right ear. So while these are fairly nice headphones (and moderately priced to boot), they only lasted me a few months so I do not recommend them to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I originally intended to review this product at 3 stars. Keep in mind that I originally bought them for $34.75. The sound quality is great and has lots of bass (what i was looking for), but the cord is VERY thin. I take very good care of my electronic equipment (my ipod is my baby) and any accessories... so imagine my dismay when the wire cover started coming apart right where it connects to the jack. Had to rig it with some electrical tape to extend the life. At least I got a good 8 months of use before any casualties!!FYI be VERY CAREFUL with the cord (i.e. when wrapping it around anything, don't yank it out of the jack, etc). I suppose thats good advice for any headphones, but these especially because of the thin cord. Otherwise they are great headphones, especially for bass lovers such as myself. And at the current price, I don't mind purchasing another pair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only bass freaks need apply!!!","review":"These are way too heavy on the bass. I was expecting them to be bass heavy, but not at such of an expense to the rest of the spectrum; especally because of the good reviews here. There are entire parts of songs I can barely hear that normally stand out. Perhaps others are correcting with an equalizer, a true sign of bad earphones. Either that or people don't know what good earphones should sound like.For now I'll keep my Zune premium earphone which are so much better than these and use these for the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth about $20","review":"I am underwhelmed. There is bass to this, yes. But that is not nearly all that is required for high quality sound. These are comparable to any other $19 set found at the local discount store. I can't explain all the raves--\\"the emperor has no clothes\\" maybe? The marketing of these is very appealing, so maybe people are hearing what they expect to hear, rather than what they actually hear. If you are after a $20 set, that is what you will get with these. And I'm not complaining--it would be crazy to complain that a set of headphones that cost $20 is only worth $20. But I am not raving either."},{"rating":"1","title":"good sound, but eventually break after couple months","review":"I am a heavy ipod listener and I use my headphones constantly. I like these headphones a lot because the sound is good. But after a just a few months the sound inevitably goes out on one side due to poor wiring. I am about to go on my fourth pair. I have already sent one pair back to the manufacturer, which they replaced, however the same thing is starting to happen again, and it's only been a couple months. Familiar with the problem, I have been extra careful to be gentle with the wire when using it. But alas, I can already hear the sound starting to go out in one ear. It's only a matter of time now before the sound cuts out altogether. This is really annoying because I think the sound quality is great, but I dont want to have to keep sending them back. For 30 bucks they should last a lot longer than 3-4 months. The 10 dollar sony's (MDR-W08L Headphones) I used to buy would last at least 6 months to a year before the same thing happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality","review":"I am on my second pair. The first time one of the ear buds stopped working and the next second the second one went out. I received a free pair as part of their warranty, but that one is cracking where it plugs into my ipod as well. I am anticipating that I have about a few days before this one goes too. The sound quality is great for the price, but I went through them every 3-5 months. I would like to try the pricier earbuds from vmoda, but I am not confident on the quality of them either. These earbuds are not worth the price of writing several emails to vmoda, going to post office to send damaged earbuds, going a week+ without headphones and have them break again in 3 months. Try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge disappointment!","review":"A couple of major issues with these earbuds, but I'm only going to address the most signicant, which is that the earphones are useless unless you plan to use them while sitting completely still. No movement at all. Don't even breathe.I just got mine yesterday and tried them out at the gym today. After I put them on I walked a few feet and then paused. Thwok, thwok, thwok...what the?? The slight tapping of the wire against my shirt as I walked was loud, distracting and makes the earphones essentially worthless for active use. Unless you like to hear, thwok, thwok, thwok..I would go on, but as far as I'm concerned, that's all you need to know. Unless you plan to stop breathing while using your new earbuds, do not buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're picky about sound quality, skip these.","review":"True to the name, the low-end bass response is incredible with these buds. Sadly, the midbass is loud but not crisp, and the claim of \\"warm mids and crisp highs\\" is a joke. The Sennheiser MX400's have much better balance and provide superior SQ if you bump the bass a couple notches. Because of the \\"earplug\\" effect, the heavy bass and the too-bright highs, these might be okay for a plane ride, but the overall sound quality doesn't make the cut for general listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"V-Moda","review":"These are not only a great value but a great product.

The bass part are almost of the same performance. But the sound at higher frequency of this earbud is kind of crappy. Also, don't expect too much from sound-isolation.

The headphone itself has no issues the real issue is the plug, it poorly made my first pair the plug was literally pulled off the cable, just regular use for a couple of months. I was really disappointed, even cheaper Jvc of Philips are better build that these. I wrote a complain to the company, never got an answer. so I started to use my next pair, i was very careful this time, which was a little annoying for me. this time after 6 months it started to get no sound from left speaker, and a week after no sound at all in both speakers. when i move the plug i can get some noise, that make me believe it is the plug or the cable again. good headphones but do no buy it unleash you want a headphone for a couple of months and trow it away after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb for the price","review":"These headphones work very well, especially for the price. The sound is very good and the design of the different sized in-ear buds helps with noise cancellation compared with headphones that just sit on the ear. As such, volume does not need to be high on your device to drown out crowd noise. They did not feel invasive, and after 3+ hours straight, 7+ hours on some days total, they did not hurt my ears like the \\"stock\\" ipod in-ear buds did after only a short while. And, surprisingly, they stayed in my ears without any problems, a concern when I was ordering them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound....but","review":"Love the sound, just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, the wire developed a short at the point where it plugs into the ipod, rendering the earbuds useless.

Only problem is that they tend to slip off if you just have one hanging from one ear. To get the best possible bass response you must find the perfect seal. They sound almost close to my Sony MDR-700's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheers for my ears!","review":"These are simply great earbuds. Comfortable, quiet with great sound quality. The only drawback however slight is the fact that at times there is cord noise. If V-MODA could fix this problem these earbuds would rank 5 stars for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for the price!","review":"I totally wore out my Sony ear buds, so I read a ton of reviews for these headphones. After receiving these and using them for about a month I can say that a lot of the \\"bad\\" reviews were just wrong. The bass on these are great and they don't overwhelm the vocals at all! These are such great ear buds! I'm so happy with my purchase. I will grant you that the wires are flimsier than most; but they really aren't terrible, you get used to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One earbud broke within a week!","review":"I'm a big fan of bass, so I decided to get this product. At first, they were a definite improvement over the regular ipod earbuds, and they felt good too. But then one day, I pull the earbuds out of my pocket (I don't just shove them in I carefully place them in a little container that holds them) and I see that the left earbud is broken. The \\"sphere\\" that makes up the bud split down the middle, with all the exposed circuitry available for me to see. It still worked, it just didn't snap back together or anything. I got a refund and I am going to purchase a much better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Have had for almost a year......no problems....haven't broken, come apart or anything mention in lower rated reviews......Love the sound...not muddle...more bass so if you don't like...mmmmm.... Great value..."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke in 45 days","review":"The sound is very good and they are comfortable, BUT mine broke in 45 days. I wore them daily with my iPod and they can't take the pressure of daily use. I didn't run with them, so they just faced the regular shock of walking around. They now fade in and out when I plug them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor build quality","review":"These headphones had amazing sound and fit so comfortably. The reason I gave them one star is that they broke after about only 2 months of daily use. The build quality on them was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound--- fell apart almost instantly.","review":"My son bought them for our other son, and while the sound quality was great, they fell apart right away. It looks like a design flaw, because the plastic seam that hold the base together, just fell apart, and does not go back together. This was very disappointing because it was a gift that he saved up to give, and now is back to no head phones, because they are non-funtional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in less than 2 months","review":"They sounded good, the silicone tips came in reasonable sizes and provided good noise isolation. Under 2 months into my term of ownership, a break developed in the right channel of the headphones. A week or so later the left channel went out too. Order date: 10/8/07, right channel failure date: 11/21/07, left channel failure: 11/29/07.Unless you see headphones as part of a disposable 2-month cycle, I would purchase something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently loss of sound from one earbud is a pretty common finding","review":"When I first bought these in October 2006, one earbud plastic broke while I tried to pull it out of the package. Luckily the Tekserve folks allowed me to exchange it; apparently it happened so often V-Moda should call it a package design defect. Also, the silicon plugs keep getting pulled off so I keep losing them. My left earbud finally stopped working after 14 months of use, and I used them only once a week. Also, the bass is clear but the mids and highs are muted. I use my iPod to lower the bass just so I can hear the vocals. This is a bad product for its frequency range and durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a month","review":"It only took a month for this piece of junk to stop working, sound only comes out of one side now. Sound quality and fit were good, but what does it matter if they don't work?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound while they last.","review":"For my iPod, I used the apple earbuds for a while. I probably put them through all hell and they still worked great. I just found them to be uncomfortable. I got these V-Moda's to replace them. They sounded great, but are exceedingly fragile. They broke within a week. I am a typical college student, so I always just put my computer, iPod, whatever else in my bookbag. The apple earbuds lasted and held up well, these didn't. The plastic is incredibly thin and the earphones cracked for no apparent reason. I am extremely disapointed and am sending them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"great sound poor quality","review":"Got these in May with pepsi points and today one side doesn't work. When they did work they were the best sounding earphones I've had. the earphone when not in use were put in the closet with the wire hanging down so the wire was never tangled no reason for them to break. if it wasn't for getting these through the pepsi points I would be alot madder than I am now."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!","review":"I am on my third pair - yes that's right - my third! While the head phones are good when they are working and while the company has replaced them at no charge (shipping to the company was out of my pocket), they . all stopped working within months of receipt. I don't abuse them, I used them about 2 hours a day, they are not near water, they were not stepped on, nothing, not even a torn wire cover, not even a scratch. It was the same problem each time - I couldn't hear out of one earbud. I refuse to continue to use their product. They will not offer a credit or an exchange for something better. I have decided to buy a Sennheiser, which I was originally looking to buy but it was not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound quality, poor durability","review":"These are great sound quality earbuds, but my first pair lasted 3 months, and my second pair only one month. I've sent both back to v-moda for warranty replacement. The wire at the ipod port connection is thin and not durable enough. Both times only sound will only come out of one speaker until you wiggle the wire. The port needs to be reinforced for better durability and repeat customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, doesn't last","review":"I bought these headphones two months ago and I just discovered today that one side doesn't work. It makes me sad because the sound quality was very good. However since they don't last long I don't recommend getting these. I only give two stars because the sound was good for the time it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ear Buds for the Money","review":"I've had these earbuds for a few weeks and I am very pleased with thier performance. I use them to listen to podcasts and music and find the sound to be very good. The bass is a little heavy at times but its nothing you can't tone down with an equalizer. Also they fit in my ear quite well and block out a lot of ambient noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bass... after tweaking the equalizer","review":"At first I didn't know how this product could receive the Cnet Editor's Choice award. I got these headphones from Amazon today and JUST tried them out. Without adjusting the equalizer on my mp3 player or my PC's media player, the bass was practically nonexistent, and the bass claims were the reason I bought them. Other than that, the sounds were clear but there was a LOT of (maybe too much) treble, which bothers my left ear. I thought maybe the ones I got were faulty, because my old cheap over-the-head Aiwa headphones had a richer sound with the same player settings. THEN... I adjusted additional settings on the PC media and mp3 player and VOILA! Deep bass on the PC, and less treble on the mp3 player. I didn't like the fact that I had to change the settings on my mp3 player to get non-ear-stabbing sound (now when I plug the mp3 player up to my desk or car speakers, i might have to change the settings again). But otherwise, the V-moda earphones work pretty well."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice sounding buds","review":"The V-MODA Bass earbuds sound better than the earphones that came with my iPod. Because the gel tips go into the ear, it blocks out some external sound but just a little. It may depend on the user but the gel tips make my ears tired after wearing it for a while.The only problem I had is the earbuds are pretty delicate. I have had 2 pairs break on my already. I threw away my first broken pair but I sent the 2nd broken and V-moda replaced it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent sound quality, great bass, and durable!","review":"When it comes to in ear headphones, it's a challenge to find something comfortable that offers great sound quality and great bass even at higher volumes. These toast to all three. It's actually hard to distort these with high bass/ volume which means you can pump your music the way you like without sacrificing the low end. I also wear these for hours at a time without any ear pain or fatigue.The only drawback would be that they isolate your ear to the sound using a \\"plunger,\\" so you need to exercise caution if you are running around at night with these in as you cannot hear what is around you. Certainly not knocking the product though, this is what was intended and is the reason for the fabulous audible experience they provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Superior to $100 Bose...","review":"I must say, these impressed me. I love great sound to match great music. Of my vast headphone and earbud collection, these are among my favorite. The highs are crisp, the mids are full, and the bass is deep and rich. Much better than the Bose I spent $100 on. Pretty comfortable considering the expected intrusiveness of canal earbuds.My only complaint would be the springy chord. It gets pretty annoying unless you run it under your shirt or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was very disappointed in this product. The music sounds tinny and I had to turn the volume up. The earbud is comfortable, but the earbuds that came with my iPod are better. It wasn't worth ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"after i got my headphones in the mail i tried them out and i was disappointed by the poor quality of sound. i had bought $3 earphones from a retail store a few months earlier that had better sound quality. but thats not the worst part. after about 10 uses the left ear bud completely died.i would give this a 0 star rating for how bad i got ripped off but i cant. im here to try to stop other customers from getting screwed like i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"Same review as the Sennheiser cx300's:I have been a musician for over 30 years, built and operated PA systems, worked professionally as a sound man and have spent a lot of time in studios, I know what I am listening to.These were better than the trash that comes with most MP3 players, but they really were very underwhelming, the bass was non existing in my opinion.Save your money, go to walmart and buy the $16.00 Phillips\\"virtual surround\\" vented ear buds, they are much better unless you want total isolation. I don't want isolation, I would like to hear the truck that is about to run me over... But all that aside, the Phillips were the best out of 5 models I tested including the sennheiser cx300s."},{"rating":"2","title":"little dynamo","review":"great little earphones. very clear very durable, I have been using them at the gym for about a month now and they sound great, i have no problem with the fit.

Mine was glued to the packaging material and broke trying to get it off. I did get a refund for that one. My daughters broke within a few days. My wife didn't care for the way they felt in her ears so gave hers to me. I have used them for 2-3 weeks and so far they are still working. The sound is very good for music but some voices in spoken word are hard to understand because of the bass. If they were a little more durable I would like them better but they are way too fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds","review":"A great product if you do not use it.

The \\"rouge\\" sound amazing, but the \\"rocker red\\" and \\"jungle green\\" sound terrible with absolutely no bass. I am aware that fit matters a lot, and they all fit the same. But they don't sound the same at all. I guess I'm happy that I bought 5 pairs of Rouge and only 1 of the other two! By they way, I know they are authentic because I bought them all directly from v-moda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent quality","review":"I got this pair of headphones after owning a previous version which broke after 2 years. The sound quality was quite good on the first pair so I got another pair. Upon receiving this pair, the sound quality was not as good as the previous pair and after only six months they have already stopped working. I don't use them for any serious tasks, only listening to music on my laptop and on the bus, so I don't think I have worn them out.Despite the good sound quality, I have not been impressed by how quickly they wear out. I previously owned Sony in-ear headphones like these, with similar sound quality but they lasted my 4 years as opposed to 2 years and 6 months with the two pairs of these headphones I've owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good bass but didn't last much.","review":"This was the first bass headphones i bought. Most say the bass sound great but less then a month the left ear bud stop working.

The wiring may short out also if your not careful. On the plus side they have terrfic bass and clear treble for the buck. So unless you keep these in a secure place and do not use t hem everyday then I would recommend them (maybe)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-destructs after 3 months!","review":"I bought these earbuds to replace my broken Senn CX300s and originally gave them 5/5 stars after using them for about a month. They had decent sound, a comfortable fit, and unbeatable value. Three months later, they fell apart.I gradually lost sound in the right ear over the course of a week and noticed the jack coming out of it's protective covering. Soon enough, the whole jack fell out. It was like the solder or adhesive or whatever just dissolved when v-moda decided they wanted another $20+ from me. Well, nice try, v-moda, but my next $20 is going to a soldering iron to fix my drawer full of broken earbuds. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 2 sets, both broke within 2 months!!!","review":"These produce great sound but they are so cheaply built that I bought two sets and they both stopped working suddenly within 2 months. They are a complete waste of money and frankly the company should be ashamed for producing such a cheaply made product."},{"rating":"2","title":"v-moda sounds great, great price","review":"while not the most comfortable or stable in-ear buds, these sound great for the price. sound quality is largely dependent on the fit. the cable does feel very weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely awesome.","review":"I'm not a super audiophile or anything, but I know what are good headphones, and what are bad. These are the best headphones that I own so far. They are very comfortable, allowing it's owners to choose from 3 different sizes for the ears. It's very in expensive compared to the other headphones. However, the buds do come off once in a while, and the headphones aren't the best build. But, for the price, it isolates sound extremely well! If you're thinking about getting skull candys instead of these, better rethink that thought. I've had these headphones for over a year now, and the lifespan of skullcandys can't match this. Spend your money wisely! It's been over a year as I've said, and these headphones still let the bass kick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these earphones","review":"I have purchased two of these earphones and i now know that the earphones are not very durable. the first pair i purchased lasted me only 2 months and when they broke i happen to have just bought a new iPhone so i used those earphones and after a couple of months, I decided i needed a higher quality of earphones so I went back to V-moda because they sound pretty good for the price.

I had one for six months and used them like no other cause the bass was bangin. Then, the left side just died. I stopped using it. I thought maybe it was because I kept it in my purse all the time it probably just smashed around and broke.Bought them a second time. Used them for no longer than a month and the left side stopped transmitting sounds. What a waste of money. I switched over to JBuds, and realized that you can get quality sound that lasts longer just for a few dollars more. The pink isn't as nice, but at least I can use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both Good and Bad","review":"The exchangeable pieces doesn't stay in the ears as well as some of the other models and slips out occasionally while running.

The low sound, however, is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"The earbuds that came with my IPOD work a million times better!! I was so dissappointed when I first tried the V Moda that I thought maybe my IPOD was broken. When I switched back to the earbuds that came with my IPOD, the music was beautiful again, rich full bodied, but when I put the V Moda back on, the music sounded like I was listening from a tin can, under water and heavily medicated. God awful product. Does anybody test these items before presented on my beloved Amazon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you try them before you buy them.","review":"I just bought these in late June 2007 and the feel is a little awkward because they stick inside of your ear further than usual ear buds. This makes the sound a little more clear and there is less background noise, but I find having something inside my ear like this is a little too strange.My main beef is with the company. I purchased these only two months ago and have only used them on my Creative Vision M player and they burnt out for some reason in the middle of a song. Now there is no sound at all on any device I plug them into and V-moda wants me to pay to ship them to them plus I will get another pair of them which I already don't want so I will have to sell these on ebay or something and then buy some other brand. Such a hassle!!! I just would like a check for what I paid and a free shipping label to send them back to them. I don't think that's too much to ask for a product that they back so well verbally."},{"rating":"2","title":"To much bass?","review":"These buds work great if your player has little or no bass ONLY!

I checked the reviews, and this looked like a great choice. Maybe I got a defective one, but these earbuds are awful!

So, obviously, they're now useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid these headphones","review":"These headphones perfectly recreate the sound of music playing through a dorm room wall. If you like that sound, you'll love these headphones. How do these headphones achieve \\"bass\\"? By cutting the treble and midrange to muffled insignificance. Also, you'll enjoy the crinkly saran wrap sound of the speaker diaphragm going back and forth as you insert them in your ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"Ok, this is one of the highly-rated reviews that I don't quite understand. I purchased these buds fully expecting better sound overall, not to mention better bass tone over the buds that came with my iTouch. I set my sounds to 'bass booster' in my iTouch settings, yet the Apple iTouch headsets still remain so far superior it's not even funny. What am I missing here? Did I just happen to get a bad set? The bass tones are completely missing, they fall out of my ear more easily than the iPod/iTouch headsets, no matter what size piece I use as well. It's just WAY too tinny...so, till I find a better set of buds (I'm considering the Bose) I'll be tossing these in the trash & sticking with the set that came with my iTouch for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I did not find these earbuds to be as good as other reviews I read.They were a little tinny and did not have the bass range I was hoping for"},{"rating":"2","title":"I made a good selection when I bought my V-MODA Bass!","review":"The V-MODA bass is a good earphone, the sounds is very good, and I think if you need to buy one, you can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I have been using the original earbuds that came with the iPod. They have been fine but it was suggested that other earbuds would give better sound. Reviews of the V-MODA here and elsewhere were most mostly positive. So I bought them. Big mistake. I can't understand why they were given good reviews.The sound quality is noticeably inferior to the original Apple earbuds. Apple's have a full, rich, 3D quality. V-MODA's sound flat, dull, tinny and do not provide an enjoyable experience. I have tried every EQ setting. Nothing sounds good. It's not that there is too much bass. There isn't enough of anything.Maybe for podcasts and other spoken recordings these would be fine. But, for music--any kind--these are a bad choice. I can't recommend them.

The fit was also quite comfortable and with a somewhat extended commute, that's definitely something I appreciate.

My primary listening is audiobooks so I don't need uber high fidelity. What I look for is comfort. These are the first in-the-ear phones that I've found that are actually comfortable. The silicone ear buds come in three sizes and are very flexible so they conform to the shape of my ear canal pretty comfortably.I decided the smallest size fit me the best. To get the best sound you have to make sure they are fully seated down IN the ear canal. I have found this does take some getting used to. The silicone tips seal out surrounding noise very well. On the other hand, it does feel and sound like you have your ears plugged in your own head.Updated: I've decided I am not a fan of earbuds. They block out too much sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another pair of cheap headphones","review":"Garbage, garbage, garbage. The left earbud stopped working a month after I got them.

The sound and fit were fine.After just three months, however, they became unusable:One earphone began to transmit sound only intermittently. I had to twist the cords in such a way to make them work.After several weeks of this frustrating process, it became impossible to make the dysfunctional earphone operate properly, rendering the set useless.Evidently made with cheap materials and assembled with a poor design.I recently purchased a cheaper set - a different brand - which have worked fine.I will not purchase from this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Blue Steel","review":"Got these for my son for Christmas and only one ear bud worked.

I am very happy with them. I guess based on the namesake I was hoping for even more bass than they have, but I am satisfied with them as a whole.

One week later I received these in the mail and was amazed by the quality in sound and the OUTSTANDING bass levels. Deep and clear sounds only from the Bass Freq's of V-Moda. If your like me you like your music loud, these can take any amount of power without flaws. Also another big concern with ear buds is the material used on the part that's in your ear. V-Moda uses a very soft but insulating material that completely blocks outside noises while remaining comfortable in your ear for hours. True customer review.~Kurtis~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Earbuds for Daily Listening - Bass Response is Good","review":"I purchased these earbuds from V-Moda as they were discounting their V-Moda Bass Freq for $8.88 each. They only had the \\"Jungle Green\\" and the \\"Jungle Green Camo\\" which has some brown on the buds. I got the Camo to be more \\"masculine\\"They definately have increased bass response but lack in the midrange. I bought these mainly to see what kind of product V-Moda has to offer at the lower end of their product line (I have my eyes set on the Vibratos). I was not disappionted by what I heard. Even with the i-pod at the \\"bass boost\\" setting they still gave a strong, clear bass response. Even though the midrange is lacking, the high end is crisp and clean.These are a great set of earbuds for everyday use. The wires are thin, but if you are careful, these should be a good choice for everyday use.I would love some feedback on their mid-priced buds like the Remix or Vibe Duo.Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after two months","review":"I was sorely disappointed with these earphones.At first I was pretty excited about them; they seemed to be working great--I bought them to replace a pair of iFrogz earphones that suddenly stopped working. After about two months I started having the same problem with these as I did with my previous earphones. I had music on, and midsong, the earphones stopped working. I could hear the music fine, but the singer was so faded out that I could not even hear the words. It sounds almost like I am listening to someone sing underwater. This is the SAME thing that happened with my last earphones. I'm very upset that I spent the money on these only to have them break on me. I would NOT recommend buying these."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Expectations ... A Bust","review":"With all the great reviews I thought these buds would be the bomb. But instead they bombed.

Amazing sound and great bass. However, they only worked for less than 5 MONTHS. Like CNET stats, \\"thin cable tangles easily and may not hold up in the long run.\\" And the later is TRUE. The cables are very thin and mines don't show any signs of wear and tear. But they just stopped working. If I want sound, I have to squeeze the cables constantly and it is truly annoying. BEWARE!!!

I'm no sound expert, but the bass was bumpin' (when I was listening to electronica and house like daft punk and justice), yet songs with a lot of treble (like\\"Last Nite\\" by the Strokes\\") sounded exceptional as well.That is... while these stupid things worked.Two months into buying them, I get them out of my pocket only to discover that the left earbud stopped working. I tried contacting V-Moda but gave up, cause I ended up losing the earphones haha.Seriously though, if you enjoy wasting 35 dollars on a product that will work well... for 2 months.. then go ahead.I am not alone in saying these things can and will break. Many other reviews here agree with me, so do yourself a favor music lovers. Look elsewhere and buy yourself another pair of more durable earphones.

I mainly used them walking to and on the bus with an mp3 player in my pocket. The sound quality was good and they stayed in my ears better than the Sony MDR-EX71. However, within the last year I've gone through two sets of these, both with the same issue. One earbud would stop producing sound and then within a week the other would fail as well. The problem appears to be wear at the junction where the cord goes into the plug. Cosmetically these looked fine, but they wouldn't produce sound. These earbuds just can't stand up to everyday use with an mp3 player in your pocket. I will be replacing these with a hopefully more durable pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"Both ear buds broke apart, connected only by the thin wire carrying the signal, within three weeks.

Now for the update. The left earbud no longer works. Now initially I thought it was a fluke or maybe I did something to it...pulled to hard or whatever, but now I can see this is a serious product design problem (judging from other reviews) so I have changed my review from five to one star. Sorry, it doesn't matter how great they sound when you first get them, if they stop working within a year, what does it matter.***Okay for the money, these are fantastic. Sound is deep and rich, blocks out all outside noise and you will find that you need to turn the volume down as it comes in crystal clear and loud. The only thing I don't like about them is the god awful color. Believe the picture, it's accurate.

Only issues would be when I move around (walking there's the sound of the wire tugging the earbud, eating the earbud falls out).

They don't pollute sound, meaning you can listen to music pretty loud and no one will be able to hear it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but......","review":"These earbuds have great sound but.... unfortunately they are not very dependable. I have already gone thru two sets with the same issue. One of the buds stops working. The sound only comes thru one ear.

I have never written a positive or negative review for any product, but I felt compelled to write about this product. The stock iPod earbuds sound WAY better.

I love that the buds come in different sizes because I have small ear openings and the buds that came with my ipod are too large. I continuously wore these for a couple of hours and did not feel any discomfort. The only thing with having such a tight feel is that it does feel like a suction cup in your ear.

Don't waste your money. The crappy white apple iphones sound much better then these. True, the bass is ok in these vmodas, but the mids are honky and the highs are shrill and extremely unpleasant. You are better off with the freebies you get on a plane flight, no joke. I have several sets of regular and in ear buds, various price and quality, and they all sound MUCH better then these. Not worth returning, and don't fit my 11 year old daughter's little ear canals (I tossed the extra silicone inserts) so I am just going to trash these ultra-crappy sounding pieces of dung. I have a pair of Sony regular (not in-ear canal type, but the apple style ones) earphones that came with my droid that sound infinitely better then these, and the base is just as loud and much crisper. The high-mid and high's on these v-modas are actually ugly and almost painful at moderate volumes, and just nasty at low volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least Comfortable Ear Buds I've Ever Worn","review":"Okay, I'll keep this short. These ear buds sound great. They aren't lying when they say that they have amazing bass. The plastic feels quality. The cord wrap that it comes with works well.Here's my beef. They actively hurt my ears to wear from the moment I put them in.I don't know if its the rubber tip or what but they create almost a vacuum in my ears that is painful. Its not even uncomfortable, its painful. I tried once I bought them to stick it out and hope that the rubber tips loosened up or something but to no avail. Its rare that I get on Amazon to submit anything but a possitive review but I wanted to warn others how much these hurt. Its possible its just my ears but these don't work for me at all. The smallest size is too small, the medium fits but is painful, and the biggest is way too huge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great...for 3 months","review":"I purchased these earbuds for my iPod, which I use when commuting to work and working out on the treadmill. They worked great...for the first three months. One day, the right earbud stopped working altogether. Only then did I go back and look at all the one-star reviews by other users and saw that other disappointed customers experienced the same exact defect.I read on the seller's profile that defective items could only be returned within 30 days of purchase, so I am out of luck. Would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formidable Bass, bad mid/high","review":"I tried the three different earpiece sizes.With the smallest size, the earpiece did not complete seal well in my ear canal. Bass was really poor, but mid and highs were decent.With the medium size, the earpiece sealed completely. Bass was REALLY good, but the mid and highs were REALLY bad.Perhaps the issue is with the user's ears. when I put the medium size on, I feel like I am pressurizing the air between the headphones and my ear drum. When this occurs, perhaps my eardrum is unable to detect/vibrate appropriately to higher freq sound. But because the air is sealed tight, bass response is incredible.I returned this set because I could not have both. Either Good bass w/bad mid/highs, or bad bass, with decent mid/highs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booming bass, nothing else","review":"Big bass, absolutely horrible mid and highs.This is a terribly over-rated product- which I learned the hard way.Sony MDR-EX36V are a far superior set in this price range.Do not buy these earbuds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased these buds in September 2008 and used them a few times a week while walking. Yesterday, while going out for a walk I noticed that I'm hearing only half of the sound. It's hard to describe, but sound comes out of both buds, however, the bass-tones and certain background music isn't audible. During my walk I had to fidget with them in order to hear the song properly.I am writing this review as I know that I've handled them carefully and stored them after each use to keep them from any sort of damage. Why do I have to replace them after less than nine months of occasional use?"},{"rating":"2","title":"These headphones are ridiculous.","review":"V-Moda Bass Freq headphones surpassed my expectations greatly. a lot of reviews said that the sound quality isnt that great because the bass takes over and the highs and mids dont sound good. but i say they sound great. sound quality is excellent and the bass is sooooo deep and precise, i love them. the silicone, in-ear, part is very comfortable, i couldnt even feel them in my ears, maybe cuz they were vibrating my brain... if you are looking for a good quality, heavy deep bass earphone, these are the ones for you. they are a steal, for $24!?!? please buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're alright - nothing special","review":"I recently purchased V-moda \\"bass freq\\" earbuds for my iPod Touch. I prefer the earbuds that came with the iPod for sound and comfort. The iPod earbuds seem to reproduce the sound of my music more naturally without the bass overpowering the higher frequencies. The iPod earbuds are much more comfortable. I don't like the way the V-moda earbuds insert into my ear canals creating pressure in my ears. I always know they're there. Fortunately, they don't cost a lot so there's not a lot at stake if you don't like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbuds","review":"I bought these as an upgrade from the ear buds which came with my Zune. These have a selection of 3 sizes of bud covers to fit well into the ear. I have small ears and the smallest size is a perfect fit. They are comfortable and do not fall out. The sound is really good, better than I expected for the price actually. I am not a huge heavy bass lover, but these cover all the frequency ranges nicely. If you love heavy bass or not, you will like these. No movement artifact either. I see no need to upgrade from these."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best earbuds i've ever owned.","review":"Ive had various pairs of earbuds over the years from decent sony buds to the ever crappy (and i don't care what ANYONE says...they suck) bose in ear pieces of crap,and these are BY FAR the best out of the bunch. I've had this pair for about 5 months and they offer THE BEST quality sounds i've heard yet. i live in NYC and ride the subway almost everyday and trust me these earbuds even cancel out the noise from the trains!!! you recieve a VERY HIGH (be careful) volume without annoying the people sitting next to you which is a big plus. i use these for my Zune 80g and am my girl has been begging for a pair for her ipod andthe price is a BIG PLUS. Do yourself a favor and give these a shot you will not be sorry!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but Fragile","review":"When I first got my Bass Freqs I loved them. They create rich lower notes well and I love the sound isolation capabilities. Then one of the earbuds began to play music noticeably quieter than the other. This happened only a couple weeks after buying the earbuds from Amazon. After getting a new pair on warranty, I was glad to find they worked perfectly after that... until one of the earbuds just fell apart. And it happened right after the warranty ended, too. Not only that, but the other earbud has just started falling apart, and they are both unreliable. I would not buy this product again, no matter how good it makes my music sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound like tiny fitted beer cans","review":"There is no slidy, plastic clip to hold the earphones together like the stock ipod headphones. Oh well at least they have a lovely fit in my ears. Lovely until you turn on the music and find they are the worst sounding headphones you have ever owned. I tried ever EQ setting and music style looking for a reason to keep them.I threw them In the garbage can by day 3. I now have current generation apple headphones again and they are more comfortable and sound perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but Sennheiser has same performance for 1/2 the price","review":"I fly a lot, so I wanted some earphones that would reduce the airplane noise. First I got the Shure E2c since they were the most widely advertised. What a disaster -- I hard a very hard time getting them to fit in my ears, and when I finally did they were uncomfortable and the sound was pretty awful (very tinny).Then I got the V-Moda Vibe earphones and the Sennheiser CX-300. Both were much better in every way than the Shures -- better fit and better sound. Overall, the sound on the Sennheiser was slightly better (more bass) than the V-Moda. I also felt the Sennheiser did the best job of the 3 of blocking out the ambient noise. Add that to the fact they cost about half of the other 2, and the clear winner is the Sennheiser CX-300."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"This is an extremely cheap product (poor grade of plastic) and sound quality is...for the lack of a better word...gross!

I've read pretty good reviews so I figured why not. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed in their overall sound quality. The headphones that came with my iPod sounded way better than these. Yes, the bass response was slightly better but I went back to the ones that came with my iPod. I'm pretty picky when it comes to sound quality so I make sure the songs I load onto my iPod are high quality. If you're like me I wouldn't waste your $ on these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I was ready to plunge some serious cash on a set of earbuds from Shure until I saw these while browsing around Amazon. I figured that I really couldn't lose with it's price and mountain of good reviews. The community is right, these buds are great! The fit is perfect for my ears with the medium sized fitments. The sound quality is great and I love that I can really feel the bass when I want it. I now own two pairs, one for my workout mp3 player, and one for the office. This has got to be the best bang for the buck earbud set available."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K. Would not recommend. They fall out too easily.","review":"These are not very good.

Item quality was really good for the first three weeks I had it. However, I stored it in my backpack and one of the ear pieces completely fell apart. Sure, it wasn't stored as it should of (which is why i'm not that upset) but i've had much cheaper headphones that were stored the same way that lasted much longer. So, if you're going to get them, my advice is 'handle with care'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"These earbuds are very good for the price, if you're thinking of a more comfortable pair to replace your stock iPod earbuds, these are great. They're comfortable, stay in my ears, and sound great...with lots of brain-thumping bass. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that they didn't provide nearly the amount of noise isolation advertised. They're better than the iPod earbuds since those don't provide any isolation but not even close to that of something likeEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones (White)the sound isolation of the V-Moda is marginal, it does a little bit but not very much. They're on par with other earbuds of this type. I would choose these over other brands because of the sound quality they provide and they style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello Bass, Please return my music","review":"These produced so much bass with my I pod that I could barely hear the music, just the pounding.

My only critique is when you are working out the earbuds tend to slip a bit in your ear, requiring adjustment."},{"rating":"1","title":"These headphones are poorly made.","review":"Got the earphones late october 2008. Only use them for maybe one hour each day 3-5 times a week and the earphones were working only sporadically (sound would come in and out of right earpiece) by December 13, 2008. I am very careful with my electronic equipment and have had other earphones in the same price-range that lasted for years. Additionally, the earbuds WOULD NOT stay in my ear even after trying all the \\"nipples\\" provided. I would put them in they would feel secure then I take a few steps and they would shift making for very poor sound. If you plan to use these while sitting completely still they may work but evenso, a earphone should last more than 1.5 months. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, poor quality construction","review":"On sound quality, this V-Moda is a definite improvement over the iPhone buds. However, the plastic shell on V-Moda buds began to disintegrate after 6 weeks. Cheap plastic, cheaply constructed. Also, the wires are so thin that they're constantly getting twisted up. iPhone's wires seem the perfect gauge to avoid this. So, iPhone buds may be have mediocre sound, but they're much better made. I wouldn't buy the V-Moda again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Bass?","review":"For headphones with a name like \\"Bass Freq\\", I thought there would be a noticable difference in the level of bass put out. Wrong!! They actually sound worse than the cheaper ipod style phones that they are replacing, although they are considerably more comfortable. I have to push them way far in my ears to hear any bass at all (and then they just slide back out)! I would not recommend these and will probably go back to the old style phones. At least I know they sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted less then 1 yr","review":"Purchased in Sept. 2009. Lasted less then 1 year. The headphone wires are just too fragile. The sound was fine but I think having a product that will not even last 12 months is not a good sign that the company is much interested in quality. And like so many others it was the left ear piece that died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"These earbuds were a disapointment. If you like a tinny sound, then go for it.

I should have known. you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great headphone, but they'll break on you","review":"I'm actually a big fan of V-Moda products; of all the under $30 headphones these are my favorites. But after having 3-4 pair of these I can't recommend them anymore. They sound great, but after a couple weeks something breaks where the cable meets the audio jack and the headphone will stop working. This has happen with every V-moda headphone of this type that I've bought. It's just crappy construction/design. They changed the jack for the newer models, and it's work great on those. But I'd stay away from this model unless you want to replace it in 2 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"At the time that I purchased these, they were the same price as the Sony MDR-EX71SLA earbuds. I had the Sonys previously, so I decided to give these a try (plus they won the 2006 CNET Editor's Choice Award). Unfortunately, the sound quality isn't as clear as the Sonys, nor is the bass as solid.The fit on these isn't bad, the swappable ear pieces is nice (the Sony comes with that as well).I've never found a use for that crummy little thing you wrap the cord around. The only thing it would really do is add weight to the cord and pull the earbuds out of your ear... *shrugs*All in all these earbuds aren't bad, but honestly I'd recommend going for the Sonys even if they are a little more money now."},{"rating":"1","title":"V-Moda Earbuds Don't Last Long, Neither Does the Warranty","review":"I bought these v-moda bass freq earbuds in October 2007. I take very good care of my belongings and knew that these earbuds could be delicate after reading other reviews. Well it's the 1st day of November 2008 and the left earbud stopped working. Since it is just a couple of weeks past the warranty, I e-mailed v-moda hoping to get a replacement pair. The answer was no. So I spent a good chunk of money on this DISPOSABLE pair of earbuds. Take my advice and the advice of many other reviewers and buy a different brand of earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, poor design","review":"Although I like the sound quality of these earbuds, structurely they do not hold up.

First, the good points: they look nice. they have a robust cable. Now, the bad: these earpods are wayyyyyy too boomy and bass accentuated! The high frequency response is poor. and most disappointing of all... YOU CAN'T KEEP THESE THINGS IN YOUR EARS!!! I have tried in vain to keep these buds in my earholes but to no avail. I am much happier with my Etymotic ER-6 earbuds. they are twice the cost but sound great and the design allows them to stay in your ears.... For decent sound earbuds need to stay in the ear canal with a \\"seal\\" established... Vmoda earbuds fail in this regard. Save your money and buy some Shures or Etymotics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slight improvement in sound quality","review":"It's small and fairly attractive, however there's no improvement in the mid and high range compare to the cheap earbuds that came with my lousy $50 Phillips MP3 player.

At that time, I thought they were a great upgrade to the iPod standard ear buds especially at the $25 price point. They stayed in place very well, kept out noise, and most importantly, had great sound.However, in June 2009, one ear developed an awful crackling sound which made the earbuds inoperable. My guess is that the wiring where it meets the earbuds is too flimsy to stand up to normal wear and tear. It's too bad because they sounded really great.

I also bought my husband and brother the same ones to replace the ones that came with their Ipod. (They were very uncomfortable and didn't stay in their ears either). They absolutely LOVE the V-Moda. The silicone earbuds come in 3 different sizes so you can even use a different size in each ear, which works for me. They are extremely soft and you forget they are even in. As far as the sound goes, it's good enough for me...(I'm not that much of a \\"music critique\\" to really know the difference). All I know is that it doesn't sound BAD and that's good enough for me.

First, I had to crank up the volume all the way. Then, I couldn't believe how cheap and tinny the sound was. I listened to Wasis Diop's 'Everything is Never Quite Enough' a good tune for rich textures, overlays and, of course, bass. I couldn't believe my ears.

I have tried every size fitting and the only one that fits in my ears is the smallest size and they still wont stay in my ear. Thats a big problem for me. I bought these headphones because they say they have extra bass which is good for hip hop music but I don't hear it. The sound does get muddled when you listen loud and the music sounds like its coming out a tin can at times. I would not buy these for the gym because like I said they will not stay in your ears. I don't know how they retail for 50 dollars. Thats just crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, all I hear is the bass","review":"I bought these based off of CNET's review. I can usually trust them but this particular review was way off. While the review depicted the bass as being a bit much, it is far worse. While listening to metal or rock all I can hear is the constant thumping, drowning out all the highs and mediums, as well as making the vocals muddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bass but at what expense?","review":"Unfortunately, the design team succeeded in providing lots of bass which, in my opinion, is overwhelming. The big, boomy bass is muddied, not at all tight and tends to greatly diminish the mids and distort the highs. The bass is overtly prevalent throughout the frequency range. Soundstage is almost meaningless. Separation of instruments cannot be distinguished. Vocals sound harsh and nasal-like. Perhaps these are decent if you listen to nothing but bass heavy music, but they are not at all balanced and will cause some weary listening after an hour or so. These certainly are not for acoustic, vocal, jazz, or classical listening.I did find them comfortable enough, but the build quality appears to be inferior to other similarly-priced phones. Overall, I do not feel they offer a good buy...too much hype, and not enough substance unless, as I implied, you really need this amount of bass and consider yourself a true basshead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound was good, lacked durability under normal use","review":"I bought these headphones after reading positive reviews on multiple reputable electronics review sites.They look great and are comfortable to wear. The sound is good, although I found the midrange to be a bit muddy. Bass definition is excellent, though.The problem was that after six months of normal usage (commuting via subway daily), one ear stopped working entirely. I came to find out that these earbuds use notoriously thin internal wires that are prone to breaking when flexed.With a little research there are alternative earbuds with great bass definition in the same price range that have better durability.Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after TWO MONTHS!!!!!!!","review":"Stay away from these earphones please!!!!!!!! They are not very good for any person who relishes audio in any way. I picked them because of good reviews by CNET and when I got them I was very disappointed with the quality.

Not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"I bought these after buying and returning the high end v-moda earbuds.

The actual magic in the book is touched upon, but to me the book focused more upon the love of Faris and Tyrian. It seemed to me to drag in places, as though the author was really stretching to make it longer for some reason, and in other places she seems to rush and skim over areas (particularly when discussing the whole 'warden' issue), some of which are quite important. My favorite part of the entire book was definately the end, I'd say it's worth putting up with the minor unpleasantries simply for the ending, it's just masterful and stunning, not at all what I'd predicted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and dull","review":"I have enjoyed this author's collaborations with Patricia Wrede, so I decided to read her solo work.

The worst part of this is that it crashed most often when seeking, which I would want to do after the previous crash to get back to the part I was listening to. It was very frustrating.Finally, a few days after the warranty expired the system simply ceased functioning. It won't turn on, no response from plugging into the computer, nothing.

Yeah, it's nice to hear Joe play, but you could put his studio albums on, add an audience and you'd have the same effect you get on this set. You'd think a brainy guy like Joe would come up with some clever ideas that he hasn't expressed on record, or maybe play some obscure songs of other artists. Something, anything but note-for-note versions of his own stuff. Making matters worse, this is a very lame-sounding affair. Again, with Joe's digital wizardry I was expecting a very crisp, punchy sound quality. Forget it. This sounds like something recorded in the mid-80s. You know, set up the remote truck, use maybe 2 mikes and presto--live album. I still give it 2 stars because like another reviewer noted, the songs from EOC are improvements. Joe, you coulda made us proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent performance marred by a rude audience","review":"As long time fan of Joe, I was eager to hear this recording but was dismayed to hear the completely undeserved boos from the audience directed at the bass player Stu Hamm.

Insted the review centered on the number of notes, not the CHOICE of notes. Why didn't Piccaso but that chicks eyes on oppeset sides of her nose, and whats with all this blue stuff? Why, because he was the artist, deal with it!! The question of good or bad should be answered by the level of emotional and artistic honesty in the work, rather than a bean-counter approach to note-accouting.

He plays all of his most popular songs. His backing band is exceptional as always. Jeff Campitelli is an excellent drummer and bassist Stu Hamm is always amazing. In fact, listening to this CD makes me upset that Stu is no longer part of Satriani's band. His new bassist is alright, but nobody plays quite like Stu does. If you're not familiar with Satriani's music, I suggest you start with his studio recordings. Surfing With The Alien and Crystal Planet are both great places to start. If you already like his music, then check this out. He's pretty amazing as a live performer, and this disc helps to display that."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reviewer from massachusetts","review":"another great live album from joe,although just as yngwie never play's evil eye or little savage,on any of his recent live cd's,i think joe should play and should have recorded hordes of locusts, lords of carma,and not of this earth.instead of flying in a blue dream all the time and satch boogie and summersong.ithink these songs as well as big bad moon,and afew others should have been substituted by hords of locusts,lords of karma,headless horseman,not of this earth,and driving at night.because exept lords most of these were already recorded live on time machine,and i think they are better pieces of music.it was still a great cd by a great man,who never sold out or turned on our symbol 9........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satriani for Seasoned Fans","review":"I am a long time, \\"seasoned\\" Satriani fan. If Joe cut a CD with eight variations of \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\" I'd buy it . On this recording, Joe plays a little outside the box -- something the seasoned fan will appreciate but the new listener may not. (New fans should try SURFING WITH THE ALIEN or TIME MACHINE) I do prefer a few cuts done in the studio compared to some done on this live recording, but for the most part, this is a must buy for any fan of Joe... and with over two-and-a-half hours of Satriani rippin' it up, it's the road trip CD of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, once again!!!","review":"I have ALL of Satriani's albums. This one, he plays good, real good, but different, well, it's live. To me, the songs sound good but just different. He does it again. He's the BEST I've ever heard, and this album proves it. If you enjoy this album, also pick up a copy of Crystal Planet another wonderful cd that will have you hooked listening for hours. I love this last CD. I bought it the first day it came out, and I'm not dissapointed. If you want to listen to Satch's latest, go grab one, and don't forget the DVD, coming up later......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the glasses, screws are a flaw though","review":"PROS:I Love these glasses and use them on a daily basis. They make good sunglasses and the color of the lens are good for a laugh. I always tell people I \\"look at the world through rose colored glasses\\", Literally. I have bought multiple pairs to keep in the car, at home, to give people, and in case I lose a pair.CONS:The screws on these are a definite problem. If you look through the reviews that is the main contention people have with these glasses. The screws loosen Very easily. The way I've dealt with this issue is when I get the glasses I take all the screws off paint them with clear nail polish, then screw it back together before the polish dries. This stops the screws from comming loose, a pain to do but worth it in the end.CONCLUSION:A great pair of glasses for daily use, gifts, or a laugh. Would have been 5 stars if not for the screw issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Went well with my black and silver buckle trench coat....oh yeah!!","review":"Pretty nice accessory.

I love the smell of it, the sound of it, the romance of it, and the amazing inhabitants that reside in it. I am an aquarium nut and love skin diving.Now, to the book: Ocean World is an appropriate name for this book. This planet should have been called Sea instead of Earth, since the majority of the planet is ocean. Jacques Cousteau describes this world in an engrossing, almost poetic fashion. The color photographs are wonderful. You will learn much about the endlessly fascinating realm of the sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"These stories are from the heart","review":"I believe the Bishops have created their very best album in \\"Stories.\\" Themed around stories of people like you and me, each and every song contains a powerful message of God's redeeming love.

And the Tallis Scholars' sopranos have almost always been LOUD and pinched especially in the high registers (in this recording and in many of their other recordings) ... they definitely do not sound angelic. If all you like to listen to are sopranos with the other voices as background noise then by all means continue to listen to this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this for the Spem","review":"Complete domination by sopranos in the Spem. How can 8 or 9 sopranos dominate 32 other voices in volume??? It's ridiculous. Despite the muddy sound, an old LP recording by Pro Cantiones was more inspiring than this recording. Get the recording by the Huelgas Ensemble instead if you want a recent decent Spem. I don't know about the other pieces on this disc since I sold my copy away 4 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth for the price","review":"Definitely worth the money paid.

Horvath has taken her formula for success and applied it once too often. Instead of being eccentric and quirky, all the adults in this variation on a theme are just plain selfish and unpleasant.

Some are less than 100 square feet, an area so small that the UBC doesn't recognize such structures as residential.A few of dwellings shown served as homes for the likes of Henry David Thoreau and Thomas Jefferson; the majority, however, are fairly simple vernacular structures, a few having been designed by the author himself.The text is concise but quite readable. The line drawings adequately illustrate the interior arrangements for living and enjoying what are often very limited spaces indeed; black and white photos answer most remaining questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little book","review":"This book has whetted my apetite for building small, tiny homes for years.

Each of over forty entries includes pictures, diagrams, and simple floorplans, perfect for mulling over the possibilities of small refuges.Quite a few of Walker's tiny houses are historical examples, including Thomas Jefferson's honeymoon cottage at Monticello and Henry David Thoreau's cabin at Walden Pond. Others are more recent samples such as George Bernard Shaw's writing shack and a dune shack belonging to a naturalist on Cape Cod. The variety of designs offers options for many needs and many settings, and hopefully, food for thought for the next builder.\\"Tiny Houses\\" is highly recommended, even in used condition, to the reader loooking for ideas on how to get away from it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraudulent Author","review":"Without considering author John C. Maxwell's background, I found Equipping 101 to be informative and insightful. Filled with quotations and life stories of great leaders, Maxwell did a great a job piecing together a book of other people's accounts on the topic of leadership and equipping. However, I don't understand how an esteemed pastor could write a hundred pages on leadership and equipping leaders without mentioning his own personal leader, or referring to the book he claims to believe. Perhaps the book hold more weight had it been written by a successful Fortune 500 business owner, instead of a pastor using his success in the Christian church to try to teach on corporate success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I purchased this as a gift and the recipient seemed to love it!

I will probably uninstall Punch and re-install Visual Home because Visual Home is much easier to work with. Also, my old software has much better kitchen and bathroom fixtures, furniture and at least offers more garage/shop items to place in the model. The only advantages to this Punch software is the deck design and the fact that you can design additional floors over the first floor footprint.

You'll learn about Tim Pickering, Aaron Burr, J.Q. Adams, but I thought the book was about Jefferson. Most of the book isn't about Jefferson at all, except the concluding paragraph of some chapters that try to address the central thesis. There's nothing new about Jefferson in this book. Someone could write a great book about Jefferson's blatant hypocrisy on slavery. Wills certainly didn't do it with this big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This book is a bunch of lectures stitched together to spin a negative picture of Thomas Jefferson.

Unless you're a Jefferson basher, as far as reading this book is concerned, I suggest you don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not about Jefferson but America","review":"Critics of this work that carp about small points concerning Jefferson miss the point entirely. The book is a useful corrective that puts slavery ands its preservation front and center in early US history. Too often, early American history barely mentions slavery until is suddenly surfaces to split the country. It was often the only issue that mattered. An abolitionist could not get elected in the Slave states, no matter what other stands they took. They would be lucky to get out alive, since many were beaten, jailed and lynched. The Free states, while solidly prejudiced, stoutly opposed the spread of slavery and the plantation system. The constant push of Slave states to spread slavery to new territories and the resistance of the Free states is the story of America from 1770 to 1865. Thanks to Wills for reminding us of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title - too much about Pickering's personality","review":"With Jefferson on the cover and a provocative title like \\"Negro President\\" you'd think the book would be all about Jefferson.........but instead, it's mostly about Timothy Pickering's fight with pro-slavery forces during his time in Congress.

The equatorial mount is decent enough. Cons: The viewfinder is plastic garbage. Additionally, the built-in corrective lens (housed in the focuser) used to increase the focal length makes the thing impossible to collimate. You can take it out completely (it screws out thank goodness), which is what I've done. Should be able to collimate it now, at least. I plan on leaving it out entirely, as it seems to be the primary complaint with the quality of this scope. I will come back with more info later, after I see if this makes an improvement.

The movie is filmed on a nice medieval location and gives some nice history hints of those times near the Austrian alps. While most actors are not well known they do very descent jobs. The only reason why I don't give it five stars is because the movie slows down a bit, particularly during the first half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having Fun with CISA","review":"The CISA test itself is pretty much BS.

However, I just took the CISA exam today and tried to recall what I read in the book, and wasn't able to carry over much of the books material to the actual exam. Don't get me wrong, this book does provide good insight into IT audit, but doesn't really prep you for CISA exam (oh by the way, the official ISACA study materials don't really prepare you for the exam either in my opinion).

I noticed about 8 hours after he ate the nutrident, the diarrhea started and it had turned blackish green. Fast forward 2 months, and our dog was nursed back to health and happy...I didn't think that the nutrident was the cause of the diarrhea earlier, I thought it just made it worse so I gave him another one. Wrong. About 6-8 hours after, I noticed his normally firm stools were extremely soft and once again, they were blackish green. I promptly threw the entire bag in the trash. Terrible product and I will never be buying these again. As a side note, my little guy tolerates and loves Greenies just fine.

I bought them because the price was right - but after wearing them for 2 weekends (outdoors) the heels are both falling apart -- the grip on the bottom fell off of the left boot the first day, and after the 3rd day the grip on the bottom of the right boot was gone as well. This allowed rocks to be wedged into the resulting hollow and ruined the traction on flat ground. Yes, they're cheap - but not cheap enough to fall apart so quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good boots","review":"These are perfect Pirate boots, along with the added bonus of being cute enought to wear as regular foot wear. The only down side is they are a little difficult putting on. I had some trouble getting my foor & heel past the ankle area. Oh and you'll need a hand pulling them off. Since they are so long you can't rest your leg on your knee to pull them off because then you're holding the boot in place. On the whole, I love these boots and can totally see my boyfriend really enjoying helping me out of them. *winks*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Champagne for Caesar","review":"This movie is a rare gem which is rarely (if ever) shown on TV.

I absolutely adore this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Champagne For Caesar","review":"This is a classic comedy with Ronald Colman, Vincent Price, Celeste Holm and Art Linkletter.

The sound track problem (mainly sibilant distortion) lasts only a few minutes and I did not find it too much a problem despite being a sound man by trade.

So I wrote to the company that put this out on DVD and this was their response: Thank you for your inquiry. We are sorry to hear that you are disappointed with your latest Image Entertainment purchase. Unfortunately the problem that you are describing concerning the soundtrack of this film is the result of damaged film stock. Image Entertainment made three attempts to find the best available master for this film and the finished product was made using the best remaining film stock available.Bottom line is, buy this ONLY if you can't do without this film.

The book definitely does not prepare you for the exams.I have successfully passed the first three exams by using online classes along with the Selftest Software and then I purchased this for Forms 2. In understanding how Oracle tests you, I can honestly say that all the areas were covered in my Selftest software but few were covered in the book. Be careful if you are planning to certify.

This week I passed the last exam (the Report one), and I can say that without this book you will never certify. I have finished all the five exams (from the first time-Thanks God) using this book as my main study tool (along with the Sideris manuals as a minor references). I can say that this exam guide will cover %95 of the material tested in exam 3&4 (Forms), 80% of exam 5 (Reports-which in my opinion is the most difficult), 80% of exam 2 (procedure features), and 90% of exam 1. As it is clear from this figure the material covered will help you pass all exams. For the report exam I think you should have supplementary material (like Sideris) for two topics tested: Matrix report and lexical parameters) but even without that you can pass the exam. In short, buy this book if you want to be OCP-Application Developer. I highly recommend it. Excellent work by Oracle Press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor study material for exams","review":"Being the only book available to study for the Oracle Developer Certification, you'd think this book would at the very least cover all of the information on the exam, right? WRONG! This book only covers a fraction of the material on the exam. It's much worse in the Forms sections than it is in the PL/SQL sections, though. Also, there are many typos and just plain wrong material in the book. But, this is the ONLY book available, so you really have to buy this and figure out some way of getting the rest of the material. This book is unacceptable. Even if you learn it cover to cover, you will not have all of the information you need to pass the exams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic","review":"Good book for a beginner (this is an excellent intro to SQL and PL/SQL), but not enough depth for the exams. It covers all the necessary areas, but barely skims the surface on numerous important topics. I recommend the Sybex book (even though it's a little dry). For each test, I'd start with this book and then move on to another text; that should be all you need to pass the exams.

If you are in the mood to pay attention to it or you are playing the CD in your car, you will notice that he almost destroys the originals. For one thing, why is it that he decided to use electronic drums - Now, he is playing an acoustic guitar for heavens sake.

After that he didn't care what I offered, he wasn't putting that nasty thing in his mouth! So, with that being said, the product is pretty worthless and definitely a waste of money since it is sitting in the medicine cabinet.

I really like all of the attachments that come with it too. Gives you a lot of options depending on where you are experiencing soreness. I used it on my husband the other night for a knot in his back and it worked it out nicely after I had used my hands to pinpoint the exact location and massaged the knot a little first.

It starts to heat up pretty quickly after using for about 10 minutes (the instructions say to use no longer than 20 min. at a time) and it is a small tip, so this isn't something you'd want to use for a long, full-body massage...but 20 minutes is more than enough time to get my shoulders to relax, and to stave off the migraines.

(1) Speeds - 1st cycle (slow speed) was too slow. For me, it was not effective as a personal massager. (similar to a battery that is kind of dying). 2nd cycle (not faster, instead, it changes to bruising pounding). (2) Noise levels: 1st cycle was quiet. 2nd cycle (lets everyone in the apt hear you; so loud it was embarrassing -(sounds like a mini street jack hammer). (3) Weight: Unfortunately, my previous electric massager from Doc Johnson died after a few years. (Unable to find a replacement, in stock.) The WAHL massager is heavy. Each time I attempted to use it as a personal massager, my hand/wrist was sore. Overall, no satisfaction.

I couldn't find it online so i ordered two or three different ones and i was sooo disappointed and i sent them back. Then, i found it online again and ordered it. I have had this one for about 5 or so years - maybe longer. I don't know what I would do without it!!

Put this thing where you need it and it works wonderfully, its powerful enough unlike other massagers. The problem is the pad between the two metal pieces gets hit and moves and then you get a very loud jackhammer noise coming from it, very unpleasant. I fixed this with some superglue and some cloth bought at a specialty store. After about a month it broke again, I open it up and the arm that gets pulled from the magnet broke. If you have ever broken off a poptab thats what happened. So it worked for about 6 months, I guess this was worth the $14 I put into it but I am hesitant to buy another because who knows how long that one will last until I have to replace the pad and the arm breaks, I've also heard of it coming without the pad on right and then its loud out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back pain relief","review":"This wonderful instrument can abort an attack of my sore back pain with only a couple of minutes of use(using the \\"deep muscle stimulator\\" attachment).It has outperformed all the other devices I have tried,and is amazingly low in price.See my review of the same Wahl 2 speed that comes with a heat attachnent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value!","review":"This massager works great- I tried other ones, and nothing can even compare to this one.

This Wahl massager works O.K., and has a useful number of attachments, but it is VERY, VERY LOUD, especially when you're applying pressure (but even if you're not, it's still too loud). Also, there should be three settings, not two, based on the extreme differences between high and low. The low is very low, and the high is very high. There definitely needs to be a medium, which it doesn't have. All in all, I would not recommend it, nor would I buy it again. I may give the Hitachi another chance, since it seems most people do not have a problem with it breaking so quickly. Maybe I just got a lemon ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This was Chrsitmas gift to my husband last year. He works a tough job and always comes home sore. I don't have the strength in my hands to massage his muscles the way he needs it but this works great!

The noise! The din! The rattling horrid grind! We inspected the thing. It looked like the others we had had BUT the seam splayed a gap upon the spine so unusual, when right on top we saw a small area of over-tightened plates as the spine had been re-glued. They, in a tiny area, ever so slightly, overlapped. \\"The thing must have been dropped\\" we said and \\"They tried to fix it!\\" and \\"No wonder it was so cheap!\\".

This newest incarnation is such a poorly made device that I think I shall be avoiding Wahl products for the foreseeable future. The cord / switch is a weak point that shorts out inside and creates a very real fire risk. We bought one that lasted 4 weeks then when we turned it on, it shorted out inside and started to smoke, so we unplugged it right away, and took it back to exchange it for a new one, thinking we got a lemon. The next one lasted 1 week. After use, we turned it off and set it down, and as we were leaving the room, we could hear a funny noise soon followed by a bad smell. The massager had shorted out again. If we had been quicker leaving the room, we could very well have had a fire on our hands.

It seems pretty sturdy, is inexpensive, and does a decent job of working out the muscle knots. In short...Some Pros: Several attachments let you switch up the kind of massage you want to get/give a bit; fairly quiet device; nice price.Some Cons: A couple of the attachments don't appear to have a clear purpose, and could have been left out in favor of, say, a large-surfaced, convex (as opposed to concave) rounded attachment; only two speed settings: \\"very soft\\" and \\"adequate\\".Conclusion: For $13 (delivered), I'm satisfied with what this simple massager can do. Only time will tell how long it will go before breakage, but so far I have no real criticisms that would prevent me from recommending the Wahl 4120-200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Pros:Poweful massage while it lasts.Cons:Attachments are a joke.Overheats quickly and can burn skin.Guaranteed to break within a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puny","review":"I had one of these, only single speed, back in the early sixties. It was noisy, got hot (metal housing), and vibrated the hand as much as the targeted muscle. But it seemed to massage pretty well. In comparison, while the new one is quiet--if not forced--and runs cool, I found it useless for deep muscle massage. The high setting is fine for facials, and possibly the back of the neck. The low setting is a joke.I thought I had a defective item, but when I plugged it into a watt meter, I saw it was delivering the correct ten watts. Maybe that's the problem. Ten watts isn't much.On the plus side, it's cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for deep tissue","review":"Like another reviewer said, this is not as robust as the older model - as usual things get made more cheaply as time goes on. For a thickly muscled person that wants to work out deep knots, go for a more robust percussion massager. This unit does not have the intensity nor power for much more than surface stimulation. If you apply any pressure at all, the unit begins to clatter. A little more pressure and the motor binds completely. One more design flaw, the switch is at the finger grip, and just a slight squeeze can move the switch enough to cut the power - can be very frustrating. Major design oversight that just adds to the disappointment in this one. Only redeeming thing was the myriad of attachments but quality is still lacking. I wish I could rate this one higher, but you get what you pay for in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vibrator ever!","review":"I got my first Wahl vibrator over 10 years ago and haven't even considered buying another brand since!

I bought it to massage my calf after a knee replacement. It took so long to get that by the time I got it, the pain was almost completely gone. Anyway, I don't understand how this can be comfortable for anyone to use. You can't really move it around on whatever body part you are trying to massage because it hurts to do so. The tips are a rubber/plastic and don't move smoothly over your skin without feeling like it is burning your skin off. All it does is vibrate, not really massage.

It really does the trick.It's fairly quiet, not too big or small, and comes with a lot of different attachments (though I've only used the deep muscle one so far).Like others have mentioned, I kind of wish it had a 'medium' speed - the low speed is too low to affect muscles (I suspect it's intended for more naughty purposes), and the high speed might be a bit too high for some people to get a relaxing massage, though it's perfect for pummeling wound up muscles.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the case does sometimes rattle a little depending on what position I hold it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"As inexpensive as this item is, it delivers every penny worth. I've used other items similiar to this at a higher price and have always been disappointed, but this one was quite surprising with the powerfulness of the second speed. You just wouldn't think something so small can be that powerful. I specifically use it on my neck and shoulders. It's easy to hold. It's a lot heavier for its size than it appears to be though. The only downside is the attachments aren't as soft as I would like, but they do work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was great, the people who sold it to me were not.","review":"Great product but I was sent, apparently, a refirb. massager.

I simply wanted the two attachments they owed me or the difference from the box with the 6 attachments in it. They gave me an excuse that it was the company's warehouse that was at fault, not them and I never got a response back from them when I asked what we can do about them over charging me for the product.

The design is compact and perfect to have in the car or boat so that it is ready and handy to be use after some extenuating day or just for fun as I do. I suggest anybody to have some accessories to diversify body massage as if you you're your professional acupressure next to you.

It was at this point that the length of the songs grew past the five minute mark, allowing the band to fully develope the groove. Only two of the songs on this disc fail to break the four and a half minute mark. Franco's guitar is the main vehicle of each song and is clear and up front in the mix. The saxophone solos, most likely by Verkys, are one of the highlights of this period. The production is clear and the instrumentation is uncluttered.None of these songs appear on eitherFrancophonic: A Retrospective Vol. 1 1953-1980or onAfrican Classics, the currently available collections of Franco's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate super buy!","review":"Having grown orchids for more than 20 years, this book is outstanding in it's treatment of the genus Dendrobium.

He should have lived at least 75 pages longer, if not more. He was sweet]. When Emily killed the kitten and put the skunk by Lillian, I was furious. But, this book came in handy for my book that I am writing. Bible-thumpers are jerks and, believe me, I have more than one in my family, though they aren't as bad as Emily and Jed [thank GOD!] But, Lillian should have beat Emily up or had someone else do it.

There is this little girl name Lillian and she thinks that she is living with her mother and father but she will soon come to find out that they're really not her mother and father but her aunt and uncle. And he so called sister, Emily, is just evil to Lillian. But when every she talks to her other little sister who is dying,Eugenia, makes her feel all better.

You can tell that this really took place in the really old days, where's the cars? Dawn just went through almost the same stuff that Lilian did and they both had to put up with Emily and Lilian wasn't really Dawn's grandmother anyway, but her stepmom, it's probably why they resented each other.

It does not have the large, cylindrical area that you find at both ends of most HDMI cables.

It also has a more shielded cable that somehow seems more substantial and of a higher quality.

But when I did break out the NIB item only upon mounting it on the camera lens did I discover that the locking ring that holds the glass in place on the filter was not installed properly. Further inspection I found that it was slightly twisted and probably the reason for not being able to lock in place on the filter. My guess is that this is of those filters that \\"slipped\\" pass the QA dept and I got stuck with it. Not worth the hassle of sending it back for a replacement.

It may be that some of the content might disturb some people. Yes, one might discover some wisdom in the novel as well, but Crowley simultaneously pokes clever fun at the rich and their dabbling into occult practices. The black magicians are hilarious. The Golden Dawn humor is mostly accessible only to those with considerable inside knowledge of hermetic practices, but even a general audience can get the sense there is some jest.

I recently came full circle and picked it up again, through the impetus of my researches and I must say I'm glad I put it down the first time, because now I was really able to fully appreciate it's profundity, able to grasp subtleties I would have surely missed before. In this way the book has (like any other of subtance can) served as a measuring stick of my own progress.

The story is wonderful (while some didn't \\"get it\\" completely, the message was there and delivered). I did edit the end of the book. I said that MLK \\"died trying to fight for peace and love\\". I didn't say he was \\"shot and killed\\". That being said, several of my 5 year old students already knew that MLK was shot and killed prior to any discussion/story read in school. Children know much more than we think they do. While we shouldn't push them to the next stage of development before they are ready, I think we also owe it to them to continue their learning. This book did a great job with my class. I already got two positive responses from parents and school was let out an hour ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Words, Best Book on MLKjr","review":"Martin's Big Words is a book that every family ought to own. It's the best introduction to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that we have come across, something appropriate for even four or five-year-olds.The illustrations are simply breathtaking, the perfect accompaniment to the simple, direct words. Tracing King's life from childhood, with truth and honesty, children are able to understand the basics of this hero of the civil rights movement. From the first read, my children understood the difficulty of his task, and also started asking hard questions.If you are afraid of hard questions, I guess this book isn't for you. But I'd encourage you to embrace them. It can be hard to talk about hate, prejudice, why the police weren't always the good guys. However, I have also been able to have beautiful, hopeful discussions with my children about these issues as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful book on Dr. King","review":"In a book suitable for kindergartners on up, Rappaport brings Dr. King's career to life using simple but eloquent language and Dr. King's own powerful words, taken from various speeches and letters from throughout his lifetime. Combined with outstanding artwork by Bryan Collier, her text is perfect for reader's theatre; at my own library program, three children read the words of Dr. King and I read the narrator part, making a very moving small piece of drama perfect for the classroom or library storytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"UPLIFTING!!","review":"Martin's Big Words is a wonderful, educational and inspiring read or read aloud for children especially early childhood children. This book uplifts readers from the first page, \\"You are as good as anyone\\" (King, 2001). The lesson about history and what Martin Luther King stood for is told in a way that the young reader will understand. The book also has very elaborate eye catching art work. I won't spoil it for anyone who has not read the book but you must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"I ordered this book for one of my grad classes, but as soon as my six year old saw it, he began to read it.

It's important for them to know why they have the day off from school. From there we listen to his I have a dream speech, and if possible I read a children's version of his biography. I recommend this book for primary teachers.

Rappaport and Collier's work goes hand in hand in creating the perfect storybook to get the message across to the reader. The strong emotion can be felt through the words as well as the expressionism illustrations. Although the words successfully tell the intended story the illustrations feel in the gaps one might have when trying to imagine what it might have really felt and looked like. Children are able to use their own imaginations to imagine what it might have been beyond the pictures depicted but have a starting point on where their imagination might want to begin. Martin Luther King's quotes are an added bonus to each page within the book. This is a book that a teacher should definitely have on her bookshelf and introduce to his/her classroom. It is an essential teaching tool for any age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"History for Children","review":"\\"Martin's Big Words\\" is a great book to teach young children about the civil rights movement. We all know that the civil rights movement was gory and it can be hard to find a way to help a child understand the importance of Martin Luther King Jr. without giving all the explicit details and I think this book does a great job of doing it. The book can be read to children of all ages and older children may even be able to catch all the symbolism the book contains that younger children may not catch. Overall a great easy read with a very important lesson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The book Martin's BIG Words by Doreen Rappaport is excellent for children between the ages of 4-8. It depicts the life of Martin Luther King and the struggles he had to endure his entire life. I like that on each page you were given a quote by Dr. King himself. I also thought that having a list of his important dates at the end of the book was great for the children to see. This is an excellent book to share with your child or classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words of a King","review":"This book was a favorite of mine, it told the story of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a very simple way. In a way that a 5 year old can follow in sequence and realize the good that this man did for our country. It teaches the young students about nonviolence. For me the book was simple but very powerful, throughout the book there was large text in quotations that were actual words spoken by Dr. King Jr. one of the examples was his \\"I have a dream\\" speech that I could almost hear his voice in my head. The illustrations were phenomenal, the watercolor paintings with its glass sequence in some of the pages brought life and feeling to each one. I loved this book and would recommend it to all ages 5 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin's Big Words","review":"The book, \\"Martin's Big Words\\" is a great choice for all age groups. It is presented in a way; both the younger and older audience can adapt to and re encounter issues existing at the time. It presents great actualities of the history of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Not only are the words powerful, but so are the pictures as well. These pictures signify the faith, challenges, and obstacles we as a Nation once faced. Introducing this book to our children is a great approach to educate and inform them about segregation. In return, the child may gain a different perspective from what they might have had before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Martin's Big Words written by Doreen Rappaport and illustrated by Bryan Collier. I consider the illustration and vocabulary in this Picture Book to be at a third grade level with the large font, bold print and single paragraphs per page. The theme of the story is a biography on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's life, which defines his beliefs and provides the reader words of wisdom and promise for a better life. He is a role model for all generations his words live in us today. The message and continued lessons reflected from his life was to have courage, follow your dreams, and the power of love. \\"Love is the key to the problems of the world.\\"(Pg 18) Martin's Big Words showed Martin Luther Kings journey to helping African Americans get the freedom that they deserved.

I was very reluctant as I've had so much bad luck with several black and decker purchases in the past few years. I once knew B&D; as a quality American brand - this is the last straw for me. Now I will always know black and decker as a crappy foreign-made company with very cheap products that may last through one use.Out of the box this spray painter was non-functional. I followed all directions and even took the painter apart to clean the piston as instructed. I then did as instructed and ran water through the sprayer to test.

A useless feature if you ask me. There is at least a quarter inch of space between the phone and the case in every direction. The case fits a Palm Centro PLUS its own case.The clip was entirely too stiff - very hard to slip it onto a belt and off.

Yes, it's impractical to carry and read along the way, but use this to get to the correct trailheads and select the hikes by photos and descriptions of the trail features. I didn't look in this book and got a local's directions to Cathedral Rock and ended up way over my abilities in a vertical scramble versus the non-expert level approach from the other side. Also, I might have passed up West Fork Trail if not for reading the description and it is a MUST DO! Have fun. Sedona hiking is gorgeous and has trails for every ability, even physically challenged. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent hikes for Sedona","review":"The hikes are presented with all the information needed - distance, skill level, estimated time, and how to get to the start of the hike.

The format of this book made that easy to do. We pulled it out over our hotel breakfast, and we quickly scanned the up front index of pictures and ratings. We jumped right to the 'Short time / Moderate Difficulty' hikes, looked at the pictures and descriptions, and we were off in a matter of minutes. We saw only about 20 other people on our Hike up Doe Mesa on a very busy Saturday, so it was nice to get away from the weekend crowds which were everywhere else in Sedona. Nice format for the quick trip. The ratings were just right - it was just difficult enough to be exciting for all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful book, practical guide","review":"This is a super book for hikers in Sedona. If you are new to the town it will give you a good introduction. The route directions are thorough. You'd have to struggle to get lost on them.

In tests the radios were unable to transmit voices, they transmitted so much static you could not hear the other person from 200 ft away.

In town, the range is several blocks in the worst conditions, and out in the woods a mile or so is easy. The vibrating alarm is nice if you're in a public place, but you almost need to be holding the radio in your hand to feel it. For us, they make tracking kids a lot easier.

I find, however, that it is simply not quite as interesting as the Tallis Scholars' performance of Jacob Obricht's 'Missa Maria Zart'. The latter recording gains from being a bit longer than the Ockeghem offering, and also for being the recording of a single Mass, with all the usual five parts, Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus & Benedictus, and Agnus Dei. The Ockeghem recording offers two different passes with these five parts, but neither seem to stand out quite so well as the Obrecht work or the later Palestrina masses.I will suggest that the very nicest thing about the Ockeghem masses is that they are short, and therefore much less challanging if one is interested in using these pieces in an actual liturgy or as a part of a longer performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"thriller espectacular","review":"para m�� es incluso mejor que el c��digo Da Vinci.Brown nos presenta una historia llena de intrigas y acertijos, que van dando giros de 180 a la historia, haci��ndola ��gil, entretenida y absorbente.

It is a frank, honest book that demonstrates the incredible courage and heroism of women and the cruelty of men. I disagree with the other reviewer here only in so far as this book is not fair to males. This book is extremely \\"fair\\", and it posits the correct thesis that males are potentially capable of rape, a very different thing from saying that they are all rapists. The accounts of past cruelties of males in places ranging from Bangladesh to the United States only testafies to the continuing suffering of women in all cultures, regardless of which males happen to be living there. This is an important book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and extremely well-researched","review":"Brownmiller researched the uses or rape, and how rape has been used throughout history as a mechanism of control.

The anecdotes, in particular, are heart-rending. However, the reader should be warned that Ms. Brownmiller's study is also damning in regards to the male gender. My advice: read this as a history of rape and as a warning to not repeat the mistakes of the past. Men are not _all_ rapists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power misused","review":"This book, with great imaginative power and no logic at all, accuses half of humanity of horrific crimes. Brownmiller has great gifts as a writer, and she misuses them to create enduring self-accusation in male readers. Despite what one commenter says, this has nothing to do with real guilt or innocence. With female readers, perhaps the book has done some good, though it must have happened at a cost. Perhaps it has validated women's experience, but has done this by eroding their ability to trust any men, not only those who commit crimes. It teaches women to pay no attention to what people do, but to view them as guilty or innocent based on who they are, like the mark of Cain purportedly passed on to Cain's descendants.This is an artifact of the feminist dark ages of the seventies. It was a time when the most extraordinary statements were circulating in feminist circles, and they did have an effect on ordinary women one knew.

Salon magazine quotes Brownmiller and other feminists who, unbelievable, condone rape when perpetrated by a leading Democrat with the attitude \\"Let's move on\\".Anyway, you can form your own opinion (as politically incorrect it is to think for yourself) as to how Brownmiller's viewpoint on this issue impacts the credibility of her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe a Word of It","review":"Ms. Brownmiller has concluded that President Clinton did indeed rape Juanita Broadrick, but that it doesn't matter because Clinton is so virile that he didn't realize he was raping her until after he was finished. How can anyone call herself a feminist when she utters such crap! Why defend the pig? Because he supports partial birth abortion? But rapists will always be doctrinaire pro-choice. Let's just say that fatherhood is not a priority with them.If you defend abortion AND rape, you condemn women to a form of servitude unheard of in modern times. I used to respect this book, but how can you trust someone who wants to convert the feminist movement into the Ladies' Auxiliary for Democratic rapists?"},{"rating":"1","title":"racist","review":"I am not looking for kudos from other readers (nor shouts of execration)--Brownmiller's discussion of the murder of Emmet Till is an outrage--she has also I believe gone on to defend--even in the face of incontravertable evidence to the contrary--the story of the central park \\"attack\\" on a woman jogger.One thing American history has not faced--and will have to (it came out a bit in the Hillary Obama campaign) is the hidden emnity between civil rights for Black People and Women's liberation--a story that goes back to Frederic Douglas and resurfaced ina confrontation between middle class women and Mrs, Fannie Lou Hamer.

Well if you look through it you'd also have to include Hitler's Mein Kampf and Mao's Little Red Book... Brownmiller is one of those who rakes in large amounts of money by being controversial and frankly reading her bizarre theories on such awful incidents one wonders how authors can truly exist on such a key topic.Sadly, this book is designed to turn readers into men-haters. If you wish to hate the world and hold in contempt the three quarters of women who don't hate men this is a great read.

Cross out the half-dozen oft-quoted lines, and what was left was very good and thoughtful.I could make other criticisms of the book (for example, any volume that explores rape by soldiers, and doesn't mention the Red Army in WWII has a serious problem), but it remains a classic exploration of a subject almost ignored before it was published.

Have problems getting both prongs to touch her skin since she has a very small neck.I will say she can ago outside without her collar and keep within the yard as if she was wearing the collar. Great product at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"beauty in music","review":"Agalloch create beautiful, ambient acoustic music with no limits on creativity or aesthetics. Some may cite them as boring (14 minute songs do that) but I dug it, and fans of bands like Sol Invictus or Slint will as well.After a brief acoustic intro, the stunning In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion begins, shifting from passage to passage gradually, like watching clouds drift by on a spring afternoon. Strummed acoustic guitar drones accompany lilting melodies and the occasional percussion.... My only complaint is the growled vocals... Nothing ruins atmosphere like RAHH RAHHH RAHH and this totally breaks the mood. Good thing they are used sparingly.There are few metal moments, (The Lodge being one) which is a godsend considering the enchanting nature of Agalloch's music. The Mantle is meant to be consumed as a whole, and hearing a single song will not capture the experience properly. So dim the lights, consume your favorite illicit substance, and let Agalloch do their magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring. Much room to grow as a band.","review":"I wasn't quite as taken with this band as others. The vocals do not bother me, but the guitar is not great; and the music is a bit too redundant. While I can understand the comparison to Opeth, they have a long way to go to even come close to the musical mastery of the boys from Germany. That being said, Allagoch has great potential, perhaps achieved with better production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish Americans","review":"As an American myself, I bought this partially due to curiosity. Most of the bands in the goth/dark/death/and so on metal are Scandinavian. I wish I could say that this CD lives up to the European standards, but it does not. It's not that this is a bad disc, but that bands like Opeth are so much better. Lyrically, musically, thematically, this band just doesn't measure up to the standards of the genre today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped to like it, but I got rid of it after one listen.","review":"Sorry Jason, but I just can't get into this cd.I found it kind of boring and could not stand the clean vocals.The clean vocals are what really did it for me, I was trying to get into it, but when he sings, it's just so bland.There are two reasons that I bought it:1. Good reviews? Everyone likes this cd, but in retrospect, I should have known it wasn't for me because I think Opeth are also kind of boring.2.

Not for head-banging, more for introspection. I have really enjoyed this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mantle","review":"I must first admit that I have owned this album for several years and have always been afraid to write a review for it. The reason being because I just don't think I have the mental capability to put how great this album is into words. The musicianship is absolutely stunning, not just for the complexity, but also for the way these guys take you through a song. It is like taking an ice cold journey into the northern wilderness. The lyrics are absolutely spectacular. They deal a lot with heritage and nature, but in a way in which you can find a way to relate. I really like it when metal takes a turn toward the folk direction. It makes sense seeing as how metal and folk are two of the most complicated forms of music to write and play. With all of this said, I can't stress enough on how badly you need this record if you don't already own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing guitar work","review":"Im not a fan of this type of music, yet after I stumbled upon this CD I was drawn to it. What i found most attractive was the amazing guitar composition, it swoops and and soars, and the songs range from triumphent to tranquil. As far as the vocals go there is some growling, but one will definitly look past that small problem after they hear how amazing the rest of the CD is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Who Realized His Dream","review":"A fun, historical account of an early western themed amusement park. Written by its founder, Arthur L. Bensen. It's the story of Frontier Town, North Hudson, NY in the Adirondack Mountains, located between Lake George and Lake Placid. Its filled with many early photos and the text was written by the founder of the park. It was written in the 1970's. 130 pages. It tells how it all began and why, where and how it was built. Its no longer open but is the place of happy childhood memories for thousands of us that were lucky enough to visit. If you enjoyed Frontier Town, this book will not only bring back memories of a gentler time but give you a look into the dream that one man had. He went against all of the odds to make his dream come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no better teaching book, anywhere.","review":"The pinnacle of the act of teaching is to be simultaneously clear, simple, interesting, and complete. This is rarely achieved in person, and almost never in writing; \\"The Little LISPer\\" achieves it. I believe this defines what a teaching book can be. It is brief. It can be read in snippets, at any pace. It will maintain the interest of anyone who comes to learn. The reader is left ready to write Lisp code, no matter what background precedes it.I read this book in high school in 1982; it taught me enough that five years later I aced a four-credit independent study class in Lisp (at an Ivy League college) without any further reading. Hey, I *told* him I already knew Lisp! Dr. Friedman, I hope you come across this endorsement some day; please accept my thanks for creating this wonderful little gem.

In a black canvas bound \\"book\\", the titles and artwork are drawn in a type of gold filagre. The gatefold cover opens to a bookelt with photos and tells a story. The pictures are beautiful and tell the story of the oxidising angel. This edition also offers a bonus track \\"Change The Future\\" and the video to \\"The Oxidising Angel\\". The bizzare thing is the video, although similar, is different than the photo book.My favorite track on the cd is \\"Falling\\". The vocals are close to the chilliness Gary Numan has...deep, rich...and cold.....and it's story is just as chilling. It's about non-emotioal commitment...being together....but not in spirit....a relationship without love....all with a cold synth hook and a driving, pulsing beat.Now I plan to find a way to take care of the special packaging as to not damage it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amsterdam!","review":"Yes yes yall!

I do believe there is a White Male System but I think she has overanalyzed certain actions of men in their attempt to suppress women. It seems that everything men do, say, believe are ways to control women. I find this impossible. According to her, all men are bad and all women are angry. I know wonderful men who do not give in to this system. Also, I'm not angry about being a woman. I have seen how women rights have come leaps and bounds through history. I also don't believe she gives enough credit to the unique differences between men and women. These differences should be celebrated not picked apart and translated as whys men are opressing women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist Propaganda","review":"Obviously this was written for people that live before the liberated 60's.

But the excruciatingly stilted, stifling prose combined with an almost obsessive desire to catalog meaningless trivia hurts this book a great deal.

Good idea, woefully pretentious execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously, A First Novel","review":"Joseph Conrad strikes me as a writer who takes himself way too seriously. His novel reads more like the journal of a young writer who is discovering his sexuality and trying to emulate other, successful writers. I found the references to the city and \\"writing culture\\" incredibly cliche. It seems to me that Conrad is trying to tell his own life story through his characters, and the result is flaky, one-dimensional personalities that remain distant from the audience. The entire nuclear issue seems to be thrown into the narrative almost as an afterthought--something to make the entire story \\"important,\\" and is wholly unrealistic and forced. I had to force myself to continue reading this book and couldn't even finish the last few pages. It was painfully obvious that this is Conrad's first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed an editor","review":"I saw hints of good writing hidden beneath a lot of drivel in this book.

The suction is not sufficient. It will only pump about 2 oz and then stops. Not to mention it takes close to 20 minutes to pump that 2 oz. It's very loud, and tends to back up in the tubing if your not paying explicit attention to the machine. The only thing good I can say about it is that the cups are comfortable.

Now I have returned to work and need to pump 3 times throughout the day. It did well Mon-Wed. This morning, the sunction went out again.

Loud, painful, difficult to use, doesn't work well, and it broke. If you're only going to pump occassionally, you're better off getting a good manual pump (doing one side at a time with a good manual pump will take about the same time as using this). I threw this away and bought a Medela Pump In Style which has been wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I bought this because it got fairly good reviews and was not too expensive. It was a total waste of money as far as I'm concerned. I only used the thing maybe twice. It took me about 45 minutes to get maybe 4 ounces of milk. This is the only pump I have ever used so 45 minutes may be the norm, but it was kinda pointless to me. By the time I finished pumping it was time to feed the baby again so I didn't really get any time to GO and do things around the house. It was quicker just to breast feed, but this may be a good purchase if you are desperate for a pump and can't afford a super good one.

This work is especially important to any artist wanting to become the best they can become in their field. The ideas presented by Hofmann can take a lifetime to \\"master\\", but well worth the effort. His ideas are more than just \\"theory\\", they are a basic understanding of how to enliven a flat pictorial space and how to infuse oneself in one's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to clean","review":"Unexpectedly, not too clean and did not want to touch the cover.

I go back to it frequently for straightforward explanations of NLP processes in my work as a life coach, counselor, and NLP Trainer. So far I've written three books on NLP, and cited Heart of the Mind in every one.

The pattern instructions look easy and all the animals are super cute. I like how in the beginning the book lists a break up of the patterns by how easy they are. The only thing not too great about the book is the basic stitches instruction in the beginning of the book. The instructions are a little hard to follow and there's no pictures so you don't know what the heck it's supposed to look like. Overall- great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for knitters with a bit more experience","review":"I love knitting. I've been an avid knitter for 25 years. And I found this book to be delightfully creative. The layout is wonderful. There are pictures of each project at completion, which is something I look for in knitting books. I like to have that visual in mind as I knit. There are ratings for each project ranging from easy to straightforward (involving a bit more complexity) to challenging. The ratings also include helpful information such as age appropriateness of the finished project.I did find that piecing together the items was a bit awkward at times. I think that, using some different stitches, the pieces could be shaped so that there is not so much sewing at the end. However, this has no bearing on the appearance of the completed project.I've used this book quite a bit for making gifts, and the recipients are always thrilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite knitting book!","review":"I absolutely love this book. I have made several of the items and have found no mistakes--only clear and simple instructions. The clownfish was so much fun that I adapted the pattern to make Rainbow fish and a whole sea full of friends in a variety of colors. The person pattern is terrific, as are the parrot and octopus. The pictures are also terrific. My only warning is that it can take a while to assemble all of the pieces--particularly for some of the larger patterns. Ms. Dalmeny, please write some more knitting books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"World of Knitted Toys","review":"I have not made anything yet from this book but have read through and the instructions are very clear.

I would not have believed that I could take on a project like this but the author's clear explanations and beautiful photos are all you need.

If this movie seems as stupid as it sounds, well, you are absolutely right!! Horrible acting, a stupid plot and sheer absurdity mark this flick as more of an unintentional comedy than horror, but with Playboy playmates in it, what should I expect?

It was too long, it had too many characters, and it took on too many issues. I know the sequels are here, but I wasn't left with the burning desire to order them. The characters were unbelievable, both too trite and too inconsistent. The goals of the principal, a poor little rich girl with a vapid, yet all controlling mother, were supposed to save the world if achieved. The premises were ok for sci-fi, but they didn't go anywhere. Unfortunately, the inclusion of critical events taking place on both Yugoslavian battlefields and the Mir spacecraft turned out to be rather silly in the light of recent real events in both of those locales. I was totally turned off by the inner-city episodes. They sounded more like an apology than a literary creation of credible human drama.

While I am not a Lubavitcher Chassid, I am an Orthodox Jew, and so maybe I understand a little more of their world than, say, someone who rejects most parts of the written and oral Law. Or maybe I'm just biased because I have more in common with the Lubavitchers than Mr. Bloom, even though I attend a secular university and am not as insular as the Chassidim. The book is filled with stereotypes and incomplete assessments. It paints a poor picture of religious Jews in general, not to mention city life. If you want to read it, take it out of the library, but don't spend your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent analysis of Extreme Fundamentalism","review":"As I read the protests from those who feel Bloom is unfair in his portrayal of the Hasidic Jews, I thought how strange that the only group that can ever be assailed without protest is the middle-of-the-road American. If Bloom's conclusion had been that those Iowa farm folk were all to blame and totally anti-sematic, I doubt there would have been any objection. Bloom wrote what he saw and was courageous in coming up with conclusions that he knew would cause others to accuse him of being biased.What I got from this book is a fundamental question of when is the protection the rights of individual fundamental sects more important than the cultural values of a country. As we deal with extreme Muslims, extreme Christians, any extreme religious group, is there never a time when there are basic values of the greater culure that deserve to be protected and perserved?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Myopic, Self-Centered, Antisemitic View of Hasidism","review":"The author begins the book questioning whether the locals are antisemitic or just leary of strangers. As the book progresses, it becomes more and more obvious that the only person who is clearly antisemtic in this entire book is the author himself. The book is his own journey of self discovery, in the process of which the author seems to discover quite clearly that he is extremely uncomfortable with all things truly Jewish. In the end, this book does, unfortunately, a pretty good job of promoting an antisemitic view of traditional culture, a view that only leads to prejudice. Had the other been less caught up in his myopic world view, and more focused on the true clash in cultures in front, he would have produced a much more honest, valuable, and object work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloom is not biased!","review":"Much has already been said about this book's writings. I feel that had it been written a topic totally foriegn to me, due to the author's attention to detail and introspection,it would have maintained the same level of interest. I also don't feel that Bloom's writing about the Lubavitcher Chasidim is dishonest or deliberately hurtful. While it often unpleaseant; this was the reality that was given to him. Considering the self-congratulatory syle of writing that is so rife in the Orthodox Jewish world, it is a fair counterweight to such tomes.I am an Orthodox Jew, and I do not feel that his view of Lubativch Jews is biased at all. That Bloom mentions his own distance from such Orthodoxy does not disqualify his emotions or views. Bloom's point that many in such groups will try to defend themselves using mechanism and guilt and aggresiveness, remains vaild-as some of these reviews prove. It is a shame that some people can't take criticism, and must twist it to be slander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda been a Contender","review":"Of course, every writer comes to the keyboard with his/her own preudices.But the detached writer--the true artist--suspends those biases in favor of an accurate portrayal of fact. Others just skim the surface, conveying their impressions. But sans context,such reportage is at the very least grossly distorted. Bloom, a nonreligious ..., seems to have come to this work with absolutely no background research...except perhaps memories of Fiddler on the Roof. But,like the Chasid on the cover of the book, Tevye was not a Lubavitcher (and possibly not even a chasid) So, what could have been an interesting essay about the \\"meeting of cultures\\" is instead a hatchet job. And once again, Jews are 'the other' .

I think Professor Bloom captures the issues of small town midwest life pretty well for someone from such the coast. I found the writing first-rate and compelling. I am not a fan of the so-called \\"new journalism\\" where the author is part of the story but this volume is one of the few exceptions. His interest in his heritage, as well as his profession drive the story along. Having read many articles in local papers on the topic, I think that Professor Bloom is far more objective in his reportage than may first appear.

I wonder if he would attack the traditional garb of a Hindu or Muslim with as much rancor as he does the Hasid's?Someone should inform Bloom that being Jewish, or Hasidic doesn't make that person's habits automatically good or bad, it just makes them Jewish. It is unfortunate that he is so embarassed by his own culture and disillusioned by the Hasidic community after his fantasy of finding a spiritual awakening at the feet of some white-haired wizened Rebbe.This book is contradictory and disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"It is quite obvious from this book that the author has in mind to bash religous Jews, whom I happen to respect.

If you appreciate literary works grounded on negativity and inner turmoil, you will feel right at home with this tome. Bloom's personal vendetta with the entire Hasidic community is based on his unfortunate encounters with several severe personalities within the Hasidic community.As a writer intending to pen a work of non-fiction, Bloom selectively chooses his \\"information\\" according to his convenience. Case in point; while expounding on the virtues of the town of Postville, the author is meticulous in transmitting precise details. However, when discussing the malevolent and baseless myth that Hasid's fornicate through a perforated sheet, Bloom does not bother to discredit this demonizing falsity. No less than on three occasions does Mr. Bloom mention this supposed tradition. And each time he fails in debunking this sexual scuttlebutt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Book, Loathed the Author","review":"It's a fascinating, real-life topic: A large group of ultra-Orthodox Jews move into a small middle American town, and what happens when cultured collide. Being from NYC, there are a dozen neighborhoods where the reactions are the same, without Hasidic Jews being in the picture.Which brings me to the author, a self-hating, assimilated Jew who takes upon himself the characterization of real Jews. Of course he hates them. Of course he thinks they are primitive. After all, Bloom has lived in SF - he has evolved beyond these strange people. And the hatred permeates the book.When Bloom dies and meets his maker, he will have to do some mighty fancy talking to explain this atrocity."},{"rating":"1","title":"a better choice","review":"The conflict between religious identity and national identity is an important subject, but Bloom's book doesn't do it justice. Skip this book-- unless you are related to Stephen Bloom and have reason to care about his personal anxieties, you won't learn much. Buy David Kertzer's The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara instead-- serious treatment for a serious theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in every way","review":"Although the author purports to take an objective view of what he calls the clash of cultures in Postville, his portrait of the conflicts in the town are in no way nuanced or thoughtful. Clearly his ambivalence about his own religious identity has shaped his perception of life in Postville. The author has not taken the time to learn about the Orthodox Jewish traditions he so smugly and sanctimoniously dismisses as \\"guilt-producing.\\" He manages to reduce his concept of meaningful Judaism to bagels, lox, and pastrami. By the end of the book I found myself wondering why he had bothered to identify himself as Jewish since his view of the religious traditions he derides seem so superficial to him. To me the book failed the basic test of intellectual honesty and clarity of thought. It was in addition, poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing mishmash of stereotypes","review":"I started reading this book with anticipation, thinking that it would be an interesting look at a very intriguing cultural clash. Though I eventually slogged my way through it, it was a great disappointment. The author's ego looms so large that it obscures his reportage. The book is full of stereotypes and cheap shots, and the narrator's voice consistently gets in the way of the story he's telling. The writing is adequate at best, and shows very little understanding of either of the cultures he's describing.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find it at my local bookstore to flip through it first and now I know why, nobody would buy it if they could see it first. The material is appropriate only at the most basic level of project management capabilities.

It was put together as a college project by Southern Adventist University and the viewer will have no doubt that all those connected have a great career ahead of them. It is not a film that pushes any one faith or doctrine other than how we can relate to each other and to God. Unlike so many films made by beginners, this film is very professional and there is no way any thing connected in its making can be faulted. The extras alone are worth the price. I fully applaud this project and hope the school and the young people involved will continue the good work. We need more Christian film makers like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret to a good movie","review":"I enjoyed this movie and have told others about it as well.

Unwillingly left there because of his father's business, the boy must make the best of an uncomfortable situation.The boy, Roy played by Kevin Novotny, soon discovers the village has a mystery and a secret and feels compelled to try and solve the mystery and discover the secret. The movie is the story of his adventures in pursuit of his goals.The movie clearly identifies the high moral ground and does an excellent job of presenting worthy moral values; as such it is a good family movie and provides clear guidance for children in the realm of moral choices.Recommended as a fine family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"What a load of cobblers!It was set in Ireland and that's all that is authentic about it. It is a typical moronic view of Ireland from outsiders who neither have the inclination nor ability to portray the country, its people or culture in an accurate manner.If you are not Irish, I guess the story is enough.

This is a vanity production by a fledgling film department of a private Christian college. More power to all those involved to make movies and especially learn what makes a story a story. And how to transfer that story to moving images in a compelling way. None of that happens in this film. Family films should not be boring to adults or children. And there's nothing wrong with movies that espouse Christian ideas (look at the success of \\"The Narnia Chronicles\\").Regarding the rave reviews. My guess is that some -- maybe all -- are coming from parents or investors in this project."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real dud!!!","review":"We were looking for a nice family film and picked this up at Blockbuster. We watched it, looking for something to happen, some story to develop, a plot, but it wasn't there. Even the \\"secret\\" of the cave turns out to be a yawner. We all were dumbstruck at how bad the film was, full of cliches, uninteresting scenes (how many flashlight scenes do you need?) and characters. The only thing done right was the cinematography of the Irish Coast. Afterward, we looked at the dvd box a little more closely and discovered it was a student made film! Blockbuster really should have a warning on this one: \\"Student Film, watch at own risk.\\" The dvd includes corny \\"extras\\" including the filmakers receiving some kind of award (probably from their school) and bloopers of the actors and students laughing it up, probably knowing someone was duped into putting cash into their pockets and into the wallet of \\"star\\" Patrick Bergin....(yeah, who?) Stay away from this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"I started reading Poul Anderson's \\"War of the Gods\\" expecting an epic and engrossing Viking adventure but quickly found myself very disappointed. The storyline moved at a snail's pace, the dialogue was uninspired and after about 200 pages I did not care whether Hadding lived or died. It is sad to see such an interesting story being handled in such a bland way. One can only wonder how this story would have turned out in the hands of more talented writers such as Morgan LLywellyn or Frank Herbert.

It is no wonder the Scandanavians have the highest suicide rates in the industrialized world. This story goes from one battle to another without breath and there is no epic feeling to it. It seems the Danish King cannot help but offend gods, giants, elves and other mythic creatures at every turn. There are many more enjoyable Viking/Norse tales to be told. Poul Anderson is a mighty writer, and this may be gleaned from many years of painstaking research, but it is a story that did not need to be told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord Peter","review":"One of the first books in this series.

It was well worth the investment.The style is analog trance and acidic trance techno with occasional IDM and Detroit affectations, more interesting than his later works. Some tracks sound more dated than others, but regardless, fans of warm analog techno with rich production values will dig it. Many of today's trance producers could learn a lot from it.The original version was released on the ZYX label and had 2 CDs, while this US edition has only one CD.

Well, the theology here is an odd mix of fundementalism and Hebrew-christian potpurri. Hey, you can take Dylan songs to justify union busting{union sundown],though I hardly think that is the intention. Ignoring the vast corpus of Dyans work to justify this is simply cheap.Dr. Fruchtenbaum may or may not be a good theologian. Howwever, this book is about HIM, not bob dylan.

Though the jacket of this book is replete with accolades (one from Larry McMurtry) trumpeting the writing and plot of this novel, I am sorry to say that the reviewer of the Library Journal (see above reviews) got it right. There are bits and pieces of acceptable writing throughout this book but the plot is confusing and the dialogue alters between period and contemporary. This unfortunate editing lapse leaves the writing with an uneven feel. The references contained on the book's jacket praising the novel's renditions of Native spirituality remain just that: unexplored references.

I was much more impressed with Phoenix Sub Zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Match bearings and fire, an excellent technical winner","review":"I've had many novels about subsurface combat and undersea naval warfare pass through my hands. Few have been as technically accurate and as true to the logic of naval strategy as this one. While some of the weapon systems are beyond modern technology, the fundamental thrust and parries of undersea warfare were a joy to behold. I especially enjoyed seeing the humour that abounds within the submarine community, but is often omitted in other novels, being represented.

This movie was not worth the $5.50 I paid for it and once I had it, it was impossible to unload on any one else (just to nice I guess). It was a made for T.V.

The characters have no life and the dialogues are just ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLEVER TWIST","review":"You may ask after that enlightening review from another reader why I would give this book 4 stars. Well, I think it is the fact that I was a little bored towards the middle. It's typical for me, a die-hard Poirot fan, to feel weariness with Miss Marple.But other than that this was a good story. You at once feel sure that one of the characters is the murderer. Despite your former knowledge of Christie's famous red herrings, you jump unmercifully into accusations and assumptions. Of course, the most suspected person is never the murderer. And once you do get rock-hard proof of the real !guy!, you feel almost ashamed. After all, isn't that such a big fall-out when we are so quick to believe?I wouldn't say that this is at all Christie's best work. However, it does fall in that large basin of pretty goods and mediocres. Thank God, though, that there are more fantastics than absolutely terribles. That's just Christie's beautiful (and sinister) mind.Holli Burke, PhD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cannot be Agatha Christie","review":"The plot continues in a trite, rather childlike manner.

The plot and mystery are almost amateurish, especially compared to her usual masterful work. The characters aren't very engaging, and there are no entertaining subplots to keep you going. This one is definitely not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little crazy","review":"typical Christie narrative, unfortunately what it unravels to is a little crazy. I recommend the TV adaptation, more believable in terms of motive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christie delivers as always","review":"I have read every Agatha Christie novel I could get my hands on. I enjoyed Murder is Easy. When you find out who did it, some seemingly insignificant points lost in the midst of bigger points make much sense. This always seems to be true; never overlook anything small that is mentioned. The characters are typical small village characters for the most part, and many of them quite unlikable. But, I like that in order to be a true detective, you have to look past your personal feelings. The most despicable person on the surface may not be the one...it may be someone you like. But remember they are almost always liars to some extent, telling things to represent their own best interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, well written and thorough","review":"This book starts with the bare basics and gently guides you through as the subject matter gets more complex. Very thorough explanations and analogies with a quiz at the end of each chapter to ensure you are up to speed. If that's not enough there is a sectional test every few chapters and a final exam at the end of the book. The author caters to those of us who lack short term memory by re-defining key terms and re-stating key facts (in a way that's beneficial, not superfluous)that may be necessary to continue to later chapters. Excellent book"},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who like to be talked down to","review":"This book does an OK job of explaining basic physiological concepts. I say OK for two reasons:1. The author talks to you as though you are a five year-old. Although maybe a cute literary tool at first, this quickly becomes irritating and eventually makes you want to throw the book in disgust.2. Only a surface level discussion is presented, with very important concepts merely alluded to as opposed to going into sufficient detail. The two most glaring examples for me are the poor discussion of action potentials, and the non-existent discussion of G-protein linked receptors, and subsequent second messengers. In fact, the final exam at the end of the book mentions second messengers as an answer option, despite never being mentioned prior. I guess the author initially included such things, but threw them out to fit in more obnoxious baby talk.There is no reason for this book unless you want a quick refresher on basic concepts. Serious students beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underestimates reader","review":"I am a science student and a big fan of the demystified books. I was very disappointed with this book. The other demystified books explained basic concepts, then built on that knowledge progressively. This book lacks fluidity and consistency.

So, if you are more concerned with how to pronounce \\"electrolytes\\", instead of understanding them, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate Eyewitness Travel Guides","review":"Although Eyewitness Travel Guides may offer more visual guidance than other guide books, they are still quite terrible.

They really enjoy the goal setting that the books have and they like that they can choose their reward when they reach their goal. I have them do a page a day, but sometimes they want to 3 or 4 pages so they can reach their goal sooner and recieve their reward. The rewards aren't always tangible things either, sometimes it is going on a bike ride as a family, or going down to the river to swing on the rope, etc. They have learned that you don't always have to spend money to have a fun reward for work done well!!

Mr. McKeown captures all the drama and adventure of the original play in modern prose, while still keeping some of the original lines we are all familiar with.

Everything is in a sense God. Yet the Kabalah's delves into the \\"life\\" of God through speculation about God's different manifestations, or sephirot.Green takes a decidedly psychological view of the sephirot; this is in keeping with the agenda of the book. It is a Kalalah for tomorrow! It tries to set out an agenda that will make the Kabalah more palatable to non- halakhic Jews and fellow travelers. In general Green succeeds. He has such a great command of the spiritiual journey that of course he realizes that it never ends.

In short, this book gives the \\"what\\" but not the \\"why\\" or \\"how\\" that would transform the book from a list of events into a narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed informative account","review":"Well written, difficult to stop reading. The personal accounts of Chiang were especially interesting and brings to light the failings of this leader and KMT/Nationalist.

Book 2?","review":"Insightful look into the life one of the 20th Century's most fascinating figures, told with a detailed background of a difficult period, blurred by multiple conflicting views of history.However, much is missing from the Nationalist-Communist Civil War, defeat and relocation of government to Taiwan, and ensuing reign. These are requisite chapters in the life of Chiang Kai-Shek, and the narrative should be graded incomplete without."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Attempt By Neal","review":"I am a Neal Hefti admirer but this album just didn't work for me. I believe Neal was trying his best to boost Frances Wayne but he didn't succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"I'm just reviewing the first cd, Lie Cheat & Steal, since I mainly listen to drum 'n' bass. Lie Cheat & Steal contains some of the best drum 'n' bass tracks I have ever heard. This album is full of aggressive snares, deep & melodic basslines, and uplifing synth melodies. I usually listen to atmospheric dnb, especially stuff from Good Looking, but the agressive beats and deep basslines on this album are a welcome change from most of the stuff on Good Looking. What I love most about Klute's music is the deep, high pitched (relatively speaking), melodic basslines that he uses for most of his tracks. If you are into atmospheric dnb, but you are looking for drums and bass with a harder (but still melodic) edge to them, then grab this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"both cds are great.......","review":"I am a life long fan of dnb, and I've loved the progressive end of house and stuff (808 state anybody? utd state 90), though more of a junglist than house(ist), the 2nd cd is really cool, and was of a higher quality than I expected. An artist as talented as klute obviously wouldn't release some silly \\"house\\" cd without an effort of quality, and the quality is there.I love dnb, but the new stuff has gotten so samey that I go back to the older stuff and draw the line at about when this album was released.the first disc need not be reviewed by me, as others have gone at length about it. that being said it is stellar and any fan of the dnb genre should own it, it is a great listen and is a must for headphones, as is cd2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klute - Lie, Cheat & Steal - Atmospheric, Smooth & Soothing","review":"Excellent buy for fans of Bukem and other more jazzy or smooth DNB/Jungle.

He is a little too wooden. It feels weird, the way he says in his very low voice: \\"Jane! Jane!\\" When he says her name, I don't know if I want to be frightened or sad or andry. He doesn't exhibit much emotion. SPOILER: He doesn't repent even in the end. He makes me feel very sorry for Jane. One might wonder how Jane would fall for someone like him.Joan Fontaine is fine as Jane Eyre. She lacks a little stubborness though as Jane. Young Elizabeth Taylor is a very angellic Helen. Sometimes though, I'm not sure if they want to make it a horror film (ex. When young Jane finds Helen dead, she screams. The camera is focused on the hands like a weird murder movie).In short, I didn't like this adaptation that much. I maybe biased though because I am a literary purist."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just saw this today","review":"Like I mentioned, I just saw this version. I have read the book many times and love the book. First thing, this version does not follow the bood very closely. Too many things were left out. There was not very much emotion portrayed in this version. There was much of it in the book and other versions I have seen. Jane was too pretty in the the movie. I couldn't imagine Jane being that pretty in the book. It tells me in the book that she was plain.

I will replace them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers. These matches are of very poor quality. Right out of the box, they seem a bit difficult to light. I took a few out and dipped them in water, waited for them to try and tried to strike them. They didn't light, I just rubbed the red material off the end of the matchstick. Others I left in some water overnight, the red striker material was actually dissolving into the water.

After continuosly pumping for ten minutes or longer without any flo n'go, the pump began to leak gas into the water.

This year the hose was so stiff I could hardly get it to work. Then it kinked. Obviously a reaction with the gasoline. Now the nozzel has broken off and so there is no way to pump or use it, unless you are willing to pick up a 14 gallon container (105 pounds) so you can siphon into your tank. And with no nozzel, you better be fast at turning off the valve that is sandwiched so close to the tank you need the fingers of a five year old to reach in to use it.Oh, and when you contact the company their reply was your tank is two years old, so, too bad, and then they also asked me to send them pictures because they didn't believe I had their DuraMax tank.Buyer beware is all I can say, from a disappointed user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good at all","review":"My Children purchased this for Fathers day so I could put gasoline into the boat.

Not the flimsy thin it comes with. As others have stated, you cannot lock it in place, so you have to hold the handle and wait up to 30 minutes for the stupid thing to empty. It gets worse as the hose gets more kinked. Then, the plastic siphon thing leaks and gets gas in the water (I use for boating) and all over the boat and my hands. I'm writing this review as I wanted to go to the company website to see if they had a better hose for this thing. Nope. Have to buy the cheap siphon and hose for like $50. Don't waste your money.

Fuel was in short supply with rationing, and it was cumbersome to use so many little fuel cans to fill the generator. I purchased this thinking I would be able to fill it and use the fuel for the generator & vehicles as needed during the fuel rationing. I may have missed it in the description, but I don't remember seeing it, but it appears to be a gravity pump. this pump is probably good for filling boats in the water since they will be below the pump during filling. I've had to move the generator close to deck stairs, carry the heavy (full) pump up 3 stairs and then be able to pump fuel into the generator. Also the pump handle mechanism is a let down, it doesn't cut off when you release the handle, it takes about 5 seconds so you are either over-filling or spilling fuel.Not as expected, but I guess good for storing fuel in a shortage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice item","review":"NIce item ,a little slow flowing out of the tank, but overall not bad.

I bought 2 of these and wish I hadn't. I'd have better spent the money on either one quality fuel delivery system or even a few 5 or 6 gallon tanks. As heavy as a 5 gallon tank is to manage it's easier than using this thing. For proper gravity flow you have to elevate it over the source naturally, but when the tractors have a tank inlet 6 feet off the ground the only thing you can lift this with when full is a chainfall or a backhoe.

Beats trying to lift & hold a regular gas can. We will probably be buying another one. Best price around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Use the product once worked fine. Used it a second time the pump handle leaks severely. As others have stated this product is majorly under engineered and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea","review":"The concept is great. But after the first use the pump leaks, and the flow is minimal at best. The hose is very prone to kinks as well. The 2 valves used to turn the flow off and on are a gigantic pain in the rear. If a better pump came with the tank would be a definate 5 start"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent company to deal with","review":"This company is very customer oriented. I had to make a return and I have never had it go so well. I would definitely order from them again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Drain Last Gallon or Two","review":"As indicated in the title of this review, the tank does not drain the last gallon or two of gas. This is a non-starter for me. Also, the newer design has a safety latch that makes it difficult to continuously pump without the gravity feed."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I m a CEO of 2 small companies, received a boat as a gift and bought this product as I m in my 60's and thought it would help me get gasoline from the shore out to the dock. Wrong. First, FedEx delivered the product and the box looked like it had gone through a grinder. The \\"simple\\" instructions are great if you have a degree from MIT in engineering. After lugging this thing to the boat...I spent 1.5 hours trying to get it to pump. It pumps at the speed of \\"zero.\\" I have been in manufacturing 28 years and this is the biggest rip off I have ever seen on a product I ordered. Certainly isn't Amazons fault. Thanks..good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"used it this weekend to refill my generator on 4 occassions and it was great not having to hold the can or having gas splash on me. the hose was long enough to reach from my truck bed to the generator which eliminated any lifting and I had a nice siphon so I didn't have to constantly pump. however, on the down side is the thin hose that kinks easily and that damn button you need to push in as long as you're pumping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flo NGo Duramax, 14 Gallon, Red Portable Wheeled Fuel Container","review":"How bad can bad be?... this container was given to me for this Christmas so I can have easy time filling gas into my new tractor... it took me about 15 minutes of constant pumping to get 6 gallons into the machine. this was the worse experience I had filling gas...! I hope we can return this thing...cons:*needs pumping all the time in order to get the flow of gasoline to move through...*very slow to release the gas*gas leaks from the bottom*heavy to load out of the car after filling it up at the gas station*too much money for too little of a practical use"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item","review":"It's fairly easy to assemble and to fill it up. But that's where the ease ends. It takes literally forever for this thing to \\"pump\\" out gas. Even when you have it raised above whatever you are dispensing the gas into the length of the hose makes you have to keep pumping the handle to get the gas to trickle out, and that's all it does is trickle. It's not like you can pump it 20 times to get it flowing and then it just flows. It literally took me over 30 minutes to empty this into my boat's gas tank. You're better off just buying a few 5 gallon jugs and a funnel. It would be great if it pumped the gas at a good flow, but it doesn't. It trickles out and it will drive you crazy waiting for it to come out and your hand will get tired from pumping the handle over and over to get the gas to flow. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"Bought 2 to bring gas to my boat. The gas fill cap is lower than the dock so gravity does all the work, I do not pump it. Takes about 10 minutes to empty the can and leaves very little in it, maybe 1/4 gallon. I just tip it forward and the rest comes out. I can see if you are trying to pump the gas up against gravity where it could cause a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much happier with this than reviews would have indicated","review":"Due to the reviews I was on the fence about purchasing this gas tank. However, I was delightfully surprized.(Review coming from a small not necessarily mechanically inclined female)Pro's- Lays flat for filling and transport- Sturdier than I thought it would be for the price- Hose attaches, no leaks, valves are pretty easy to navigate- Rolls well, have rolled it full over grass without much difficultyCon's- The pump handle does not feel like it is super durable, especially if used to pump gas as opposed to gravity feedBuyer beware- When full it weighs more than I do, you might need some help- To pump gas into a car, you will need the long gas tank funnel- I rolled it onto my front porch to pump from it, which is four steps up, from that level it emptied nicely into an SUV, very little was left in the tank"},{"rating":"1","title":"not long living","review":"i owned this item for almost 2 years. the first year the nozzle failed and was replaced under warranty. the hose was constantly kinking and was told in essence that was the only hose available. i purchased new 1/2 in. fuel hose (at the cost of $30.00 and solved the problem. a month ago the ball valve that shuts off the tank to the hose started leaking.i called the manufacturer (in canada ) and was told it was not repairable and since the 1 yr. warranty was up there was nothing they could do for me! i would not recommend purchasing this item because it's a piece of JUNK ! i now have a useless fuel caddy with additional money invested in hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quality","review":"I ordered this product for my father as a gift.

The writing is smooth to the mind and at no time will you feel you missed something as other thrillers have a tendency to do. The characters the author has created become people you can imagine and may even know.

I have enjoyed 2-3 of the authors and some of Morris' work in the past, but this one fell flat. There is some heavy repetition in my mind amongst the collection of essays, super hero characters are repeatedly analyzed, and frankly I felt in a number of cases this book challenged me to take it seriously. If you are a big comic fan, pass, and if you are a big fan of Tom Morris, pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and thought-provoking","review":"This is one enjoyable book. The collected authors have combined superheroes and philosophy in an entertaining and mind-stretching way. Personal favorites are \\"God, the Devil, and Matt Murdock\\" and \\"Comic Book Wisdom\\". I haven't read several of the series the book's articles talk about, and yet I was never lost. To disagree with one of the reviewers, religion and philosophy need to be discussed together. It hurts neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book!","review":"I enjoyed this book! At first I thought they were crazy with their \\"brushing the face\\" idea, but right after that I was reading the advice in national magazines. Their advice on skin care is what was most interesting to me but what I also liked was their positive upbeat tone, reminding me to knock off the negative thoughts about my body image or what other people will think. As far as the other review that mentions that it doesn't talk about friends or spirituality as a way of feeling and looking younger, well, those are valid points. But my take on this book is that it is more of a mental/physical changer. Spiritual issues could have been mentioned, in my opinion, but since we tend to gravitate towards people who are like us, if we are trying to change our image of ourselves, our friends may not be a good way to look younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad..... 2 1/2 stars.","review":"One of this band's biggest influences is (guess who) Nightwish-- and it shows. A lot. Namely in the keyboards, which sound almost identical to the ones in Oceanborn. If you are a NW fan at all you'll notice this, and it can either be pleasantly familiar, or plain annoying.This CD's major flaw is that the production is awful. Sometimes you can barely hear the vocals, which are weak-sounding as it is. The songs themselves are good, but the dull quality sort of keeps them from being enjoyable.I'd recommend VoA's next CD, Cast Away, much more than this one. It has a new male singer, better production, and they've gotten rid of their attempts at \\"death vocals.\\" Go ahead and buy Eternal Endless Infinity if you're a fan of the style, but don't expect anything to rival a band like Nightwish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good effort, but sounds like a demo","review":"Well like everyone else, I am a Nightwish fan, so when this band was suggested to me, I bought this CD. The first song is okay, but after that, I stop paying attention. The music is good, but not great...maybe it's the production. The vocals are, imo, the best female vocals next to Tarja. I think the comparison to Angels Fall First is a good comparison - this is almost like a demo.All in all, I wouldn't spend money on this CD unless you're a diehard fan of bands that sound like Nightwish, but they have a ton of potential...and I look forward to hearing their future releases as they mature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad album. Check out their second release instead.","review":"I agree that this album was horrible. The recording was terrible, the male vocals were horrid and sounded distant, the instrumentals were mediocre, and the female vocals were definitely off in some parts. I took one listen and never listened again. Luckily though, I purchased their second album before ever hearing this one. The vocals are ten times better, there is- from what I could tell- a new male vocalist who is much better, the overall recorded sound is better and far less distant sounding, and the music is also improved. Skip this album and check out their second release.And they aren't Nightwish wannabees in my opinion. The female vocalist's voice is just similar to Tarja's. Big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sighs*","review":"I bought this CD because of the pretty cover. Well, I also heard they were a wannabe-Nightwish, and as a huge Nightwish fan, I wanted to see what they sounded like. The vocalists are terrible, and pushed too far back in the mix. The music is actually pretty good, though. The only track I ever listen to is Lovebearing Storm, and I marked it only as 3 stars on my iPod. I would not reccomend this album to anyone, nor will I ever purchase Cast Away.

The pictured chest shows the Waterford symbol on the inside lid but the chest I received had no inscription. It makes me think that the chest isn't apart of the Waterford line at all but rather a standard old chest. Now, mind you, there's nothing physically wrong with the chest. I just would have perferred the chest to have the Waterford symbol in it. I paid more for the \\"Waterford Set\\" thinking that the chest was Waterford as well.

In Brazen Virtue, the heroine is a murder mystery writer and the hero is a homicide detective. Unfortunately, blossoming love is interrupted (or is it enhanced) by the murder of the heroine's sister. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, as I have all of Ms. Roberts' books, but there were a few opportunities for development that were missed. For example, when the hero discovers that the heroine has an astronomical income in comparison to his, only three paragraphs or so are devoted to their discussion. I think with most relationships, that would have been a huge point of conflict and could have been discussed more thoroughly.

You won't waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this is you like green day","review":"Apparently, your taste in music has to be askew to even go near these guys. Especially on this cd. The productions weird, but I love it. The lyrics are simply amazing. Everything from government conspiracies (Government Flu) to think about what you're really doing when you want anarchy (Riot), and to the hillarious (Forest Fire). Ray's guitar is so eerie, it somehow sadly beautiful. From that statement, you know I have no vocabulary. But my favorite is the bass. The lines get stuck in your head all day and you'll drive people crazy humming them. And you also get the In God We Trust, Inc. 12\\" ep free! Of all the cd's I have, this has to be my all-time favorite one. Order it now! If you don't like it, go sell it to zia's or something.

The copy I recieved was written in 1997, and so much has changed on 95. I was really sorry I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bedtime for the Kennedys...","review":"A slab of raging hardcore punk, the Dead Kennedy's final album, \\"Bedtime for Democracy\\", is probably in many ways a response to the disasterous affair conduceted during the investigation of \\"Frankenchrist\\". Whereas that album reached through different forms and really expanded the vocabulary of the band, musically, this one focuses on aggressive punk sounds, and doesn't really settle down until halfway through the record. But the pace and intensity picks back up and pretty much sustains for the rest of the album (the exception being Biafra's spoken \\"A Commercial\\", absolutely brilliant in its sarcasm).The net result is I'm always inclined to feel this is really the weakest album in the Dead Kennedys' catalog. Mind you, had it been a different band, I'd've rated it higher, but compared to the earlier material, it really pales."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't plastic Surgery Disasters","review":"Don't be fooled this record stinks. A bunch of over the top songs that seem to be the Dead Kennedys parodying themselves....it was funny on \\"Frakenchrist\\" but now it's tiresome. the one standout is the cover of \\"Take This Job....\\" but it aint worth the price of the whole cd.......Avoid"},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically Boring Novelty Record","review":"A band that has never sold out and did their own thing. Problem is who cares? 90% of Punk music is boring musically speaking and was quite dull when it first came out. This cd made me laugh a few times but I rarely play it. Kind of reminds me of a Weird Al Yankovic album. I'm serious! Jello has a voice very similar to Weird Al. The lyrics to to this are very whiny and bitchy. Who wants to listen to some guy complain with that irritating nasal drawl? This band was good to see live as a sort of performance art set and it was interersting back then to see the wild, sometimes violent audience reaction to the music. Removed from that environment the music comes off very badly. Pretty well the most boring music imaginable, a genre based on a rigid refusal of new musical ideas. If you have to listen to Punk listen to Black Flag."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"this is the worst album ever by the dead kennedys. of all the albums ever by them this one is by far.

I bought it on cd because I'm a completist. Try as I may, I hate Bedtime. The lyrics and playing are great, but it just doesn't stand up to the other releases. I wonder if the legal stuff and a contract resulted in a rushed album. I listened to it again a couple days ago with fresh ears and still hate it. The others (including the live one) are still great and relevant though. If you are new to DK and are wondering what to buy, get Fresh Fruit or Plastic Surgery Disasters- both are great examples of what DK were about. Avoid Bedtime though."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet dreams","review":"The DK's last album contains some of JelloBiafra's most thoughtful lyrics--especially on \\"ChickenshitConformist and \\"Anarchy for Sale,\\" which are among the most reflective punk songs ever written, and the ever-more-relevant \\"Triumph of the Swill.\\" But compared to the band's previous array of concept albums, this is a sloppy rush job. Feels like they're trying to squeeze all their material onto one last hurrah. Too bad, because filler like \\"One-Way Ticket to Pluto\\" buries some real classics. Music and lyrics only truly come together for \\"Frankenchrist\\" and \\"Lie Detector.\\" All that being said, this disc is still a buzzsaw through the cable holding up elevator music and all its trappings. Faded brilliance is still brilliance.--J. Ruch END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Album Good Album","review":"I think that this album is just as good as their others. It has the potential to be the best, regardless of whether the DKs sold out or not. Even though it is true that they (minus Jello) have sold out, this CD was recorded before they did. So I think reviews concerning how the CD [stinks] because of the selling out factor should be diregarded.This CD is fast paced and has many political lyrics. It's everything that punk should be. It's short, but is still worth every penny you pay, it has stupid songs, some are almost the same, and it's not blink 182 or good charlotte! THIS IS PUNK! So disregarding all other reviews, buy this CD and you won't be disappointed.PUNK'S NOT DEAD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fix the titles","review":"Track two of this Album is \\"Hop with the Jet set\\". Not \\"Hope with the Jet Set\\". The meaning is changed dramaticly with one letter.It's a fantastic Album, and I find it annoying that the sellers could care so little about it - not to bother checking to see if the titles of the songs are correct.This album makes social statements that are even more relevant today than they were when it was released. It's in the lyrics that the beauty of this work shines; powerful social commentary for a people who have been taught from childhood to admire the screwed up system that oppresses us.The five stars are for a shining work of courage and truth. The MP3 album needs to be corrected, please list it with the care and attention to detail that the original album was published with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factory seconds","review":"These bowls are factory seconds.

Opal Palmer Adisa's, Caribbean Passion, defies this trend. Indeed, the emotion that shapes every syllable in this collection is a fervent love that celebrates its expansiveness. Throughout the four movements of Caribbean Passion: Mento Ska, Reggae, and Dancehall what emerges is a portrait of a woman and poet who is unabashedly erotic and boldly passionate about her home, life, and culture. And at a time when some Caribbean poets, artists, and intellectuals may be tempted to turn away from the Caribbean and its landscape as a proper subject of artistic or intellectual meditation, Adisa's poems pull our attention back to where it rightly belongs: our homelands in this archipelago of islands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Coincidences","review":"A Review by DarcyHer sister was murdered.

I couldn't believe I was reading the same book as was being reviewed! I couldn't even finish this book. The story was poorly developed. Ms. Berg used very obvious plot devices which glared out at me and, as hard as I tried, I couldn't believe the situation. The feeling of the story was one of someone trying too hard to fit every explaination in for why this ridiculous situation was happening that the heart of the characters did not come through. There was no connection nor flow in this story. Did not one of you notice that Samantha's eyes were brown on page 21 and \\"hot green\\" on page 31???

Somehow everything fell a little short. The heroine is sweet, hard-working, and well-intentioned but not too smart, and the hero is kind of flat. He's rich, of course, and I gather he's nice for a rich man. Several secondary characters were quite annoying, especially the manager-cum-minister who preached at every opportunity, and the needy, demanding sister who never took no for an answer. Jack and Sam fall in love instantly, knowing nothing about each other. Such quick and superficial relationships leave me cold but probably would appeal to fans of the \\"Pretty Woman\\" school of romance: Jack is so free with his money that he doesn't mind spending 320$ for a cute bra & panties set.

I hate to say it because decent balls SHOULD be this inexpensive, but these are probably not the balls you are looking for.It's probably not a surprise that the manufacturer themselves describe these as 'one star'.

Laurie Gwen Shapiro is a truly funny writer who believably shifts her narrative voice in seesawing chapters from a 27 year old neurotic New York female physicist to a likeable struggling mid 30's Down Under male rocker. It punches you in the stomach with totally funny deep observations on everything from disappearance of the worlds frogs due to pollution, to the substitution of pop culture for those alienated by religion.

He claims that the portrait of \\"nuts and bolts plantation operations\\" in Gone With the Wind, is \\"right on the money\\". Reviewing Ken Loach's Land and Freedom he denies that Franco was a fascist. Of Platoon he claims that Oliver Stone vastly exaggerates the extent of atrocities like My Lai. So this is historical film as seen through the eyes of a \\"history buff\\" apparently unacquainted with current history writing, or even journalistc accounts. Even if the reader sympathizes with, or is willing to overlook the author's political ideology, ninety percent of each entry is historical background. So there's really very little about each film, and far to much of the author's own revision of history.

For example, just in the section where Tsar Nicholas II meets his future wife Alexandra (Alix), the author states that Alix's mother, Alice, was the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria; Alice was actually Victoria's second daughter (and her third child). The book also claims that Alix lost her elder brother and younger sister just following their mother's death, when in reality, both of those children died prior to their mother's death.

It didn't.There was no passion or excitement. There was no outside or situational interference. It was just two shallow people so wrapped up in their own wants and needs that they couldn't give a fig about each other.So to me Perfect Opposites wasn't a Romance OR a Comedy.

After a short time, the sealer started turning off before the food saver bags were fully suctioned. It was necessary to unplug it and plug it back in to get it going again. As time went on, the problem became worse and worse. After receiving no replies to our contacts to Rival (2 to the 800 number and 1 via email), we tossed it and replaced it with another, more expensive brand. Rival's customer service is non-existent, so do not take a chance with buying any of their products. If it should break, you are on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor customer service","review":"Rival does have very poor customer service as motioned in another review. The hotline is always busy during work hours and they do not react to E-mails at all. I finally got myself a foodsaver as a replacement! The seal-a-meal lasted for about 1.5 years and after this the seams do not hold up any more and finally one lid release button broke as well. All of this might be repairable issues - but without customer service the device is useless.

The autofocus - though you don't really need it in macro - is silent but spends a lot of time searching in low light conditions (no miracles!). Really sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic lens","review":"This is my first Sigma lens but third overall Macro lens. I want to have a longer shooting range from nervous critters, but yet, can't justify spending $1,800 on the Nikkor 200mm f4 macro. I use this to take macro shots as well as portrait shot.The pros are1.) Excellence build quality - wolid feel in my hands.2.) The image quality if fantastic, very sharp, and wonderful smooth DOF when open it all the way up, and unbelievaly beautiful colour.3.) At f2.8, it is fast even in a low light condition.4.) Good for both portrait and macro.5.) Affordable value for money lensFor me, the two cons are: -1.) Heavy2.) No VRDue to the two cons above, the image can become blurry easily, at a lower speed. I \\"solve\\" the problem by using a monopod to support the weight and to reduce the up-down movements which caused the blurness.I'm glad that I made the decision to buy this lens. It is one of my favourites along side the Nikkor 35mm f1.8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigma 150mm f2.8 EX DG HSM IF macro in 4/3rds mount","review":"This is a very sharp macro lens that allows a good working distance from the subject. A bit front heavy on my Olympus E510 and may require a tripod for full 1:1 indoor macro shots, but overall I'm quite pleased with its performance as both a macro and a telephoto. The focus limiter switch also cuts down on the hunt time, which can be rather long telephoto macro lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the Nikon 60mm Micro","review":"I compared images I took of a tip of a needle and I could not see a difference between them. I haven't gotten the fine detail tuned in yet but that is a learning curve for me. I just started out playing around with macro photography and think this a fine addition to my arsenal of fine lenses to give me a little more working room than my 60mm Nikon Micro. This Sigma also takes wonderful portraits for head shots if you are on a tripod or are shooting at higher shutter speeds since there is no image stabilization (VR). The build quality seem to be bomb proof - all metal and very heavy. Overall, I'm very pleased with this sample of the Sigma 150mm Macro and look forward to having it on my camera often."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME LENS!","review":"This lens is fast and extremely sharp. I am using it on a D200 and it is great. I am deployed in Iraq and this lens is one I can feel comfortable about walking around with. It's built like a tank. It accepts the teleconverters which makes it even better. Buy this lens from 47th St Photo. Best prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Macro Lens","review":"As Olympus E-system user I have found Sigma 150mm Macro Lens very useful when taking macro shots from a bit remote distance. OK, the f-stop is 2.8, and Zuiko 50 mm Macro Lens is 2.0, but in Zuiko case you have to approach very close to the subject. Making close-up shots of some dangerous animals (bugs, spiders, scorpions, etc), this could be life saving and, not for that only, I decided to buy Sigma lens. Moreover, sharpness is also, very good and, for that money, I never felt any regret for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What I Wanted","review":"I won't waste time reiterating all the positive reviews of this lens. I was looking for a lens to do macro photography, something to dial in on the small things, be they animate, inanimate, it doesn't matter. This lens lets me do exactly that. No image stabilization and the auto focus will hunt but if you're shooting macro you're using a tripod and, at least with my Canons, using LiveView to dial in the focus.The lens tripod mounting arrangement is great, being able to quickly rotate the whole camera is a definite plus when framing small subjects.Build quality is excellent. The included case and hood are a nice touch, given the cost of these lenses its disappointing that Canon doesn't include a case with their offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Acts Commentary on the Market","review":"If you are looking for a commentary that is in-depth yet easy to understand, then The Book of Acts Commentary by Dr. Harley Howard is a must.

The game has great atmosphere. You really feel like you're in the midwest, competing with other local racers for just a few bucks. This is a game where $1500 will buy you a great car, and you have to earn it.The game offers many different events in career mode, too many to name, but my favorite is the figure-8 jump race, for various reasons. But all are very fun to play. The cars handle great and show damage well. The soundtrack is good and gives the game a distinct feel, and the career mode takes quite awhile to get through. I haven't even completed it yet.Since this game has been out for several years, and newer consoles have surfaced, you can get this game for cheap. But trust me, it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Highly Overated","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books ever written on the origins of Mormonism.

Had the Salamander Letter of Mark Hoffman not been proven a forgery, the book's thesis MIGHT hold some water, but without it . . . Well, it crumbles without it. Lots of research here, but the conclusions do not appear to follow from the evidence-- rather, this is a case where Quinn yet again brought certain presuppositions to the \\"evidence\\" and thus reached conclusions that a) need not follow from his premises, and b) have little to do with what Mormonism is all about, today or in its early history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Citation Liberation","review":"I read the first two chapters... and reviewed the citationz. In my opinion Dr. Quinn is not much of a historian..his conclusions are leaps. I may or may not read the rest of the book. It is to difficult and time consuming to check each reference.

Its a very different film compared to this hacked up for the rest of the world version. ITS NOT RIGHT!And how about those subtitles? I don't even speak the language and i could have done a better job than that! They even dub Tony Leung in his own language for some beyond strange reason.This DVD is a throw away.Wait and hope until Anchor Bay gets the full print and beefs it up.

In \\"Bullet in the Head\\" the violence is so over -the-top, so gratuitous, you want to run for cover (I might have blown up my tv if I had to watch another gangster do a cartwheel as a big explosion lifted him of his feet). This movie proves to me how repetitive a director Woo is, and I got a similar feeling from Face/Off - its like watching a figure skater do figure 8's all night - you want to shout \\"ok, I get it!\\"Loud, irritating and chaotic. Jacky Cheung's shameless overacting and bulgy, beady eyes were as irksome as the excessive violence - give this one a miss - its a wet blanket of sentimentality and schlock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overacting and just not believable","review":"Some of what the characters did and some of the action scenes are just not believable. The movie suffered the classic endless ammunition during every fire fight scenes. During one shooting scene before the trio was captured by the Vietcong, one man was able to hold off a platoon size adversary with a pistol while two of his friends were rescuing another friend from the river. At another fire fight scene at a brothel/club, there were just endless bad guys being shot dead by our heros with endless rounds. If the bad guys with their endless supply of men would just surround the place, our heros would not have easily escape through the front door and into a car. As for overacting, just look at the POW scene in which prisoners were forced to shoot each other. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, depressing, alive and outstanding","review":"I've said it all above.

It is quite different. The male bonding in this film leaves virtually no room for romance. Again, themes of loyalty and materialism are explored. Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (CHUNGKING EXPRESS, HARDBOILED) is superb. The film is often horrifying in its depictions of violence (which is never excused or condoned). This is NOT an easy film to watch -- but definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and entertaining","review":"If you are a fan of Mark Donohue, or a racing fan from the era of the CanAm series, I believe you will enjoy this biography.

There is much insight into the business side off the sport as well, and demonstrates Roger Penske's determination and acuity in running a top flight team."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unfair Advantage - A Classic","review":"For years I tried to find a gently used copy of this racing classic. It is highly sought after by those in racing circles and it is quite expensive. I finally came to my senses and purchsed this special reprint edition. I was always a Mark Donohue fan when he was alive and loved reading about his rise in road racing from his humble start with Roger Penske to his heights at Indy.

Most of her cooking is fairly basic but as her Television Cooking Shows reveal, she is a good teacher. I am careful not to accumulate too many cooking books as I will not do them justice but as soon as I borrowed Delia's I knew I should have it in my collection. Some of her recipes make simple vegetables into almost a main meal with her interesting use of herbs and spices. She gives cheaper meats, fish and poultry a new 'place at the table'. It appears budget cooking is becoming a way of life at the moment and people want more on their dinner plate than a pile of pretty salad vegetables, a piece of chicken and a basil leaf garnish.This book would have an appeal to people raised on Post 2nd World War English cooking. I own one other \\"Delia\\" cook book which was published many years ago and I hope there will be more to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on hard packed snow.","review":"We tried this out at a winter scout camp where the hill was hard packedsnow and it was worthless.

And while less Ruby is a good thing, too much Isaac is a bad thing.Another silly pretense of Juliet sticking her nose into something that doesn't concern her, and people telling her everything she wants to know for absolutely no reason at all. Nothing makes a novel less enjoyable than having no clue at all why the main character is involved or why people are opening up to her.I'll give this series one more shot, but if the annoying brats continue to overshadow the actual story, I'm done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improving","review":"Ayelet Waldman improves with each entry in this series. In this episode, Juliet Applebaum's trainer commits suicide...or is it suicide? Juliet feels something amiss and begins delving into his background, including his adopted family, his birth mother, his drug-addicted fiancee.I enjoy these books because the author does a great job of mixing mystery with day-to-day life without compromising the realism of either. I am glad that she is involving Juliet in the private detective business of her friend Al, because in many series there occurs a disbelief when a \\"normal\\" person (one outside the private detective or police world, for example) runs across too many murders.Looking forward to the next entry."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor writing and boring storytelling","review":"I had the bad idea of picking up this book for a long flight, knowing nothing about its author. It turned out to be worse than the airline food. The writing is truly awful, clumsy yet full of conceit.

That's the only real mystery about this profoundly mediocre, boring and superfluous novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"authentic American folk music","review":"This album probably includes some songs you've heard before and some you haven't. Warner and Davis really make the music come alive, displaying a wide range of musical styles--one or two songs are done a capella, in fact. Perhaps what makes this album really cool is that Jeff 'n' Jeff have included a brief note on each song's meaning and history.

I actually bought the book for my wife who likes vampire stories, I read it because I read everything that comes into the house. She couldn't finish it and I had to force myself.

Had I known this prior to puchasing the book, I would not have bought it. A triathalon is based on completing a certain distance in 3 disciplines, not a set number of minutes. This is my first triathalon, so my expectations were not too high in terms of other content, but the minutes versus miles schedule is a big turn-off.Additionally, I found the author providing a lot of anecdotal information about his races. I was looking for general information on how to prepare for my first race, not a story about how this guys gets ready too slow in the morning, so he got up before everyone else. The author also states up front that he is not a master in any of the 3 sports composing the triathalon, and references 3 other books to read. Had I known all of this ahead of time, I would have bought the other books he references instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date!","review":"I didn't realize how out of date this book was, or I would not have bought it. The book makes 80s-era references when it comes to diet, nutrition, and other books about fitness. He suggests that you'd better plan to spend a whole $45 dollars on a good pair of running shoes!The author is readable, and his personal experiences are somewhat interesting. But although he is an M.D., there seems to be no scientific basis for his recommendations - it is all based on his personal experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start!","review":"This book is a great way to enter the world of triathlon. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is slightly incomplete and references other books. However, I think anyone who really gets into tris will find that this is generally the case. Glad I found this book to get me started! Oh, and regarding Miles vs. Minutes: Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I'll go with the Minutes system since world champions Mike Pigg and Mark Allen swear by it and I would be wary of the disparagement of this method from someone who has never done a triathlon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for beginners, otherwise...","review":"It got me pumped up in the beginning, but I found it to be not aggressive enough partway thru the book.

There is also a live album with orchestra called (I think) Ys and I will be buying that one too.Can't recommend this highly enough, but the voice mightn't suit everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuinely unique sound","review":"I first heard this album at a Starbuck's. About thirty seconds into the song, people were glancing at one another, shaking their heads in wonderment and smiling. People walked up to the staff to ask who was singing and jotted down her name. Joanna Newsom is certainly not for every taste but play this album a couple of times and you get hooked. By the way, if you feel compelled to compare her with anyone, try the folksinger from half a century ago, John Jacob Niles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and beautiful - every song.","review":"There's already a bunch of reviews of this CD, but I love it so much I had to write one too. I heard \\"Peach Plum Pear\\" on the radio late one night, and the next day bought the CD. Now, I'm a 45 year old guy, ex-punker and metalhead, so I'm not the typical \\"emerging young folk artist\\" fan. But I love this CD, every song on it, and have been listening to it over and over in my car. Her voice is unique, a combination of Shirley Temple, Melanie and Patti Smith. I loved it right away, and combined with her sharp, poetic lyrics and spare, non-traditional instruments (mostly harp, played like an acoustical guitar), it becomes something new to my ears but very familiar to the pleasure centers in my brain. It's a great piece of work and accessible to anyone who wants to listen to something a little off the beaten path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carol Channing meets Little Orphan Annie","review":"That's the only way I can describe this.

It's the woman who says \\"Go Into The Light\\" in that movie Poltergeist, except now she's singing at a Riverdance concert.Seriously though, I'm not going to say this music has no merit, it's just that the voice is an EXTREMELY acquired taste. The harp playing is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's from San Francisco, not iceland","review":"An overly dramatic voice reminisent of Bjork and Stina Nordenstam with a hint of Buffy Saint Marie or Joni Mitchell.

It disturbs me that this album receives such critical aclaim. She may be able to craft a good song, but why in the world does she have to sing so horribly. Instead of this, i recommend that you spend your money on something that is beautiful all around, such as the new Edith Frost album, \\"It's a Game\\". Edith masters the craft and executes beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but no.","review":"My Father bought this CD based on the glowing reviews from the New York Times. We both recoiled in disbelief as the harp & keyboard drowned out into wretched sounding vocals. That's the only way I can describe her vocals: wretched & fake. It sounds like Joanna is forcing and twisting her voice into something that it's not. I think she is a worthy musician, her lyrics are very creative and the instrumentals are innovative. But, I just can't get over the forced-out scratchy, twisted vocals. I get the sense that Joanna hasn't really found her \\"voice\\" yet and is banking on this forced-out, contrived folksy sound to set her apart in the folk scene. Sorry, I don't buy it... I want to hear the real thing, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed and cried too....","review":"....but not because it was good. Seriously, for those folks who actually say the unattractive features of her voice are great, why not just run your nails across a chalkboard, it's much cheaper than buying this cd.As to her harping, it's quite bad. Good harping is supposed to sound smooth and contain seamless bridges. It almost sounds as if she's snapping the strings with a clip. There isn't anything that is musically pleasing about this \\"music,\\" if it even can be called that.

I bought this CD based on the many positive reviews written here and after listening three painful times can confirm (1) the positive reviews have got to be a joke, (2) she sounds a lot more like a Lisa Simpson parody than Bjork (which makes me want to apologize to Lisa), and (3) on my deathbed I will rue the lost minutes I wasted listening to this weirdness and trying to comprehend how and why others would recommend listening to it, much less buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeek!","review":"I'm sure I'll get bashed repeatedly by those who love her, and I'm sure Joanna is a fine, lovable person... but I would liken my enjoyment of this cd to that of watching a double feature of \\"Showgirls\\" and \\"Natural Born Killers\\". If you can get past her fingernails-on-chalkboard voice, there might be something there, but I couldn't find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Beautiful","review":"This is one of the rare occasions that I've been moved to write about someone as special as this individual. Until last night, I had never heard of her. I was listening to a local college radio station and I heard this most unusual singing voice. She was singing \\"The Book of Right-On\\". It sounded very child like and pure. As I listened to the lyrics, I was knocked over by her distinctive singing voice. The lyrics weren't bad either! Anyway, she has now been added to my collection of great sounding vocalists."},{"rating":"2","title":"when I first heard her voice...","review":"I thought \\"what the hell is this crap\\". My son's father had been telling me about Joanna Newsom for a while, and finally sent me this CD. I had to call my sister and another friend and play them this horrid voice, and they both said that they thought it was satanic and to never listen to it again. So, of course I did, and now I am in love with her crotchety, childlike voice that sounds more beautiful every time I hear it.It (her voice) is most assuredly an aquired taste, but once you've tasted it, it's addicting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but no.","review":"My Father bought this CD based on the glowing reviews from the New York Times. We both recoiled in disbelief as the harp & keyboard drowned out into wretched sounding vocals. That's the only way I can describe her vocals: wretched & fake. It sounds like Joanna is forcing and twisting her voice into something that it's not. I think she is a worthy musician, her lyrics are very creative and the instrumentals are innovative. But, I just can't get over the forced-out, scratchy, twisted vocals. I get the sense that Joanna hasn't really found her \\"voice\\" yet and is banking on this forced-out, contrived, folksy sound to set her apart in the scene. Word of caution: Listen before you buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodness...!","review":"A record for Bjork fans who would like to know why some of us dislike Bjork. One listen to this and they will get the same effect Bjork has on me. This is not, however, a record for those who dislike Bjork. An unholy union of Bjork and Yoko. I'm sure the lyrics are excellent as some say but I cannot get far enough past the voice to hear them. A great pity, I'm sure, but I can live with that loss as I cannot live with this music."},{"rating":"1","title":"the first and last time i ever comment on anything....","review":"it's that awful. comparisons to bjork? really? if by similar people mean white and female, then yes, i suppose they are. this is the emperor's robe of \\"more original than thou\\" really deep thinkers. can you hear it? can you? it's the most striking , profound album of 2004. really."},{"rating":"1","title":"The milk eyed mender, voice like a blender.","review":"I bought this album on the strength of a New York Times review that made Joanna Newsom sound like the greatest female vocalist since Joni Mitchell. I fired up the CD and was stung by how horrible her voice is. She sounds like a grade schooler learning the words to her own song. I thought the first track had to be a daughter or very young sister but I became depressed after the second track and realized this is her actual voice. I have a feeling this is some hip chick being promoted by the politically correct media, but she should make her career in orchestra. Do yourself a favor and listen to the tracks before you buy. I didn't because I trusted the NY Times. This album makes the case that music should be free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this albulm knowing it was going to be a little off putting but after a few songs I could not listen to it anymore I loved the few parts where Newsom sounded folk-ish but the rest of it was like a cat dying"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Heart Joanna!","review":"like folk music? There has actually been a lot of really awesome fok stuff this year, from Devendra Banhart to Thanksgiving, and this is my favorite. You know the voice that Bjork does when she is being \\"cute?\\" That is how Joanna sounds all the time.Witty and singable lyrics, clean catchy guitar picks, and just overall \\"cute.\\" Joanna is pretty much brilliant. I can't wait to hear what is next.\\"As for my inflammatory writ? I wrote it and was not inflammed one bit.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, be reasonable!","review":"Look, I know the attractive nature of being counter-cultural or avant-garde, but you must be reasonable. THIS IS NOT GOOD MUSIC. This is a strange woman, admittedly skill with the harp, doing funny things with her voice. I'd just say this album is strange but, honestly, Pink Floyd is strange but awesome! This is just strange. Unfortunately, I believe that most of these positive reviews see the words \\"San Francisco\\", \\"folk\\" and \\"new\\" and like it on spec because it means they get to be first and different. Oh, well. Just listen to the samples and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful singer","review":"Maybe her harp playing could be acceptable, but when she sings... everything turns awful. The worst singer I ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a baby crying in the night","review":"This is another album that really grabbed me.Magical, mystical, clearly indebted with the late 60's/early 70's acid folk scene, but also very personal and moving.Her voice is peculiar, at times childish while in other moments she sounds almost ghostly. All in all a great album, and another great release for Drag City."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing and clever","review":"I borrowed my daughter's car, and the CD in the player was poised on \\"Bridges and Balloons\\"! I had to laugh. And I had to hit the \\"Repeat\\" button, because I wanted to decipher the lyrics. I still haven't figured them all out, I'm having fun trying. As others have said before, her voice grows on you. Her playing is charming. And her lyrics are fun and clever and intriguing. I've played it for friends, and they've had to laugh, too. No, she'll never be mainstream, but she'll have a loyal following..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful album","review":"Miss Newsom is an excellent musician. Once one becomes accustomed to her unusual, but hauntingly lovely voice, the poetry of her words washes over you. Well written and expertly performed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Newsom's music is a gift.","review":"Who else would provide us with this music? Too bad for those who aren't into her style of singing. The songwriting is obviously brilliant whether or not you like the voice. I'm in complete awe of this album, her second album \\"Y's\\", and we'll see about the third (check it out if you don't like her voice here, her new style is infinitely more accessible to a broader audience). Anyways, this album is very special. One of those debuts that has little chance of being topped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting - Music is Great, But She Makes My Eye Twitch","review":"At first sound I wanted to yell, \\"Make it stop!\\".The second time I listened with an open heart and quite honestly I thought album was very creative, the music was great, but that voice...to me it's something that you either love or hate. I'm in the latter category. All I could think of was Carol Channing, very drunk singing loudly to the night air, stumbling down the street on her way home. The creative aspects of this album, for me, cannot be redeemed due to the silliness of the vocals. That being said, I can understand how she could appeal to some. I'm just not one of the some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to Ponder","review":"I don't need anyone's permission to enjoy what i enjoy and I love Joanna Newsom. Any flea head knows art is subjective."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"After reading the glowing review of Milk Eyed Mender in the New York Times, I was anticipating purchasing the cd, which I promptly did. I was also excited about purchasing it, being a harpist myself, though not a professional one, and wanting to support another harpist. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in the cd. Although I enjoyed the harp playing, I found Joanna Newsome's voice displeasing. The NYT review had said her voice was unusual. That was an understatement. Although her lyrics can be poetic, and her harp playing is wonderful, frankly, her voice is difficult to listen to - often off-key, child-like to the point of parody. A musician friend of mine compared it, but unfavorably, to Yoko Ono's voice, but not as good. That said, her music is interesting, and I'd love to hear her songs sung in another voice. But with the voice as is, I just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or Hate it","review":"People will compare Joanna Newsom to Bjork and this is a good comparison. They don't sound alike, (Bjork is more siren, Joanna is more coal minor, and I mean that in the best way possible) although they both have amazing voices. This is not the reason for comparison. The reason they are comparable is that you will either love this music or hate it. It is revolutionary and beautiful new music or it is akin to cats howling in an alley. I love both of these artists and think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread (or maybe even the printing press). I would suggest you listen to the samples and if it catches you, buy the cd because you will not regret it. I have also seen her live (after I fell in love with the album) and it was a highly recommended experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy cow!","review":"Great music, Audio quality is very good. The Harp is delightful. I like it a lot until Joanna opens her mouth. Like fingernails on a chalkboard, bless her heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why aren't there negitive stars in the drop down?","review":"this is the worse collection of anything (i hesitate to call it music) I've ever heard! I'd rather listen to dogs bark jingle bells! Although, now that I think about it, it would be fun to blast it out my windows when my neighbor's kids have their friends and their friends cars all over the street in front of my house. Hummmm, sounds like a weapon of mass destruction! Okay, i give, it does have it purposes.Some one I just played a sample for suggested she sounds like Bob Dylan on Helium. Another suggested using it at Guantanamo Bay as a torture device."},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me wince","review":"I bought this album because I read a review that said it was a nice relaxing one to listen to with a cup of tea...[...] As I listen to this album I get the peculiar feeling that I am listening to a demon-possessed child. Is this a joke? When I was in the fifth grade I went around singing in my \\"bad voice\\" just to annoy the boys on the playground. [...]The lyrics make no sense either, she just throws in pretentious sounding phrases like, \\"a hat made from a page of Camu.\\" I've read a lot of Camu, but I don't get the significance of that line. What confuses me is why so many people have listened to her shreaking voice and called it art, called it good. Has anyone ever heard of the Emperor's New Clothes?

Topics covered include ions, electron orbitals, complexes and their stabilities, macrocyclic complexes, organometallic complexes, REE complexation, spectroscopy, and more. This book requires a strong background in chemistry to fully appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Ship One just rules!","review":"While this album didn't catch me as fast as Burning Organ did, it is still worth the price to hear Paul and his Osmonds/Beatles vocals and blasting guitar riffs.

If you are PG fan, it's definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting both as a travel memoir and an anthropological study","review":"I purchased this book after returning from traveling in Peru, wanting to get more of a perspective on the daily lives of villagers that I had only glimpsed from the window of a tourist van. I was mostly satisfied with the level of detail provided by the author - she is honest both about her own misconceptions and missteps, and those of the campesinos whom she lived with for one year. The narrative is told in the present tense, as though we are living through the events with her, and she tries to capture what she was thinking and feeling at each moment that significant events occur. This is a bit more detailed than your average travel book, and probably a lot less technical than your average anthropological text. For me it was a good balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough enough but far from finger-friendly.","review":"I purchased this shock-proof Panasonic after disappointments with all brands of cheaper thirty-dollar players. I've had it for only six months and see it's been pulled, so maybe there are problems with the model which I have yet to discover.It's a tough, hardy, water-resistant player, and the hand-strap is indeed extra insurance against droppage if you plan to take it with you for walks, etc. The primary limitations are lack of any sort of illumination (pretty much true of all portable CD players) and the flat, rubbery, poorly-designed controls (which taper into increasingly tiny surface areas, so that hitting \\"advance\\" requires tiny fingers with micro-management precision). Needless to say, the player is far from ideal for those \\"night walks.\\" In fact, there's no way a manufacturer can justify selling these for above fifty bucks and hope to offer a competitive alternative to iPod-type players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a gift","review":"This book was a gift for my sister, who is raising three young girls.

Otherwise, a seasonal album everyone may enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chilly Winter's Turning","review":"To me, this record is by far the coldest album that Robin has produced - it contains no work of his own and although all tunes & songs are performed as expertly as ever, it lacks the warmth & feeling that graces his other work, partly caused, perhaps, by the instruments used. The rendition of traditional work on his recent albums is much more communicative & far more human - although I still prefer his own gems.This \\"Winter's turning\\" feels like a chilly, chilly wind blowing, and if there are inky scratches showing on the cd surface, it's not from frequent use.Hans Wigman"},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be a comic book","review":"Trooper Mark Black!?!

They get compromised and they must fight their way out to the Chilean border. The latter is perhaps the only contribution that Ryan has actual experience of. Then, twenty years later, those naughty Argies are at it again and this time a more experienced Black returns and guess what?...he bumps into that spy again etc. etc. etc.A poor plot, lifeless characters and an immature writing style.

If you do buy it, test it before you install it. I would suggest that you buy a model that has mechanical buttons and a mechanical dead bolt handle.

Worldcom is then given as an example; another icon of the excesses of the internet boom that imploded. Participant in the opening discussion is Dennis Kozlowski, who is now serving eight to twenty-five years in prison for his role in the Tyco scandals.I admit, all of this is entertaining enough from a historical perspective.

I do not think so. Between The Buttons is testimony to the endless talent of the Stones. Departing from their harder, blues driven rock, this work shows their versitility in music making. All Sold Out, Complicated & Amanda Jones are just but a few of the great tunes on this album. No, these songs did not make it to the Top 20, but that was probably not the plan anyway. The Stones were pushing the envelope and finding new ways to make their music last well into the 21st Century. Long after the Beatles had used up their creative genus, The Rolling Stones pushed on. \\"Between The Buttons\\" is a Beatlesque work that the Liverpool Boys wish they had made. It is no accident that the Stones are older than most of the parents of the reviewers seen here.

However, the whistle is decidedly creepy; it sounds like a ghostly train approaching from a distance. Also, the handle is on hinges and often made me nervous pouring the tea (nothing ever happened).

I had only owned the teapot for about three months, if that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not whistle and alert you","review":"One star for cuteness and another star for paying $20 and about $6 shipping.

It SOMETIMES gives you a VERY LOW medical device flat-line hum. Yes, a tad eerie as another reviewer wrote. The handle can get hot on occasion. Too bad...this is the third tea kettle I've purchased. The other two were returned. Oh...a plus is no sharp edges except for the spout. The ergonomics of pouring water out is decent. Spout is kinda wide so there can be some spillage if you don't control the flow volume. It's black inside so tough to see if the hardwater has built up so just use baking soda and vinegar daily to keep the enamel from corroding (what happened to us before)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not warm enough for winter","review":"SSG Pro Show Leather Winter Riding GlovesThese gloves are soft and comfortable, but not warm enough when it gets below freezing.

This one left me sleepwalking for the next few weeks, just thinking about it. Malcolm experienced the lowest of lows, and the highest of highs. From criminal, to Elijah Muhammad's right hand man, to founder of te NAACP, to martyr. He is wrongly viewed as a counter-racist. First of all, he had good reason, and second, he changes after his pilgrimage to Hajj. This is a must read to a student of El Hajj Malik El Shabaaz, a student of the the civil rights movement, or a student of history. I recommend this for anybody. Anyone in search of a good read.

If you are looking for an interesting story of a great African-American and his struggle, this is definitely for you.

You'll sympathize with the horrendous childhood Malcom endured and relive the evolution of a man. Malcom became a black supremacist under the guidance of Elijah Muhammed and the Black Muslim teaching. An unfortunate series of events contributes to Malcom's search for himself. Amidst the most astounding change a man can feel, his life was cut short. Malcom X, upon returning from Mecca, altered his perspective so radically that he no longer provided the press with a racist appeal. Malcom was truly a hero who fought for his people.

I had always heard about Malcolm but I never knew to much about him. But after reading this book I do know a lot more about the man they call Malcolm X. I like the book because it was about his life, how he lived it, what he did, not about some made up stuff that never happened. Its quite interesting how he was a criminal and then turned into a Muslim priest. It was a very descriptive book on his life, it told all the things he did. Another point I like about it is it was an interview, it was not some guy writing a book on what he thought about Malcolm X, it was a book about his actual life.

I was not impressed. Of course, anger is a dead end. Of course, the Muslims aren't all they would like us to think they are. Of course, a life of petty crime is a dead end. If he had actually shut up for a while and listened to other people, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble, and maybe still be alive. But some people are so dense they will not listen but need to hit their heads against the wall over and over again.

A real disappointment. a poor example of displaying \\"change\\" and the such. Anger and hate gets you no where, as we can see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opener","review":"This is the greatest book to find Malcolm X's own perspective on all aspects of his life. From his troubled childhood to thugging through Harlem to becoming one of the most well known Black/Muslim leaders of all time- he tells it all. Through discovering the tribulations he experienced as a child and teen you can see how he would come to believe and preach what he did. This book is an inspiring account of a great leader's life.Many people give this book poor rating strictly because of Malcolm's hate of the white man which he carries for most of his life. Remember not to judge a historic figure by today's societal standards. Put yourself in his shoes and his views make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the whole book!!!","review":"A fascinating look at one man's personal growth. Fast-paced and very readable - I couldn't put it down. But - the book must be read through, beginning to end, to fully appreciate the changes which Malcolm X experienced in his life, caused by both external forces and personal acquisition of knowledge. Should be required reading in every US high-school curriculum."},{"rating":"2","title":"The mind of Malcolm","review":"Overall, I think this book was extremely intriguing and informative. Although at times Malcolm's views were prejudice and extreme, this book allowed me to see his life and the world through his eyes. It was not just a book about a black man's life but it was a story about the self-discovery of a human being. He shares his story of love and hardships and his change of heart about other races. \\"Packed in the plane were white, black, brown, red, and yellow people, blue eyes and blond hair and my kinky red hair all together, brothers! All honoring the same God Allah all in turn giving equal honor to each other.\\" Ultimately, I think if you can keep an open mind through a few chapters of his racist views and thoughts of hatred, that you will get through the only weakness of this book, it's definitely worth reading, especially if you want to know the truth behind the X."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to Black Manhood","review":"Some books can change your perception, but only a few can wipe out age-old assumptions, and force you to rethink everything you thought you knew. The question of RACE is at the heart of the American society, and in this book, not only African-Americans, but Americans of all colors, black, white, red and yellow, will find themselves reassessing what racism entails, for Malcolm X life, is a poignant testimony of the black man's struggle against both individual and institutional racism.This book has inspired many to answer the question of RACE in America on the institutional level, among them, The Black Panthers, CORE and many other Black Power movements.Thanks to Alex Haley, Malcolm X will be remembered as a man, who stood for what he believed, who lived the word he preached, and who fought oppression, \\"by any means necessary.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"this are just notes, not the actual book","review":"it was not clear to me upfront: this book is not the acutal autobiography.

This book was entertaining enough to hold my interest, yet compelling enough to leave me feeling a certain conviction at the horrible way my country has treated the African American people. While my personality recoils at some of the things Malcolm X did, my heart cannot help but be moved by the hardships and inequity he sought to overcome. I would recommend this book to anyone -- but especially the man or woman in need of a stirring of the heart in the matter of racial pride."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real eye-opener to anyone who thought they knew who X was!","review":"It was amazing to read such a fully formed (and true) story of anger, betrayal, and change. Very few readers of my generation know much about the man known as Malcolm X, and this book tells all, from early childhood to death. Alex Haley did an outstanding job of transforming interview notes into a first-person autobiographical account."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best depiction of the times Written..Malcom is eloquent","review":"When I originally became interested in reading this book, I wasn't sure what I would find. I expected to unearth racial doctrines, and reiterated black power. What I found instead was the tender, intelligent voice of an entire generation of african americans. Indeed the eloquent Malcom X, using Alex Haley, as his microphone took me through the story of his life, and of his times. A must read for anyone pursuing history, philosophy, humanities, or Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book and truly an american classic!","review":"Alex Haley does an excellent job in describing the life of a controversial man. Haley produces a book that is a must read for every educated person in America. Haley writes about Malcolm X with honesty and candor. The reader will find the book to be meaningful in understanding how Malcolm X became a victim of racism and religious fanatism. Malcolm X made significant changes in his ideaology and views regarding the nation of Islam. This book is enlightening and powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"These load leveling shocks have worked wonders for the handling of my old Dodge pickup, especially when it is heavily loaded.

By all means, go for these if you've got the scratch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stones' First","review":"The self-titled debut album by The Rolling Stones laid the blueprint for the next several releases of their career. They had a couple of original songs and a liberal dose of the hardcore rhythm & blues that made them the evil twins of the Beatles. The first three songs \\"Not Fade Away\\", \\"Route 66\\" & \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" (later made famous by Foghat) all show the raw energy of the band. \\"Tell Me\\" is a fine original composition. \\"I'm A King Bee\\" sets up the Mick Jagger persona of the sexual lothario and \\"Carol\\" starts the trend of having a Chuck Berry cover on their first few albums. The album shows off the band's potential and although it doesn't always hit, \\"Can I Get A Witness\\" and \\"Walking The Dog\\" to name two, it is a solid debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This was supposed to be one of the best Stones albums.

There are some great tracks here, like Not Fade Away, Route 66, I Just Want to Make Love to You, Honest I Do, Little by Little, I'm a King Bee, Carol and Tell Me. But, later in the album the boys start to run out of gas. Can I Get a Witness, You Can Make It If You Try and Walking the Dog are pretty weak.

It supported at an emotional level that there is live after death and my friend would see his daughter again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have actually read it--imagine that!","review":"Unlike those learned gentlemen who practice the judging of a book by its cover, I have read this work. It is a fascinating and compassionate account of a family dedicated to reshaping execution from torture to a death as quick and painless as possible. A second goal was to carry out the sentence with as little trauma to the body as possible, to spare the family yet another indignity.Unlike recent inept and intenionally cruel Iraqi hangings done at the direction of the US government, the Pierrepoint family practiced and rehearsed the final moments so that only a few seconds elapsed between the executioner's entering the chamber and the drop. Pierrepoint also desribes his awakening, and his eventual joining of the British movement to outlaw the barbaric practice of capital punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read a number of books about British executioners includingDiary of a Hangmanby John Ellis, andThe Hangman's Tale: Memoirs of a Public Executionerby Syd Dernley, and I have to say that this book by Mr Fielding was not nearly as interesting as those two. The actual biographical information about the three Pierrepoints, Henry, Thomas and Albert is rather sketchy and most of the book consists of page after page of brief accounts of murders and then a paragrpaho or so detailing the execution of the perpetrators. A few of the murders are interesting accounts of famous cases, but the bulk are sordid and mundane and the accounts of the executions, for the most part, seem to differ only in the weight of the victim and the length of the drop. It is a pity that the author didn't focus on a smaller number of cases and provide a bit more interesting detail for each. As it was, the book quite quickly became repetitious and tedious. I finished it, but I doubt I will read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want my money back","review":"I'm someone who buys a lot of books and almost never regret a purchase. This is one of those rare instances that I have. All the book is is a list of those executed by the three Pierrepoint men...nothing about their feelings or the psychic cost (if any) that their job entailed... maybe this book works for someone who just wants to read a paragraph or less on many, many different crimes...but even these are not told in any kind of compelling style. A waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pierrepoint a family of Execuioners","review":"Pierrepoint A Family of Executioners is a very factual account of the History of the Pierrepoint Family I think the Author built the book around Official documents which would have he barest of details as the book shows once or twice, I personally enjoyed the book better than Pierrepoint Executioner which is told by the man himself who unfortunately comes across as a little Cocky and self serving, but if one remembers what he did for a living he may be excused, the Family of Executioners is a good read for those who are interested in that type of History and how the law was applied in England up until the sixties it didn't appear that the threat of the Death Penalty had much effect on curbing the Murder rate in the years covered by this book, I gave it four stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploitative rubbish","review":"The cover of this book shows a noose totally unlike that used by Pierrepoint or any other British executioner - one cannot help wondering if the rest of the book is as full of such glaring errors.

We must be \\"Within the Woods\\"...","review":"If you want to see a really scary, well produced horror movie, stay away from this one. The director must have thought ripping off other horror movies done much better was some kind of homage but it's not. The cast does the best they can, although the lead actress's greatest talents lie hidden underneath her shirt, and we're not even given the pleasure of a glimpse (nice going brainiac). The scene at the end in the control room was unintentionally hilarious, when the guy gets his hand chopped off by the killer clown and screams, you'll scream too... with laughter.As cheesy as this movie is it does have some entertainment value if you want a laugh, when you're done watching it, the DVD makes a nice drink coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors","review":"The layout of the book is nice: each chapter begins with a reading and analysis of the text and then continues with further grammatical explanations and cultural notes. For someone who just wants to review the basics of Spanish for informal use, this book is probably sufficient. However, it is filled with too many errors to be of much help to someone who wants to make a serious effort to learn grammatically correct Spanish. There are minor mistakes throughout, and the explanations of preterite vs. imperfect and the uses of the subjunctive contain significant inaccuracies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiot's Intermediate Spanish","review":"If you want to learn about Spanish culture, this book will be somewhat useful in learning some statistics. Unfortunately, it is also loaded with chauvanistic comments about how superior the Latino culture is and how friendly, polite, helpful they invariable are despite the fact that there are cities decimated by killing gnags in Mexico, some of the countries are ruled by dictators, and poverty abounds. Books on Spanish should be about the language, not attempts at brainwashing.If you can get past the propaganda, there are some useful analyses of the readings in this book. If you hope to come away from reading this book having the knowledge to move on to the advanced level of Spanish, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"E string is junk","review":"G, D, and A work fine, but the E string squeals quite noticeably and and is very embarassing when it happens.

The deck's unique art, a combination of line-drawing and watercolor, is some of the best I've ever seen. The colors are luminous and harmonious...The artist pulled off a rare feat in creating a truly colorful deck, but one that defies syrupy sweetness or garishness. The symbols and images of the deck are familliar (derived largely from the Waite deck I believe), yet presented in a very fresh, new way. The deck is very \\"user friendly\\". The cards are of large size, but not awkward, and are easily shuffled right out of the box. I have not yet had the opportunity to completely read the accompanying booklet, but my first impressions are that it is intelligently written and useful. Even the packaging of this deck reflects quality. The \\"kit\\" is very compact and portable. This deck/book set gets my complete approval. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful artwork... fantastic deck... Llewellyn's best","review":"A beautiful deck full of bright pen and watercolor images that grab the imagination. It has become my deck of choice. The cards are larger than most decks, which I like, and the packaging is well done. This deck makes its home in my best tarot bag... I like it that much. The art is soothing to the eye, unlike the familure Waite/Smith images. The book that comes with the deck is interesting reading but for the beginner this deck and Joan Bunning's workbook are a very good match (even though Joan uses Wait, the images translate nicely... for the most part). This is Llewellyn's best deck in my opinion and you cannot help but come away from this deck anything but a fan of Nigel Jackson's talents. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most reccomended!","review":"Beautifully illustrated cards that holds a treasure for the occult interested, full of medieval, and renaissance Occult symbolism.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very elegant but not easy","review":"I was first attracted to this deck because of the beautiful and graceful design. The images are calming and the colors pleasing. While the artwork is simple and lovely, the accompaning book is complicated, dealing with the science and history of tarot as well as Pythagorous and his mathmatic/mystic concepts. It's interesting, but also extremely difficult to read and not for beginners. I love the deck, but I work with other books of card interprations when reading the cards.

The author clearly recycled existing conventional recipes, substituting some soy flour in place of wheat flour. To truly succeed in baking with soy ingredients, you need to compensate for the taste and behavior of the soy flour. In my experience making these recipes, they all need adjusting and doctoring. She routinely leaves salt and vanilla out of the recipes, or calls for much too little salt. They generally lack flavor.Additionally, the table of contents and index are next to useless. Every recipe is named \\"Soy something-or-other\\" which makes it tedious to find what you're looking for. I was thrilled to find this book initially, but am now beyond disappointed with it.

In that regard, it will afford genuine opportunities for young and/or creative new web designers to have their work stand out.Nielsen set up the industry for this book with definite genius by making his own web site completely plain and, therefore, \\"safe\\" from measurement against anyone's standards, save for beauty, and perhaps readability.

I purchased the product and it was delivered promptly. The problem with this seat cover is that it doesn't fit on top of the Swchwinn's seat. It's not designed to work with it. I contacted the company to return the product and they said they were looking into redesigning a new product for the Airdyne Evo Comp. The problem I had was the return policy. The company is a \\"Mom & Pops\\" operation in MT and doesn't pay for returning the product for credit, it cost me $23.28 in UPS shipping fees which was 50% of what I originally paid for the seat!

A guy is putting plants on a water deck and a silly girl shoots two of the plants. The guy gets mad and throws the rest of the plants in the water then a table then a chair and then jumps up and down. Funny? No. Stupid? Yes. More of this type of humor throughout the movie.

His best sendups are of the would-be large and small-time crooks in the story. An overdose of slapstick is neatly cancelled by his great use of great music - who else would spring Grandpa from a hospital by brass band invasion? Which unexplained capo trussed the musicians to play up a tree? Any chamber musician who has ever felt more like servant than artist will feel right at home with that scene. Amid this inspired chaos, the family members dutifully taking care of each other at cross purposes balance further parodies of Balkan violence. A work of genius, and to those fluent enough to recognize the Serbian and Romany epithets behind the subtitles, a fine education in the art of strong language."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've ever seen","review":"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

Nonetheless, as I watched, I found myself smiling, then chuckling, then laughing, and finally howling. Toward the end I was on the floor laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. There is no originality in this film, but there is plenty of humor. Lots of nudity, too, in case that matters. If you like to laugh and are not offended by naked girls, this one is a hoot. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can go back in time","review":"Private Resort is a hokey movie that falls into the typical T&A genre of many circ 80's films with young men suffering from high libidos. The special appeal on this movie was seeing a young Rob Morrow long before his success on Northern Exposure or Numb3rs. The plot is adequate, the scenery pleasant, the clothing is enough to make you cringe, but it was a special time in America. It's a light hearted comedy that you can spend some time watching and laugh, smile and wish life was that innocent and simple again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than I thought it would be","review":"I ordered this movie and actually mistook it for \\"Hot Resort\\" Same year (1985) and almost the same name with a similar setting.

May not live up to what some people expect from a movie anymore, but for it's time, it was funny up there with Animal House,The Nerds, and Porkys.

However, I'm sure this film is one that Johnny Depp, Hector Elizondo and Rob Morrow aren't proud to have on their resume.The movie's plot is slim, and neither Morrow or Depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers. Elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs, but he's not at his best either. Most of the film's laughs come from Leslie Hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo; Dody Goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and Tony Azito as a bumbling hotel security guard. There's lots of slapstick, some of it works, most of it doesn't. You can do better, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dumb Movie!","review":"As far as I am concerned, there is exactly one good thing about this movie: a young and delicious Johnny Depp. No doubt men will see it differently, given the number of bikini-clad females around. It's Florida, it's spring break, and what do you need with an actual plot? It's basically slapstick and worse, in terms of humor. For example, one big deal is made over a guy whose hair is \\"ruined\\" by Depp's roommate pretending to be a barber when he is not. Through all the slapstick foolishness, all I could think of was \\"What's his problem? Yul Brenner looked great with no hair at all. Just shave off what's left and stop crabbing.\\" But of course, that wouldn't be nearly as funny.There is one particularly golden moment in the film, just one. Johnny Depp changes his pants. OK, he's facing away from the camera, but still . . . mmmmmmmmmmmm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny movie","review":"I admit that I'm a die-hard Johnny Depp fan, but this wasn't anywhere near one of his best. He IS adorable in the movie, but the plot is extremely corny, and I found myself rolling my eyes more than laughing out loud. Guys will enjoy this movie for the hundreds of bikini-sporting girls, but not much else. Although there are a few remotely funny parts, it is mostly because of how dorky this movie is. But then again, it was worth it to watch Johnny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iliad","review":"This is not the book that I thought I ordered.

I'm afraid that I might not have read the whole series if I had read this one first. I'm almost tempted to go back and reread the first book to keep my enthusiasm alive.Agatha has mellowed and become almost pathetic. The plot was weak and the usual sexual tension missing in action. The setting offered nothing, except some glimpses of English history that we hadn't seen before. The characters and conversations weren't believable. Or entertaining.

I've heard people say that she is funny, but I found her pathetic and generally unlikeable. Lastly, the mystery was very lame.

The inhabitants of Barrayar or Beta are extra-terrestrials but their preoccupations are very earthly so we can identify very easily with the heroes of Mrs Bujold. Even with Miles Vorkosigan and his strange complexion.THE WARRIOR'S APPRENTICE , as in the other books of Mrs Bujold, is more a psychological study than a pure sci-fi book. That's not a critique, in fact I really appreciate this manner to translate in a far future our today problems. The author is obviously talented.Once in a while, it's really a pleasure to read such books as THE WARRIOR'S APPRENTICE. They are not of the serious kind but you never have the feeling to lose your time by reading them. That's a compliment.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is worth the money to buy this book","review":"Hihger praise I cannot give. This book is worth spending the money to own it.

There is usually little doubt as to what will happen next, but the characters are interesting at times (even if they are somewhat cariacatured). The warlike Barryarans and peacenik Betans don't display much variety, but the character of Miles Vorkosigan is interesting to read in action. Lois Bujold gets better with her later novels about this strange universe set in a future where humans migrated to the stars as tribes and lost touch with each other for a time and then found each other again. The Barrayarans appear to be made to resemble the Soviets (warlike and totalitarian), while the Betans are Anglo-American democratic pacifists. All in all Bujold is a good writer (as she proves with some later adventures starring Miles), but here she appears to be experimenting and growing still. Not bad and not the best, but it's a better read than most other science fiction out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space...ummmm...opretta?","review":"This takes all those hoary old SF space operas and sets them on their ears.

The plot is moot from the beginning since it's as implausible as it is ridiculous, but like I said, it's a moot point since the plot is the last thing you'll remember. Remember the joy you felt hearing Steve Martin utter the words \\"I would like to by a Hamburger\\" and you'll instantly remember why you can't hate this movie, even if you don't like it.

This misfire is perhaps a career low for Martin, who will no doubt go on to do more great work in the future.

They were several times when I lost myself laughing uproariously. The film is worth viewing just for the two of them.The plot: France's well-beloved soccer coach is killed just 3 weeks before the French Medal of Honor. The chief Inspector of International Police (Kline) realizes he cannot take the case. So he brings in Clousseau, thus depriving a remote French village of their idiot, and sets him on the case planning to take over at the last minute and solve the crime.

At any rate, Steve Martin has to, MUST be considered among next year's nominees. I don't know if there is an actor today who can take over Peter Sellers' role but one thing is clear, Steve Martin is not it. In baseball terms he \\"goes for the fences\\" but an infield hit is (seldom) as far as he ever gets. I just felt sorry for him throughout the movie (as well as for the few people who did manage to laugh during the showing I went to) and sincerely wish they paid him well to do it.The good news is for \\"Bewitched\\" which is off the hook as the worst recent remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"I can't understand why Hollywood should try to make remakes of the unremakeable.

Belko\\" should have seen this version of \\"The Pink Panther\\" coming like a bad car wreck.Martin is always better off with original material rather than a re-imagining of old,well-known classic material made famous by other comedians/actors. Do you think any other comic on the planet could do a remake of \\"The Jerk\\"?On the \\"Pink Panther\\" movie itself; it was not just a poorly done rehash, but it missed the point of Seller's dry delivery and slapstick mishaps as the clueless Inspector Clouseau.There was just not one memorable, laugh out loud moment I can recount in the whole film. Probably because I was constantly thinking how horribly mis-cast this film was.If ANYONE should have been Couseau, it should have been Kevin Klein. His performances in \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" and \\"French Kiss\\" proves his comedic chops.Reno as Martin's assistant was another blunder. Where the hell was Cato? A major missing link in the Clouseau chain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupefying","review":"Stilted, vapid and utterly predictable. And that was just Beyonce. The rest of the movie was even worse. There was exactly one laugh in the whole thing -- the end credits list a dialect coach for Kevin Kline!

Steve Martin is uneven his role in temperment and accent, Kevin Kline in unwanted in his, Beyonce is just there for teen idol and politically correct reasons and she is no actress, Jean Reno is bored in his role. The only ones who score are the lady who plays Clouseau's new secretary and the guy playing 006. The three dimensional Panther cartoon was not used but is in the special features is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The punked panther","review":"Movie remakes are always dicey, and it's often the best-loved movies that get remade. As a result, remakes often fall short of the level defined by the original. Steve Martin's remake is a unfortunate demonstration of that phenomenon.The original was clever, sophisticated, and drily witty. Martin plays Clouseau with broad physicality, funny accents, and a bit of potty humor. In other words, the exact opposite of Peter Sellers. It's like a Barney sing-along trying to imitate Placido Domingo.

Steve Martin is amazing as the hapless Monsieur Clouseau, he really should have gotten some kind of award for this stupendous work that he does in the movie. Personally I think he does a better job then Peter Sellers. Steve Martins awful English accent is just about right and he acts the part to perfection. Some of the scenes are instant classic like the farting in the sound proof room and many others. Personally I find this version allot more fun then Peter Sellers then again I am a huge fan of Steve Martin and I consider him to be comedic genius well in league with other greats such as Eddie Murphy and Bill Murray to mention a few.

More on the lines of Airplane and similar spoof comedies. I find Steve martin usually irritating in film. He is outstandingly irritating on this one. The rest of the cast does not fare any better unfortunately.

Given all that, I was shocked and disappointed at how bad this movie was. There were a few very funny moments, but the rest of the movie felt tired and predictable, and even the slapstick was poorly done and not nearly as amusing as I'd expected. I thought some of the slapstick and jokes might be funny to children, but it also had enough inappropriate moments that I might be hesitant to allow children under maybe 10 or so to see it. No nudity or swearing, but just enough sexual humor to make it a toss up.I won't be buying this, and I'd probably recommend skipping it unless you have a couple hours to kill and there is absolutely nothing else on TV.

I'm a big fan of Steve Martin'a work- and yet I could not sit through this awful movie. Peter Sellers' Clouseau was a very nuanced character, a man who may have been incompetent, but who went about his business very seriously. He realized when he made a mistake, and much of the humor arose for Clouseau's attempts to recover from his mistakes. Martin's Clouseau, by way of contrast, is simply a clown, who blunders through thinks completely unaware of the havoc he is creating, or of any of the effects of his actions. I suppose if you've never seen any of the original Peter Sellers films you might find Martin's slapstick enjoyable, but anyone who finds Sellers' Clouseau to be one of the great comic figures of film will find this movie (and its sequel) to be a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"It is absolutely painful to watch a talent like Steve Martin butcher this role so badly.

All of the people are recognizable even if given not so obvious fictional names. If you are a lover of Bukowski and a lover of Barfly the movie, this is a five star classic. If you are a lover of either of the above----it's still a four star, well written work.

Either way, you'll find a flattened, two-dimensional version of the story you loved.Although much more professionally done thanFlatland the Filmand with some big name voices, this strays far from the original story. Females, for example, are geometric and social equals of the males, and an Area 51-style conspiracy theory appears at the center of the story. Overbearing overlords of the society come across as petty tyrants - too obvious to be at all threatening, at least to any viewer in a multi-digit age group.The mathematical commentary survives, with a pleasant \\"extra\\" from an Ivy League math professor, but that's about all that's left of Abbott's original points.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!","review":"I just received this yesterday after waiting for a year for it to be released (I ordered the home edition - which is the same as this except different licensing) This movie exceded my expectations and is a WONDERFUL tool in introducing third (and fourth +) dimensions or just to watch.

It is very powerful! I also really like Marie Leveau, which is about the famous Voodoo Priestess. Also really good is Handsome Weathered Woman which reminds me of my husband and I. I also really like Marie which is about a Lesbian couple and since my closest friend is a Lesbian, it has a lot of meaning for me.

I tell them that though this book stitches together the stories of a nurse-practioner and four of her women patients (fictional composites, to protect the privacy of the author's real patients), it is a book that reaches beyond the subject of the female experience in the medical world.

When I was a child I used check out \\"All-of-a-Kind Family\\" and the sequels from the library over and over again. The books taught me things about the Jewish faith and culture that I probably would not have learned elsewhere. Not only are the details about Jewish customs interesting, but the stories, characters and early 20th century settings are fascinating. My favorite character was Henny, because she was always getting herself into messes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally found this book","review":"I read this book as a child. Since then, I have been desperately searching for it. Unfortunately, though I could remember specific scenes from the book, I couldn't remember the title or author. Finally, after years of describing the plot to hundreds of children's librarians and bookstore owners, a chance remark from an aquaintance gave me the title. I am so excited to find it here at Amazon. For a young Jewish girl growing up in the 1960s, it wasn't easy finding Jewish characters in books. That is one of the things that made this book so special to me. Yet, I would urge any young girl (or boy) to read it, regardless of the religion of the child.

I am glad that a boy gets born at last because it makes a change from girls and it would probably make Gertie feel better to still be the youngest girl, though not the youngest over all.

I made the mistake of wearing it to my SIL's wedding when I was 9 months along, and the smell made me so sick that I still cannot wear it, almost a year later.

I bought this book at a school book fair after reading the back cover, thinking to myself, \\"this should be a great book to read to my daughter as she enters 5th grade.\\" I was wrong. If this author really knows a world like the setting of \\"Eleven\\", I don't want to live there. My daughter and I could not relate to this book.

Although the character of Charles is misguided, shallow, and in severe denial, I still found him fascinating. His friends, his scenery, his house, his food -- all are created so meticulously that I was absorbed into his world and story.

The book shows how we try to make a last ditch effort to repair heartbreaks in our lives, even if that goal is in reality a dream which would not really make us happy and can literally destroy others. It also explores the growing closeness of two elderly cousins who have had a life-long difficult relationship but who are the sole remaining members of their families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiring Read","review":"I wanted to like this drawn-out tale, but it just didn't grab me. The writing is notable. However, the characters are not memorable or even particularly likable.

I had heard what a great writer she was, oh what a disappointment. I felt that the story was very shallow; it was about an old guy who still thought he was young and his rather silly love affairs.

It's cute, but it only lasted a few mintues of play before breaking. Works by spinning up a flywheel which keeps the car going after you stop pushing it. My kids and I found that the main flywheel gear tends to slip after just a few pushes, and we can see that the contact between the gears is clearly worn a groove into one of the gears, allowing it to slip quite a bit. This was after only 10 minutes!Agree with the other reviewer that it isn't appropriate for little kids due to the exposed gears. And definitely keep this thing away from long hair!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor customer service","review":"The monkeys came out of a package - just thrown into a brown envelope.

There are several very good essays on the Finnish _Kalevala_ as an influence. Tom Shippey's essay on the _Edda_ and _Kalevala_ is one of his best, and a fine example of his typical clarity of style. Several of the reprinted articles, notably Catherine Madsen's essay on natural religion and Kathleen Dubs' on Boethian philosophy, are quite thought-provoking. Andrew Lazo's essay on the Kolbitar, precursor to the Inklings, is repetitive in sections but includes a good deal of very interesting material. Also noteworthy are the papers on oaths and oath-breaking by John Holmes and on Beowulf by Alexandra Bolitineanu. All in all, a useful collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book of family history for me","review":"My parents got a copy of this book when it was first released. My mother is one of Tinker's (Charles Wayne Owens, actually) sister. I was finally able to get a copy a few years ago from Ebay for about $89. This book is a treasured possession. Many family photos and stories that I remember well and a real story of the life of a college football player. I love the pics of his wife and child, Brandi. They are still married with two other children, all grown and are grandparents now. Tinker is still just as crazy as he was in the book!

However, upon receipt of the product and attempts to install it, I ran into many of the same problems that the reviewer below did and have been trying to get this product to work for 2 weeks with absolutely no luck and nothing but frustration and the run around by the manufacturer.I even hired a computer consultant with lots of experience installing similar products and he said that he has never had such a problem with a product before either.Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many frustrations","review":"I had high hopes, but so far have met with frustration at every turn.

So, went to a computer with a different OS, but couldn't get the maps installed because the Amazon third party vendor order failed to send the \\"unlock code\\".

Wife For A Day was a great book. Bride For A Night, unfortunately was not. I almost didn't finish it but I did hoping it would get better. I did not like Cairo's character. She was too indecisive. As an expert explorer, Duncan did some pretty dumb things. Even though their son had a high IQ, he seemed a little too smart for a four year old. The relationship between Graham and Phoebe did not seem real--I don't think anyone moves as fast as they did or after grieving for his wife for five long years Graham gets over her in a few days. Most scenes were short and clipped. I could go on but I won't. Sorry Patti this one just didn't do it for me. But I won't give up on you. I look forward to your spinoffs from Wife For A Day (Lauren Remington and Mike Flynns stories)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Other Book Was Better","review":"This book was really boring. Duncan and Cairo(weird name) fight with each other over the past and then they fight again over their son, Dylan.

With the late Maestro Bernstein we were fortunate to have several such chances. What is espcecially wonderful with this opportunity is watching him do what he became famous for early in his career: working with and teaching young people.

People say it is repetitive because of this but I think its a strong point not a weakeness. Brings the book to life and worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect complement to the book","review":"The DVD along with the book can take your training to the next level. Make sure you get both though since a lot of things covered by the book are skipped in the DVD and vice-versa.

I have to agree with Jim Wendler in saying that it is the best book on strength training ever written. That being said, at times (particularly in the 3rd Edition) the wording can get somewhat heavy and you can get lost in the elaborations on biomechanics, anatomy, and \\"human geometry\\" as Rippetoe refers to it. As an earlier poster put as well, \\"A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words\\".Sometimes getting lost in it, the visuals as well as watching Rip coach the lifts to Trainees over and over again (might I add they all have different builds, limb lengths and are of different ages), really works as a great companion to how REAL weightlifting is done.

What more could you want ? The sound recording is clear and listenable. James Pease also makes a strong contribution as Hans Sachs.Sutherland and Vickers are simply glorious ! (Sutherland's diction notably clearer than it was to be just a few years later.)This is a very strong recommend.The filler, Sutherland's first studio recording, I believe originally released as a 45, of arias and songs by Donizetti, Spohr and Rossini accompanied by Richard Bonynge on piano, is also quite wonderful, but it has had several incarnations on CD. It is a pity that some other rarer Sutherland or Vickers materiel might have been included instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily The Best Album of 2005","review":"Another solid album from Graham Parker, yet this time with revived energy in Rock N Roll mode, with The Figgs for backup. Every single tune is great, except for one clunker (\\"There's Nothing On The Radio\\"). But the quality of the work is so high that one can forgive a momentary lapse. My favorites keep changing, but \\"Local Boys\\", \\"She Swallows It\\" and \\"Go Little Jimmy\\" kick some ass and should really get some airplay somewhere. If you want to go for GP's best album since, well, last year's \\"YOUR COUNTRY\\", what's holding you up?

Half of the book is about how Mr Murch, God on earth, is such a great person. The author spends most of boring us with details of no importance about Mr Murch looking outside the window, walking to have a chat with Expert Y, making the whole thing such a big thing...what a risk it was...what a pressure to comit for such an exploit...when most of the readers are only interested in Final Cut rather than Mr Murch. You could throw away 80% of the book to get the interesting bit...maybe even more.

Too much of the book is focused on the INCREDIBLY HEROIC undertaking that was using FCP 3 on Cold Mountain. The author goes a little over the top with his love fest for Digital Film Tree. I thought this was going to be an in depth look at how Walter (lord of the edit) uses FCP. As well as in depth info about the editing of Cold Mountain and his editing process. Everyone has technical problems of their own. It isn't that much fun reading about Walter Murch's technical problems. I'm more interested in the creative side. There are too many books like this that focus too heavily on the tools and the technical problems. Though it is fun reading Steve Job's emails. For that it deserves 4 stars.

The story somehow stuck in my mind, the creepy cover haunted my memory.After reading more grown up stuff for the past years, I felt like I had to lower my thinking a bit to get into this teenage world, but I have enjoyed the story once again.Trish is being stalked by a man with a thousand faces, and she isn't safe anywhere, even in her own head.

Perhaps if Mojave 3 decided to liven things up (a lot) and write their saddest effort in the vein of \\"Deserter's Songs\\" era Mercury Rev. Or if the Flaming Lips did a dead serious album (hard to imagine I know) that came across as meloncholy as Radiohead's \\"The Bends\\" and were a as melodic and strings oriented as a Moose album.Seriously, it's that good, but if have a hang up with meloncholy or strings you will be as offended as the last reviewer -- sorry dude, I think you missed the point.Honestly, I'm a fan of happy music (lots of lush pop, sweedish bands, indie dance and the like) but this is a real downer.

There is no tooldial for the Windows version ( a fact that they don't disclose ) which is probably the most powerful feature of this product.I now feel as though I have wasted my money on what is a useless tool ( if you have Windows ) and been totally conned by Logitech.What is even worse is the fact that Logitech don't have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for Window users.

Using the pen to do the editing and this to do the navigating (zooming in and out, scrolling around, changing brush size, navigating history states, etc), I can remain more focused on my work.This is not a revolutionary way to work, but it does help to increase efficiency and speed up workflow.If you are a Windows user you should be prepared to download the drivers from Logitech, since the last I heard it was still being shipped with Macintosh software only."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"definition\\" the confused concept","review":"one of the chapters of this book is about \\"real definition\\".Robinson believed that the notion of real definition is a confusion of at least twelve activities.some of these activities are legitimate and extremely valuable activities,but we shuld not call them \\"real definition\\", and some of them are wholly bad.real definition as search for essence is a bad activity because it has some false premises.I wrote a reaserch about real definition in islamic logicians attitudes and addapted it whit Robinson's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Says Who?

Only a bit into the book, the whole cloth pronouncements on what \\"they\\" (the user) want and find useful come fast and furious. Where are the references? Even an anecdote? Nielsen left out any research to hide complicated conclusions.Nielsen is considered by many in the business to be an expert on web usability, but the book has exchanged any good science for gushing cliches and maxims. Simply no credibility, unusable by mature professionals. Perhaps the book is meant for hobbyists? I did not get that impression from the presentation.This book is written to make money, not to get at the truth.

If this is an example of what happens when people without solid skills read a book like this, then I am not very impressed. The world is replete with bad websites; I have no evidence (right now) that this book is making a difference. The proof in our (programming) world is always in the pudding. In other words, talk is cheap, but it is hard to build good software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about a waste of time!","review":"Three points to illustrate why you should not buy this book:1) Jakob Nielsen does not understand frames. Plain and simple. Few people do. Frames are not the answer to everything, or even to most things, but they are an incredibly useful addition to the web designer's arsenal if used well. It is easy to use frames poorly. Hard to use does NOT equal bad.2) Jakob Nielsen's opinions are held WAY too strongly for him to be even the remotest bit convincing as a guru. Gurus are about helping you to find yourself. Jakob just shouts at you and hopes you'll find him by the noise.3) In amongst all the b.s. statistics, it would have been nice to see some nuts and bolts. If you want useful, buy some other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If web design were a religion... this would be the bible","review":"Cover to cover this book is crammed full of good stuff.

A+++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, It is Good Guildeline but a bit out of date","review":"I admire that Jakob Nielsen point out that a lot of graphic take longer time to download. It did help us as a webmaster to try to reduce / optimize the graphic size.However, the recent website trend is always moving toward nice-looking design. We must balance the use of graphic and text and not only try to reduce the graphic element.Last point, I still seriously think that a clear website architecture and easy navigation is the main ingredient of a good website. That is why I give this book 4 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit outdated","review":"It is amazing how a book that was useful when it was published becomes obsolete so quickly.

Therefore, designing better web sites that work for users and helps portray your sites or company's goals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow on specifics","review":"A bookful of screenshots does not research make. Sure, this book is full of common senses suggestions for usability, but it sorely lacks detailed references to establish credibility. A statement like \\"most people prefer searches\\" doesn't carry much weight without as much as a footnote to the actual research. This useful payload of this book could have easily been conveyed in 50 pages.While I wouldn't recommend this read, Web newbies might pick up an idea or two. Anyone with any sense of Web design should spend their reading time elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book that could be condensed more efficiently","review":"This book summarizes what Jakob Nielsen has been trying to tell us for years about building usable software. Here he applies it to the web. This is probably the best book out there for learning to create web interfaces that won't send users clicking away after two seconds. My only complaint about the book is that he keeps reiterating the same core points over and over again, chapter after chapter. If it's so simple, then why am I reading 500 pages? A good book, but probably could have been condensed more efficiently."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very, very good basis for a constructive web site","review":"There are a LOT of books that take you through the dos and don'ts of web site design. As a web designer I tend to take these with a grain of salt - one guy's opinion may not necesarily translate into good web strategy.But this book seems to know common sense from personal opinion. Nielson goes through tried and true design and architecture practices, in a relatively structured and logical fashion. At times a little wordy, but helpful.This is definitely a good book to accompany Siegel's \\"Killer Web Sites\\". With these two on your shelf you're definitely a step ahead of the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contradictions from the opening chapter to the end","review":"Do yourself a favor, if you're used to Linda Weinman's clear, concise writing, stay very far away from this mess. Mr. Nielsen may know an awful lot about creating web sites and keeping them simple, but he doesn't have a clue about writing a book. Rather than explaining things in layman's terms, he seems overly concerned with expressing his great intelligence to the detriment of the book's continuity and accessibility. Good topic- bad author."},{"rating":"1","title":"verbose","review":"Exceptionally verbose. While there may be some redeeming value to all the case studies mentioned, you could get the same results from the authors web site, and save the bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be about facts not ego","review":"From the beginning this book seems to be about Jakob standing on high, sharing his unquestioned wisdom with the simple folk. Perhaps if he backed up his pronouncements with more facts, idependent research (not just quoting himself, his firm or his past affliations with Sun) he might sound like more than hot air.In the end, I measure any non-fiction book by how many practical insights, tips or concepts I take away. I finished this book without having learned anything more than if I had sat in a bar listening to a couple of web designers bitching about how stupid most people are. It comes down to look at my site. I got it right because I am smarter than you.Save the money. Go buy a couple of developers a beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, use it, benefit from it.","review":"This is an excellent book. If you are involved with web design, creation, construction; this is a must read. Jakob writes very clearly. He provides, in a very simply and clear way, his views on different design alternatives, that are backed-up with rational reasons that you will find insightful. Buy this book, use it, and reap the benefits. It will help everyone using your website."},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance here","review":"I personally found no value in this book. I read it once and thought that maybe I skipped some chapters. I studied it again and determined that no, I did not miss anything. There is simply no substance here. Perhaps the author left some chapters out by mistake. I was hoping to learn guidelines for how to present different types of information for different types of sites. I was sorely disappointed. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef","review":"Pablum served up as science with no practical scenarios or examples to back up the author's theories. Sort of like reading Freud and wondering when we are going to get to Skinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Simple-Minded Web Designer","review":"While this book has a few good points, the majority of it reverts the reader back to the Web design days of 1995. Technology and bandwidth have increased the Web's capabilities, and there are many, easily-navigable Web sites that employ very little from Nielsen's thesis.He seems to be a small-minded man with an affinity for himself, especially considering the \\"I Love Me\\" page on his site. Someone so close to the engineering aspect of Web technology does not need to be given that much credit for design."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was valid stuff.. 3 or 4 years ago...","review":"\\"renowned Web usability guru\\".. that's almost funny... from circa.. 1994? I often wonder how people like this exist. Someone, somewhere, at some time.. validated this guy's archaic ways of thought and now we've got a book of outdated, narrow minded, limited use information.It almost angers me that this hogwash is treated as factual information, when in actuality, it is nothing more than the opinion of an outdated person with no creative talent and limited understanding of our technology and how it has progressed. If we were to all subscribe to this belief, we'd still be listening to the weekly radio show and placing phone calls through \\"Elma\\" at the local switchboard.The Internet is changing. Lead, follow, or get the heck out of the way.. we're tired of the mindless babble."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent starting point!","review":"This work is largely common sense, which means you should already know it. But honestly, most common sense only comes after making mistakes. This book can prevent you from making many of those mistakes. As a programmer, this book was helpful for me in making the transition to the web.Mr. Nielsen's book is lucid. It is well thought-out. He has studies to back up his conclusions. Even though you shouldn't treat it as gospel, you would do well to consider his reasoning before making your design decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"The author offers critiques, but rarely offers a better idea or redesign. It's the same with his other book about home page usability. This is a severe shortcoming.A related problem is that some of his criticisms are just unfounded or - in my humble opinion - just plain wrong. And I'm coming to the conclusion that that's why he doesn't offer solutions - a web site is a tradeoff between competing goals. It's actually not that difficult to find \\"problems\\" with sites; it's much more difficult to fix those problems and find that sweet spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive, not polished, but priceless","review":"Bad designers beware - here is a lucid eye-opening analysis of making the web useful and not just pretty. Most web sites and design books are based on one person's creative or technical skill using special effects on the web - Nielsen bases his reflections on testing, real people, and experience. Special effects without content and without considering the ultimate user of the information is useless. Many nice-looking web sites are good for one visit only, this book will help you keep people coming back.The price is high, but I'd pay twice the price for more of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book to be the best...","review":"Honestly, I never bough a better book in my life.I am a web developer on a professional level and I have though that I knew everything I need already, but this book changed it all - it told me that there's much more to learn yet!While you're going from chapter to chapter you see so many details to be followed that this book seems to be the bible of web developing. It doesn't say how to create a web site in technological terms, it is all about your style, the way you project a web site, the way you keep your visitors as happy and as less frustrated as possible without even give them a chance to understand it.It is all about the usable and practical web sites.I think this is what all of us, developers, should know. read this book and you'll have no doubts anymore if this is better or this ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"It's one of the must-have books for any webdesigner. You can find it quite cheap, so no reason not to buy it. Check out the authors online articles too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtually useless.","review":"The problem with a 'common sense' approach to usability is twofold:1)The design suggestions are solely the author's subjective opinions and have little empirical data to back them up.2)The suggestions that are well established enough to indeed be 'common sense' are common knowledge as well. It's not really news to anyone that a Web page should be visually simple, rather than visually complex.In short, if you have any background in the field at all, you'll mistrust many of the guidelines and already know the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Priced and Overly Cautious","review":"A good, solid, GUIDEBOOK for anyone who is just starting out in wed design, but certainly not gospel. Seasoned professionals will appreciate it for what its worth: an enlighten collection of tips and opinions on the subject of web usability. It would have been nice if the book was more advice and here are your options/possible consequences, and less absolutism.I've been a fan of Nielsen's alert box for years and was excited at the prospect of this book. True it is nicely illustrated and full of good tips to keep in mind, but in general the Nielsen's advice is overly cautious times and down right extremist at others. Tighter editing would have cut back on the exhausting over analysis of some points as well as corrected the numerous other gramatical and typographical errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design a Book I want to Read","review":"I wish the inside of this book lived up to it's cover, or title. What a let down! Try book design. A sea of text that falls into the gutter, leaving tons of white space unused off to the side. Ugly screen captures (albiet on point, if you are paying attention). Whatever it is about this book, the layout or the writting style (take your pick), I can't finish it. I've tried a few times, and with all these glowing reviews, I guess I'll try again. I DO agree that web usability is important. A good dose of bad medicine, I suppose. I'll hold my nose and keep reading (especially since I reeeaaaallly want to get my money's worth with this one).

After having only read the first 100 pages of the book I'm starting to see what he's talking about when he discusses web usability and how it relates to sites that are developed today.I think this book is perfect for any web developer.However, the only bad thing I would have to mention about this book are the amount of pictures...which aren't bad...but I'd rather sacrifice the pictures with more content...that's just me.Anyways...the book rocks (so far) and is definently worth getting your mits on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate waste of paper","review":"Nielson has once again demonstrated his ignorance when it comes to defining people on the web and what they like. According to Nielson, the average user is uneducated and needs to have their hand held every step of the way. I have more faith in the average user and I believe they are capable of waiting and understanding the intricate works of both text and image. I have to ask Nielson, should every piece of advertising exist in just black and white, Helvetica type leaving nothing to the imagination? Where is the fun in that? I feel bad for the aspiring web designer who is mislead by the information in this book and learns nothing. This book will not help you to build a better website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nielsen is a dinosaur.","review":"The book is banned at our company. We feel is will stunt the creative growth of our employees. For the life of me, I can't understand how anyone who's been doing web work for a while would take Jakon Nielsen seriously. This man is *severely* out of touch with the industry, but mixes in just enough common sense for the sheep of the web design world to proclaim him an expert."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the bible","review":"You may not follow all of Jacob Neilson's guidelines, but you can't start any website construction or redesign project without reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone's a Critic, Especially Nielsen","review":"If you don't mind a book thta does nothing but criticize a technology and art that are evolving, then this is the book for you.

You're probably also a beaten house-wife.I have witnessed over and over again, the deep heated desire to control creatives. I believe it largely stems from envy.

I suspect he objected to that as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designing Web Usability : The Practice of Simplicity","review":"This guy has no imagination.

If I ever see this guy in public I would spit in his face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of nothing","review":"Nielsen's approach to teaching web design is \\"learning by example\\". The entire book is an endless series of screen dumps accompanied by Nielsen's comments about what is \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" about the particular design. Unfortunately, most of the narration are only substantiated by \\"proof by pronunciation by eminent authority\\" (i.e. Nielsen himself). There is almost no reference to research, and very little resembling theory. There certainly is a lot of common sense expressed in the book, and an occasional tip and trick of to be utilised by a practising web designer may also from its pages of this book. But in its stated objective: to teach the student the fundamental principles of web site design, Nielsen's book fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just look at his website first - the proof is in the pudding","review":"Jakob Neielsen has his own website at http://www.useit.com/. If you even think about buying this book and consider yourself a web designer, take a look at his site first. Frankly speaking, it stinks! He even breaks some of his own rules about text clutter and long scrolling pages. Perhaps you like his site. If so, then maybe this book is for you. Maybe I can get a PhD in web usability, proclaim myself a guru, and sell books. I'll get companies to pay me 175k to give them verbal feedback on their site based on some simple principles that should be summed up in one article - Creating text based websites for morons. By the way, in the same vein of the Dummies books, Jakob assumes that people are idiots. Buy his book and prove him right (the press sure has).

I guess that Jakob Nielsen is a grat web developer, he knows many technical things about it, but he should not write books. Or he might take some lessons about \\"making some text shorter\\", -if you can say somthing using two words, don't use three. Usability is just about to make things easy to read and understand with minimum effort, this short-lettered, plenty-of-words-pages and plenty of pages book is exactly to learn things you should not do when trying to reach for usability.Im sorry Mr. Nielsen, its dissappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good conecpts, BAD DESIGN","review":"This man can really tell you how to design a website that will satisify user well.

He explains the do's and don'ts very well enabling you to avoid the pitfalls. But as the broad band technologies become more of a reality, his notion that favors using minimal graphics and multimedia in favor of text may become a thing of the past. He has a great site that outlines the points in the book - but buy the book if you can afford it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for all of us","review":"With the many computer related books that I must read to continue on this technology road, I can easily say that \\"Designing Web Usability\\" has made me think more than all the others. It is a book that doesn't necessarily teach us facts and 'strict' rules as much as it pushes the development community to start thinking in new ways. Designing for 'usability' should be a given considering the Web's user base can often be newcomers to the computer world, but this isn't the case. It is easy to understand, after years of designing boring databases it is wonderful to immerse ourselves in wonderful graphics and slick navigation systems. Does any of this really serve the users? Many times not. But beware, after reading Jakob Nielson's book, you may find yourself analyzing every page you read, asking yourself \\"Why didn't they do this. If they would just change that over there and it would be so much easier...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"web page design","review":"This book is an excellent resource for basic web design. While it is an older book, it still has much to offer the beginner. The illustrations support the text and aid learning. It is well organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, what a great web design book!","review":"Wow, this book does it all. It tells you what to do and what not to do when designing a web site. Get this book if you are having trouble designing the layout of web sites and the usability of web sites. The book is easy to read and keeps you turning the pages for more. This book is well worth your hard earn money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite for web design","review":"In my work with designing web designs, I rate this book as the best. If I had to keep only one book on web design, this would be it. This is a classic in every sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Baseline Reference","review":"Desigining Web Usability is, overall, an excellent book. I agree with one of the previous reviewers who stated that if you are a seasoned Web designer/developer there is not a ton of information here that is new. But it is nice to have it all in one place and so lavishly presented. The production value of this book is very high and is itself an example of excellent information presentation (albeit in the print world).The book is especially good for those new to Web site design and usability. I have seen all too often how graphic designers or especially marketing types and executives new to the Web insist on designing a Web page THEY like instead of one usable for the intended audience.Overall you may not agree with everything Dr. Nielsen says but if you take the basic principles to heart your Web pages will be much better. A key principle is that just because a page looks good does not mean it functions well. Dr. Nielsen will show you how to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and subscribe to Alertbox","review":"I have been a huge fan of Jakob Nielsen for years. I am also a subscriber to his Alertbox newsletter (on useit.com).I was looking forward to this book, but alas, found nothing in here that I would classify as new or ground-breaking.If you have never, and I mean never, read a book on web design, then by all means, buy this book. But if you have read anything by Waters, Weinnman, Pirouz, McClelland, Ibanez or Flemming (all excellent writers of web design and technique) then you have covered the topics in this book already.There is no technical, or real design theory here.Search the Useit.com archives and then subscribe either directly or through devhead (ZD Net) and save your money for his next book (of which this is Part I).

It is a book for study and reference. Unfortunately has no pictures to liven up the text. Rewritten every four years by the top decision making body of the church, The Discipline reveals all the secrets of a large religious body. As the title implies, it takes some discipline to stay focused on the tightly written presentations. Get the truth on the Methodists - I read the Discipline daily in conjunction with reading the Bible and my journey of faith is enlivened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful if you order this","review":"The summary page of the Book of Discipline shows the current edition on the front cover, but when you click on it and go to the specific page you get a different edition. Be careful here. I was not and did not notice, so the book I got was the 1996 version instead of the current 2008 version. It was useless for what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"$100 for this book is outrageous","review":"My rating pertains only to the price asked for the hard copy version and in no way reflects the content. I do not understand Amazon and the $100 hardcover price for this book. There must be some mistake. The same book is being sold in Christian book stores and from Cokesbury Press for $24.95. And yes, I am talking about the 2008-2012 edition. If you need the hardcover version look elsewhere until Amazon corrects this mistake. I bought the Kindle version but want a hard copy as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"On point!","review":"This book is very helpful, and consistent with my time of life - now that I am older and wiser!

Planning a trip to Europe I was expecting travel advice for when I am IN Europe. Instead the first 17 chapters wrote about everything so basic as to what a passport is, how to pack your backpack to what to do with your plants before leaving. Give me a break! The book was so common sense that unless you have never stepped a foot outside your country it is a complete waste of reading time. After 17 chapters of useless content the rest of the book gave a 2-3 page synopsis of each European country with zero valuable travel information.Luckily I bought Lonely Planet's Western Europe Travel Guide which is the size of a Bible with quality travel information. Again, this book is a total waste of money and offers absolutely no valuable travel advice for anyone traveling to Europe. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Birthday!","review":"I received this doll as my B-day gift and let me tell you she's beautiful.

Secondly, I love the hand strap that comes with it, so it won't fall when you're walking with it.

He said it was performed for a specific purpose - - to accompany dancers - - and misrepresented how he would conduct it for a regular opera performance.The film is excellent, butI have heard the soundtrack recording and have to agree with Sir Thomas.

I'd happily pay quite a bit for a stainless steel one."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real let down from kitchenaid","review":"My original kitchenaid hook lasted more than a year, and then the powdered coating came off and I sent for a replacement. The very first time I used the replacement dough hook, the powdered coating started coming off in chunks. I sent that one back and got a new replacement and am having the same problem, I used it once and the powder coating started flaking off, not as bad as the first but not good.

It's not in any way a waste of time as some reviewers seem to think. A step below \\"Purple Cow\\" and \\"Free Prize Inside,\\" and a couple steps below \\"Permission Marketing.\\"In baseball terms, it would be a double.He sets the bar high, and nobody can live up to that mark on every offering. Give it a chance before you judge it on the bad reviews you read here.Go Seth!3.5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book!","review":"I have worked in marketing and advertising, but do not currently. I picked up this book, strictly for the title. I have always thought myself to be a marketer's nightmare. I don't buy anything because of the brand name. The few branded things I do buy are only bought because I have used them and they have proven their worth to me. So, I picked up All Marketers Are Liars, expecting it to trash marketing gimmicks. Boy was I surprised to find that I am not the nightmare I thought myself to be. Godin's theory of storytelling as opposed to advertising is right on the money. While reading his book, I realized that I, too, have been hooked by the good stories and it opened my eyes a little more to marketing ploys that I hadn't even paid any thought to. Godin's examples of product story telling are very interesting. I really enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Stinks","review":"Really, I'm just lying.I was reading a blog I follow and All Marketers are Liars was recommended. Since I respect the blogger I had it in my Kindle that day. The author makes some great observations of companies we've all heard of. I took the information and extrapolated it my tiny Health Coaching business. That same week I was sharing my story with a colleague and without trying I framed it right into his world view and he offered to become my client. Thanks Seth! I appreciate your insight. I give it 4.5 stars - really!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More insight from the Patrick Henry of the grassroots marketing revolution","review":"The title is just messing with your head - but what really messes with your head is the premise of the book. Godin states that the real \\"liars\\" are the consumers. They are liars because of the stories that they tell themselves when making a purchase. The marketer is responsible for making sure his story matches the story of his target audience. The marketer is only a liar if he tells a false story to trick the audience.What's funny is that the book is not really about lying. It is about being transparent and authentic and not trying to trick your prospects into buying from you.This is a must read for not just marketing communication people, but also professional salespeople."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godin is Right","review":"I loved this book. Godin's premise is that consumers want to view themselves a particular way and good marketeers market to what consumers want to hear. For instance, the person who buys free range chicken and organic milk at Whole Foods thinks of him or herself as caring about the environment and human health and Whole Foods plays this up, even when selling vegan chocolate donuts. Book also talks about how marketing can be a true value added item for companies. As an American involved in global business, I found it somewhat comforting because America is still the leading marketer and there is nothing out there to indicate that will be changing soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive.Poorly organized. Fluffy.","review":"This book would have made a nice HBR article, if condensed into 15 pages. Alas, I had to force myself keep reading after the first chapter (which I read in the bookstore, and which made me buy the book in the first place)As many others have noted, the book is overly repetitive, poorly organized and generally has too much fluff in it, portraying a simple concept as a sacred marketing elixir... 4 points for the first chapter, minus 2 points for the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting concepts and facts, but there's gonna be more to the story","review":"Some interesting and eye-opening concepts, and a relatively easy read. However, the premise of telling 'stories,' which are essentially lies wrapped in 'authenticity' is exceedingly flawed. The true story is always the best and eternally effective, even if it doesn't drive short (or even long) term profits. Marketers have a responsibility to tell the truth, albeit in the form of a story or whatever language will reach the consumer. If your truth sucks, then reinvent your product/service, don't tell a lie and expect your authenticity to make it true...that's the essence of bullshit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for marketing geeks","review":"This is the first Seth Godin book I read and is one of his better ones. I've struggled with a lot of his later books as the riffs feel a bit disjointed. I think the reason I was able to read and enjoy this so much was that it was considerably shorter then Linchpin.I really enjoyed it. It helped me learn about the power of stories and how they apply to marketing. In writing this review, I actually think I need to re-read it because I know that my world-view has changed since I first read it 3 years ago.This is the type of Godin book that should be re-read at different stages of your business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godd read and on time","review":"Went on line to find this book after reading it recommended and it was at the right price but I wish it was on kindle.

This is a great read if you are marketing any product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read, but a good one","review":"I read this book in one day over a Christmas vacation. Most of the ideas in it seem intuitive to me, but they are explained in a way that is not necessarily the way I had thought of them before.If you have a business or are in sales, this book gives you insight into the psychology of marketing, in that your target audience already has a story in their head of how your product is going to work for them.Whether it actually does what they think it does, doesn't really matter, but if it does - then you will sell more to them.This books explains how to find who it is that is best suited to your product/service, and then how to best market to them (allow them to best view your product in their \\"story\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern day Hans Christian Anderson approach for grown ups.","review":"Marketing is all about winning trust and involves a piece of make believe. It's in the eye of the beholder. Seth boils marketing down to simple steps (in all of his books), and making it simple is needed in this complex world. Stories have been around for ages and they have a great impact as it allows for complex problem being told in simple terms. Seth gives many great examples in this book and is put some meat around the what and how, and keeps impressing with his easy readable books. Helpes to take difficult messaging and transform it into easy understandable stories. Its a look in the kitchen of the modern day Hans Christian Anderson, whom stories have been around for ages, but his messages still hold strong. Marketer are not liar (his title is his first lye:-), but definitely a catching title and worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't change the facts;can change the story","review":"You can't change the facts but you can change the story. A jury consultant's dead on advice to me, and it's a fundamental and universal truth(there are not that many). Godin gives us the whys in 172 pages: he explains frames(how we are pre-wired to believe certain stories); how our minds make sense of what they see by creating a story; how once are minds are made up(\\"the mind is never wrong\\" is another jury consultant gem) they kick into confirmation bias, accepting what fits, rejecting what doesn't. Godin clues us in in how to use these truths to persuade others, build a brand, create the buzz. Everyone who persuades needs to read his lucid and brief book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this. Easy to read.","review":"I like this book. I have no proper marketing education and this book helped me to understand some nowadays marketing problems. Not only understand but also find own solution to design and marketing own products.Book is easy to read. I was only sometimes confused by terms liar and lie. Author seems to have his own definitions of these words, but these have not been included in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this guy so popular?","review":"I find Seth Godin's books incredibly lightweight. There is really nothing of any substance here. The usual series of marketing anecdotes, normally about quite niche products. I think the whole thing can be summed up in the old advertising cliche: sell the sizzle, not the steak. He's just given it a new word - essentially he's dressing up well-worn concepts in new clothes. The book is poorly organised and repetitive, and I think he succeeds simply because his books are so lightweight - they're easily digestible on a bus ride or plane trip, don't rely on any support for his theories so they're not easily challenged, and essentially say very little. The marketing equivalent of the airport novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captivating title but......","review":"OK, I will start by saying I am always skeptical of business books because I always feel like they are telling us something we already know. AND EVEN if it is something I don't already know, is it necessary to have a 208-page book essentially saying the same thing over and over again? The book is chock full of anecdotes, but all point to the same conclusion: the product must tell a good STORY. And to be honest, I am not so sure I buy into the use of the word \\"story\\". But, in any case, the author beats it to death. This book could have easily been summarized in a 2-3 page pamphlet. I noticed one reviewer included some quotes, most of which came within a 20 page span. As a book of stories, it works OK, but I think I would prefer a book like \\"The Tipping Point\\" before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was fun to read...","review":"I really enjoy Seth Godin's way of writing. His books have always kept me turning the pages...And even opening up boxes. I know this is a business book, and heaven forbid we have fun with it, but All Marketers Are Liars is extremely fun to read. It's easy to digest, it has very clear points and you do not need a translator to decode the messages. A very good marketing resource!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first 3 chapters","review":"Great content. But most of it was in the first 1/3 of the book. Most of us probably wouldn't pay for a book the size it would be if it contained just the first three chapters of this book - but that's the part worth paying for and reading.The last two thirds of the books is a rehash - OVER AND OVER of the same points. And, I never really was sure what those points were.The \\"tell a story\\" concept needs to be embraced by marketers. Too bad so many trees had to die for whatever else Seth was trying to say but didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i hoped for","review":"blank and jones just simply did a bad job with robert smith on this. the original versions and the remixes are flat and boring. i won't blame robert on this, his vocals are obviously fine. blank and jones are just not up on whats good these days. their music sounds like something from the 1995 club scene. just nothing original, i have heard it too many times in the past to think this song is some stand out amazing track. if they did this track in 1995, then i would be impressed. so much more could have been done here. if robert smith collaborated with Gabriel & Dresden or Hybrid or even Paul van Dyk, this track would have been something worth playing. even though i am a cure fan (for 18 years now) i don't consider this to be worth adding to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert could have done this alone","review":"The song is ok, similar in style to what Robert did on \\"Mixed Up\\" just updated to the mid 90s. This CD was sold with a DVD that came with the video and an interview with blank & jones and Robert. In the interview, Robert explains why he did this track and the track with Junior Jack. The interview alone makes this EP worth adding to any Cure collection as these collaborations may be setting the direction for the next Cure album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"You get for what you pay...The lens is not sharp at all, even at higher F values. To closer you get to 2.8 the most you notice vignetting in the four corners of the photo and I judge this based on the fact I use a full frame camera, might not be the same with a 1/2 frame.

To me it's more of a pain in the @ss to try to get every single photo in focus and when I need to shoot action shots it's terrible because of the manual focus. When I bought it I thought it was autofocus. I am currently using this lens on a nikon D3100.On a good note, the lens has great boke and if you focus the subject correctly it's an ok lens. Just wished the description had said something that it doesn't have an autofocus motor built in. Well enough ranting for now, this is just my opinion anyways.

This product is composed of a lightweight material indicated in the product description. I was very happy about the loop that was located on the bottom of this garment bag because this loop allows for this bag to be easily doubled for convenient travel. In terms of protecting the garment, it performed admirably but I would recommend double bagging any delicate items for anyone that is concerned about providing additional protection for garments inside.

Rudy is stoic and undemonstrative, content to go to his dull job everyday while Trudi harbors a secret wish to see Japan, yet they are as close as two cabbage rolls on a plate. When she learns that he is dying, she arranges a trip to visit their children, but the kids are too busy to be bothered with them.This is a remarkable film about life and death and devotion. It moves slowly and gently and allows us to get to know the couple and their self-absorbed children. It deals with love and fulfilling one's dream and gave me a lot to think about. The story goes from Germany to Japan and is in German with English subtitles and much spoken English in the second half.The DVD cover calls this movie, \\"sublime,\\" and I agree. If you've experienced love and loss, this movie will touch you deeply. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty in both happiness and sorrow","review":"In our search for higher achievement we turn to educational knowledge and career, the security of a home, and control of our health and surroundings. Sooner or later we find ourselves in unexpected free fall when these attainments collapse from circumstances sometimes out of our control and sometimes simply because we refuse to see their true impermanence.Cherry Blossoms follows a German couple (the wife of Japanese nationality) who in losing their carefully constructed life style are yet able to reach an atonement, a sublime richness and depth of loving. Film, screenplay and acting are excellent in creating this beautiful story about inter-generational and cross-cultural mis-communications and emotional circumspection, all subtly revealing how playing-it-safe, keeps us from being open to the divine dance that life is."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible film","review":"After she learns of his terminal illness, Trudi convinces her husband Rudi to leave their rural Bavarian home and visit their far flung children. The film leads us slowly through lanes of mourning and regret as Trudi and Rudi discover how alienated they are from their children. Then, in a twist of fate, Trudi dies on the trip. Her loss awakens Rudi to aspects of his wife's life that she had suppressed to please him. Making the journey to Japan that she wanted and exploring the artistry of Butoh dancing, which she loved, he is poignantly connected to her at last. An incredible film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull book","review":"I like to read book and when I read this book, I learned many thing about astronomy, and I found this book very helpfull and easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise words for the aspiring photographer","review":"This book could also be called \\"Zen and the art of being a photographer\\".

Since the microphone slots directly into the hotshoe of the HV20/30, there's not much in the way of buffer to divorce it from any camera noise. I'm not just talking motor noise: any time you press a button on the camera to toggle settings, anytime you use the manual focus slider, anytime you shake the camera in the slightest...the mic picks up the noise. The makes for an absolute audio nightmare.So - if you plan to plop the camera on a tripod and not touch it whatsoever during filming, this microphone is a fine choice.

Such obviously incorrect assertions as the statement that ancient Celtic priestesses were known as Naiads (Greek water nymphs) and that the Morrigan was a \\"sea goddess of wisdom and beauty\\" (virtually all other sources state she was a goddess of war) make me wonder if the author simply didn't bother to do any research at all, or is just indulging in wishful thinking.

A. 9/13/10This was quite a read. I was drawn in and kept involved although the characters were not pleasant. Still, the training and harshness and character development was well crafted and believable. The writing was paced and thorough. I was rooting for them all even the trainer.The one thing that I could not let go was what happened to Sharon. Robert and Claudia were pampered compared to what Sharon went though. Even Brian was given fresh chances, but it seemed that from the outset there was a bias against Sharon. She was treated badly and given a cruel situation at the end. That left a bad taste.In all this was a good read.

Very well crafted story of one slave who is stuck in one role that she does perfectly and three wannabes who are really unpromising.

It's such a pleasure to read the books in this series, which are so far above the usual run of treacly soft-porn romance or sleazy dungeon fantasy that I hesitate even to mention them in the same paragraph.It's a tribute to Antoniou's excellent writing that she suspends the reader's disbelief entirely while constructing such a clearly imaginary world. The four main characters in this novel have depth, subtlety, and complexity, and they draw the reader in completely. The sex is hot, and there's plenty of it, but there's a whole lot more going on. Eat your heart out, Anne Rice.As a road warrior, I'm so happy this first book in the series has been made available for Kindle, and I have my fingers crossed that Kindle editions of the others will follow.

They all sound the same! The lyrics are just too rambling. If you skip to the middle of each song you can hardly even tell it's a different track.

Then at 0:19 that beat fades out and some other garbage starts... It's reused again at the chorus but the whole song just doesnt gel, it's like two different beats moulded as one. It's almost as if they had a pile of acapellas laying around they needed to find beats for and just slap it together and shipped it...Anyway if you're new to the underground scene, avoid this.

His favorites were the dog that got tossed into the drink off of Newfoundland, the big storm the ship experienced in I believe '44, and the time they were in port in the Azores and woke up to find a German submarine berthed near by to them. He thought very highly of the 1st Captain (Binford?). I think in general, he was pleased with the effort that Mary Kelly gave to this book.

The stand, while not exactly light, can still be fairly easily carried from place to place if needed. There are two issues that keep me from giving this stand five stars. 1) The flip-up stand is a bit flimsy, so while it supports a few pieces of paper well enough for reading, you can't take notes or write on them. 2) There are many sharp edges and compressible gaps which easily and painfully trap fingers -- you have to be careful whenever you manipulate this thing to avoid getting pinched.

Cast in the long shadow of Lawrance Thompson's three-volume diatribe against the modern titan, Meyers' work is balanced, judicious, and highly entertaining. It does not deny Frost's tragic shortcomings, but it also lauds his compelling and unique body of work and restores his eminence as a 20th- century virtuoso, all the while exposing the contradictions in the personal and moral life of the intellectual. The work is full of wonderful anecdotes and has unparalleled direct accounts of Frost's early courtship of his wife, Elinor, and of his later complicated relationship with his mistress, Kay Morrison. Meyers is especially adept at providing insight into the biographical events that shaped individual poems.

I actually ended up enjoying this movie, despite the fact that I'm not a big fan of Lawrence at all.The real star of the show, in my opinion, are the kids. Especially young 3-year-old Andrew (played by twins Preston and Trevor Shores). It's sad when the 3-year-old is the best actor. He stole the show for me.Reality is completely out the window on this one so don't expect anything that requires an IQ over 60.

People that the authors feel are marginalized: women, Olympic Athletes, and well, that's about all I could find.If you're embarrassed by middle-class women who portray themselves as being on the margins of society because of their gender, this book isn't for you.

I purchased this light due to reviews saying the VL-3 was not bright enough. However, this light is way too bright to not have tilt and swivel capabilities. Your subjects will always squint when this light is pointed at them.Also, this product does not interact with the advanced hot shoe, it only attaches there. This means there is no advantage of the Canon branded light over a 3rd-party/generic version.The cost of this light is based on the Canon name alone, because the quality construction is also poor. The battery does not firmly seat into the light so any sudden movement makes a loud clicking sound on your recording.If your lighting needs can be accomplised with the VL-3, purchase it. It is auto on and off and makes no sound on your recording.If you need a strong light, buy a 3rd party one with barn doors and tilt and swivel ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really compatable with Elura Camcorder","review":"I initially purchased this product because it was cross listed as an accessory on the page for the Elura camcorder.

Consequently, I'm returning it as not really suitable for the application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery not included","review":"I was very disappointed to receive this light and find that the battery, an apparently expensive Lithium Ion battery, is not included.

De Beauvoir is hardly extreme or radical; she simply advocates equality between the sexes... and who among us doesn't? How is this radical.Anyway, to get to the book, this book is not like \\"All Men are Mortal\\" or \\"The Second Sex\\" in that, there is less advocation and pontificating going on here (this is a neutral judgment, by the way). It is more straightforward fiction; I would liken it to a minimalization of Balzac's view for the French society: It captures three woman in sharp, short snapshots at specific points in lives.

The inside jokes are enough to make it good but Mickey takes it that extra step further and makes it great. A movie about a movie that takes great pleasure in poking fun at Actors, Actresses, Producers, Directors, cast and crew. The movie industry portrayed as the cutthroat, unscrupulous, painful industry it is. No one is left untouched. Even the writers get a jab when the \\"full of himself\\" star wants to change the script as he sees fit. A full-length feature full of Mickey Rourke makes this a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film is really great art.

This DVD is about a pair of interplanetary police agency, or something like that, that do their police work while wearing bikinis. In the four episodes they: save a prison warden, destroy a berserk robot, disarm a bunch of spoiled brats, and shut down a casino. Since this is old school anime, the graphics are not the best but OK, plots are adequate for 25-minute episodes. No explicit violence or nudity, so it's OK for kids. I would have given a 3-star rating if it wasn't for the jokes that the girls crack about each other constantly. Did I mention that they mostly wear bikinis!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Photos, Poor Content","review":"This is a fantastic source of images on the subject of fractals, but not a great source of learning. Most books on math and science are difficult for the general reader; few authors (like Isaac Asimov) can make complex things easily understood. But the author of this book is, in my opinion, doing the public a disservice by oversimplifying the subject. The explanations underestimate the public's ability to think, and even include a number of things which are either dead wrong or made-up! The subject of fractals is still new, and there are recently more books available to explain fractals to the general public. Again, this is a great source of images, if that's what you're looking for, but look for another source if you want to undersatnd and appreciate this incredible and important topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"This book says absolutely nothing. It has a few good pictures (the best one is one the cover by the way), but the text is utterly worthless and uninformative. My favorite quote from the book is \\"Nonlinear means not linear.\\" Really? Don't waste your money. Now I understand why I found it at the used bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"an easy to follow and lavishly illustrated guide","review":"I don't know enough about the mathematics of fractals to agree with the reader below who points out the author's lack of qualifications, but even with small mistakes like those, the book is a terrific introduction that requires no technical background. The author does an excellent job explaining not just how fractals were discovered and how to calculate them, but also how artists, writers, poets, and scientist use this information to explain and interpret the world around them. Most books I've read on fractals have a narrow focus. Also, with so many illustrations (this is a gorgeous book), layman explanations and far reaching applications, even the average reader can appreciate the beauty and power of fractals. I could not put it down and then had to start all over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible photos, but the author's a charlatan.","review":"With a degree in \\"Psychology/Aesthetics\\" from a school he won't name, the author has managed to read Scientific American articles and regurgitate them, calling himself a \\"science author\\". The new-age arm waving style of this book may be popular, but is quite hollow and often misleading.Statments such as: \\"A rice-grain-size ice crystal on an airplane wing will make it explode.\\" and references to a photon's length should not be printed since they are so incorrect. I suggest the author and the editor both sign-up for a physics class at their nearest community college before they attach the word \\"science\\" to their titles.Sincerely,Michael LeitchPhysics Teacher and Flight InstructorBerkeley, California"},{"rating":"1","title":"trying to sell it on ebay, waste of money","review":"I hate this bra. Over rated, terrible fit. The straps slip off and the cup size is definately not the size I am used to. I thought it would be perfect, but I only wanted it for the low back. I am now trying to re sell it on ebay. I am resorting to buying a bra that fits properly and is comfortable and buying a seperate strap adjuster for the back to make it a low back bra.

You will see the back if the top is any less that about 3 inches above your waist so super low items won't work with it. I have a keyhole back sweater and a u back t-shirt that I haven't been able to wear because I could never find a bra that fit. This one is pretty comfortable and I didn't fidget with it too much while wearing it. Let's face it, belly rolls happen when you sit and that front strap can move around some. It's adjustable though and does help anchor the back strap so it doesn't ride up. The support is excellent for a larger chest. I usually wear 36C, but ordered 34D on the recommendations and it was the right call, the cups might otherwise be too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy from IN THE MOOD INTIMATES","review":"This seller, \\"In the Mood Intimates,\\" is highly disreputable. I bought a matched bra and panty set, same color, as a gift. The bra was at a great sale price, the matching panty was at full price. The total, in excess of $100, qualified me for a $10 discount and free shipping.Twelve (12) days after receiving my credit card remittance, they shipped me the panty only, with no explanation as to the missing bra. Over the next three days, I left eleven (11) detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates, receiving no response. Finally, another nine (9) days later, I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock, and indicating their refusal to accept a return of the panty (even though its packaging is unopened) owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile, they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $10 discount.These people are dishonest.

I never tried clear straps before, and I found them to be too visible, so I ended up wearing a strapless bra with my dress. The straps also didn't stay adjusted properly - the clear straps just didn't have the right friction and the length adjustment would slide as I wore it. It is a relatively comfortable bra, but I have no idea what the belly strap is supposed to do. I have other bra's that fit just like this one with no stomach strap. It doesn't seem to hold the bra in place any better than any other bra's straps.

The material makes a big difference when you are not an A cup up top. I am a D, and this does not stay on me at all. The dress fits fine but there is no tension to hold the girls in. So it sits away from my body and every movement would make it so they fall out of the cups. Ordering a smaller size will not help, because the the 'bra part' like most higher quality pieces, isnt made of a separate fabric, since they wanted to make the back sheer. But, if all your going to do is lay down on you back in this, I can recommend it? Like all the other reviews, the stockings are pretty terrible as well, definitely get some pretty ones of your own.. or do yourself a favor and skip this one if you aren't small chested.other than that.. this is my bfs favorite color and for all my fussiness with it.. he still really loved it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This babydoll is perfect in every way.

Having used this product off an on for about a month I can say that I have noticed a difference in the color of the skin under my eyes. I think there would have been a greater difference if I had corrected my sleeping habits and applied the lotion twice a day instead of just when I go to sleep. This product however is by far the cheapest solution to dark eye circles and unlike most other product it can be easily obtained at a local drug store. Since I am young, I can't really comment as to its effectiveness on clearing wrinkeles but for those of you night owls out there who either dont get much sleep or spend a majority of your time looking at a tv screen, I would reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"I really don't have many wrinkles, bags, dark circles - have been blessesd at 62.

I actually get puffier using this product as well as the face products than I would with a good face cream. If you want to use this as a good exfoliant - that's ok.

There are ways to acquire real estate with little or no risk to the buyer and nothing up front invested. Allen is specific, detailing many creative deals he and others have made. His prose is readable and inspiring, making the book a fast and informative read.His credibility lies in this: to execute such deals requires research and cunning. \\"Sweat equity\\" in a sense, in negotiating a buy; replacing money with effort.

But this book is well thought out and the numbers do definitely make sense. I am a real estate investor as well as a property manager and own a brokerage. The key is once you buy the property, is to make sure you have good tenants who won't trash the place and put you in a bind if they leave in the middle of the night and you have literally thousands of dollars of damage. You have to not only buy right, but have the stamina to do the management, or hire a management company who can do a good job and you still can cash flow. You make money in real estate going into the sale! You hold on to equity by finding and keeping quality tenants. Definitely not pie-in-the-sky, but rather \\"do-able\\". And you need to pick your properties carefully and remember that location is everything.

Of course Tom Savini is the master of gore in my opinion and he doesn't disappoint in this film, is it gratuitous? Sure it is, isn't that why we watch a slasher or horror film to be shocked or scared ?

You have to like these type of films from the time period. Wierd, violent, gore, cheesy/some humour. The gore effects by Tom Savini are great! Acting is ok, typical for 81'. Film creates nice surreal atmosphere. I've seen every version/format of this film. Blu./unrated is best but, consider the source. Blu is best visually for being low budget movie. Sound/extras are also good.Story is pretty easy to sum up...crazy guy in city hunts women-kills women and who ever is in the way- takes scalps/souveniers and places them on series of mannaquins in apartment- he believes the mannaquins are alive - they may be!?! So, if you are a fan of 70's/80's horror, gore, violence, exploitation films, independent low budget, Tom Savini f/x, cult-classics, and a horror movie that is more realistic (villian has no super powers) - this blu-ray version is a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult Horror","review":"I wish it had been mentioned somewhere that this would be considered cult horror...and not good cult horror at that.

This movie doesn't hold up and it appears very dated as it is. The premise is promising, but I felt the film progressed too slowly at times. The suspense wasn't there enough to keep me on edge. Joe Spinell's acting was good enough but it couldn't save this one. The two more memorable moments on this DVD are the scene where Frank Zito surprises a couple in a car by jumping on the hood and taking the driver's head off wth a shotgun at near point blank range. Well done, that's the kind of shock value and special effects I expected from this film. The other positive is in the special features section, where there's a Bio piece on star Joe Spinell that I truely found to be more interesting than the movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Spinell really must be this creepy!","review":"Oh, finally I got my grubby hands on this masterpiece! What a disturbing film! This sort of thing is why I watch horror. Maniac tells the story of a truly sick individual. As other reviewers have said though, what sets this apart is the performance of Spinell and the whole narrative structure. This is not merely another slasher flick - it's a study of an individual whose evil nature takes control of his, seeminly at times against his will.Hearing this maniac breathing and grunting as he's watching his potential victims was probably more disturbing than the violence - and their's plenty of it here for the gorehounds (thank you Mr Savini!) and the shotgun scene is, well, a blast!Reminded me of other classic serial killer films such as \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Henry\\" and deserves to be in any serious horror film lovers collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW IT ALL STARTED","review":"If there were no Maniac there would possibly be no slashers that we know and love today. The whole genre started after this one. And I mean not those stupid kill-them-all flicks but serious thrillers that try to penetrate murderer's mind and also to play some of your own strings. Joe Spinell is brilliant, Tom Savini's effects are very good especially for that time (after scalping and head-shot scenes you'll want to rewind and see how it was done). And it's the atmosphere that will leave you meditative for the rest of the day (or night). It's so claustrophobic and sociopathic you'll actually feel yourself in maniac's skin by the end.Also there's a very good documentary on Joe Spinell in this DVD edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"movies that rock!!!","review":"I love this movie.

Joe Spinell's performance is truly remarkable... must be seen to believe. i think the greatest thing about the movie is that you're focused completly on Joe Spinell(our maniac), it isn't the usual serial killer story about a cop trying to solve a murder case kinda thing... the story gets very deep into the world of this very disturbed individual. this film has scenes which you wont see in no other films, not even in Henry: portrait of a serial killer... a highly recommended film for all fans of psychological thriller and ofcourse gore fans(the film sfx were made by none other than tom savini). but there's more to it than just gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maniac","review":"I am the niece of the late Joe Spinell and I played \\"Denise\\" in the film.

I was let down as Maniac is nothing more than a cheap exploitation serial killer bio-pic.This is not your typical slasher as it is told from the first person, in this case it is mamma's boy played by Joe spinnel. He's whiney and obsessivley crazy, probably the most annoying antangoinst ever.Granted there is the infamous 'point blank shotgun' scene but other than that, there is no entertainment value to this film unless you're a misgonistic lunatic. I was hoping the only saving grace to this film would be gratutious nudity but there is none thus not even making a true exploitation film.Avoid this title like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed up and confused","review":"I'll preface by stating that I am generally a huge fan of schlocky B horror films.This movie has some decent gore and sick murders, but the premise is muddled and follows no logical order. The reason we are given for the Maniac's craze seems tacked on. There is no evidence to support it throughout the entire film. If there was more exposition it might have come out better but all we get is a poorly acted nutcase going around killing people with a quick \\"this is why\\" at the end.The acting is mediocre, the story is lacking, the writing sucks. The worst part is watching with the director's commentary. He seems to think he was creating a gift to the genre and the entire film industry. He is dead wrong. Usually when I find a DVD in the $5 bin I can forgive it no matter how bad it is.

This is the unrated version so I am curious as to what the \\"R\\" rated version would have been like. There were maybe one or two really good gore scences that is even worth watching, however it did not turn my stomach. I personally thought Final Destination 2 had more of a gore factor than this did.

A complete disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top Notch Drama Covered Entirely in Blood and a PerfectDVD","review":"Maniac is a unique film that depicts the lows and highs of a serial killer. The film is dramatic by means of the relation of killer and his mother. On the other hand, the movie is full of gore and blood.This limited edition DVD set is beautifully packaged! It contains the standard DVD release and as a bonus, the set includes the original Score CD which is shaped as the killer's head.The animated menus, extras on the DVD are perfect. As a plus, Anchor Bay's edition contains an all-new Joe Spinell featurette. It is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Blu-ray Transfer I've Ever Seen","review":"This review is not for the film itself, which I believe you either love or you hate. Its also not for the copious supplemental material included, which is phenomenal if you enjoy a lot of extras. Its for the quality of the Blu-ray transfer, which is honestly the worst I have ever seen. Perhaps the 16 mm source material is simply not appropriate for the high definition format. The picture is full of murky blacks, persistent grain, milky picture and very little appearance of anything \\"high definition\\". At best, the soundtracks has a lot of punch and is spotless and aggressive.

This guy can certainly play the blues, but the instruction is limited. There is almost no slow motion of the fingering and not a mention of what notes are being played. Video quality is excellent, but it is filmed from the right and left sides of the keyboard (no overhead shot) and the keys are often obscured from view. Add to that frequent switching of the viewing angle and it's almost impossible to follow what's being played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Balsa for my project.","review":"There is not much to say about Balsa wood, other than it is just what I needed for my project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as a reference, poor as an introduction.","review":"James has distilled the magically useful material from Dee's often-obscure diaries and presented it in organized form, creating an \\"Enochian grimoire.\\" However, some of the material was not delivered in the order in which James presents it, and there is little historical or background information.

I like it. It's mellow then upbeat, all the while exploring various musical and emotional climaxes and nadirs. Literally, it's a CD for you to play on the car ride home time and time again. It's also consistent; if you don't like to buy CDs because you're afraid of \\"filler\\" (other songs on the album not as good as or not even similar to the single) you don't have to worry about it with Josh Kelley.

You can hear his Southern influence in ��Angeles�� and fully appreciate his ability to create musical mood in ��Faces.�� Overall, his mellow guitar riffs and soulful lyrics make for a joyful and relaxing experience reminiscent of John Mayer or Jack Johnson.

I'm a John Mayer fan, and I can definitely see similarities between these two artists in Kelley's first CD. Coincidentally, John Alagia (who produced for Mayer) also produced this CD. But enough about John Mayer; Josh Kelley can stand on his own. His songs are very relaxed and easy to listen to, and Kelley also has a likable voice with just the right amount of Southern warmth. His lyrics are sensitive and deliberate. I recommend this album for anyone who wants something new and laid back. And the title seems very fitting; the thirteen songs all link together in a nice combination that would be perfect for \\"the ride home.\\" I suspect that we will soon be inundated with young guitar-playing, singer-songwriters, but Kelley definitely has promise and he's just pleasant to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh, aint THAT great","review":"when i first bought this cd, i was so excited cuz i heard it was such a good cd. however, i was very disappointed. i , personally, do not think this cd is good at all. i'll admit, 'amazing' and 'home to me' are ok. every other song just seems to kind of drag along. this cd lacks catchy beats and upbeat tempos, so it seems kinda slow. i really wish i had spent my money on something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't actually have this CD, but i have a reccomendation...","review":"I haven't bought this CD yet, but i'm planning to, he's got a john mayor vibe, and something else...but i wanted to say that if you like Josh Kelly, and a little bit of Dave Mathews, you'd probably like my brother's cd...he's just an ordinary guy, but he's trying to make it in the music world, and he's got a lot of talent and deserves it.

If you like soft rock music with some country pop influence you have to listen to this album. You can preview the album at joshkelley.com.

I was somewhat uneasy when I first heard about it, but now I can't put it down. The first hit single is titled \\"Amazing\\" and it really is. You can pop this album into your car and play it for days. It never gets old or annoying. All the songs are good songs, my favorite is \\"Everybody wants you\\" which is the most original and best track on the album by far. I also fell in love with the song \\"Home to me\\" which expresses his vocals greatly. This album is for the true music lover, who can understand all types of musical expression. There are also no songs that are just there to take up space, they all are good songs. I prescribe this to anyone who is suffering from headaches due to half the crap the industry is producing.

It's outlook on life is flowery like you would tell a child but lacks the real world as it's defece. This is a book for troubled youth, for someone overcoming an assult and needs something overly simplistic and nice on the rebound. My belief is that the world doesn't fit in the box presented by this book. I also didn't like the little bells and whistles through this book it's like a web sight with to many sponsers, anamated pictures with little comments through the entire book which do nothing but distract the reader.

I was disappointed with John Travolta's performance as a big, tall alien. He despised human beings and thought the alien race was superior. Boy, was he wrong! You mess with Barry Pepper, you will have ten layers of glass broken and eat rats! This is possibly the worst thing ever made. Maybe you can put Chucky the doll with John Travolta's alien and you'll have the ultimate movie. Humans can't fly and why are they wearing rags? It's supposed to be the future?

It was a seventies screenplay dropped into 90's special effects.

The movie is just such a mess I can't imagine where to begin. I rented it on the impression that it would be bad, so as not to give myself unrealistic expecations. I'd heard it was bad. But, how bad could it really be? Would John Travolta sign up for such a sorry screenplay? Yes, folks, he would. He did. This movie IS as bad as people say it is. Like I said, it's a mess.

But the way he adapted the story to the time constraints of a movie were very inventive. And they worked! I would have ordered this DVD just for the movie, but the extras make it impossible to resist. Everybody should buy this movie. It is going to be talked about for years to come.

While I was watching the movie, it saddened me to see that they covered the first 100 pages in the first 10 minutes of the movie. The movie takes place in the future where an alien race takes over the earth to mine certain minerals from the ground. Travolta plays a disgruntled alien security advisor that is looking for a way off the wretched planet Earth. Barry Pepper plays one of the few remaining humans on the planet. The movie is slow, jumps about from one thing to another. It really didn't do anything for me. The acting was really poor as well, and I wonder why Travolta even agreed do such a thing. The book was such a wonderful story. It had a great message about humanity and hope. This movies destroys all of that and replaces it with abnoxious jokes and a few loud explosions.

But how do you condense a 1,000-page epic into a 90 minute movie?The script basically leaves some of the bones of the book in place but put in such ridiculous changes as to make the movie utterly, laughably unbelievable. For example, a raid on the main Psychlo city that involves months of planning and training humans to use gee-whiz equipment is condensed into a meager 1 week!Battlefield Earth would have been far better, actually as a true to the book Anime, with 24 or perhaps 48 (two seasons) episodes.A damn shame.

The more I thought about it however, I realized that no screenplay could take that much plot, character development, story and action and put it into a move lasting less than 20 hours. The movie adaptation is therefore no surprise. It leaves the viewer: - Laughing at the absurd coincidences that the humans fall into. Ex) 1000 old US Airplanes that still fly. - Mortified by the lackluster story. - With no sympathy for the humans struggle to survive due to NO character development. - With no fear Terl or appreciation of his capacity for evil - Absolutely no understanding of the aliens inhabiting earth - On and on and on .....

I frankly don't care what the actors or director have to say about it (unless it's something in the way of an apology). As a Sci-Fi fan, I took it on myself to see the movie when it was in theaters.

I even own two Ed Wood movies. But Battlefield Earth is the most profoundly bad motion picture I've ever seen in my entire life. So bad that even my prodigious capacity for the appreciation of awful science fiction isn't great enough to allow me to enjoy it from a campy, unintetional comedy standpoint. It's just excruciatingly painful - like an H-bomb in a volcano.The fact that this abomination didn't immediately and irretreivably end the careers of everyone associated with it from John Travolta and Forrest Whittaker to the key grip and caterer is both perplexing and disappointing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most badly made big budget movie ever made.","review":"ENDLESS OPTIONS FOR RENEWAL,ENDLESS OPTIONS FOR RENEWAL,ENDLESS OPTIONS FOR RENEWAL.

I was astounded by the bad acting, the forced lines, and the way that the actors themselves seemed none too thrilled to be in the movie. The high point, for me, was Forest Whittaker's character.

The alien Psychlos are much more interesting than the heroic human characters. When the story revolves around the duplicitous Psychlos, the movie is actually fun. One does need an enormous suspension of disbelief to accept this movie as serious science fiction. So forget that. But as a send up, probably unintentional, it stands alongside \\"Independence Day.\\" I enjoyed the movie. It is fun in spots, terrible in others and borders on boring in the last quarter.

In this he has nothing to do but laugh every 30 seconds and to call Barry Pepper \\"Rat Brain\\" - yes, \\"Rat Brain!\\" through most the movie.

Translating the novel's alien characters to parodies of human actors may have been a practical and artistic necessity (after all, earth's atmosphere was instant poison to the aliens, requiring full breathing masks - not the hospital-like enrichment tubes of the movie - and they were much taller and more massive than humans).For one who has enjoyed rereading the novel several times, the movie was an acute disappointment.

Forget the \\"awesome\\" special effects and tired post-Blade Runner my-kid's-messy-room production design and immerse yourself in the patently ridiculous plot, dialogue, makeup, and characterizations (especially Travolta's).

The characters were flat and some were not at all as written. Most of the characters in the book never made an appearance in the movie. The plot had only the vaguest resemblance to the book.I wondered how they could make a good movie from a book that is 1050 pages long. Now I know they just took the name and trashed the rest.

Strangely enough, he seems to pull out modest hits occassionally. This is not one of them.His choices of movies to star in are dubious, definitely hit and miss. More miss than hit.

I suspect that Hollywood's rather patronising view that a couple of loud bangs and a spaceship or two is all it takes to satisfy a Science fiction film fan had a lot to do with it.

The first point is that it is not original. The supposedly \\"special effects that are completely real\\" ain't. (The ruined cities looked, for the most part, like cheap matte shots.) Finally, John Revoltin' Travolta is so strange looking that the fear that hostile aliens should create is lost.

It wsa very cool to see behind the secenes shotsand interviews from the people involved with the movie. I also liked the movie itself--it is true Sci-Fi.

Rarely has a film come along that has less going for it than this one. It has no redeeming qualities in any category.

Am I right?Did anyone else have an old Buick with a dragging muffler that sounded like those space ships? And of course, the miracle of savages learning to pilot fighter planes like Chuck Yeager! From spears to joystick. Amazing! And God bless the director. Apparently allowing John and the boys to go get hammered in the morning and do the acting stuff in the afternoon. I think it must have been ghost directed by Kevin Cosner.John and Forrest: we fans forgive you! After Pulp Fiction and The Crying Game you guys have earned at least a couple of stinkers each.

A major-release movie this bad comes out pretty much every year. The best parts are John Travolta's legendary performances and the numerous, hilarious wipes. I was waiting for them to pull out the star wipe, but alas, twas not to be. Still, ridiculous though it is, it wasn't boring, which is the only utterly fatal flaw a movie can have. What can I say, I went to see this movie with a group of friends and we had a good time. True, we were laughing at the movie rather than with it, but that's more than you can do for some films. 'Dungeon & Dragons' for example.Grade: F"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prejudice Against this film?","review":"I found this film to have a strong plot and a story involving humans, unlike much science fiction. The only reason so much derision, and intial floppiness to this could have come is due the story being written by Scientology founder L RON HUBBARD, and the sense it is a tribute to him. Does this mean L RON HUBBARD never wrote a good story.L Ron Hubbard, like Joseph Smith was a con-man who made things up on the fly and manipulated people for his ego. However, the film makers of BATTLEFIELED EARTH set out to make a good film and did so,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing redeming in this one. A stinker.

Excellent DVD","review":"When I saw this in theatre, I have absolutely no idea what's going on in the movie. Seems like the movie jump from one scene to another like bad editing. So when I got a used DVD that is real cheap, I decided to give it another try. Well, I still don't like the movie but the DVD itself is great. The Dolby 5.1 is excellent and so is the picture transfer. Director Roger Christian provided a commentary track. I would suggest you listen to it even if you hate the movie. It is really insightful. The plot about earth that is enslaved by Alien race. The Alien general is played by John Travolta with heavy make up. Barry Pepper (the sniper from Saving Private Ryan) is the hero. Like I said earlier the story is confusing but I really think that is because of poor editing.

She also had some great solo albums and this is her third. First of all, it is very hard to top her excellent \\"Mahogany Soul\\" album from 2001, but Angie tries her best with great tunes like 'Come Home', 'Karma' and 'You Don't Love Me'. Although I personally don't care for 'That Kind of Love' with Betty Wright and Floetry saves 'My Man' from being another rehash of 2001's 'Brotha', this is still another great album from Angie. She gets better with every release, which is more than I can say for the Mary J.

Soem cds say \\"Content protected\\". When a cd is labeled as \\"Content protection\\", usually it includes SunnComm MediaMax Version 5 content protection software that may expose security vulnerability when played on PCs and usually you can make small amounts of copies to cd-r's and I-pods or other digital music players. but this is \\"copy protected\\". I can't even transfer it onto cassette. And from my understanding, every international release of this album except Japan, also is copy protected. I know that the music industry is trying to cut down on Piracy but I feel that once you purchase a cd, it's yours and you should be able to do whatever you want with it. I don't think it was fair that I had to buy this twice : once on cd form and the other on I Tunes. I am against music piracy but I'm also against copy protecting cds.

I love Angie, she is one of my favorite singers. But this isn't her best album, in my opinon. It was great and I really enjoyed it but its kind of hard to top two great albums, and she came really close. I really love Mahagony Soul(best album) and Black Diamond.

The feeling in the voice and phrasing - incredible. I am a HUGE Aretha fan and for another female artist to have me playing her disk as much as I do the Queen's...well that's got to be good for me do that. I want to Thank Ya gets the disk going and puts you in a good mood. The tracks with Anthony Hamilton and Floetry are great too.

The woman has a direct line to the old school SOUL vibe and she turns it on better than anybody!!! There's only 2 tracks on here that I sometimes skip over, but the rest of the CD is so fantastic, so smooth and so enjoyable that I just have to represent with 5 stars. Angie Stone is the bomb.My favorite cuts are..U-Haul, Remy Red, I Wanna Thank You, Stay for a While (with Anthony Hamilton), Karma, Cinderella Ball'n and Lover's Ghetto. Every damn one of them songs is a classic!!Miss Stone, my hats off to you. You brought it for real this time. Excellent!!!And don't forget to pick up SALT by Lizz Wright.

This album contains field recording that Mr. Krause made in Kenya and Rwanda, combined with music of his own creation. Admittedly, the title might make you think that this is a collection of music from Africa, as it did me. In fact, like all of Mr. Krause's music, it's entirely written by him, inspired by the sounds and his experiences in collecting them.Overall, I found it to be a nice, relaxing album. It's mood music, entertaining and pleasant to listen to. I didn't really have any expectations when I first popped in the CD, and as such it didn't disappoint me.

Bad idea. These discs are just tiny flimsy little things and they don't stick very well. The quantum canker patches last for hours and hours while these little things will come off within less than one hour. It doesn't feel like it's doing anything except sticking to my mouth. There's no healing or anything going on. I've been using these for days, but nothing's been happening. Yes, I get temporary relief while I have it on, but then it falls off and it hurts again.

I'd say they last at best 45 minutes, whereas Canker Covers last an entire night's sleep. And while Canker Cover adheres almost instantly, Canker Melts must be held on--and kept dry--for about a minute to adhere, and even then they tend to fall off. The only advantage these have is that they can go somewhere visible, like your inner lip. Canker cover is too big and gloopy for that. Other than that, these are so-so short term relief at best and I see no reason to buy them over Canker Covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"There is nothing more painful and disgusting then having a canker sore.

It has never come undone by itself and has saved my camera from falling many times.My only issue with the strap is that while the necklace is metal, the loop that you fold the necklace through to connect it to the camera is still thread. The thread has not failed, and it shows no signs of wear, but I was still hoping that there would be no vulnerable surfaces.Despite the one personal preference issue, this is a high quality product and I fully recommend it as a safeguard to protect your camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and durable strap","review":"I have been looking for this metal strap for a couple of months.

So I thought it would be a good idea to buy Volumes 1-4 for my daughter, who's two-and-a-half years old.She hated it.The show begins with Topo Gigio conversing with an older gentleman, sort of the interchange Johnny Carson had with Ed McMann...that goes on for several minutes and gets monotonous quick. Then it switches to Topo Gigio doing some cutesy skits.I've seen my daughter disinterested in some children's videos, this is the first one that actually made her cry. I think it's just too outdated compared to modern fare.If you're a diehard Topo Gigio fan and want this as a collectible or to reminisce, it's fine.

I was very disappointed with the quality of not only the house, but the furniture as well. For the quality, it is very overpriced. The dining room table and chairs are so flimsy and cannot stand normal play as they keep collapsing and the actual house itself will tumble over if your child so much as bumps it. The shower curtain rod keeps falling off of the side and the bassinet's parts keep coming off. Even with all the sounds, I still don't think it is worth the money and I am taking this back and purchasing the upright barbie dollhouse as the house and furniture are made of wood; I'm hoping it will be a lot more sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the Gasaraki series but this vol. flopped","review":"What can I say, volume 6 was not the quality I expect from the gasaraki series. The voice acting, sound effects, and surround quality were much worse than the preceding five volumes. I have come to expect a certain level of quality and depth of story/character in the series and this one just doesn't meet it. On the other hand, it is nice to see everything come together. The plan to rid Japan of the Chinese immigrants is now getting into swing but none of this is news. They took advantage of an interesting situation that took some intelligence to dream up (on the part of the writers) but nothing was really treated with the depth and detail that it usually is in this series. I expected more details on the grain shortage, Miharu didn't say a word, and they found refuge with some Chinese mafioso.... but the acting was piss poor. This vol. seems more like something they just had to get out of the way so the story could proceed to it's climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"Go to a local jewelery shop.

I was also afraid it'd end up being too expensive to justify.But this book convinced me I could do it, and without breaking the bank. I even used the book to convince a couple of friends to go in with me on the tools and materials, so we can share the costs. We figure if a \\"Dummy\\" can do it, then we can.Great stuff.

This was luther's finest diatribe (he said he thought more clearly in a state of anger). luther fought tooth and nail with rome's representative, disiderus erasmus.

Luther's main argument- that human will is bound and captive to sin and that we are unable to experience salvation apart from God's grace made manifest in the death of Jesus on the cross- is dead on. Even as a Wesleyan/Arminian thinker, I found Luther's view compelling, though I believe what Luther argues here extremely compelling. More to the point, the essential debate underneath between Luther and Erasmus is still with us, albeit with some twists, today.The personal attacks on Erasmus are foreign to modern academic theological argumentation, but those who engage in blogging or Facebook groups will completely \\"get\\" the spirit behind it.In short, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware the transalator","review":"Be aware that this is the Henry Cole transalation, not the J.

With modern man's insistence on their own dominion over their own destinies, it is good and necessary to examine the scriptural evidence to the contrary. The question is, as fallible humans, are we going to place our trust in how things feel to us, or in the infallible, unshakeable Word of God? May we return the glory to Him unto whom it is due!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for a right understanding the of the human will.","review":"Late in his life, Luther commented that of all he had written, there were only two works which did not need revision: his children's catechism and his Bondage of the Will. This is Luther at his best, systematically debunking the great Erasmus' arguments for the freedom of the human will. It is a must read for those struggling with the sovereignty of God and the freedom of the will. The introduction by Packer and Johnson alone is worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, but not easy reading","review":"This book is a \\"must-read\\" for the growing Christian. It lays out the basis of our salvation and our faith in Christ.However, it is probably not a book to read while lying by the pool. You must spend extra time reading it in ordert to comprehend the author's (and translator's) meaning. It's the type of book that's easy to get frustrated with and simply put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hardest, most honest album I've heard in a long while...","review":"Yeah, the comaprisons to Nirvana are obvious. But it's only in their tonality that Officer May sound like that classic grunge troupe. These guys have their own song structure, their own raw energy, their own discordant equilibrium. Their songs are tight, quick, and to the point. Plus, they're willing to make mistakes in the studio and release them for the world to see. Raw, untapped, pure, honest. This is an album that clearly represents a band certain for future greatness. The album has the feeling of a live show about it, and that's where a lot of its strength comes from. Definitely, if you're into harder, cutting edge rock that isn't your typical college blah-blah-blah whining and moaning, if you're into something with sensitivity without self-effacement, if you dig good hardcore power trio noise, sweat, and eardrum damage, then you gotta pick up this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing Tradition Of More Great DBZ!!","review":"This is another great DVD of Dragon Ball Z, entering the third chapter of The Frieza Saga. For those that have been following DBZ on DVD for the last 60+ episodes, you'll be excited to know that on this disc the action-packed epic 30 episode long battle with Frieza finally begins. While the dubbed English voices are still really cheesy, (most likely because Funimation is now handling the dubbing, rather than Pioneer, that handled it on the first 17 volumes), thankfully you can watch the original Japanese version with english subtitles. I noticed major differences in the dialogue between the two versions is different - nothing major - the main points are still made, but sometimes scenes in English look a little awkward with the made-for-american-TV dialogue. This is still lots of fun, thought - and addicting as ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"Tropic of Cancer, the book is filled with titillating imagines, it flows uneven at times but somehow remains focus. Our little movie here is like a dream of the book. Clouded and fuzzy, but still titillates. Henry Miller was alive with the soul of an angel, disguised in the body and mind of a scoundrel. I believe if you love his work, you'll appreciate this movie. It's uneven, to be sure, the dialog drifts apart at times. However, you will enjoy the moments of recognition and taste the infatuation with life, even when faced with despair. Of course Henry and June, the Kaufman Movie is superior, however, it's the uneven parts of ToC that remind one of HM's Books. Life is uneven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie","review":"I was reading Ellen Burstyn's autobiography and I wanted to see her in one of her first movie roles.

Go to the store and test it out first2. Bring your baby along for the ride3.

The front wheels have fallen off more than once when popping it up from the collapsed position. When the handle is reversed, it is really hard to walk without kicking the wheels, and it is extremely hard to steer.Even with the handle in the correct position, I often feel like I am pushing a shopping cart with messed up front wheels.

I don't think that it will last for the years it is meant to."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT OUTDOOR STROLLER","review":"This was our first stroller purchase, and I ordered it online without even testing it first. I studied the product description over and over. No regrets whatsoever. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stroller. We use it almost everyday with trips to the park, or for exercise type walks or relaxing walks. I love the reversable handle. If the sun is in their eyes, you can easily turn it around. Today, it was the cold wind on his face, and it was great being able to turn my son so that he was facing me. Also, the handlebar height saves my back!! Great for taller parents, even shorter ones, since you can adjust the handle bar. Would buy this stroller again, without a doubt. FIVE STARS!!!!
