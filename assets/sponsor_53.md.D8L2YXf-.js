I just finished the book and am still shaking my head. What was she thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"why is she a best seller??","review":"Catherine Coulter, either needs to become a romance writer or a mystery writer, but she tries to combine the two, and it doesn't work. I would not reccommend this book to anyone that likes a well written mystery, but would reccommend it to those that enjoy a book that has unrequited love, 9 unsuccessful murder attempts, and foolish unbelievable FBI agents."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing Coulter - what a shame.","review":"At first as I was attempting to read Hemlock Bay, I thought I was just allowing other things to distract me and therefore causing me to lose the flow of the book. I kept reminding myself of how much I had enjoyed reading every other Catherine Coulter book - especially the suspense series involving the FBI characters. But, I finally had to admit, that this one was just not up to Coulter's usual style. Hopefully, she will put this one behind her, and return to her usual style.I'm still wondering about those \\"Ghouls\\" and Tammy or was it Timmy's acts of illusions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm really glad I read the other 5 in this series before I got to this one. Chances are that if I hadn't I would not have bothered to go back and read the others. The characters personalities seemed very childish to me in this book. I didn't feel that a lot of effort and thought went into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Stinker","review":"What a waste of time and money. This is one of maybe 5 books I've refused to finish in my life. It's disconnected, scenes are not realistic, feel completely false, and nothing about it kept my interest. The editing is very sloppy, in one place, after the evil Tammy has her arm amputated and escapes from the hospital to murder again, Ms. Coulter has her \\"rubbing her bloody hands together\\". Maybe it was a misprint, is should have had her \\"rubbing her bloody HAND together\\", being as she only had one. Immediately following was an unbelievable interaction between Savitch's sister, an art dealer, and an art forger. That did it. I closed it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hemlock Bay","review":"I paid full price for this hardcover book and feel must warn others who have read/liked other Catherine Coulter novels. There is no way to say this nicely...THIS BOOK IS AWFUL! The dialogue is stilted, the plots (there are two) are so far fetched as to be unbelievable and there is no character development. Even the physical discriptions of her recurring characters are inconsistent with the previous novels. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"In one word \\"silly\\".","review":"I want take up a lot of time with this review, enough was wasted reading the book. Obviously there was little research done. Example: Show me a permit department that has maintained drawing of an old barn somewhere in the country side, for fifty years. A husband and wife team working as FBI partners in the field.Some statements seemed to be thrown in at the most inopportune times. Example: During a heavy interrogation of Tenyson, the author goes into the woody flavor of a dinner wine served.Another great statement by Lily's brother Savich and sister in-law Sherlock: Oh! by the way, those pictures our grandma left us are worth a million apiece and you have eight. Lily is a thirty year old artist herself, but is shocked at this. Lily is not smart but a very good fighter. Just a couple of days after having her spleen removed, she beats up an attacker that is trying to kill her with a knife.I know this book is fiction but get real.

What a waste of time! I did not like this book at all. I kept thinking maybe a child wrote it under her name! The dialogue seemed too trite at times and did nothing to enhance character development. I also thought she couldn't quite decide which plot to develop, so the two of them just dragged along. It was tough for me to keep reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Coulter, Where are you?","review":"After reading Coulter's other modern mysteries, I couldn't wait to read this one. Boy, was I ever disappointed! While I usually enjoy her characters, especially Dillon and Sherlock, no one had any depth in this poor excuse for a mystery. The characters appeared and then left without much ado. Frankly, after awhile I wished the book would magically disappear. I feel upset at myself for finishing her book because Coulter left her readers feeling unfulfilled right up to the last page. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME READING IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, how could you read this?","review":"Ok, actually I did read this. But only because I feel a warped sense of loyalty to Catherine Coulter whom I've been reading since I was 13. Her early historicals were good, particularly The Sherbrooke Bride series. (This does not mean you Mad Jack!)Her dialogue and analogies just get worse and worse and her character development, always shallow, is deplorable. I guess it's mainly her dialogue that gets me...ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hemlock Bay","review":"It has been quite awhile since I ordered this book and my understanding is that Clearbook has had some problems with someone who stole their identity. They did email me back and I gave them my name & address but still have not received the book. I believe I said I would wait but over a month is too long. I may ask them for a refund or at least send me my book. I know it is not their fault but I had to email them to find out the status. Otherwise all of the other books I ordered came in a timely manner. Louise Heyza"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed","review":"Admittedly, I'm a Coulter Fan and this book in the FBI series adds still another layer to the continuing saga of Sherlock & Savich. The whole cast of characters comes alive in this story of Savich's sister. And, of course, justice prevails. This was the only one of the FBI series that I hadn't read - because I couldn't find it. And in retrospect, by missing it I missed part of the layering of stories. A good excuse to re-read the stories. There is just the right amount of tension, humor and romance to entertain anyone who likes to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hemlock Bay is poisonous to a readers mind","review":"Don't waste your time on this one.There is not one likeable character in this book.Dillon is perfect, Sherlock (and what's w/that name?)is the only woman who has ever given birth to a perfect child.Simon Russo is smart,sexy and oh yes, he was once married, but divorced and was she a secretary? Of course not, she's now a 2 star general.And Dillon and Lily's Mom. She's dating a garbageman,right? No way, he's a U.S. Congressman (thank God we didn't get both of them in the book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This is NOT a mystery. This is a romance masquerading as a mystery. I hated it; I gagged over Nick-n-Nora, aka Dillon and --would you believe? -- Sherlock; I quit reading it about halfway thru. I truly dislike those romance novelists who are trying to parlay a rep in that genre into one in my escape genre of choice, mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I get it.","review":"Finally, it clicks: the reason I liked Coulter's historicals but couldn't plow through even half of the last two contemporary suspense novels. (And I do mean the last.)First and foremost, it's the stilted dialogue. Nobody talks like this, people; not in this millenium and not in the previous half-century, unless we count \\"See Dick run. Run, Dick. Run.\\" In period novels, it's easier to suspend disbelief. But when the setting is here and now, the same style comes across as bad writing.I wanted to like these books; I swear I did. Coulter's historicals filled many a rainy afternoon with what I thought was high-camp fun - a satirical take on the genre. Now I see that what I thought was satirical was not. The joke was on me.BTW, when you have to describe a character as witty, she probably isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your hard-earned money","review":"I picked this book up at the library on the day they received it, since it was on display at the entrance of Borders so must be good, right? Wrong. I have never written a review before but just felt that this book was so bad that I wanted to save people the time and effort of getting it. The only reason I finished it was because it was the fastest read I have ever seen, since the language was so insipid that it was as if a high school student had written it for an English project. The two unrelated and poorly resolved plots,were not believable at all, and one kept hoping that something would happen, but nothing ever did. The author jumps back and forth between the plots so many times that you have to read the titles of the chapters or subchapters to know where you are, and after a while you don't really care! This book makes John Grisham look like a genius. THere are so many good books out there-find a different one to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of TIme","review":"I purchased this book for two reasons. First it was on the NYT Bestsellers list. Second it was a FBI thriller. Frankly, it was stupid. I couldn't get over the fact that a publishing house had actually spent money to publish this book. At one point in the story you are reading about being on an airplane and the next sentence jumps to talking about sleeping in a house somewhere, with so-n-so down the hallway. What? When did they get off the plane? Did the author forget to go back and correct the story line? Did anyone bother to proof this book?I was greatly disappointed with this author. I was excited to find a new author, one who had a number of books written, as I am a fast reader and read everything by an author. Unfortunately, I will not buy another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is a thriller?","review":"I find it difficult to believe Ms.Coulter actually is a best-selling author! This book was probably among the worst I have ever read. The plot was unbelievable; characters were unbelievable; and paying any kind of money for this book is most unbelievable! Even if you can borrow it for free, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing suspense thriller","review":"Hemlock Bay has two primary plots focusing on FBI agent Dillon Savich's work and family. Both plots become progessively more unbelievable, culminating in endings that are nothing short of ridiculous. Although Coulter manages to keep two disparate story lines somewhat apace, the characters and the connections between them are shallow. Compared to other books by Catherine Coulter, this is an unfortunate disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading Catherine Coulter's previous thrillers,I found Hemlock Bay very disappointing. The idea was great but the book dragged. The dialogue was stilted and predictable. Too much romance, not enough mystery and adventure. Maybe she was a little too ambitious this time. What were the Ghouls, anyway? It seems that Coulter dug herself a hole and couldn't get out of it! Even the romance was not believable...I'd recommend you read something else!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leading to where???","review":"I have to say that I was sorely disappointed after finishing this book. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't a book with two unrelated storylines and no romance at all. The spark between Sherlock and Savich are toned down to the point that you don't see the great chemistry between these 2 characters. What you see is a struggle for the author to complete and tie in two unrelated storylines with too many main characters. This book is mainly about Savich and his sister Lily, but since Savich has Sherloch, Lily has to have Simon, her hero. You see no romance or chemistry between Lily and Simon until the last 20 pages. All of a sudden, there's supposedly great love between the two...wait for the paperback or just borrow this book from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Disappointing","review":"This is my first Catherine Coulter, and probably my last. The characters are so flimsily drawn it's hard to get a handle on them. It feels as though you're reading the paper that had to be turned in before Friday, words but no involvement on the part of the author or the reader. And the editing errors really stand out, hooking your brain and refusing to allow you to go on until you search out the problem. It's one of the maybe five books I've put down without finishing in my reading life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast to Fizzle","review":"This book has one of the biggest build ups to one of the lousiest climaxes I have read in a long time. It was lacking in closure. How did the antagonist, Tammy Tuttle, change the scenery and disappear? What are the ghouls? How and what killed the 11 boys? I am totally confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!!!","review":"I have always been a big fan of Catherine Coulter. I have read all her books. That's why I was so unbelievably disappointed in this book. I felt cheated for buying the book. The plot is really stupid. There is no suspense or romance. Catherine Coulter who has always been known for her great contemporary & historical romances, should go back to writing the way she use to. If she wants to write a good suspense novel, she should take a lesson from Nora Roberts or Linda Howard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Near The Fireplace","review":"I usually love to keep books that I have read...but will certainly make an exception for this clunker.

Don't waste your time or money on this one...but keep it near the fireplace...at least it burns well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential but was too predictable!","review":"I thought I would really like this Catherine Coulter novel but I was pretty disappointed! It seemed like there were 2 separate stories going on..the one with Savich's sister & her \\"dilemma\\" and the story of the \\"Tuttle twins\\". They were pretty OK stories on their own but the plot with Savich's sister was very formulaic & the one with the Tuttle twis was just plain weird! They didn't tie the two stories together at all & Coulter never really gave resolution to the Tuttle story and the \\"ghouls\\". She never really explained their origin or cause,etc. She just got you to the end of the book and you're at the last page thinking \\"...AND.....???\\". Not her best work, I'm afraid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"not her best effort. in fact, it was quite possibly the weakest plot i've read in some time. both too much and too little going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Last","review":"Of the books I've finished (and there are very few that are so bad that I could not get through them) sadly, this is the worst. Perky Lily has nine lives. She has a car accident, then surgery. Is released from the hospital, then fights off an attacker, then goes on to write cartoons, the same day. That is just the beginning of her adventures. This is just one of the plot lines that strains credulity. It appears that the other stories about these characters may have been better, but it's hard to believe that the person who wrote this book could actaully write something that anyone would spend time reading. Hopefully, what other reviewers and more long time readers of the series say is true: that the author could not have sanctioned this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply dreadful","review":"It is hard to decide if the plot or the diaglogue are the worst parts of this book. My advice is don't bother to even start reading it. It is a really worthless book in every sense.

I had difficulty finishing this book due to the \\"oh... come... on\\" factor. I've read many Catherine Coulter books before and enjoyed them; however, this is not one. The rescue from the fire episode was ridiculous. I read that deal out loud to several of my friends and the usual comment after laughter (or during) was \\"oh gawd, you've got to be kidding.

I was looking forward to reading it, but in the middle of the muddle with too many plots and under-developed characters, I lost track and interest. What's with the magic show kidnapping/murders? She should have either developed this plot more or the other involving Lilly's in-laws and Swedish connection. This disappointing mess is far too convoluted, I want my money for the paperback refunded!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Disappointing","review":"I am so disappointed, I waited with baited breath for this one. If I didn't know better, I'd say some novice writer wrote this book. It was awful! There are two stories being told, but only one you mildly care about, and the romance, please, it's non existent!

I struggled through 189 pages or so and threw it away. The characters are wooden and so is the dialogue.

The plot stretched credibility to the breaking point, and the characters were flat and amateurish. The only reason I could see that this book ended up in print at all, was because it carried Catherine Coulter's name on the title page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"As an avid Catherine Coulter fan, especially her previous books including FBI agents Sherlock and Savich, this is not at all what I expected. I would have placed this in the category for fiction, maybe suspense, but certainly not a Romance novel. Story was dull and lacking in romance. The first Coulter book I didn't care for, but still a Coulter fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing anyone?","review":"I feel like something happened to Catherine Coulter before the last two mystery novels she wrote. I've always enjoyed her work, but it's as if she's trying out a style of writing that is at complete odds with the material. Or, because of her success, no one is editing her, or having the guts to tell her the writing has taken a severe downswing. Why? To meet deadlines? I wish more time had been taken to review her manuscript before publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the hemlock!","review":"Precisely who wrote this dialogue?

I thought the book was Catherine Coulter through and through. I have been struck with how some of her heroines come off as superhuman. Enduring calamity after calamity. Kinda over the top. But the story lines keep you engaged. This is one of her books that have several story lines going at once. It also encompasses the supernatural as some of her other books have done. It's quite interesting. Many of the reviews wanted an explanation of the supernatural events. But that's just the point. There is no logical explanation. If there was, it wouldn't be supernatural.

One only has to compare Monk's work on Russell to his biography of Wittgenstein (\\"The Duty of Genius\\" says it all). The interesting thing about each of Monk's biographies is that while both men led solitary lives and maintained erratic beliefs and behavior, Russell is castigated as a \\"madman\\" while Wittgenstein is a \\"genius.\\" It is far too easy as a biographer to portray intellectual celebrities as either geniuses or madman. If you want to hear from the person, Bertie Russell, read his biography instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp!","review":"The book is essentially a form of ?tabloid scholarship.? Mr. Monk is more interested in bedroom tales than with the impact of the awe-inspiring humanism of Earl Russell. The fabrications and mischievous assertions appear to be inspired by some right wing streak which results in a lack of a modicum of integrity and honesty.Russell?s work as a mathematician, a philosopher and as a humanist, towers above such sensational publications, and of course, outlasts them many generations to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a scam!

The \\"hero\\" had a beyond-teeth-grinding split personality: one was scarily obsessed with the heroine's body (and only her body) and the other was cold, insensitive, and ruthless. He used both of his personalities to constantly boss her around and she would just meekly obey. Ugh! Also, the narrator was ALL wrong.

The other 2 stars were for the 3rd section, for beginners in FB's work the third section turns out to be a gem in the rough. It really adds flavor to your self-directed learning/practice of Bardon's magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keytronic optical mouse","review":"This is just what I wanted, a simple, optical mouse that uses the mouse input rather than USB. Way too many devices want a usb port compared to the number usually provided. The mouse works as expected except that after two or three weeks of use the left button has a bit of a squeek when depressed. No big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great Print Quality","review":"I would go for the Arcanum version of this film as the print quality is better and it's paired in a double feature with Tod Slaughter's MURDER IN THE RED BARN. A MUCH better value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stitch 'N Bitch ROCKS!","review":"I've been knitting for 50+ years, so I wasn't really in the market for a book on how to knit. It's quite possible that I own every book Elizabeth Zimmerman ever wrote!Happily, a fellow office mate gave me this book for my birthday, and I must say the book is quite hilarious, as well as informative. The book is packed with excellent drawings, photographs, technique how-tos, and double entendres.The knitting patterns are fun, and there are directions for sewing two different knitting needle cases, which I thought extraordinarily appropriate. The funky eyelash yarn PRINCESS SNOWBALL CAT BED called out to me. Now THAT is an original creation, if there ever was one!This book has a real trendy urban tone which, as a former 20-year Manhattan dweller, I found refreshing. The book never talks down to the reader, but invites the reader to EXPERIENCE and EXPERIMENT!Buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"This was a really fun book with a catchy title, however, being a more advanced knitter, after reading through it, and getting my knitting juices flowing again, I passed along to my sister because she is just learning to knit. She found it fun, and the best part of this knitting book, is that it lays out knitting as trendy and hip, which is great to get some more people interested in the craft. So kudos for that! Knitting is sure becoming popular, and I give this book some of the credit for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an easy book to use","review":"I thought the information sections of the book were too cluttered and confusing. It's such a big book I thought there would be a lot of patterns. There are some but nothing I'd make...come on a bikini??? Wristbands? Falls in the catagory of too much work, not enough reward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever copy, little use","review":"I enjoyed reading this book but was dispappointed with its content for the most part. The copy is clever and witty but if you want humor try reading another book. The patterns were esoteric and I was not inspired to knit any of them, often I said to myself why would anyone want to knit that? I mean who wears wrist wraps and sweaters with skulls on them? There are lots of other books that have more information and better paterns and instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Beginning","review":"I have been interested in knitting and crochet for quite some time, but when I found this book, the instructions actually clicked for me...Stoller's humor is entertaining for the Gen-X and Y'ers at which it is aimed. Her goal, to get more people knitting, has worked. Several of my friends have begun to knit now, and my yarn habit grows daily. Kudos to Debbie for getting this book out there! Hopefully she continues on with the Stitch 'N Bitch and gives us more books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book for the novice or experienced knitter","review":"This book is interesting to learn from and also includes interesting family stories about the craft. The author seems to have thought of everything helpful and important for the novice along with reminders for the experienced knitter. The title doesn't make much sense to me, but I can live with that. I highly recommend this book.I'm editing this weeks later: The author writes so very well and explains clearly in addition to providing excellent illustrations that I only wish she had added a section on steeks and all the ins and outs of working with steeks. There is info online about steeks but nothing that seems to realize that some of us have no idea how to work them and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun & easy way to learn knitting!","review":"The instructions in this book are easy to understand and fun to read. This book has all of the basics you need to learn how to knit plus some cool projects. The projects at the end of the chapters utilize the skills that you just learned, which is great. She also explains how to read patterns!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The wife liked it","review":"Got this one and \\"The Happy Hooker\\" by the same author. Both easy to understand and gets referred to regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the spunk","review":"This is the first book I have purchased in my efforts to learn how to knit. I enjoy the history of knitting and the pictures of all the tools but I think more pictures/drawings would be useful. I bought an accessories pack but have never used it because I don't know how. I might have to find a separate book on that. The step-by-step drawings and descriptions are good but sometimes you are left guessing if you completed the step correctly. A nice feature is that Debbie gives you the option to choose how you would like to knit, using the method that is most comfortable for you (right vs. left handed, holding the needles etc.). Right now I am working on my second scarf using the traditional knit stitch, so using this book without any prior knowledge is possible. She includes patterns for projects your grandmother probably would never produce, have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I taught myself to knit with this book. When I would get stumped I would watch a you tube video to help out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knitters","review":"Likes the book when I first saw it, but once I got it I was a little confused on following the instructions and just getting started. Book overall was okay for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic self-teacher","review":"I've never felt so enthusiastic about recommending a book before. I've picked up knitting so easily with this work. In the two weeks since I received it, I've taught myself casting on, knitting, purling, garter stitch, stockinette, and ribbing. I've completed a scarf and made a couple of swatches, and I'm working on another scarf. I'm no expert yet, but I've been wonderfully surprised at how easily I've gained these skills. I think part of what's made it easy with this book is that the book is pretty hip. Stoller has an easy, fun style to read, and there are lots of pictures and cool patterns to drool over as you learn. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anxious to Learn More.","review":"This book is so very helpful for beginners, and there are so many different things to learn. Even intermediate and advanced knitters can use this book for the patterns or design stitches. I really recommend this for anyone starting off or looking for some cute cute CUTE patterns! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great instruction!","review":"This is the first knitting book I bought and I definately don't regret it. The instructions for a beginning knitter are excellent. The patterns in the book aren't something that I am excited about, I'll probably only make a few of them. But this book is definately worth it if only for the instructions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"Funny anecdotes; great projects for beginners - a few more challenging for the intermediate knitter. If you want to learn to knit, this is a great book for you. If you already know how to knit, you may learn some new techniques reading through - worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a great book with lots of helpful images to aid in the learning process. Also, the author is pretty funny, which helps alleviate some of the consternation of learning this sometimes challenging hobby. I definitely recommend this to new knitters and veterans alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for beginning knitters!!","review":"I definitely recommend this book for other beginning knitters. I went in with basically no knowledge, and I've been able to follow the guides quite easily between the descriptions and visual aids. I'd say that a combination of this book and a more experienced knitter to consult as needed on anything tricky would be more than enough to get started.I love that this book gives recommendations for what supplies to get, as well, including needle sizes and materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stitch N' Bitch","review":"Well written book, very informative. The examples are well drawn so you can follow the stitching. I intend to purchase the sequels for more info on knitting techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 21 years of knitting, I finally learned something new!","review":"It isn't often that I find some new tip or hint for knitting. I am not a great knitter, just a functional one. I make lots of scarves, hats, and other useful, quick items. In this book, I found hints I didn't know before. I also was inspired to make different types of projects like a cat bed and an ipod sock. I could have found instructions for these projects somewhere else or even make my own pattern, but this book gave me the inspiration to start looking differently at my needles.Although I am not totally sold on the title (is the sticher a bitch or does the sticher bitch while stiching?), I actually read the introductory chapters about knitting history. Usually I skip right past the \\"boring\\" part and go for the patterns. Not so here!I recommend this book for the beginner and the experienced knitter who is not so excited about sweaters anymore. It worked for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Make A Good Knitting Guide Even Better. . .","review":"I concur with the great reviews this book has gotten, and have recommended it to many people who have commented on my knitting projects on the subway. One thing with which I fault this book (and Ms. Stoller's subsequent ones) is that TRADE PAPERBACKS DON'T LIE FLAT. This was surely an oversight on the part of the publishers.Here's a fix: Take this book to Kinkos -- or its equivalent in your area -- and have them shave off the binding and spiral bind it. The cost is minimal and it makes it much easier to use if you're just beginning to knit and need to study the illustrations.Happy knitting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!!!","review":"This book is super hyped and long on style, short on substance. I have been knitting for over a decade and the patterns in this book are poorly planned and described, and require hunting through the internet for corrections due to the fact that they were not checked before printing (!). I think the explanations are convoluted and not good for the visual learner--i have talked to many beginners that had problems with it. I would suggest the Knitter's Bible instead for basic instructions and a fantastic stitch glossary. It has visual steps and very thorough explanations. For patterns, I recommend \\"knitwit\\" and \\"hip to knit\\" for SUPER cute patterns that are well-explained and turn out beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and a good addition","review":"I had avoided buying this book because I thought it sounded like a waste of money. However, I saw it in a brick and mortor book store and picked it up to peruse. I liked it almost immediately. I didn't buy it for the patterns - I have plenty of those. I also have lots of \\"tips and technique\\" books, but this one was fun to read. It's clever and witty and inexpensive enough that it didn't matter to me that the patterns weren't so great. That said, my boyfriend does want a sweater with skulls on it now! I wouldn't recommend this book for a brand new knitter with no other books, but it is definitely worth adding to an existing knitting library."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one knitting book, make it this one!","review":"Open the book to any page, and you'll discover immediately that Debbie Stoller is one hip and righteous woman, as well as a gifted and hilarious writer. Even if you're not interested in learning how to knit (that'll change when you flip through the projects section and see that it's chock full of stuff that you actually want - nay, need!), the clever text, pictures, and titles will suck you into the knitting world and keep you there forever. The instructions are excellent and valuable to both new and seasoned knitters alike; Debbie really takes the time to help you understand what you're doing, so even accomplished knitters will learn concepts that will make their knitting easier. The book is a must-have for all Generation X knitters (or cool knitters of any age). Just don't be surprised if you start using your food budget to purchase yarn instead - the author's passion for her craft is truly that contagious. Thanks, Debbie, for such a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Knitting Snob","review":"This tone of the writing in this book is condescending, snooty, and in some places, offensive. In Ms. Stoller's world, if you use metal needles and yarn bought anywhere except a specialty yarn store, you might be a redneck! Ms. Stoller seems to think she invented the idea of women getting together to do needlework, when women have been doing this in some form for centuries. She has nothing new for experienced knitters except, put downs and glib comments about how and what you should be knitting (her way or the wrong way). For the new knitter: If you want to experience the joy of knitting, get the Vogue Basic Knitting book or even Knitting for Dummies. The authors of these books will give your clear directions without the elitist attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever copy but a waste of money","review":"I thought this book would be great judging by the title but as the saying goes, you can't judge a book by its cover. If I had been in a traditional store where I could look through it, I wouldn't have purchased it. It is more fluff than content using cleverly written copy, overly snappy layout, and all the knitting puns out there but it doesn't fill a void in the knitting book world. The projects aren't interesting, I was not inspired to make a single one and for several I nearly laughed out loud at how ridiculous they were, do people really need wrist warmers or a sweater with a skull on it? My advice: Don't bother with this book. If your a beginer knitter then the Vogue Knitting guide is the comprehensive tome that every knitter needs, and the Yarn Girls guide is full of quick and easy beginer projects to get you started. Happy Knitting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for a Starting Knitter","review":"I was shown the basics of knitting this past January. Three scarves later I discovered this book and decided to give it a try. It's awesome! I love the stories and commentaries given throughout. The instructions are easy to follow and the little projects to practice new skills are great. The pages of patterns are wonderful, too. I can't wait to begin knitting more than just scarves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knitting is not just for old ladies","review":"This book will not only teach you how to knit, correct mistakes and plan projects, but it has instructions for very current, stylish items that you will want to make. The text is fun to read and easy to follow. You will quickly advance beyond scarves and other easy items to sweaters and purses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, even if you're just starting out","review":"I purchased this book during the summer and found the instructions very easy to follow. I was brand new to the knitting world and was suprised by how quickly I was able to complete my first project.A must have for the new knitter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I learned how to crochet by using Stoller's other book, Stitch n' Bitch Crochet, which was clear and easy to use. However, her knitting book is an absolute travesty. The instructions are either wrong or badly written, but whatever they are, I was forced to buy another [...] book just to learn basic stitches.Additionally, the projects require expensive yarn that isn't even available in my state. It would cost me [...] just to buy and ship the yarn I would need to make the pair of socks in the book.Much of the writing is purely fluff, which can be annoying when you have to read three paragraphs in order to get one sentence of content. \\"The Importance of Needle Width,\\" for example, on page 25, could be condensed into a few sentences. Just tell me that I need a needle gauge, for Christ's sake!In conclusion, you'll love this book if you have plenty of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"First and best knitting book I've bought","review":"This was the first knitting book I got, back when I wasn't sure how to bind off. It's wonderful. All the new techniques I've needed to know so far I've been able to find in here, and the patterns are kickass. The only complaint I have is that there are a bunch of mistakes in the patterns; corrections can be found at http://www.bust.com/knithappens/oops.shtml.No matter what experience level you are, I definitely reccomend this book and it's 'sequel', Stich 'n Bitch Nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information for Beginners and Funny!","review":"I love the content and was able to get started with knitting basics. It was also very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My Great Aunt taught me how to knit when I was eleven. Years later I wanted to start up again, but forgot how.

The chatty and zany approach circumvents the usual dry knitting approach and traditional applications and will appeal to newer, younger audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"First timer","review":"I have tried to knit before to no avail, and with the help of this book, I just completed my first row of succesful knitted fabric! I already knew how to crochet, so I had some experience with yarn and hooks, but I could never get the hang of knitting with two sticks sans hook. This book has the best written instructions I have ever seen. I am so pleased with this purchase! THANK YOU, DEBBIE!P.S. I can't wait to make \\"skully!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for beginners, or collecting dust on my shelves","review":"I bought this book after reading all the stellar reviews posted here. As a fairly new knitter, I learned just about a year before I purchased this, I thought I could pick up some good information from this. Maybe my skills are more advanced than I thought, because this seemed too basic. None of the projects really jumped out and said, \\"Knit ME!\\" Some where for a much younger crowd, (I just turned 30 this year, so I'm not quite a grandma yet!), and were not at all what I was expecting.I have since lent it out to a younger cousin who is just beginning to knit, and is full of questions. Hopefully she'll get my money's worth out of this book, as I surely didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newbie Knitter Gets It!","review":"I just started knitting when I got this book and it's awesome. I already knew how to knit and purl, this book helped me learn how to increase & decrease and tons of other neat knit tricks. I made the big bad baby blanket that is in this book and it's gorgeous.The only problem I had is that the yarns they recommend are fairly pricey. I'm prone to writing down the weight of the yarn and then finding some less expensive variation at my LYS.Overall, this is a great way to learn how to knit and to expand your skills. I've decided to knit all the patterns in the book (just for fun)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, imformative and inspirational","review":"I borrowed a copy of this book from my friend. I loved all of the history of knitting info and all of the info about the creative knitters that came up with the patterns. I like the way the book is written, it is like having someone talk to you. I didn't want to buy any kitting books before I saw this one, most are to stuffy. The patterns cover beginners and go beyond that.I think that the simple ones are creative and get you to use your imagination like the artists that we are. I also have Stitch 'N Bitch Nation and love that as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than cute patterns","review":"I was somewhat horrified by my interest in (and love of) knitting, as a first in a few generations knitter in my early twenties. My mom saw knitting as a throwback to unglorious days. This book helps to clear things up a bit.Through personal essay and observation, Debbie Stoller manages to clarify the pull knitting is having on young women (in this latest wave of new knitters) as well as to reclaim knitting from its unflattering stereotype.When I finished reading, I passed the book on to Mom, who now knits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!","review":"I recently purchased this book and was not that impressed with the book. The writing is long winded and the projects were kind of boring. I am anticipating the book by teva durham to come out because of her know ability to get the knitter more accomplished.I would not recommend this book to anyone except for the novice knitter or someone interested in only craft, campy style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knitting basics","review":"I originally bought this book upon a knitting friend's recommendation, and have since bought additional copies for other knitters. Great illustrations and a down to earth style. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I wanted","review":"This is just a basic how to book - nothing really innovative except perhaps the title and cover.I would have returned it, but since I got it at a low, low price, I will donate it.I should have investigated it further.Not the publishers or the providers fault however."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book insults all knitters","review":"If you are an experienced knitter, pass this one by. You will be insulted and offended. Ms. Stoller acts as if she singlhandedly saved knitting and gathering women together to do so from antiquity. She makes it clear that only those who choose the most exotic and expensive yarns and needles are wothy of her lofty tome. If you dare to be so crass as to use aluminum needles, prepare to be insulted. The patterns in this book are the of the most basic and unimatinative variety. She gives you the instructions for a simple scarf as if she was the first person to ever knit a long rectangle in garter.If you are a new knitter, you will be better served by absolutely any other book on the market. This woman will confuse you with her attempts to give instructions in what I assume she thinks are hip and trendy terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but annoying","review":"She's amusing. The patterns are very young and very thin. Don't buy this if you wear a size 10 or more. It made me chuckle a time or two, but the femenist mentality comes through way too much. The patterns are do-able for almost any knitter, but definately aimed at the 18-24 crowd. Although I'm still in that crowd, I'd pass on this given the chance again."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEFTIES: Don't Be Fooled!","review":"I made the mistake of reading a review below citing the book's inclusion of \\"The Continental Method\\" as being \\"for lefties.\\" It's not! Not if you are a Lefty who wants the SAME EASE, AGILITY AND SOOTHING USE OF YOUR LEFT HAND .... in the way RIGHT handed knitters take for granted. If you want your LEFT hand to be the ACTIVE hand... the HAND WIELDING THE NEEDLE, forget this book and keep trying to find a left near you who will just show you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth looking at","review":"I'd give this 0 stars if it were possible. I am a new knitter. I've made some fuzzy scarfs with that incredibly popular eyelash yarn and have made 3 hats.

It is chocked full of basic and advanced information and great tips as well. I go to Stitch 'n Bitch to get a clear explanation of a technique that other books gloss over or don't explain how to do the technique or stitch. Example.....when adding the neck to, let's say a sweater, other books tell you to pick up the number of stitches and knit...however, Stitch 'n Bitch tells you that what is really meant by that is \\"pick up only\\". You actually need to pick up the number of stitches first and then ...you start knitting.I highly recommend it for all knitters..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners!","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I've been knitting and learning on my own and it really helped with some of the questions I had. It has great references and goes in detail of how to do certain things like different cast ons and offs, inc., dec., stripes, intarsia etc. etc. I even got the hang of both styles of knitting from this book which was great!The author has a great personality, every book I have of hers makes me laugh which is great because I have problems staying focused on dull subjects. She makes learning fun and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this one.","review":"This book is an in-house expert available at all times. I've used it as a beginner for the basic stuff and now refer to it for help with more complex stitches. The patterns are not what I would choose to pour time into, but that hardly matters; the author encourages one to go for personal design and to find unique ways of doing things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently Cute Patterns and Entertaining Banter","review":"I've been knitting for quite some time and as many of us young, non-traditional knitters know trying to find cute and modern patterns can be a challenge. Usually I'll buy a book when I really love 2 or 3 of the patterns but in this book almost every pattern appealed to me. Many of the patterns are simple enough for the beginner and Stoller covers a lot of ground as far as techniques are concerned. It's not a knitting bible nor a complete reference, but I learned a lot from it and I've been very happy with the results. The writing style is pretty cheesy at times but in a funny way and anyone who's fallen asleep while reading dry, boring knitting books will welcome Stoller's puns and rock 'n roll knitting attitude as refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Dull patterns, muddy instructions. Total waste of cash.","review":"What a waste of paper this book is. The first half is just her droning on and on about the history of knitting, her family history of knitting, her grandmother's death bed, and a bunch of other useless anticdotes and her trying to talk 'hipster'...yawn. The instructions in this book are muddy at best.The second half is the patterns which are seriously boring and out of date (think mid-90s, Brooklyn hipster). Anyone can knit a boxy sweater and no one looks good in one. What's the point. This book is 100% filler and if I really stretch it, one half way decent pattern among all the sillyness and uselessness. There are way too many good books out there with clear instructions (hers are like mud) and fabulous patterns to waste time and money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the Bad Attitude","review":"Why is our society sunk so low that even a knitting book has to be full of bad attitude in order to promote this time honored and beautiful craft? I looked at the book on the shelf and decided not to buy it because it had no place in my home. I agree that it could encourage a beginner to get some knitting done, but why can't we do that with some decorum?(I'm a relatively young mother of small children and not a grandmother.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Title a real put-off....","review":"I read a review of this book on a knitting forum where someone mentioned that they were old enough to remember when \\"B****\\" was a derogatory term. Hunh? It still is, if you were brought up with any manners at all.As to the patterns, well, the devil and kitty hats have been out on the web as well as in magazines, and the rest of the items don't look all that special--some of the striped items look like they come from the Gap. All the color photos are in the middle, and many of the photos had the camera tilted, as well as the models being photographed in very cluttered settings, which takes away from the items.Also, the orange around the pages does nothing for the book--money would have been better spent on better layout.This book is just okay, and is not the greatest for children, unless you have already explained what \\"ribbed for her pleasure\\" means."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad title","review":"I would like to own this book, but the title is not appropriate for me to have in my home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need all in one...","review":"Debbie Stoller has really written the only book you need to answer every basic knitting question that you may have.

Shipped very fast & secure! HIgh quality book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for teaching yourself to knit","review":"I read reviews of TONS of books on learning to knit before Christmas last year. This one was highly recommended so I asked for it for Christmas. Using this book and The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting video I taught myself to knit quite quickly. I read a good portion of this book on the way home from celebrating Christmas at my parents house and promplty started my first project. While working on the project I watched the video, which was helpful for demonstrating techniques for changing colors and how to prevent the added stitch when switching between knit and purl stitches. But really I think this book is how I learned to knit. I've been knitting for less than a year and have already make scarves, hats, socks, afgans, and I'm not afraid to try more complicated patterns I find. This book can truly teach you how to knit. And the authors humor keeps it from being a dry read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool looking patterns, but not accurate","review":"When I opened this book, I loved the way the designs of the sweaters and other accessories. I was really sick of seeing out-of-style knitting books that only your grandma would wear in 1980. This book definitely has patterns that are for people more in tune with today's mod fashions. I was truly excited to get started on a few of these.However, the patterns were very inaccurate and difficult to follow. The measurements were inaccurate, and it really was hit or miss when it came to knitting a good pattern, especially since each pattern was written by a different person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pun Intended","review":"Stroller uses nearly every knitting pun imaginable, but it makes for a fun (but sometimes hokey) read. She covers a good deal of ground in her handbook, and the patterns provided definately back up the \\"lessons\\" in the book.I was surprised by her relatively quick address of Intarsia and Fair Isle, whilst excluding any mention of Entrelac.At times, I found the illustrations a bit unclear, but on the whole, I think this is a fun and focused primer for the beginning knitter -- as well as a great pattern source for the experienced.

I was not intending to buy a knitting book on a recent fiber stash-enrichment expedition but once I saw the title I had to pick up the book and leaf through it and I was instantly hooked (?or perhaps 'needled'!). I have to admit I haven't tried anything from it requiring a precise gauge yet but I thoroughly enjoy the instuctions and information and, as others have stated, hip--and tongue-in-cheek--approach! Sure there's some patterns I won't try, but there's lots I'm itching to get started on. The instructions I've followed so far have been quite complete--plus the illustrations are excellent. I've had to struggle with writing a few instructions myself and can *really* appreciate how the steps were made so concise and descriptive.

Someone like Camryn Manheim? How come they never do those commercials.I happen to be a workout fanatic and eat and exercise to feel good. Looking good should not be starving oneself and have a frame that looks like it will snap in two.I admire women of all shapes and sizes. A pretty face and shapely body (not a pencil thin one)is what I like in looks. Usually, a warm and cheerful personality makes the face beautiful (not tons of make-up).

The basic theme is that we, as a society, are wasting a precious resource by keeping women's energies focused on living down to the supermodel ideal of a small package with nothing in it. The author offers a man's perspective on why so many in our society find abundant women so threatening, and calls for the end of weight prejudice. A great book! Very positive for women.

So when Valerie's dad says he is moving to some tiny country that no one has heard of because of his new job (protocol chief for royal family), she decides to go with him because, let's face it, who wants to live with their lesbian mother and her girlfriend and transfer to a new school? Although Valerie is upset because she has to leave her friends and a potential boyfriend named David, she soon realizes that living in this new country could get pretty interesting, considering there is a young prince her age living in the palace (Valerie and her father have an apartment there since her father works for the royal family). The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because it is somewhat predictable, but it is still worth your money to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite","review":"I started to read this book, and was sucked in to the plot.

But her dad is moving to shwerinborg because he works in politics and it would be best if his life wasn't plastered on the newstands. Valerie goes with her dad knowing that they can come home in a year.

Then, her father announces that he's being transferred from helping the President in Washington, D.C. to helping the royal family in Schwerinborg (or Smorgasbord, as most of Valerie's classmates call it), a tiny European country somewhere around Germany. Not wanting to face facts about her mother, Valerie moves to Schwerinborg. At first Schwerinborg seems kind of gray and dull, but then Valerie meets Georg, and things are looking up. But when she finds out that, in fact, he's Prince Georg, she isn't sure if it will go anywhere. She tries to find out if he's interested, while also trying to learn German so she can understand what everyone is saying, and she's in for some surprises. Another great book from Simon Romantic Comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Story But Awesome Still","review":"Valerie has everything a girl in high school could want.

The life partner is what bugs Val the most, but nonetheless, Val loves her mother deeply. Suddenly, Val is in a whole new world and is being swept away by Prince Charming (literally!).This is a very cute read, and while the story is familiar, it's not SO familiar that you won't like this book.

Johnson wanted his great society more than he wanted the M.O.L.E.

I feel this is a very good and noble position in the face of the modern American aversion to anything labeled \\"nuclear\\".

This dvd shows just how diverse her comedy abilities were. She could be the biggest nerd ever, or a Brownie Scout trying to keep herself company in her room. Rosanne Rosannadanna always had 'somethin' to say. My one disappontment was that her song, \\"Honey\\" wasn't included on this dvd, though I recall seeing her do in on SNL. It's great fun to see her once again on the screen and laugh as hard as I did when SNL was in it's infancy.

My word, it was like seeing those two charming women THEMSELVES on the screen!The acting done by Drew Barrymore, and Jessica Lange was phenomonal, to say the very least. As I mentioned,it was eerie how pitch-perfect those two women played those roles! I own both documentary films,and this one seemed as if it was the third in the series, not a separate HBO film. The clothing, dialects,scenery, everything looked like it had been duplicated exactly from the documentaries by the Maysles.This film will not disappoint you if you are a true fan of these wonderful,captivating, STAUNCH characters,that are the Beales!ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey Gardens","review":"A wonderful movie. Both Jessica Lang and Drew Barrymore deserved an Oscar. They were so convincing as Big and Little Edie. I will watch it many more times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read several books about Gray Gardens the home of Jackie O's aunt. I was very disappointed in this movie. Drew did an excellent job but the movie was not well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got to see it","review":"never got to see it, the dvd that i purchased was damaged it skipped then would start then pause, i did not go back and reorder the movie from another vendor worried it would be bad cause it is old movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Acting, Lame Story","review":"A morality tale and character study of the effects of parental domination and the resulting frustration of a daughter who fails to achieve her potential. Well..a little more complicated than that, but you get the idea. Primarily a film that will appeal more to women than men. Very slow moving and repititious IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD quality","review":"When we started watching this DVD everything was ok but in the middle it starting having problems. There was 1/2 screen then black blocks and freeze-up's. It was a hot mess. So we got to watch the first 20 min. and the last 20 min. Totally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!!!","review":"The worst movie I've ever seen. I don't understand the fascination with the whole Camelot thing. A total bore fest. I made it through the whole thing only because I thought there might be some kind of twist,(nope),just more of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"This is a beautifully-made movie which goes to show there is quality on television as long as you look for it. Everything is superb. Even if you are not fascinated by the connection with Jacqueline Kennedy that the subjects of this movie had, you will enjoy it very much. It makes me want to buy the original 1976 documentary on which this movie is based, and I will probably do that soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Take on a Cult Documentary","review":"Grey Gardens was so much better than I expected it to be. If you've seen the cult documentary, you know what to expect or rather, what you should expect. This film does not disappoint. Barrymore and Lange are both wonderful here. Lange, of course, has always been a wonderful actress, but Barrymore puts aside her cutsie image and proves naysayers very wrong indeed. She is wonderful. Tragic and funny and sad, this is one of those wonderful Divas in/from/driven to Hell films. Great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading product info by publisher","review":"The book is ok, to be honest it made things clear BUT it clearly stated from the publisher that there was a companion website that offered animations, quiz generators etc. etc. sound good? well, not so fast, the only thing on the website is an image bank of the illustrations ALREADY IN THE BOOK! Apparently the rest of it is only available for instructors. Of course, once you scratch off and reveal the code to enter the website it nullifies your ability to return the book. And those \\"pocket size\\" study cards are just more illustrations but the size is much larger than normal pockets (hint: they are pages to be torn from the book..full sized pages) most would assume pocket sized to mean about the size of a 3x5 card otherwise just lug the book around. In any case, like I said the book I would rate a 3-4 the resources promised -1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Easy? What a joke!","review":"When I first saw the title I was already a little leery. Anatomy & Physiology is a difficult subject if for no other reason than the fact that there are lots and lots of jawbusting terms to remember, most of which come from Latin. So how could you possibly make that easy?Well it turns out you can't! There is no magic way to make all those names go away, and there is no magic way to learn to remember them. Adding a lot of cute cartoon drawings does not make the subject any simpler. The book simply skips a lot of stuff, uses many terms that it never defines and leaves the reader the worse off for it. I was studying Anatomy & Physiology in college and we were using a monster text. So I thought this book would simplify the whole thing for me. All it did was give me two books to be frustrated with AND skip incredibly important stuff that weakened my understanding instead of helping me.I CANNOT recommend this book at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Great Broadway Shows\\"","review":"Such a disappointment! The sound quality is beyond poor on CD 1 and is followed closely by CD 4; the other CDs are okay. If you're into old Broadway songs, buy \\"Greatest Broadway Hits: Golden Greats\\" instead. The latter is listenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been better","review":"The book consists of 47 essays by different authors, each essay an average of 9 pages long, where the author gives their anecdotal story or insight. And then there is another 20 pages at the end of the \\"what to know when you travel there\\" stuff.It is a great idea for a book, and a you should read it if going to Spain, but I just wish they had used better authors. Nothing from Hemingway, Washington Irving, nothing from the Spaniards themselves like Cervantes and Lorca. The writing seems too modern, not deep, nor funny, nor penetrating enough: Not up to the task at hand. Although the writing is OK, there must be better insights written than these. This could have been a better book, considering the subject is Spain, it could have been a much much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly bad guitar instruction","review":"I purchased Vol 1 of this set, and was amazed at the very low quality. The videos are OK, though not any better than available for free on YouTube. The book itself was amazingly bad: dark, grainy photos and poor graphics. A whole page was taken showing a murky photo of a hand holding a chord position and a diagram of the same single chord.And yet, the publisher decided to include neither chords, tabs or lyrics to the songs taught on the video - guess they needed all the room to pad out the pages of chords. Forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works in the Classroom","review":"This is an excellent book for the introduction of physics concepts. By blending science fiction and science fact Dr. Forward puts concepts commonly misundersttod into the grasp of the laity. I have found this book very useful in my Physics courses. My students tend to enjoy it as well. Dr. Forward draws on his background at JPL to give sound techincal explanations and his ability as a science fiction writer to give the concepts life.WARNING! If you are looking for a piece of fluffy fantasy fiction this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly interesting and educational hard science fiction.","review":"Although this book is listed as Science Fiction it is notjust a collection of short stories. Dr. Forward puts forthessays on various aspects of SF technology, couching them in fairly easy to understand language. Between the hard science bits are short stories dealing with the previous chapter so you can see how it all fits together. ***Warning*** Don't read this all in one session. I did, and got a headache for my trouble. That much information in such a short time is a real brain stretcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Utility Amp","review":"Due to limited eyesight I bought the pre assembled amp.It was very easy to mount and connect a pot,speaker,power supply and on/off switch.

Plenty of clean volume.I'm impressed!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Best","review":"I have been using this hairspray for years, and yes, it is horribly expensive in stores retail. This is a great price--even when I buy it through licensed only beauty supplies I have to pay much more.I have very thin, fine hair and I haven't found anything that works like this product. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hairspray EVER","review":"This is my favorite hairspray EVER. It is the only hairspray that doesn't leave your hair sticky, tacky, or flakey. You could literally spray the entire bottle on your head and still walk away with touchable, smooth hair.The only bad thing (and it's very minor) is that I can never seem to use the entire can because when there's like 1/6 left, it repeatedly gets stuck in the nozzle (no matter how much hot water I put on it).I've been using hairspray nearly all my life and this is TOPS. You won't be sorry you bought it (unless you like frozen, sticky hair)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A godsend for people with fine hair","review":"Finally, a product that won't weight down my fine, straight, limp hair. It holds like a dream--isn't sticky. You can brush through your hair and the product STILL HOLDS!! You can also use it as a setting gel for your curling iron.I finally gave up on my perm. I just blow dry every morning--blast the spray through my style--and I'm on my way. No worries about the laquered look, no fear about humid days, or 50 mile an hour windstorms. My hair looks and feels natural--the additional shine this product provides is an added bonus.If you have fine, limp hair, do yourself a favor and give Caviar a try. I don't believe you'll be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not all that it's cracked up to be.","review":"It isn't that great. Not worth spending all the money. I would not spend the money on this hair spray again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hairspray! Best Price!","review":"Been using Alterna Caviar for over 3 years now!

I order 3 at a time.. thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product 3rd time purchasing.","review":"This product does not stiffen hair nor does it have an odor. If I need to touch up during the day I can go through my hair without a problem yet my hair continues to stay in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Gorman","review":"The second installment in the Noah Ford series is a disappointing read. Ford, a federal agent in the 1880's west, is an interesting character that Gorman does not really develop. I am a big Gorman fan, be it westerns, mysteries or thrillers, but this just doesn't cut it. There is no real sense of time or place in this novel. It feels much too contemporary, and just seems to plod along. The mystery itself isn't enaging. The western aspects are negligible. This could be a contemporary mystery just as easily as a westernI have enjoyed Gorman's books for years, and if has his name on the cover, I will read it. But if you are new to Gorman, there are better places to go in either mystery or western field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hook on Christmas","review":"I was VERY disappointed with \\"Hooked on Christmas\\". It wasn't like the Hooked on Classics CDs that I have. The songs weren't taken from the most popular or classic of the Christmas songs. Being performed by Paul Brooks, (or whoever)it was pretty \\"BLAH\\". I was actually prepared to buy these for several members of my family, but will definitely NOT do it now. I have two copies of this CD now and don't know what to do with the second one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Track Missing","review":"I am excited about this album. It has one problem that is irritating. Many of the songs end abruptly and usually without really ending. I think they tried to put too much on one album.GREAT MUSIC, too bad they short change it with almost every song.RB"},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant film!","review":"This simple story is another proof about the enormous talent of this argentine film maker . The decay and the last day about a teacher who decides to retire to a farm , the plans and the illusion with his wife are the central focus of the supreme film .Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting not enough","review":"Like most Aristarain's films, this one goes nowhere plot-wise. It is also peppered with presumptuous ranting and gratuitous, artificial dialogue, much in Aristarain's style. The actors make a very professional effort in trying to put some life in the starchy script and slow plot, but not even the skill of Luppi can prevent the movie from stopping dead when his character is forced give speeches on every utterance.A waste of acting talent, Spanish money and my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cured my reverse pivot","review":"This book cured my reverse pivot. I wish someone had told me about this earlier it would have saved me a ton of money spent on lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt the definitive women's golf book","review":"This book is loaded with information that makes for easy and enjoyable reading. I recommend it to my friends whether they are beginners or better players. It explains the golf swing so well. I just think this book is wonderful and gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for a beginner","review":"I got this book thinking it would be good for a beginning golfer. I was very disappointed. The concepts were much too difficult for a beginning golfer or just not well written or communicated to the reader. The illustrations weren't helpful either. A much better book for beginners would be the Golf Handbook for Women by Vivien Saunders."},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite","review":"My son gave me this book for mother's day and thank you David I LOVE THIS BOOK!

I even got some great music in Hatari. It was a win/win situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody Has One","review":"Although I have the 1989 version, 12 years later I'm still using it for trial work. Maybe it's the 18 perfectly-spaced, clearly labeled flip-tabs, starting with \\"relevance\\" and running through competence, privilege, admissions, demonstrative evidence, impeachment, hearsay (2 tabs), authentication, objections, and a few more. There's a section on offers of proof and parol evidence, too.The principles, key cases, and tactical pointers are set out in bold, bullets, and section headings. This book hits it just about right for the general commercial trial lawyer. It's especially useful to cite to enough detail in a hurry, to overcome the skimpy defense-lawyer motions defense lawyers tend to lob around the courtroom during trial.The 3 ring flip-book format has advantages to Hunters or Mauet; and bringing Mauet to court with you risks looking funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I've purchased a total of 12 controllers for our 2 cubes: these had the shortest shelf life. One died in the first week, the other made it a month. I got them for the small size for my kids' hands, and that aspect is nice, but they're just too fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 broke within a month","review":"I bought 2 of these so we could play gamecube games on the Wii. They worked fine for a little while, and my son liked the small size. However, one broke in 2 weeks (no functionality with the B button) and the other did the same thing a week later. We tried to take them apart to see if it was just a little mechanical glitch we could fix, but it wasn't.We went for the regular nintendo controllers this time, theGamecube Controller Black. These were 5x more expensive, but if they last at least 5x as long (that only being 5 months) they will be worth the price. These weren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Controller","review":"This controller is really good. I like the small size and it works just as well as one of the larger ones. The only reason I'm docking this controller one star is because after about 6 months the A button has become quite stubborn. It still works but you have to press it quite hard. I'm not sure if this is because of the controller or because of repeated use of the button. BUT this controller is still a great deal for the price. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent cheap controller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not wireless.","review":"I made the mistake of buying this product. It really does look as if it should be wireless, but it is not. Other than that, this is an excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Remote","review":"As soon as I opened the package I could see this was a cheapo product. I purchased it for my son because I liked the smaller size. He's 3 1/2. Anyway he quickly became frustrated with it and when I tried it out I realized the buttons were not responding properly. Needless to say I quickly returned it with no hassles (Thanks Amazon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky buttons, useless in a few weeks","review":"DO NOT BUY these controllers.

So we open the package plug it in and it shuts the whole system off. We tried 4 times and every time you moved the controller the slightest bit....POW! Down goes the whole game. I normally reply on reviews for product info in Amazon, so I figured it was a good buy. Yea, try explaining to a five year old that his \\"new\\" controller has to go back before he can even use it. Sigh........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, cheaper option","review":"This is a descent controller, especially considering the price. We have had it kind of quit working in the middle of a game a couple of times, but that may have been do to a young user accidently messing with the program button....Overall, a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for litle children","review":"my kids enjoy a lot playing with this controllers, perfect size for their litle hands..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gamecube Pro Mini Controller 2 not what is seems.","review":"I got this Gamecube Pro Mini Controller 2 on Dec 5.

However, I was unable to find this DVD for sale through amazon.com, so you may have to look elsewhere.The content of that DVD is two programs - \\"The Beatles Down Under\\" which features interviews with fans and a lengthy interview with John, Paul, George and Jimmy Nichol. The other program, \\"The Beatles On the Road\\" is a more standard history of the band but still interesting.However, this DVD, just called \\"The Beatles Down Under Plus On The Road\\" is sub-par quality. It looks like a screen was filmed and transferred to DVD, and in the process, you see a border on all four sides of the image. In essence, the video image is shrunk.

Jonathan Hunt. Fingernails scraping down a blackboard have nothing on his terrible, terrible style. His voice is raspy beyond belief, but that would be okay if he had any sort of timbre at all. He has NONE. Let me repeat that. He has NONE. What he has is a roaring whisper for a voice, which sounds suspiciously like an adolescent trying to imitate Rob Zombie.The only thing that saves this album from completely fumbling the ball is that the musicianship is pretty good.

Having killed the first one with no reason that I could come up with, I was super careful with the second when it came to the knobs and back plugs and also switched to LED rope lights to make sure the wattage was low.I stayed away for a couple of years after the second one died after 2 uses (literally).

The book is not only ambiguous, but poorly crafted with topical transitions sloppy. I can comfortably say that there is not a single section of the book that adequately unveils the dynamics of various convertible instruments or their pricing. Indeed, the book reads more like a glossary than an explanatory text and for persons new to converts, the spate of regurgitated pricing theories will likely do more harm then good. Perhaps the one strength of the text is that it serves as a broad reference for readers truly interested in converts to seek out more educative pieces.

They all work well, shipping was obviously handled by Flash Gordon and these phones were much less than the ones I recently saw at the electronics store. Small answering machine works good. You just can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a great purchase","review":"This phone system is almost perfect. It has good sound quality & it is easy to put a call on theloud speaker while you are talking. You can't take it off the loud speaker once you put it on, however.I would like to be able to take the call off the loud speaker if a friend happens to come into the room.That is a small irritation. The major concern (which might cause me to purchase a different system next time) is that the call indicator has a light only alarm to let you know you have received a message. I forget to look at the base unit (the only place a call indicator is located) to see if the light is flashing. I muchprefer a beep tone indicating you have received a call with a message. It is easy to go several days without knowing someone has left you a message. The unit I owned previously had a beeper and light, the beeper was optional - a much better system"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks distinctive ring feature for incoming calls","review":"I bought this system to replace an earlier Panasonic DECT 6.0 system that was starting to get glitchy. I have been happy with Panasonic, but this new phone system lacks a feature I had come to rely on: no option to set distinctive rings for certain callers. Four ringtones and 10 different melodies, but you can't set any of them to a specific caller, sadly. I didn't realize the distinctive caller ring feature was so important to me until it was gone. Definitely a deal-breaker. I returned this system, and am limping along with my old one (KX-TGA931) until I find a quality phone set with the distinctive ring option. Any suggestions? I called Panasonic, and was told that none of the phones they currently manufacture have the distinctive caller ringtone feature. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"We purchased these handsets after reading the reviews proclaiming their extensive range. Wow--what a disappointment.

I have a 2000 square foot house, so this product should be able to reach. I put the central base in the middle of the house and still had problems getting the 2nd handset to connect on one end--so, sometimes I would have to walk toward the center of the house to get it connect before making my call. Other than that, the phones worked well. More recently, the phone has started disconnecting me while on a call in the house. I've previously had great phones with Panasonic and will be replacing these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"A great unit and by far the cheapest I found it when shopping in Jan, 2008.

I gave it an overall rating of 4 stars because of two (for my use) significant shortcomings.There a several excellent features which include ringtone's and ring-melodies. Each instrument can have it's own distinctive \\"ring\\" - or none. The best feature is that you only need to program one phone, and copy all, or selective telephone numbers to the other phones. Very impressive. The clarity of conversations is also excellent, but the volume is limited in both the answering system and hands-free functions. The volume cannot be raised to a comfortable listening level in either of these functions.The other shortcoming is that there is no audible alert for new messages on the answering system. There is a average brightness LED that flashes when a new message has been recorded, but that LED is not really noticeable in common ambient room lighting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic KX-TG1033S","review":"This phones are working great.

I have never had phones that lasted more than a few years. I will always buy Panasonic phones.I have owned this phone for about a month and I really like the quality. I had good experience with my old Panasonic phone and decided to replace three odd phones with this set of three. The phones are great. The range is better than the 5.8 Ghz phones I had and the sound quality is good.Here are two considerations - I don't want to have the phone in my bedroom ring so I turned off the ringer. Unfortunately the messages still came through loud and clear. Also we really missed the talking caller ID (kind of like when the batteries go dead in your TV remote control - it still works but seems SO inconvenient). I solved this by plugging the old phone in and hiding it under some furniture.I'd definitely recommend this phone to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PHONE!!","review":"I was in need of new cordless phone and since my past 2 cordless phones have been Panasonic, I decided to go for it again.

We have only had the Panasonic TG1033S for one day, but it is already far superior to our previous V-Tech 5.8 gh phone. From the first time we tried it, all of the static and buzzing noises on the phone were gone.I do agree that navigating through the phone is a bit time consuming which is why it got 4 stars instead of 5. However, the guide is dummy proof. It tells you step by step exactly what button to press for what you want to do. The handset is extremely light weight. The phonebook is much better than on our previous phone. It lets you edit the numbers very simply--our old phone wouldn't let you do this. This also has a previous number called memory which I like. Transferring information from one handset to another is very easy and very convenient. As with any product, it is not perfect, but for the money, it is a good system.The time of shipping from Amazon was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"phone","review":"Good clear sound.This is replacing a old at+t tape unit.The one thing I miss is being able to leave a memo or keep the message for the next person in.It does have no memory aaa batts,thats one reason i chose it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"One handset defective, so now I must send to service center in Texas.

The Panasonic KX-TG10335's adaptor now works with 6.5 volts output making it impossible (I believe on purpose)to substitute for any of the commercially available adapters (they are adjustable to the following output voltage: 3 - 4.5 - 6 - 7.5 - 9 - 12 ...

Frequently when trying to use an auxiliary handset in other parts of our not-large house, we'll get the \\"move closer to base\\" message. When talking on the auxiliary handsets, the audio quality is frequently very poor with static and an under water-type sound. Several calls were dropped.

These phones are very clear and easy to use and have a long range from the base. I would recommend these phones to anyone! I only wish the type on the handset were a tad larger but other than that fantastic phones. Also I love the ability for my husband and I both to be on two receivers at the same time without any beeping. Lastly, picking up messages remotely works but I wish there were an easy way to delete all messages after retrieving them. Could be that I need to break down and actually read the instruction book that came with the phones.

Now one of the others is on the fritz, sometimes it works fine and others there is no display. Audio quality is ok, range is pretty limited - maybe 50 or 60 feet max.

Initially calls were very clear and it has a good range away from the house. But after a few weeks I would occasionally have a call with a very noticeable echo or reverb sound, and unfortunately now it's happening on most calls. It's really distracting and just not tolerable for us, so the phone is going back. Should also mention that one day the caller ID on my handset just wasn't working; it would say \\"incoming call\\" but never display the caller ID, though the other handsets were. Next day it worked fine. Still waiting to hear from the seller, but if they don't honor it then I assume (hope!)

Granted it has been years since I have used cordless phones. But these, sound great going both ways, no static or interference ever heard. The best part is the telephone memory functions, not having to remember memory numbers, but being able to scroll to the person that you want to call. Plus the ability to make a change to your stored names and numbers and being able to forward that change to all the other phones. But what is weird is if you change someone number, that is considered a new memory and you have to go to each phone to remove the incorrect number. There might be a reason for that, which just escapes me. The range is good, I can take on to my office across the street and it works, and have left then hanging on the table not in the charger and they never seem to go dead.

After you go through multiple phone trees and computer answering machines with questions--that don't apply-- you get hauled over the coals because you don't want to \\"hear frequently asked questions.\\" No, I just want the manual.Nope-- MAJOR PROBLEM.Looks like the best technique is to return the unit and make the seller replace it, and thus, cost Panasonic 2 units.What an incredibly stupid company these people have become, and how totally unworthy of anyone's business."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best I've found","review":"I was shopping for a phone system with answering machine after a recent move. This phone was the more comfortable - very lightweight and fits the hand very well - than all of its competitors. I don't know if the Dect 6.0 is the most advanced technology or somewhere in the middle, but the sound quality of both the handset and speaker phone (on all the handsets) is excellent. The equipment is simple, small, lightweight, and portable. Worth every penny (it's not the most expensive out there)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best out of three that I tried","review":"I had tried three other sets of phone prior and all had issues with range. This product has worked wonderfully since we took it out of the book. We have three handsets total in a single story house approximately 3,000 square feet.

We are very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One thing missing","review":"I like this phone a great deal - the sound quality is good and there are some great features.

I thought I remember reading some reviews where they said the range got better the more you used it and recharged this phone..... I can't get it to pick up when I'm outside unless I'm on the same side of the building the base is on. And my old Radio Shack cheapo has this one beat hands down in that dept.I have tried different makes, digital vs analog, different frequencies and have come to the conclusion that they just don't have the same range that they used to.

Only problem is we bought the same one 18 months ago and one of the phones stopped working so we had to buy it again. The panasonic system we had previously (for many years) was a bit easier to enter names into the phonebook from previous calls, but all around this phone is a pleasure, takes up very little space, carries over long distances, lets us transfer phonebooks from one phone to the next, and has a nice answering machine.

The reason I pulled away from Uniden was that I have high cheek bones and I would constantly disconnect people because of where Uniden had their disconnect key. It was a joke, that whenever I called someone that I would hang up on them. (That joke got old)The two phones were comparable - if you do not have high cheek bones you may wish to get the Uniden because it is a bit more programably friendly. Probably because I just got used to it. Uniden's battery never wore down for me, the Panasonic has once already. They are pretty much alike, I am happy with what Panasonic and Uniden are doing with phones.

I would recommend it to a friend.It has user friendly menus. Great sound. Good battery life. It has fallen quite a number of times and has not broken. I only gave it four stars because of some minor issues: 1. If you don't pick up phone until after the answering machine picked up it often keeps that answering machine running and records the whole conversation, and 2. It sometimes does have reception at some far extremes of the house (I have a large house), 3. So far I have not been able to figure out how to delete messages when dialing in from an external phone (Ps. when reviewing messages from one of the cordless phone, you can delete the message by pressing the clear button. I did not see this in the instruction manual.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, cute phones","review":"If you're anything like me, you're probably scared to order phones on amazon without having handled them.

I saw this set at a local store and was happy to find it cheaper on Amazon. The problem is that the sound quality of the phone is lacking. Even being within 15 ft of the base we get significant static-enough to interfere with a conversation-and even with the volume turned up all of the way they are not always loud enough (and my hearing is fine). I will be looking for a replacement phone system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but a couple annoying flaws","review":"Sound clarity and range are great. No interference.I was, however, annoyed to find that you can't use the phone if the answering machine is doing anything. For example, if someone leaves their number in a message, you can't start dialing and call while the messages are playing. The phone is \\"busy\\".Also, occasionally when you pick up the phone (any telephone I have on my home line, not just this Panasonic one) to answer a call, one or more of the handsets will continue to sound the ringing sound for about 15-20 seconds - continuously! Looks like some sort of software bug in the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible phones","review":"Will return phones for the following reasons: Dropped calls. Echoes.

To the caller it sounds like it just rings forever. I can't put a new answering machine in because the old one does something after 4 rings.I can't send the base unit in for repairs because none of the other phones will work while it is gone.I am currently spending time trying to find out what to do.We really like the phones other than this problem. The intercom system is great, sound is good, and speaker phones work well. The menu is a bit cumbersome but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of static - very disappointed","review":"I am so disappointed with this phone. I did a lot of research before buying this at the beginning of January and this one kept coming out on top. It has gotten overwhelming positive reviews so I decided to buy it. From day one the static has been awful, to the point where I've had to end calls because I couldn't hear the other person. I've moved the base away from all electronic devices and the static still continues. Since I'm still within the 30 day period this is going back and I'll go back to the drawing board on researching another phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best phone(s) I have owned","review":"This is by far the best phone I have owned. Everything about it is great, pleasant keypad beep, large keypad buttons, great quality speaker phone (my wife doesn't even know when I switch back and forth between phone and speaker), only needs one phone jack for all three phones, you can set the answering machine message from one of the phones, crystal clear audio on both ends, worth the price. We tried a cheaper GE cordless system and it was quite terrible. The phone would pickup interference from our overhead fans. As with all cordless phones, they will not operate during a power outage (we just have a cheapo corded phone in our just bedroom for Hurricane season)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a Cordless Phone that Works!","review":"Like some other reviewers, I have had tons of issues with cordless phones.

One of the handsets broke right after the 30 day return window was over. The other handsets don't work well either. They keep cutting out during calls and there is a clicking noise when I'm speaking on the handset. Yes, I'm very close to the base when speaking on the handset, and yes, it's not near any other electrical equipment. It's simply a TERRIBLE PHONE. So, after 3 months, I'm tossing in the trash and buying a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I've been using the Sony Dect 6.0 for 2 months now as a replacement for a Sony 900 mhz cordless product that gave us over 15 years of good service.

Try KX-TG6424T instead","review":"I am very happy with the ordering and shipping process but very disappointed with the range and voice quality. It is sad to see Panasonic has a product like this. I live in a 1600 sq ft townhouse, the conversation keeps breaking. I install the base station in my bedroom(2nd floor) and make call from family room(first floor). The other end of the call keeps asking me to repeat myself. Even if I move to closer to the base, the improvement is marginal. I tried for a few days and gave up. I went to Costco to buy the 4 phone pack model(KX-TG6424T) and install phones at the same locations, it is a different experience completely. The phone has a better make quality and feel better. Voice quality and range are excellent. But I have to say Amazon return experience is like a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Dect 6.0","review":"Good: Any phone can be used for most functions and the system keeps track on all phones. Clear Reception. Phone book can be transfered from one phone to another. Works better than my old phone, another brand.Bad: Slow response when using menu. Somewhat confusing menu items. Needs direct access to redial and caller id. NO MENU! My old (and still using it) Panasonic doesn't require fumbling thru a menu.I've read that some static with a lot of electronics. None that I can tell. Using 3 different cordless phones, wireless router, half a dozen remotes, wireless this and that, no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Quality","review":"We bought this phone system because our Uniden 5.8Ghz system would click and crackle whenever it was near the computer, TV or microwave. The people on the other end couldn't hear us or us them clearly. We had heard of the Dect 6.0 system and how Panasonic made excellent phones. We brought this 3 phone system for a good price hoping it would do the job. We were surprised on how well these phones have worked. Absolute clear reception no matter where we are in the house. The intercom system is a plus and transferring the phone book to the other two phone with a push of a button is nice. The only cons we have are that some basic features found on other phones are not present or take more digging into the menus to find them but we basically knew this already from the reviews we read. That's why we give this phone system 4 stars instead of 5. Once we set them up though they work excellent and we do not regret this purchase at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"multi-phones","review":"I bought this product having purchased several Panasonic phones-answering machines in the past. My former phones let me wander over my 3500 sq ft house and worke everywhere. I expected to be able to put the base unit in a central location and use the satalite units anywhere in the house. I could not use them that way. The the units cannot be more than about 50 feet away from the base unit and still communicate. The units work fine but have to be a bit close for my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"mr.","review":"Great phone. good reception,no static, and cheap price.over all Amazon experince was great. keep up good work ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone at a reasonable price","review":"Wanted to get my review added to the positive feedback.

They then need to be recharged before you can use them again. Panasonic has acknowledged that it is a battery problem and wants me to mail them in so they can repair, which is nice.

I put the main unit with the answering machine in the kitchen, one in my bedroom and another one in my office. So far I've been very happy with the purchase.

I needed headset capability because I work from home.There's also a cool intercom feature which lets you call another phone within your home.The only bad thing I've found so far is the answering machine speaker.

I don't think I have ever bought a phone machine that didn't have an audible indicator. On this system, the only way to know you have messages is if you look at a headset, or the base, and notice it's blinking. I don't know about you, but when I get home, I generally have a million things to do, and glancing at my phones usually isn't one of them. I bought these after returning another system (Vtech) that was great except that the handsets didn't have headset jacks. WHAT ARE THESE MANUFACTURERS THINKING? If you have no problem remembering to check for messages, this system might suit you just fine. But if you depend on that little beep, keep on looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound drop offs!","review":"When the sound is not \\"dropping off\\" and you hear nothing, the sound quality is great. We are working with Panasonic -their customer service people are helpful, retuning the package for a \\"refurbished set\\" - does annoy me that while it is only a month old, we get \\"refurbished.\\" Negative of the handsets, is that each one is independent - previous multiple handset phone we had if you cleared on handset (missed calls, etc), all were cleared."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"The best set of cordless phones that I have ever owned. I will stick with this brand. They work great with my Vonage Phone services."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long range? Not!","review":"I did a lot of research prior to buying this item, looking for a phone that would give me extended range. Many reviewers commented on the excellent range of this item, so I purchased it. My second handset now sits on a kitchen counter less than 40 feet from the base unit, just off a direct line of sight. Almost every time I pick it up, I have to walk towards the base unit in order for the handset to make contact with the base. I am extremely unhappy with this purchase - maybe I just got a lemon and the other reviewers are right, but my phone does not work as advertised.Update: After using this phone system for a few weeks, I hate it even more than I did at first. If Amazon allowed it, I would definately change my rating to one star rather than the two stars I originally gave it. The range is HORRIBLE!

Each time the phone rings it kills XBOX 360 Wireless connections and interrupts wired DSL connections even. It causes interruptions with VPN software causing multiple application crashes.

Panasonic will not respond to my inquiries. One star is rating it way too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"My recommendation: Don't buy this. It is junk.Within four months of buying this phone, one of the handsets conked out. The phone also doesn't have the speed dial facility.

Now it is clear that they haven't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reception & Answerer Quality etc","review":"The overall quality of the reception on the handsets was very poor. Mainly, due to not being able to get that far from the base unit before voice reception broke-up and became staticy. The quality of the answering machine was poor. I made the announcement, time and time again, and the recording always sounded muffled and difficult to understand. I'm not sure why they call it a 6.0 DECT when it operates in the 1.9GHz frequency range. I suspect this is what the cause of the inferior reception and the limited distance from the base you experience, when you notice the quality drop-off. I have a GE 6.0 DECT cordless phone system that is in the same cost area, that I would highly recommend over this unit. Save your time and frustration.

This one is no different.It's well made, easy to use, has a good feel, plenty of useful features and calls sound perfect, as good as any phone and answering machine I've owned.The only things I'd change to make this set better: Make it also available in black and add a \\"copy to all handsets\\" phonebook update option. (You can share phonebook updates between all handsets but you have to send from one handset to each other handset one at a time.) But those things are nits in the big picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear sound, less static","review":"I bought this to replace the Panasonic 5.8Ghz cordless phones that I had previously. I run a wireless network at home, and the interference was noticeable with the older phone. Fortunately, the Dect 6.0 works as advertised - I don't hear any interference or static on the phone. The other feature of this phone that works well is the speakerphone function. I can hear clearly and the person on the other side can hear me well also.What would make this phone nicer is if the ringtones could be customized. After a while, I tend to get tired of the limited number of ringtones."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do the job","review":"No problems with installation or use.

I was excited to have caller i.d. for once. However, this phone is disappointing. When I'm on another line and get a second call, no number displays to let me know who's interrupting the call. The volume doesn't go very loud. And throughout the course of a conversation, there will be a clearness in the quality of the call and then a muffled, still period which, at first, had me asking, \\"Are you still there?\\" I'm used to that happening now, but leaves me very disappointed.The pros: it's a phone. It has caller i.d. on the first incoming call. We have three phones throughout the house now.The cons: the overall quality of the call experience is poor; volume is poor; and you're unable to view the numbers of incoming calls when you're already on a call.I don't recommend this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic cordless phones","review":"Reception is very clear.

I like their home phone series. Many good features and I like the big keypad and the melody ring tone. But I am experiencing a problem with the battery. I went to vacation for 3 weeks and of course, after came back, the phones all ran out of power. When I put them on cradles to recharge, the screen displayed it was charging but actually not, put it there for 1 whole day and still stated charging. I have to take the batteries out and put them back, then it can be recharged. And I noticed the charging time is longer than the 5.8GHz phone.

Usually Panasonic phones have good sound quality and their wired phones are pretty much the best. The fidelity and sound quality on this phone is quite good. The wireless reception is solid.

This is my third Panasonic phone and it preforms as it should. I do not find that the range is any better than the 2.4 GHZ I had before, but I do believe that I get less static. The range on the phone is very good. I can walk outside my house as two houses down (200 feet about) before it get a little static. The thing I like the most is the remote bases do not need a phone cord, they only need a power cord to work. I wish it had a digital readout of how many messages I have, but I am sure another model does. You really can't go wrong with this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as it should","review":"I bought the Panasonic KX-TG1033S with DECT after some research, and the other reviews are pretty much on target.

Panasonic has really come through on this generation of cordless phones. These phones are really light compared to their older models. The new DECT technology really helps as these phones are crystal clear with no interference. I have my phone service through Cox cable with direct input into one those of GE insta-phone jacks that simply plug into an electrical outlet. I then have the base of this phone plugged into the other end of the insta-jack. So I use no phone line whatsoever and all 3 phones are perfect in clarity and performance.

However one of my children gave his brother one of these phones as a Xmas present and he had high praise for it so I decided to try one more time. I was very pleased with its performance and have subsequently purchased two additional handsets for use in the basement and both work extremely well and one is located a considable distance from the base as well as being on a different level. This is as good of cordless phone system as I have ever used and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of money","review":"These phones are terrible!

That may be true for most people, but all I received was static. I hooked it up all over the house plus in the garage and the reception was the same. Turned off all electrical appliances, lights, etc. and nothing changed. For some unknown reason none of the phones would work without static from even a couple of feet away from the base unit. My old 2.4 ghz phone worked much better.I emailed Panasonic, but didn't receive an answer.

We can hear the other parties but they can't hear us. It's not due to being too far away from the bases either. We'll be within 10 feet of the base the whole time. There will be good connection for 5 - 10 minutes and then it will cut out. It comes back after about 10 - 15 seconds; just when you're ready to hang it up as a dropped called. We do have great clarity hearing others when it's working though. Everything worked for about two months before the trouble started. I have received complaints that I can hardly be heard when using the matched Pansonic headsets too.With all the Christmas calls today it just became too much to sit by and not do anything about it. It's too late to return it to Amazon (3 months). I guess my next step is to see what Panasonic will do about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for about 2 months.....","review":"Works great for the first few months and then you lose reception 10 feet from the base.

I consider this Panasonic to be a downgrade, not an upgrade, and I am very disappointed. Compared to the ATT, which had a color display, this display is extremely hard to see. It does not have customized ringtones or graphics. The handset does not flash when the phone rings (so if you have more than one line you can't tell which one is ringing). I don't notice any improvement in sound quality with the new DECT technology. You can't tell if someone else is using the line by looking at a handset; the ATT displayed \\"extension in use.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"We've had this setup for over a year now and it's been good.","review":"After a year of use I can say that this phone setup has a lot of range, good sound quality, and some cool features that we use rarely but do come in handy, such as the speaker phone option and the headset jack on the side. My wife can plug a headset into it and get both hands free so she can walk around and do things while she talks.Also, they're not battery hogs.

It even keeps ice from melting for hours and hours. The lid is very tight and will not leak, and as long as you are careful, your beverage will not drip onto you (and burn you) when you unscrew the lid. The thermal doesn't have a handle or a ring to hold on to, but the outside will not hurt your hand, cold or hot.A definite negative is that though the bottle maintains its shine and looks wonderful, it does scratch very easily and is pretty easy to dent. This doesn't hurt the function of the thermal, but you'd have to be careful if you are one of those who likes their possessions to look great all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"coffee mug","review":"I love sigg products and tried this coffee mug. it keeps coffee hot for several hours. i love using instead of wasting paper cups"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thermal Water Bottle","review":"This water bottle lives up to it's reputation.

The one difference in this thermos is that it has a wider opening to be able to drink from.The top caps only function is to 'cap' the middle piece. The middle piece, that many seam to thing you drink from, serves only as a pressure release cap but nothing beyond that. You do not drink from the middle piece!To be a considered a MUG, Sigg needs to redesign the top, go with a slightly larger circumference so that it would not move about in our cars cup holder. You leave the cap off and you WILL have fluid all over you car. It will take two hands to open this thermos which is not good for driving.One thing is fore sure... this thermos does hold temperature really well. The paint is also fabulous.Would I buy it again? For the price probably not. It needs to be labeled a THERMOS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky, design doesn't make sense","review":"This product has a fatal flaw which causes it to leak your beverage.SIGG touts its \\"2nd lid,\\" which is basically an upper chamber (grey plastic part) that has two tiny holes which allow steam to rise into the that chamber. The problem is, once your coffee steam rises up, it then cools and condenses into a big puddle of coffee, and then leaks its way out of the upper lid (small metal top part).Am I the only one who sees this? This thing leaked all over my bag. The upper chamber is not sealed against leaks (the lower main bottle portion seals just fine).I can't return it now, so I'm going to seal up those two tiny holes to prevent liquids from getting into the upper chamber.Disappointing, that the feature they trumpet about (upper chamber has relief holes to prevent vacuum sealing of the bottom) is the one that kills this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Not A Travel Mug, It's A Thermos","review":"It's billed as a travel mug but this item is a thermos only.

The rest of the book does, like the other 1 star rating stated, use Lacanian jargon making it appear that they've come to some great understanding, where in fact they do not understand, or at least do not appear to since they cannot seem to explain what understanding they've come to, and delimit this understanding or try to make it greater than it is with fancy words. This may appeal to those that suffer from the ivory tower syndrome that still plagues what could otherwise be the rich field of study of psychoanalysis.

The famous master take which has been the subject of controversy here at amazon is the version released by RCA after Elvis left the Sun label. RCA edited the song by making a split of takes 2 and 4, leaving out the spoken part. Hence, if you want the RCA version, buy the remastered Elvis Presley (1956) album. Don't be fooled by people who haven't really purchased this CD and haven't taken their time to read the great booklet that brings all this information. This IS indeed the ultimate Elvis Sun Sessions masters album. Top quality!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why RCA, why??","review":"Great sound, actually incredible. I agree, the sun sessions CD needed to be updated, the rematered tracks are so much better, that they are a revelation now compared to that release. The sunrise edition, the one I own, is great, but is targeted mostly to fans who want to hear every alternate take and hissy live track of the period. But there is a lot of people that just want a concise CD, with great sound, of MASTER TAKES. Then why, oh why RCA, did you include an alternate take of 'I Love you because' instead of the master take???? You know why $$$$$$$$.

This is Elvis before he went to RCA and the rot set in. You need this music!BUT...19 songs is very stingy on RCA's part. That probably adds up to 35-40 minutes or so of music on a CD... this would be the ripoff part.Your best bet is to hunt down 'The Sun Sessions CD' (used, of course) which came out in 1987. A lot more music (28 songs, 72 plus minutes); more bang for your buck.And, yes, RCA did come out with 'Sunrise' a few years ago, but are you really gonnna sit through 2 discs, 3/4 of which are outtakes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"50 Years On","review":"Elvis Presley's Sun Sessions remain a basic reference point for rock and roll music and our popular culture. Assimilating r&b;, country, gospel, folk, and pop, Presley, along with sidemen Scotty Moore, Bill Black, and producer Sam Phillips created a true American synthesis, and the reverberations are still being felt today.This set is more concise than 1999's bulky SUNRISE and offers the tracks in chronological order with good liner notes and great sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Oh Baby, baby\\" it may be, but Elvis recorded it first (LOL)","review":"The writer of the review which precedes mine says he doesn't want to go into the details of who recorded \\"Baby let's play house\\" first. The Burnette Brothers and their followers have been saying, for years and years, that the Trio came up with \\"Oh Baby, Baby\\" totally on their own, I repeat, totally on their own, which means that thay fail to credit the person who wrote and recorded, in early 1955, the song \\"Baby let's'play house\\", which the Trio insists never hearing prior to their writing \\"Oh, baby, baby\\". That Gunther blues ditty is the song which Elvis adapted, after hearing it sometime in late January of 1955, then recording it, in February of that same year. That date is, in itself, a full year before the Trio recorded their \\"Oh baby, baby\\".Having cleared that matter, it would suffice to say that \\"Elvis at Sun\\" is the most essential recording that any rock student should own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clean, Sterile, and Awful","review":"I remember listening to my Dad's Sun Sessions LP back in the 70s as a kid. I also listened to the CD version issued back in the 80s or 90s. When I bought this CD, I was expecting that same sound, but what I got was a \\"clean,\\" sterile, completely dead-sounding version of the Sun Sessions. The echo and reverb, which were so integral to the magic of the original recordings, were gone.This version of the Sun Sessions is absolutely awful for that reason. In my opinion, who ever produced this version just doesn't get it. Rock and Roll is meant to be raw and raucous, maybe a little distorted and rough. That's what makes it so great, and that's what gives you goose bumps when you put on the old LP and hear Elvis, Scotty, and Bill tearing it up in a tiny little storefront studio in 1950s downtown Memphis.If you're a fan looking for that original Elvis Presley Sun Sessions sound, DO NOT BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"I love this book!I think the best part is when Trixie pretends to like Honey's cousin Ben.If your a Trixie fan then I sugestreading this book.Its not mystery like but it is a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing; strictly for continuity fans","review":"Substandard.

Compared with other E&E; books--Civ Pro, PR--this one was miserable.This book is entirely practice problems. Each chapter has about one page of intro text and then all the rest is problems. This is fine if you just want something to work through, but I much prefer the model of other E&Es; where you get a chapter of 5 or 10 pages that cover all the basics, and then a question section at the end. This particular format makes it too difficult to find any information quickly. And, of course, as with all other E&Es;, the index is so utterly useless that it's actually more difficult to find material if you attempt to use it.

I am not sure why the publisher chose this route, as color photos of most of these tanks are in abundance and easily obtainable. Black and white photos (even some drawings) do not convey the scale or manufacturing quality (or lack of) of these machines.

It is sad because these Indian children were taken from their homes and placed somewhere where they were to speak and act like someone they are not.

It looks and feels like a heavy, well constructed device, but looks are deceiving. The internal workings are not well made. It generally works to remove the cork, but fails to eject the cork at least half the time. You pull the lever one direction to remove the cork, which generally feels smooth and easy. Then you reverse the action of the lever to eject the cork. At this point you hear the internal mechanism fail with a plastic snapping sound, and the cork is withdrawn into the mechanism instead of ejected. As another reviewer has commented, you must then manually unscrew a difficult to reach cork. This is a ridiculously over-priced product.

Their customer service is in my opinion hard to get on the phone, unresponsive to requests, and has a uncooperative attitude. As this is an el-cheapo generator it appears that they have zero interest in being customer friendly.

There are a number of truly beautiful images scattered throughout the 112 pages.Unfortunately, many of the pictures are considerably less impressive. Some are extremely grainy and unattractive, some aren't well focused, and still others look like they have been shot using color-altering filters to poor effect. In addition, there is a heavy preponderance of sunset/dusk shots. Dusk is a great time to shoot photos, but when one technique is used in such great repetition in a single collection of photos the effect becomes monotonous and the photographer begins to look like a one-trick pony.The author is an experienced photographer and is obviously capable of producing very good work. Sadly, he too often settles for shots that are not worthy of publication in a book like this.

But it is still interesting to see what a Supreme Court Justice picks as the noteworthy events and aspects of our justice system.

I anticipated this book to be biography of her life, her decisions, and her life in the court; however, it is more like a history of the Supreme Court and the Constitution. It is quite informative, but poorly written. Organization structure is very confusing and she goes from one topic to another in a poor manner. Hard to follow and read. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy snoozer","review":"The book reads like a garden variety history book, with few insights strictly pertaining to O'Connor's own experiences. It doesn't feel the least bit candid, which is disappointing, and the writing style is windy and bloated.Seriously, was she getting paid by the word? Some of the sentences and paragraphs in the book remind me of my Business Communications class exercises where you are asked to re-write for improved clarity.O'Connor does bring up some truly interesting points, like how the legal language on Fourth Amendment Search and Seizures was initially uncontentious, and that all the litigation surrounding it cropped up later. Ditto for 1st Amendment free speech stuff. Unfortunately, you have to slog through a lot of blah blah to get to the good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but dry","review":"I read a lot of biography and I have tremendous respect for Sandra Day O'Connor. I thought, for sure, this was a win-win combination for this book. Sadly, I only made it three quarters through before I donated it to the local library. It is well written but dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"Like other books from Supreme Court Justices, this one is informative and interesting. It is very easy to read, probably more so than some of the others. The sections on law and history are very interesting. The section on women was not quite as interesting, but that was to be expected (focusing on a special interest as opposed to the broader scope of the court). The explanations of how the Court works is very good and something about which the public is often wrong. Overall, a good Supreme Court book."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of Constitutional Law and some interesting notes about judges.","review":"This book starts off in a dull way: the history of constitutional law and the judges who helped shape it. Later on Judge O'Connor talks about her perspective of the people she worked with, which makes it well-worth reading. I plan to read her other book: her life growing up on a Texas ranch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining historical","review":"I'm no expert on Elizabethan England, but this book seemed well researched, almost to a fault. It did tend towards exposition in spots, but I can forgive that for the sake of learning some history. The juxtaposition of headstrong, educated Lady Appleton in this vivid setting made for a highly entertaining read.Some of the foreshadowing was a bit blatant, and I thought the villain was pretty obvious. (Hint: In Chapter 4, pay attention to what is so carefully *not* revealed about the murderer.) But I had a great time following along, and the ending had some unexpected little twists. I look forward to more of Susanna's adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fading away, but soft","review":"\\"Bamboo\\" soft towels make a pretty picture in the bathroom.

My taste in Southern short stories tends toward Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, and William Faulkner, and these stories are of a completely different ilk. They're OK for light entertainment, but the writing is typically quite ordinary, many of them are predictable, and some are plain boring.

I absolutely LOVE what they did with this song. I envision being lost on a dark dance floor everytime I hear this song, which is usually in my car.

It does not focus very much on actual valuation methods, instead explaining the nuts and bolts of the sale announcement, due diligence, negotiation, and closing processes.Although the author, at times, uses the book as a commercial for his consulting business, this is not entirely a bad thing.

As a mental health professional I was vaguely aware of some of the potentials associated with healthcare information technology. Michael Freeny has alerted me to the depth of those potentials . . . both the good and evil. I must admit, I doubt I would have ever wadded through a technical description of this technology had it not been woven into a story that captured my attention. It was a great way for me to get some needed updating.As a novel to read on an airplane or at the beach, Terminal Consent is thoroughly enjoyable. It is a good read!

It was simply too similar to the recent film \\"Tombstone.\\" That might not be Parker's fault, entirely, because both that film and this book (and, I suppose, the movie \\"Wyatt Earp\\") are based on the same historical or legendary events. Still, some of the book seems extracted from the film intact. Most of the book differed in its specifics from the Hollywood version so that I didn't feel I was simply reading the screenplay, but it was disturbingly similar a bit too often. Still, it's well written. The narrative moves along nicely and the dialogue is sparse and engaging. I certainly enjoyed the author's attempt at trying to write a western - it was an easy, fun novel to read.If he ever reads these reviews, I'd be interested to get the author's comments on the similarity to \\"Tombstone.\\" Perhaps I'm way off here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Parker","review":"As an afficionado of Parker/Spencer books this is a disappointing effort.Halfway through, I was glutted with bullets,Winchesters,Colts, the way Wyatt holds his coffee cup,fried bread and bacon, etc.Parker has an obsession with Jewish women.

Watch Costner's \\"Wyatt Earp\\"? Throw in a little \\"Tombstone\\"? Buy into the myth Wyatt's \\"Josie\\" created for herself...and this is the woman (real name Sarah but who hid her Jewishness behind the name Josie) who gambled all his money away for over 45 years and then let him die of neglect. I loved the spotlight review from back in 2001, that bit of delicious parody up there - spot on, matey. In a few easy lines of perfect dialogue it captures the scope and style of this rather unimpressive book. Doc Holliday is intro'd as a southerner merely by saying he's a southerner...and then proceeds to speak in a coarse uneducated way from then on. Pooey on this book. Daniel P. Smith who wrote the spotlight review would have written a much better book. Probably has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Robert Parker but hate this book.","review":"Normally, I love Robert Parker books. However, Parker should stick to the gritty detective novels. The plotline is sketchy and at times hard to follow. It takes place in Tombstone, AZ and is the story or Wyatt Earp and the showdown at the OK Corral. Annoyingly, it does not even include the showdown, which is too bad because Parker is good at describing gunfight scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dwindling Effort","review":"As a former rabid fan of Robert Parker, especially the Spenser series, it saddens me to say that this book is just another of Parker's recent half-hearted efforts to put something in print. In Gunman's Rhapsody, he rehashes old plots and dialogues from print and movie script. The publisher, in collusion, allows it to go out with it's deceptive practice of meager word count, large font, and widely spaced lines. Robert Parker is tired folks. After so many great works, he doesn't seem to want to write anymore. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Robert Parker Novel that's a Terrible Waste","review":"I am such a fan of Robert Parker, particularly the Spenser novels, that I preorder them in anticipation long before their publication date. This book, Gunman's Rapsody, was an enormous disappointment. I love Robert Parker and I love western lore, so this was a double whammy as far as I'm concerned. Basically, this book is a scene by scene recap of Kevin Costner's film, Wyatt Earp. That's it. There was no real exploration of character and no real story. It was almost a novel based on a screen play. What a pity. And what a waste of time and effort. I can't believe I read the whole thing. Up until the last page, I hoped for it to get better. I am so disappointed. I will wait until publication before buying future Parker books. I feel I've been had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Travel for Spencer","review":"Have you ever put aside a Parker book, too bored to continue? This one was a first for me.Parker's protagonist, Wyatt Earp, sounds surprisingly like Spencer, and various other characters remind me strongly of Susan, Hawk, etc. The dialogue that delights when spoken in Parker's Spencer series, sounds flat here.Sadly, I don't think this Western book works, but I'll be eagerly awaiting his next mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parker Shoots and Misses","review":"Okay, maybe we have already been overexposed to the Earps, Clantons, Doc Holliday and the rest. But Parker just missfired in this \\"historical\\" retelling of the most famous story of the old west. The characters fail to develope. After awhile you just wish the shooting would get done. Where Parker's characters usually are multi-dimensional, here they are cartoonish.As usual, Parker is an easy read. I did get through the book quickly. But there were no surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book EVER.","review":"I have never read, nor feel i will ever read, a book like it. To tell you the truth I picked it up because of the shiny red dot on the cover and threw it on my TBR pile. It was only later that year when I went on vacation to the South Carolina shore that I picked it up again. After my normal fare failed me and the book I was currently reading dropped into a puddle of water, I picked up Gunman's Rhapsody. 8 hours later ( yes I finished the book in 8 hours... I don't know if that is good or bad ) I was a changed man. Shortly thereafter, I read it again. For any Robert B. Parker fan, this one is a must-read. For any Western fan ... it is a must-read. I am now a highly decicated Robert B. Parker fan. I also have to admit that I read \\"Appaloosa\\" with the same rabid intensity. Which turns out to be a bad thing since now there are no more Robert B. Parker westerns to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So awful only a name writer could get this published","review":"Positives: short chapters, quick read, and, for what it's worth, more historically accurate than Hollywood.Negatives: the characters are paper thin, the only way you can tell them apart is by their names, there is no suspense, no humor, the title that tells us nothing about the story is a clue to stay away from this.I don't know of a good Earp novel, but if you want a good Earp story, check out John Ford's My Darling Clementine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance for Parker","review":"Rhapsody is the story of Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, his love life, his brothers, and the shoot-out with the Clantons at the OK Corral. It's not the best version. I have the greatest respect for Parker. Looking for Rachel Wallace is a masterpiece of the modern mystery, the first mystery I ever read, and fifteen years later I'm writing them myself. I do whatever it takes to get a new Spenser novel, even though in the last ten years they've been longer on humor and shorter on action (with the exception of Thin Air). No matter. I could read a book with Spenser, Hawk and Susan doing nothing but sitting around a table, I'd be immensely entertained. But Rhapsody has none of the humor, none of the cleverness, none of the insight Parker is famous for. It's limp, boring, and dies on the page. It's a struggle to make it to the end. I love Parker, but there's no wit or humor here, no real plot twists, no life. Even the great ones put out the occasional dud. Sorry, Bob."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pains me, but....","review":"I GENUINELY hate writing this, as I'm a huge fan of Parker's work, but I'm also honest, so here goes...I've seldom been so disappointed in a book in my life. I've the feeling that Parker was going for a kind of \\"spare\\" feel to his prose in GUNMAN'S RHAPSODY, but all he managed was to make it feel thin, instead. And this could have been so much more.Is this evidence that Parker is trying to churn out books, rather than take the neccesary time to give us wonderful works like A CATSKILL EAGLE, or ALL OUR YESTERDAYS? I dunno, but if so, please slow down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good western","review":"I think this was a very good book and should not be compared to the movies. It is hard to write a new book on this subject since the two movies came out about them. It was an entertaining book and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strap On Your Holster And Prepare To Join The Earps In A Rip-Roaring Read!","review":"Parker's Gunman's Rhapsody makes you feel that you've been transported back to 1881 and life in a small western town (Tombstone)-- dealing with gun fights, cowboys and local politics, and working with the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, and their women. Since the book is based on historical accounts of the Earps and events leading up to the gunfight at the OK corral, much of the action is not surprising. However, Gunman's Rhapsody's main strength is in its very well-developed characters and its sense of the Wild West that seems so real you constantly feel the need to kick the mud off your boots, and to check your pistol to make sure you're ready for whatever trouble you're going to have to deal with next. If you are hankering for a good novel about an exciting era long past, Gunman's Rhapsody is highly recommended. Louis L'Amour has nothing over Robert Parker in books about the Old West."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parker's Name is Only Item of Interest in this Book","review":"Clearly, someone wagered Parker that he couldn't write another account of OK Corral gunfight AND sell it.The tipoff on this book is Parker's name at 5 times the size of the book title AND Parker's name is at top while the title is well at bottom of the cover.Do not buy this book; if you have to read it, get it from the local library. There is nothing of interest, nothing in the characters, nothing for a plot that you cannot discern in firstthree pages.Finally, this book fails the Dan Jenkins first page test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Touching lightly on the historical charactors, Parker delves deep into the scarred and fetid remains of Wyatt Earp's heart. There isn't a penetrating re-opening of Wyatt's past but, rather, a very intimate look into the man's hidden demons, his love for family and hid penchant for, however unintentional, causing pain to those closest to him.Parker hits a heavy blow to the traditional western with his relaxed narrative and dialogue driven story. As good, 'cept different, than any Spencer novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like it.","review":"Parker misses big time. He has ripped off the Costner film version of the Earp saga.

I have read a lot of books on Wyatt Earp and his travails in Tombstone. It is factually quite accurate, and this talented writer adds a great human touch by injecting into the background of his story both the use of the Josie romance (as a real motive for the Behen efforts to get Wyatt using the cowboys) and by using newpaper clippings of other world events that were going on at the same time in the world. And it will be hard to forget his almost poetic reporting of that shootout near Fremont Street on that cold October day. Robert Parker is always great at character studies and this is no exception. Virgil, Doc, Morgan, Ike, Curly Bill, Ringo, and even Bat and Allie get the bright light shone in their direction. It begins with Dodge City and ends immediately after the Vendetta Ride. Marvelous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of course he's a good writer, BUT ...","review":"this is not an original story here. We all know the characters and the places; there is no real depth of character or any new spin on the Earp story. This book is like any other western story ever told but without detailed description of the setting or the characters. Only the Earp brothers get much character description and except for Wyatt, its pretty sparse. The chapters are really short and don't flow smoothly. There is nothing new here. If you want to read a good western about Wyatt Earp and Tombstone look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE TABLE!!!","review":"HORRIBLE TABLE!!

Who would want to read a book about a dirty old man who never shaved? He made a spectacle of himself wherever he went. And he was ahead of his time only in being pro-Pinochet. The secret desire of all Chileans is to emigrate. Write a book about that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no pictures","review":"The pictures, that I hear are great in the paper addition, are missing from the electronic edition.

This book is a little bit slow going, and dull, but once I got into it I had to keep reading. I only wish the writer had gone into more detail about her relationship with her children and the Kennedy family. It always seemed to me that Jackie tried to shield her children from the influence of the Kennedy men, and I was curious to see if that was true. However, not much detail was given there. All in all, it was no earth-shattering work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hum-Drum read!","review":"This book read like all the others written about JBKO. There was nothing new here. The same old, tired facts about her life with JFK and Aristotle Onassis, and her life after the death of both men. She obviously achieved what she had always hoped to - privacy, because no has managed to write a book about this incredible woman with any new or unknown information about her. Bravo Jackie! A very dull book. Don't waste your time with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The mysterious Mrs. Kennedy","review":"She was a key public personality of the 1960's until she died in 1994. Worldly, cosmopolitan, intelligent, stylish, polished, and a woman with her own dark shadows ... Jackie Kennedy lead a life that was a living dream. From the White House to Park Avenue, Jackie left a trail of mystery and fascination. Her human side hidden from the public and a mind we came to know in her later years. It was sad to see her go at just 64 but she lived a grand life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading - Not Your Normal Tell All Book","review":"At first I was hesitant to read this book because I generally don't like to encourage the authors of \\"tell all\\" books. However, I was very curious about the life of Jackie before and after JFK. I really didn't know much about her life growing up, and was shocked to learn of the wealthy lifestyle in which she grew up. Most significantly, this book describes a woman who was extremely intelligent. I had no idea that she had such an educated background. After reading this book, I can appreciate even more the fact that she didn't give that much sought-after interview. Good for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another stab at her memory","review":"I have long been a fan of Jackie Onassis, as both a dedicated mother and successful career woman. But this book left me feeling that I wouldn't have wanted to know her, had I had the chance. It's really too bad that this kind of trash journalism can be published without the author being held accountable for sullying the memory of a wonderful woman. While I forced myself to finish this book, I was tempted to close it permanantly many times, as the author's arrogant writing style left me wondering why he even wrote it. It's gossipy, and petty, and reads like a conversation overheard at a garden party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugary Sweet","review":"It always makes me smile when I see reviews that praise Jackie as the ultimate mother. Look, as accounts from people who knew her will tell you she was an average mother; her kids went to boarding schools, and she had a great deal of help in the way of nannies and maids to assist her in being a \\"perfect\\" mother. jackie was an ordinary person; prone to selfisness, and keep in mind that she had a great oppurtunity to become a humanitarian (like A. Hepburn, and Diana). Did she though? No. I am fascinated by Jackie because of the private life she led and her extraordinary style and beauty. This book painted a laughably perfect image of her-she had no faults, and of course as we all know everyone has faults. For a more objective look at her life I would suggest \\"A woman named Jackie\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The memories of Judys' husband","review":"I don't see what makes people so outraged about this book. I never saw it as reading a biography of Judy. I saw it as a book written by a man who was Judy Garland's friend for over two years, and husband a few months, and his experiences being both. I was charmed when he talked about his surprise honeymoon in Paris for Judy and their starting a home in London, happy and full of bliss for the future. The way he told their story, what charming company Judy was, and how funny she was and so witty... I really felt that they were truly in love and loved each other. They had their little spats, and quick reconciliations. I must admit, though, that Deans' biographical look at Judy is somewhat depressing and a bit too shady for some tastes. But still, when he talks about his last few months with Judy as her husband, it brings a smile to my face... because, now I know, that in her last few days, Judy Garland was indeed- terribly happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Mickey Deans","review":"When Judy died Mr. Deans either would not or could not pay for her funeral and burial. Poor Judy laid in a temporary grave that funeral homes have for almost a year unknown to family & friends before daughter Liza had her mother properly married. What a lame excuse for a man. A shame, Judy could have done much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weep no more, is a sell out","review":"I have read Me and My shadows by the lovely and very talented Lorna Luft. Her book is about a loving mother who tried hard to stop her addiction for her family. Mr. Dean's book is about a has-been movie star who was overbearing and who wanted to feed her addiction. This book is a horrible tribute to the legend of Miss Judy Garland. I was outraged at this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor tribute","review":"Unfortunately this book by Mr. Deans, the late Ms. Garland's last husband, comes across as an attempt on his part to cash in on his \\"connection\\" to this great and much loved personality.

Appears to be written by someone who looked up Dylan in the encyclopaedia but knows little about the music or the man. The accolades on the back cover are a joke.

These being the first four issues of the new \\"JLA\\", I would have thought they would have taken more time in developing the characters, interaction, and story. None of that is here. It's non-stop action without a frame of reference to go by. Imagine taking a handfull of fight scenes. Now put all the panels in a blender and mix them up. Try putting them back together. You have extra pieces? That's ok, squeeze those panels in there somewhere. The reader is only 8 years old and doesn't know better. NOT!

The art is decent, but the stories are horrible. There are NO good enemies for this team. Until someone comes up with some good villians, the JLA can never be as good as their individual members. The only good part in this book is when Batman fights alone against the villians."},{"rating":"1","title":"JLA new world is an example of bad writing!","review":"The story was so unintelligent that it read like a comic book that comes with a happymeal. In other words, cheap promotional ploy. The hyperclan were such crummy enemies that I think Superman could have cleaned all their clocks even without the help of the JLA. Since when did Superman needed help? Flash and Green Lantern's lines were corny efforts at trying make conflicting characters in such a short 4-issue mini-series. It just doesn't work. I'm no English major, but at least I know good story-telling from bad. Grant Morrison should start watching Superfriends cartoons to find out how the real JLA should be like!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating, Disappointing","review":"I really don't know what so many people have seen in the JLA stories written by Grant Morrison. I, myself, was one person that was induced to bye this book and the second book \\"American Dreams\\". I have to say that I had to make an effort to read this first book entirely, the second one starts with a story so bad that I couldn't read the rest. I only may conclude that I was deceived! This is certainly not one of the best works with JLA, nor Grant Morrison's best work. I think that Grant Morrison would have write a far better work if he continued writing Vampirella books, where he was (again) by far more creative, and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Brilliant Stuff Here","review":"Storytelling at its best....almost. The part where Flash kicks Zon's butt is amazing, as is Batman's single-handed whipping of the Hyperclan's members. However, some parts of the story are sketchy and vague. eg, there is no real body to the capture of the Flash and GL by the Hyperclan....it just happens.All in all though, this is a good book and definitely worth the read. My only complaint is that Superman spends pretty much the entire story whining...and most of the cool stuff is reserved for Batman.Nevertheless, pick it up if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautful Photography of Georgeous Architecture","review":"This 511 page book by James Neal is a must buy for any architect, travel buff, or anyone who enjoys architecture. This book talks of Architecture's great history in an introduction, then captivates the reader by bombarding his senses with extraordinary pictures. These pictures probe the prehistoric dwellings made by ancient people, it explores the great roman Architecture that spans centuries, and shows modern Architecture in its entirety. The bulk of the book portrayes Architecture in beautiful color picture form, so the reader can fully experience the Architecture, without boring opinionated documentary. In my opinion this book is a great addition to anyone's collection. Personally I have two copies one for home, and another that helps me in my studies, it is a wonderful resource and a great entertainment tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the (money)","review":"This was Katharine Hepburn's first starring role; she looked divine.

I liked learning all the PUA acronyms and game terms like the \\"neg\\", a disparaging remark often said with a big smile that throws the girl off-balance and taps into her primal instincts of attraction. The first time I tried \\"negging\\", the girl pointed at me and I thought I was busted, but then she broke into a HUGE smile and said flirtatiously \\"Hey, that's not nice!\\" I was in.

He was entertaining and comfortable to be around. I had no idea he was working a seduction plan, but I'm not surprised.The book explained it all.

Very interesting and entertainning. Will change your perspective on life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious book!","review":"Book came in good time and in great condition, so overall good service.The book itself is absolutely hilarious. You'll be laughing and learning a lot. Neil Strauss makes fun of Mystery (host of MTV's \\"The Pick-Up Artist\\")a lot. He also talks a bit about his and other gurus' methods of picking up chicks, what he believes works and doesn't work. Incredibly interesting and entertaining. Also, try \\"Rules of the Game\\" by Neil Strauss for a good sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"If you are looking for a how to pick up girls book this is not the one. It is very entertaining and well writen book about a man who undertakes this journey. It may give you an idea on were to go to pursue more knowledge on how to pick up woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pageturner","review":"Before I get to the book, I should review the reviews. Heady stuff. Half are from the same Internet troll using different names. And all the reviews combined only go to serve the point of this book, which chronicles a fascinating and bizarre men's subculture full of social genius and destructive ego. It verges on the brink of being a mainstream movement yet constantly sabotages itself with in-fighting.Oh, about the book: this is an amazing story. Period. It tells you the how-to along the way, but it reads like a novel. It's up there with The Dirt on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a Pick Up Book...","review":"This book is amazing. I started it on sunday, and i finished it on wednesday, its that inticing.The way Neil Strauss writes will captivate you and hold your attention for more than just one sitting (as you can tell by me), and the story will grab you by the throat. Sure you get some insight to pick up girls, but its more than just that. Neil's story is extremely interesting, one like no other.Highly suggest this book, one of the best reads i've had in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game vs. The System","review":"This has clearly become more of a blog than a review for this book. I think we're having the Players Ball here.Either way, I think it's valid to compare the best of the best. I agree with the other reviewers. The System is more of a seduction guide that provides excellent techniques to do f-close (have sex with girls) based on body language etc. The Game is a brilliant work of literature that shows guys how to approach girls and how to hook up and get phone numbers of HB (Hot Babes) in otherwise difficult situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like exaggerations & poor writing skills, you might like this misogynist book.","review":"I really cant believe that someone would want to read this book.(although I did, from a recommendation) Its full of poorly developed characters and not any substance to it. Its such a boring read, about the LA pickup artists in VIP rooms, etc. etc. Its not even a congruent story line. If I where to compare it to a movie, the movie would be Gigli. Save your money and get an entertaining read at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech blech blech","review":"Francis Bacon noted that \\"some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.\\" And then there's this book. Spit it out, then rinse with Listerine, and maybe even wash your mouth out with soap for good measure. It's not worth the paper it's printed on.

This book did it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Honest Review - and no I am not part of the community, nor do I know the author","review":"Firstly I seriously doubt that this will make it to the big screen. This would have to be the most overated book I have ever come accross - just read some of the reviews people have been giving them. My advice is don't pay attention to them they are people trying to profit from the book, writing in false names. If you want an honest review here it is.This book is a big let down. If your not in the Internet community like myself your not going to like this book. The whole time throughout the book their is so much different stuff going on I kind of didn't know what was going on. As for the tips on picking up girls, their not that great. The only thing that I liked about this book is the presentation with gold tipped pages but thats about it. Amazon has really got to do something about this review board because this book isn't even close to five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"SECRET eh? give me a freakin break","review":"I would like to be kind. Since I admire the creative work of writers. It's something I certainly can't do well. However, something about the book didn't sit right with me. Now coming here, I know why. Most the books \\"secrets\\" - and even Characters and story line - are already plastered on various forums, etc,all over the net. For free! Just do a search. So the book is an elaborate copy and paste affair.And the only true secret I find, is who is the most agressive marketer here . Look around - Im a bit shocked that everyone in the \\"book\\" is here waiting for you to drop your money. For that I will have to take 1 star off my review. In my humble opinion - this is really an informational of sorts, NOT a legitamate book. Amazon I believe your TOS says no url posting allowed, why are you permitting this carnival of sales people here? Memo to Neil Strauss - please try for more credibility next time - you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"another boring pickup book","review":"This is \\"NOT\\" a book to pickup women nor does it give any pickup lines. Its about a bunch of guys get together and tell about there darkside. If you are looking for pickup lines watch \\"hitch\\". After the first couple of pages i fell asleep. I wasted $25 on this book. If you are looking for style pickup women watch james bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to swallow","review":"Anyone in this community will tell you that the stuff in this book is way overexaggerated to the max. The whole concept of cashing in on men that don't have a clue on how to talk to women is why it has come to this level of success.The authors made a commitment to start writing a book on how he's gone from AFC to PUA and probably had it planned from the start. Who's to say the went out over the years didn't get laid as much as he said and when he didn't get laid he would make the rest up for the book.I mean come on, he's an author he just happened to become the worlds greatest pick up artist and write a book about it too, I think the guy plotted the story line even before he got started. Its a bit of a joke.Anyone with half a brain can see through this.But the funny thing is the book will sell becuase once again he's cashing in on the guys who will try anything to be successful with women."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSULT TO WOMEN","review":"I had no idea what I was getting when I read this book.

Gave a real insight to 'the community', as well as a much-needed reality-check for those of us in it.I think the book shows us the bigger picture of what can be achieved, and what we can expect to get out of the community and our associations with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's amazing what Jeff Madison is doing!","review":"[...]I have been in the community for three months, and I just want to say something. For all you guys out there, THIS IS TRUE. Utterly, completely true. However, the events are overdramatized. And the people who say the Game (the actual game) is misogynistic, you're wrong. We're just trying to level the playing field. Realize that when you want to PUA, you must improve yourself. It is a journey of self improvement. If you do decide to pursue this path, know that you must forget about Neil Strauss, forget about the game (the book). The book is really entertaining, but barely scratches the surface of pickup. Please do not suddenly run out thinking you're a player after reading this book. Becoming a PUA takes from 6 months-3 years. Jackmal out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Neil did a fantastic job with this book.

Im 40 something. Ive been OK with women, but found myself falling from one disaster relationship into another. I was needy and lacked self confidense. This was the book that changed everything. I began a study of the seduction community. I even went to one of Mystery's boot camps. That was a trip. After that I studied the works of David Deangelo, Robert Greene, Sinn, Mehow, Hypnotica. It changed my world from one of scarcity to one of plenty. Im see women now that I could only dream of before. Seduction is an art..... and it can be taught and learned. This is a good place to start. It takes alot of work and persistance, but the pay off is big. Be careful...... once you go down this road you cant turn back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Eye Opening!","review":"I have to say that this is a great book.

I recommend this highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book; lousy customer service.","review":"The book is more than a \\"how to\\" book. It is a very good (true) story.

Don't hold your breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern pickup strategy history","review":"If you're looking for pickup strategy, I recommend Double Your Dating by David Deangelo.

The reason I gave it four stars is because you aren't really being truthful to the woman. You use rehearsed lines to pick get their number. But, they do work.It is pretty gross that women respond to the advice in The Game. Why can't we just be nice guys? Maybe this is where the saying \\"nice guys finish last\\" comes in.This book did give me confidence to walk up to a woman and be able to have a conversation from scratch. It is not scary I have just always psyched myself out.Good luck but don't take it too far. Some of the stuff in this book is a litte out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhhhh!","review":"Not sure who are all those that gave this book high marks. After reading the Reddit AMA with Neil Strauss I thought this would be a fun read or listen as I purchased the audio book. It's not fun. It's brutal. The best way to describe it? It's what 16 year old David Copperfield thought picking up 20 year olds in clubs was like as written by an 18 year old. If you're 16 you might enjoy this and I guess that's why most of Reddit thought it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and funny","review":"I had a good time reading this book but there is so much info that i was lost after a while so,i started to read other books mentionned in this one(neil strauss) and then i read it again and everything made more sense.My life has changed completely since then....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game vs The System","review":"I think these are 2 excellent books. I enjoyed reading both books and frankly use ideas from both books to meet girls. I'm not a part of this or any community nor do I wish to be. I think you can learn enough from both of these books to go out and have some success with girls.The difference between these books are - Strass has never intended for this book to be a pick-up guide. In The Game he wrote \\"I want to write literature, not give advice to horny adolescents\\".Valentine (the System), on the other hand in his book stated: \\"The goal of the System is to be able to meet a girl, seduce her, take her home, and have sex with her.\\"Clearly different goals, from the horses (or studs) mouths.

Sure it had it's twists and turns but I was expecting something completly different.There is a geeky aspect towards this book that at times makes it hard to get my head around, so I did find it a bit hard to read. Mabey this is one for the Internet fans out there, not for your average joe.Thought the characters were well thought out, it just didn't sit with me well that this secret society turned out to be a bunch of geeks. Apart from that I enjoyed it, but wasn't blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book was great because it has lots of specific information to improve your game, and the plot and flow of the book make it enjoyable to read.

The the most thoroughly joyless,boring book i have ever read. The cover looks like a james bond movie, but the inside is not what your looking for.

In saying that I didn't enjoy the book as I was constantly looking through the glossary feeling a little bit geeky myself (I'm actually embarrassed I know what all these abbreviated words mean).I just wish someone would have told me who the community is made up of and I wouldn't of wasted my time on this one.SPOILER: the community of pick up artists are actually made up of geeks.I'd be waiting for this one in the bargain bin folks, it's a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revenge of the Nerds 4 - The Game","review":"Not my cup of tea, I guess you have to be inside the community to like this book.

It is not about how to grow and develope a meaningful and lasting relationship. For most young healthy and inexperienced men it is the perfect book to help them overcome and grow out of their shyness, fear, and confusion in dealing with women. And that is what young men need most. Women can be difficult for men from all ages and walks of life, one wrong woman can easily ruin a mans life if he is not very careful. This book tells you how to take charge of your life men, read it before you even think of saying hello to another female. The stuff they teach in school is crap, this is about what it is really about in dealing with the most dangerous creature to ever walk the planet, the human female!!!!

Are these reviews from independent readers or are these people affiliated with this author? I found this book to lack substance and does not provide pick up techniques i was expecting. If you like to read about a group of PUA'S and their shallow private life style then buy this book. The author has no in depth study on female psychology or any academic credentials.

It was absolutely disappointing and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"book fell apart","review":"The font on this version was so small I needed spectacles and the nearly every page of the book fell out after about 3 sessions of reading.

It is covered like a Bible but it is about the dating game. So I perused through few pages and decided to buy it on Amazon.I was really disappointed this book was ONLY about mindless stories of picking up women. You can call it case studies of supposed studs picking up women in LA. After about 100 pages, I realized the whole book was about stories of picking up women, and I still had another 230 pages to go. You can only write so many different stories of the same topic and still be intersting.What is sorely lacking is any real understanding of relationship between men and women. Sure, the book provides some insights into picking up women, but anyone who has been in some relationships know picking up women is always the easy part.This book has 331 pages of mindless stories of picking up women which is not even the most challenging aspect of relationship between a man and a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Style might say - 'Awesome'","review":"Truely a great read - it will make you think . . and not just about approaching women with the aim of seducing them. It goes to the heart of how people are perceived in the daily interaction with others, and how you might influence that interaction to your advantage. The benefits of this obviously have broad appeal in the business world, your career and all of your relationships, whether with new people, friends or family.However, it's not simply some self help kind of book, it goes a lot deeper than that. It's full of well developed characters - who happen to be real people, but not celebs - so it's got a reality TV like drama to it - no simple plot lines with a happy ending - just real people and what they get up to when they devote most of their existance to the singular pursuit of winning over women. It also gives some insight to our own inner workings, our insecurities and how they can affect our approach to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulls*** for Kids","review":"These guys use fake lip rings, wigs, hats, scarfs and other Bulls*** to look like the Peacock in the room.If that is what you are willing to do to bed a girl, think of what kind of idiot girl you are going to end up with.There are some interesting elements regarding giving negative responses immediately when a girl gives you an uninviting indication. There is some merit in this book.It might be worth the read for some insight, but not the end all novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game","review":"This was a very good buy!

Stauss takes you through the exciting beginnings of his ascent to \\"Master Pickup Artist\\" to a plummet that reveals the underlying insecurities and the futility of the lifestyle.He makes no attempt to bash or insult the \\"pickup game.\\" He loves it! But ultimately, it has enormous negatives... which he doesn't reveal until he himself discovers them.Worth reading for any man considering getting into \\"the game\\" himself. Take every word to heart. Strauss writes no spite, no warnings to eliminate competition or attract wingmen... just pure honesty. I'd write more but my keyboard is shorting out. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all play!","review":"This book was very fascinating! From beginning to end I didn't want to put it down. I started the book with a different mindset then I had closed it with. You get more about life and the struggle people go through than expected and the end results of the lifestyle which they have chased.

Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"I had heard about this book for years and decided it was finally time to read it.It is a very good read and an entertaing book. Although some of the strategies/methods they use seem to be geared towards a younger crowd 20's - 30's, sadly, are true of many women. Women have a very strange psychology and attraction strategies.One thing I like most is that when you are confident in approaching and attracting women then you won't put up with some woman's BS and she'll pick up on that. She's value in that, she'll detect you won't tolerate it, don't need it and she won't act like a little brat so much.This book discusses some very basic yet true principles that are constant between men and women. I haven't finished the book as of yet, I am about half way done, and although they seem to be good at attracting women the book does not discuss how to keep one and have a relationship. But that's not why we're buying the book, is it? So, just know that going in."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun read","review":"I read this book because of the hype surrounding it.

As interesting as it was, however, I felt bored at times, simply because some mundane events went on and on or were similar enough to be repetitive.

Sense of humor will improve her mood and she will associate that with you. Being a gentleman will appeal to the primitive sides of her brain. If you are caring and respectful to her, you will be a good father and husband. You are the right one to raise her kids.Finally, every technique will work sometimes.

Wish there was more about Mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BLEND OF ANECDOTE AND RESEARCH","review":"It was a fun read and it can be pointed out that Kevin Doyle and Robert Greene have written books on this same subject, and both of those authors seem to share the opinion that the universal qualities women look for in a mate are confidence and status, notwithstanding all male efforts to be seductive or socially superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Shallow, stupid people successfully pursue other shallow, stupid people. Great storyline! I can only hope that my son, when he's grown, won't regard himself or women as lowly as the \\"PUA's\\" do, and that my daughters will be able to spot empty-headed, sleazeball opportunists like this from a mile away. This book, when read between the lines, might have a purpose, though, in that it's a bleak reminder that young people are desperately in need of finding some legitimate meaning to life (and, no, I don't mean endless sex partners)."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no magic pills!","review":"I think that Neil Strauss wasn't really a nice guy or a nerd and that he had a lot of social proof just by being himself: a guy who knows famous people.The book the game just paces extremely well the reality of most guys who are bad with women. And he was very good at that!When you paces the ongoing reality of another person then they're ready to be led into your world.What was Neil Strauss's world? self promotion and promotion of guys like Deangelo, Zan, David X, Steve Piccus, Hypnotica, Tyler Durden, Juggler (Wayne Elise) and, of course, Mystery!If you want to have success:1 - pace a fundamental need that isn't fulfilled in the life of a lot of people.2 - Then, offer a kind of solution in exchange of money (even if it doesn't work), and you'll get money.I threw my copy of this book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"This is just an attempt to gain popularity and the mechanisms in this book are childish, but the overall premise is the same if people can get past the pony show. Just be open and confident and you should be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"is Neil Strauss for real??","review":"no, I don't think so. This book is, of course, BS. I doubt he ever slept with that many women. People love to brag, but what you say/write is not necessarily what happened. Helps him sell the book to socially awkward and retarded individuals who most beautiful women wouldn't give the time of day to, not because the guy didn't have the right technique, but because she's just not interested.Think about it: human beings have been meeting and falling in love since time began. You DO NOT need a book to tell you how to do it, go with the flow and let nature take its course. You also do not need a book to dupe you into thinking you can get anyone you want (unless of course you are extremely good looking and/or rich), because that's a lie. Only seriously sad people would want to read a book like this, or take any of his or his PUA artists friends' advice which is total BS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can some one please put this book in the fiction section","review":"Before you read this book I would warn you not to take it seriously. The information that he gets from this so called secret society can be posted by anybody. Its basically the blind leading the blind, a bunch of geeks psyching each other up to go talk to women.I'd bet that the author has got sucked in to this and realised this fact a bit too late but he'd already put so much time and effort into trying to come up with some sort of story for a book that he's made most of the stuff up just so it sells.I've seen the guy been interviewed and notice how he keeps using is girlfriend (he finally got a good one now he calls it quits) to try and demonstrate he's successful with women. It's pretty lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game vs The System","review":"Like others, I think it's interesting to compare the Game (Neil Strauss) and the System (Roy Valentine). I've read both books and think they are the best. Here is a summary:The Game looks at the underworld of men in search of the sciences of seduction. The book is compelling as it shows the journey of the main characters as they learn and improve their skills in approaching and bedding women. It's an interesting book that is well written. It acts as a window to another world that most of us can only imagine.The System focus is a 5-step process to pick up women in any situation. The steps are fairly simple and easy to follow and is supported by examples throughout the book on how to use them to pick up girls the same day you meet them.The System is primarily a seduction guide. The Game is about Strauss' adventure in the world of seduction. I would recommend both book for anyone interested in learning more about seduction or the world of seduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I started reading this book and just couldn't stop. The amazing thing about it is that it is a true story. The author is engaging and takes the reader with him as he explores and then masters the skills that most guys only dream about. If you have ever been just a little bit frustrated about how to interact with women, this book will really open your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow this one is amazing","review":"Style has laid it out here, the answers to all the questions. I wish someone had told me this stuff when I was in High School. This is NOT a book about how to lie to women. It's a book on how to be the kind of person they will be attracted too. How to tease them, tempt them, the common sense stuff you never think of when you are stuttering through a hello to the Hot Babe who just walked up. No hocus pocus metal BS like some of the books available on here. This stuff works. I highly recommend it. It also presents the down side of playing the game all the time. Excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, interesting","review":"These guys aren't as good at picking up as they make it sound.

This is \\"the book\\" to mould you into a PUA! What separates NS from most in the Hollywood Project, is that he had a job! His writers background serves him well since most PUA books are quick reads. That's not the case with The Game. A fascinating look at pickup yet one that also goes full circle. It took two years of training to reach the lofty status of World's Best PUA! Lots of time, studying, exploring, taking chances and honing his skill didn't happen overnight. What's humorous though is the one time AFC resorts to old school rules when he finally finds his true love. When it's love, everything just flows. However, if you're looking for a confidence builder plus different approach to meeting woman, I'd say this is the best and only place to begin. The bar is set here and all other's are a notch below. Side note: I was stunned NS didn't kick TD's sorry butt when he had the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"I found the author merely bragging about himself....nothing new.....no new technique....seems details made up.....boring.....1/4 thru the book I threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Book","review":"I am recently single and have had a blast reading this book.

I've never really had a problem of talking to women, but didn't know really what to say. I'm not like a pocket nerd or anything, but found that some of the ploys in this book REALLY work. The book itself is interesting and easy to read but everyone must know... in my opinion it IS a work of fiction. Some of the people and stuff in this book may be actual, but you have to keep in mind that most likely the events are of fictional nature. I've recommeded this book to several of my friends who were amazed that it's not so hard to talk to women."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended","review":"I bought this book on referral from a friend who spends weekends trying to 'pickup'. I'm glad I took his advice. This book can be taken in two ways, on the surface its a eye opening and at times hallarious account of Neil Strauss' journey to becoming a PUA. For guys who want to know what it takes to get the woman they really want its a source of inspiration and information. But you can also take a deeper look at what this book means to you, if you look closer the book speaks volumes on human interaction in general, how to best market yourself and impress people (well mainly women!) I found myself laughing out loud in some parts. At best it challenges the way you think about women and how you interact with them, at worst its an easy, funny read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book For The Socially Crippled.","review":"I Don't Recommend this Book if you:ever had sex.ever gone clubbing.ever made out with people.this book resembles a late night infomercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I couldn't put this book down for 2 days.

However, now that I look back, this book had little to do with actually helping my \\"game\\". You learn a few new volcabulary words, and have a few \\"Aha..!\\" moments, but nothing I found particularly useful in my situations. It gives an overall synopsis of what must be done, but no wisdom to guide it. In fact, I found it a bit insulting and slightly misleading. It SAYS penetrating the secrets, and shows his journey to become what he is now, but the book contains very few of those secrets. Kind of like a Magician Guide, which says you have to be quick, smooth, and charming, yet doesn't reveal the gimick of the trick. Sorta wish I spent my money on something that actually gives me facts and causes (like Carlos Xuma explains...which, BTW, I am skeptical of his book as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will find a new home on top of your toilet stall.","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I was even a bit anxious to read it because I was so excited...until I read it.Style's writing is very bland. If I had to sum up his storytelling, it would go something like this: Okay I see a hot blonde in the club, next I need to use one of my lame pick up openers (Did you see the two girls fighting earlier?), then I need a gimmick to entice her even more (Want to see a magic trick?), then after all that she either gives me a number or brushes me off.I can't imagine any girl falling for Style's techniques. The girl would have to be deemed mentally retarded to be aroused by his approach. If The Game were made into a movie, I would say it would par with 300 or Clash of the Titans.

Their advice is doing one thing that our world needs less of: 40+ year old immature guys trying to be something that they aren't.

Many people, some men included, may find it offensive. If you're socially conservative, you may want to steer clear.Strauss is an excellent writer and this book is very engaging. It's a story about his own personal foray into the world of pickup artists. I don't know whether it's all true or not, but it doesn't matter much. If you read this book as an engrossing story, it's a page turner.If you're looking for a manual on seduction or pick-ups, this may not be the best place to start.

It is NOT, by the authors own admission, the pursuit of a long term relationship. Nor is it, by my deduction, the pursuit of a virtuous relationship.

I liked this book so much that I bought a copy to loan out to my patients. As you can tell from the title, the author has a good sense of humor, but she deals seriously with the challenges that she faced and other suicidal individuals face. She shows that she's been there and she is not handing out easy answers. She really knows how suicidal individuals think and function. I found her story uplifting because she was sick for so long that one would be tempted to give up hope for her, and yet she clearly has come out the other side. I also liked that she explains that it was a long process, no overnight flash of insight, and that she still needs to keep vigilant for slipping back into old habits. She's not promising that one day life will be a bed of roses. The advice she gives is practical and sensible from my 30 years of experience in mental health."},{"rating":"2","title":"one person's guide","review":"This book is, as the title says, one person's perspective. It has lots of useful suggestions for coping. It helped me by being an example of someone who suffered like i have. The part that disappointed me was that the author insisted that people trying to commit suicide dont really want to die. instead she says they are making gestures to call attention to themselves. Though this can be the case many times, other people are very private about their attempts and serious about dying. This technicality did not take away from the usefulness of her suggestions though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book and a good resource","review":"This is an interesting book and a good resource. The book's title in itself truly depicts what happens in a suicidal person. In a way, it's not really the person that kills the self but rather it's the brain and the \\"chemical imbalance\\" associated with it that causes damage. So can changing the brain chemistry effect a change and save lives? Sure-that's what medication does. This is how psychotherapy works.In Ms. Blauner's book, several \\"tricks of the trade\\" were discussed. Asking for help, emergency contacts, and keeping a journal are just some of the practical ways of dealing with suicidality. Her \\"crisis plan\\" is a useful formula that a person should have to avert any self-destructive thoughts or behavior. Likewise, the chapter on spirituality is a gem.Written in a layman's prose, the book stands out in making complicated concepts (such as neuron and electrochemical transmission) more understandable and seemingly \\"easy\\" concepts, clearer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Training the Brain","review":"Susan's book, for me, was a Godsend!

As someone who has struggled with severe depression since I was seventeen, the first few chapters made me angry, nauseated, and eventually frightened. This book will serve to fuel prejudice and contempt towards suicidal people, by claiming it's something that can be averted with a lollipop and a pat on the head; a hysterical search for attention. Obviously the writer did have serious emotional difficulties; but most suicides are committed by people with physical, chemical, mental illnesses, as dangerous and as un-asked for as diabetes or cancer. If you want to know WHY, read Kay Redfield Jamison's \\"Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide\\".

I patiently searched on line until I was able to purchase another DMR-ES15S. It may not have the most attractive design, however if you are looking for reliable & dependable dvd recorder, I don't think there is a better dvd recorder on the market.

When I tried to buy another Panasonic DVD recorder I found that all of the current models had no editing mode which makes it worthless if you want to eliminate commercials from a recording. So I bought another recorder that was the same model as my old one at a greatly reduced price. I only gave it 4 stars because it does not have what it needs to record programs when that February 2009 eliminates analog broadcasts. I am hoping that it will work with my cable which is digital.

And what, no eject button on the remote -- unforgivable! The video was horrible, and the DVD-R discs were not compatible with all my standard players. Also, I got bars on the sides of the video I was recording and couldn't get rid of them no matter what I did. I'm guessing that the HDMI output told the unit it was 16:9 and so the DVD's were ALL recorded with this buffer (left and right bars), and it didn't matter that the input was 4:3 or 16:9. Also in case you're wondering, I had the bars even playing the discs on a standard 4:3 system (both DVD player and TV).

I think they had two runner's up and just put both on the disc.The remaining members of the original cast and crew talk a little bit about what it was like doing the show or what it was like working with comedian 'X'...Save your money, or if you must have this, buy mine please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"Like some reviewers I was expecting only classic SNL skits from 1975-1980. Instead this dvd is a documentary about the first five years with interviews from the original cast and people who hosted the show, along with excerpts from many skits. But I am not going to complain like the knuckleheads who buy a dvd from the Classic Albums series and say \\"Where are the music videos!?\\". I enjoyed the interviews with Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, etc. about what was going on around the show. I discovered some things about SNL that I never knew. At 2 1/2 hours it's a good deal. I just wish it were twice as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"While there are some good highlights from the first five years, this DVD is a really long documentary more interested in glorifying the self-righteous cast members than giving us the clips which made the show great.

Also, we visited every website to get the information of every travel system.Evenflo Eurotrek is very good, but the website said: \\"Complete Canopy\\", and this model (Pinebrook) doesn't have the complete canopy. Also, the color isn't totally gray, it's a greenish color, so be careful.The good news are that it's VERY EASY to fold and unfold!

David Thomson, so good in his WHO's WHO, seems to be in his own little world in a book that I desperately wanted to like, but found nearly impossible to read. The best parts are about CHINATOWN, Howard Hawks, and his trashing of TITANIC and EASY RIDERS. But, having read his other material, that's old news. The addition of sound in the 30s brought pictures forward, but moving away from black and white robbed them of something--again, old news from Thomson. In the end, I had to put it down because it was going nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Navel Gazing","review":"I had such expectations upon ordering this. Usually, I make pretty good selections to read from the various book review sources I use. In this case, I was duped.This book epitomizes high brow pretentiousness, i.e. 372 pages of pure psycho-babble. Too many pages are devoted to his obsession with the movie Chinatown, and his idol worship of Nicole Kidman. He can barely write a paragraph on cinema history without derailing into the meaning of life or some such.Somehow, I can see Mr. Thomson completing a page a day and having his wife read them back to him as he stared into a mirror...This is one that I plowed through thinking it could improve and I'd miss the salient points if I put it down early. The only thing I lost were hours I'll never regain."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was horrible","review":"I read the stock reviews and then the readers' reviews and could not agree more with Mr. Hauer's reaction. I cannot understand how anyone who reads very much could tolerate this poorly written book. Undoubtedly, Mr. Thomson is a font of knowledge on film history, but he needs a writing class badly. I threw the book down at p. 181. Try this on for size: \\"No doubt, esteemed Renaissance painters and eighteenth century composers were able to carry on their work without distraction. (All they had to worry about was Inquisition, plague, or sheer loss of favor.)\\" The book is full of bizarre, inaccurate rumblings like this - - and that's before you figure out what in the world this weird aside has to do with the history of American film. A good editor would have advised the author to reduce his dependence on convoluted sentence structure, entertain simple declarative sentences and reduce this mess to a meaty magazine article at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Pressed to call it history.","review":"A book in which the author expresses his enjoyment of Jerry Lewis is not a history.

When I say this at Best Buy for 5.99, I couldn't believe the deal I was getting. All of these great songs from the 70's that I grew up with, all on one CD. But then when I listened to the album I felt ripped off. Sure, some of the songs sound similar to the original recordings, but that's not good enough. When you've heard the songs 100's of times on the radio you are expecting to hear the songs that way, and anything else sounds like a cheap imitation. The cover did say \\"new stereo recordings by the original artists\\", so I did think there might be some small differences, but not to the magnitude that I discovered upon listenting.I agree with the other reviewers (and wished I would have checked here first).

Among them are Jefferson Starship, Carlos Santana, Chicago, and Rare Earth. And, it looks like a great collection of songs, and the price is especially convincing.Wrong. These are NOT the originals. As previous reviewers stated, most of these are inferior live versions and re-recorded versions. I do like the live version of Chicago's classic '25 or 6 to 4,' but other than that, this disc is very disappointing.My advice is buy the originals.

But he clearly confused the Catholicism he was raised in and surrounded by with true Christianity. Which comes across loud and clear in his writings. Most of the world does (confuse the two). Other errors also compile to make Tolstoy's gospel a false gospel. Tolstoy does have some good things to say at times, but they are all interwoven with his own personal socialist beliefs and he seems to snatch bits and pieces of scripture references out of the Bible to back up those beliefs; rather than taking scripture in context with the whole he only gives acknowledgement to those verses which serve his purpose, his beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolstoy schmolstoy","review":"It's sad that things of this nature can be seriously taken for a briliant life's philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant Even Now!","review":"Christian and non-christian alike, will find this a provocative and contemporary read.

Fundamentalist will be inspired to think furiously and reconsider their so-called Biblical point of view.

(2) Tolstoy wrestled with Jesus' 'turn the other cheeck' and believed that non-violence was the answer: non-aggression, pacifism was the correct interpretation of Jesus' teaching.This book is relevant to the challenge we as individuals and Americans face amid the escalating use of violence in homes, on the street, in schools and at the workplace.

Like the other albums this one is short at only a bit more then 30 minutes, but I pretty much like the whole thing.

He has appreciation for inventors who have developed new materials for the service of society. His book offers a balanced perspective, with engaging anecdotes.A mild criticism concerns organization.

Because the others, that don't have the quick-release feature, force you to pull apart the links to remove them from the dogs, the links soon become too loose and you are in danger of the collar coming apart mid-walk.

With her vast secretarial skills (none), knowledge of golf (none), sensible office attire (none), how can Lorimer say no? The odd and amusing path to true love will keep you very entertained as Skye finally learns who is the right kind of man for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reconciliation ahead","review":"A friend of mine and I read this book. We both have had experiences of being in all-Black and all-White congregations and the authors are right on target. This is definitely a must read for all that are concerned about reconciling the races for the greater cause of Christ. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirkus Reviews Misses the Point; a fine book","review":"I am sorry the Kirkus reviewer is so damn jaded. It may not be Dostoyevsky, but it's a fine book with characters you care about. I am particularly happy to see someone write such a good, Regular Guy type of witch. The religion and magic are not incidental, but they don't mean only pagans or outre religious feminists will be comfortable here. Anyone who likes a good read, clean deep affection, and a taste of individual liberties will find a couple of hours' joy in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel; vivid and absorbing","review":"Unfortunately, the people who most need to read this playing-out of popular delusion and the madness of crowds aren't likely to do so. I live in a rather conservative community, and my dominant thought throughout reading the book ran along the lines of, \\"Without eternal vigilance, it could happen here.\\" Grant is a wonderfully vivid writer, almost snapping his fingers and putting you into a setting. Logic and happenstance mingle believably in this book. I did not find the characters stereotypical. I feel that I have met nearly all of them (and even been several myself). Strongly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel made my Christmas during 1997","review":"I don't usually keep books. But this is part of my cherished collection that I bring out when I need my mood lifted.Further, this book always puts me in a Christmas spirit. It has an original sense of Xmas magic. The theme, the poems, the prose, the dreams, the depth of emotion, the story, it all builds into layered, rich, satisfying Xmas experience. Much more so than so many sentimental, or kind of boring Xmas novels.Yes, it has poems. But, it's not typical literary fiction, which usually bores me. The story grabs me, and is 100% believable. I go through the tunnel of darkness with the character. Somehow, its light of day moments moments are true magic.It avoids predictability. I love the non-mainstream characters, which could appeal to other fantasy fans.To me, this is Richard Grant's best book. Nothing else comes close. But, it is a little dated (Nineties)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"Grant writes a beautiful story that had me cheering for Pippa & Winterbelle against the ignorant masses."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.S. Mr. Kirkus Reviews...","review":"By the by, Carol Deacon Aaby wasn't the one who came to the house to get Winterbelle. It was the psycho psychologist Allison Rhinum. He probably only bothered to read every three pages. Don't listen to a word. This book describes feeling better than any other I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"in praise of 'land of winter'","review":"richard grant does a very nice job on this one...I really enjoyed cruising through it- a great short (3 or 4 hour)read-no really obscure verbage but high on descriptive prowress. Grant gets in a couple of rants and raves about christians and other marvels. especially well written when you dig on the \\"in touch\\" femininity poured out by young richard. the plot centers around the removal of an admitted witch's daughter by \\"the authorities\\"--it shows pippa drawing courage and inpiration from her wicca/witchy sense of spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"The writing techniques used in this book are exquisite, but the content made me lose respect for any of them. Grant obviously doesn't know enough about Christians to write a plausible story that features them as antagonists. The Christian attitude toward paganism is blown way out of porportion in this book, and not one of the Christian characters is portrayed realistically. To anyone whose perception of Christianity was changed because of this book or to anyone who is planning on reading this book, I want to make one thing quite clear: Our attitude toward paganism isn't based on arrogance, fear, or misunderstanding, but on our sincere love for the one God and His commandment to have no other gods before Him. And please know that real Christians face just as much persecution and intolerance as any other religious group. If you must read this book, please keep this in mind before making any judgments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, but not phenominal","review":"This book is a good overview of what life was like throughout the war for the German soldier, however it is not an in-depth study. Good for a beginner, however those looking for a thorough look at the life of the German soldier would be better served by another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good primer, but not for the serious student.","review":"This book lightly covers all the theaters of war. The Chapters include: Moulding the Soldier; Infantry; Panzer Forces; Artillery; Airborne and Special Forces; The Waffen-SS; Casualties of War; France 1940; North Africa 1941-43; The Eastern Front 1941-43; Defeat in the East 1943-5; The Italian Campaign 1943-45; Normandy 1944; North-West Europe 1944-45.It is not for the serious student that already has an overview of the Wehrmacht and wants details. That is why I got the book.Example: It talks about how well the Waffen-SS did in actual combat and about their stringent training requirements. It does not mention that the Waffen-SS Division had more tanks, equipment, and men than the Wehrmacht Division.It had a lot of personal stories in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody refuted this book yet","review":"About a month after the attacks i began doubting the official version. It wasn't until this book was published that i found an independent investigation on the subject. It's easy to say that everybody who thinks different is a \\"conspiracy freak\\". I've been called that earlier while discussing JFK assasination with some friends. But until you do a little research and some thinking, you don't realize that there're big holes on the official versions of the facts.Mr. Meyssan didn't invent or imply anything on his book, and most of the information used as reference is available on the internet and easily verifyable from their sources. It's just a matter of knowing where to look, knowing about american history of the 20th century, and doing some logical thinking...I advise to anyone thinking about reading this book to do so, but with an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'est tres horrible","review":"This book makes a feeble attempt to show the world that an airplane hit the pentagon. They clearly have removed the parts of the pictures that show the evidence that debunks theur theory. Thats all I will say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disppointed","review":"When I read the review for the book I got the idea it was along the lines of a tutorial. When I received the book I was very disappointed. The data wasn't any different than that I've on other photography books going back to the old Kodak Take Better Pictures series. The real disappointment was that the photos in the book did not related to the text. What I wanted was text and instructions with photos that illustrate the instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"My PERFECT Guy?","review":"Jessica and Damon are finally going out but there's a total issue of miscommunication here! Neither is sure what the other one wants and they end up making each other and themselves unhappy by not talking at all! If only they had acted like they were actually friends...I've been in a situation like this before and I just have one thing to say...make sure you TALK! Why else have a boyfriend? But anyway this book can tell you just WHY you need to talk. I rated it 4 stars because I liked it and it seemed kind of like something was missing, however. A must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious+Sweet=A Fantastic #14!","review":"I think this was such a funny and romantic book. There's a hint of sadness in it though. What made it so funny was about Brian doing all these things like bringing compliments, chocolate candy etc... It all has to do with Jess and Damon. Read it! You'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um............","review":"I love sweet valley and read all of they're books, and enjoy all of them. Like you can read them more than once! But this book was kinda boring. I think if it were more reqlistic it would have been better. This wouldn't have happened in real life. SO if you cant pick between this book and another, pick the other cause this was a flunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Storyline!","review":"Along with this whole series, this book is also exceptionally good except they should've hurried the storyline a bit faster.

The author has thrown up a bolshevik screed that is ignorant of history. His knowledge of the Spanish Civil War seems to be entirely the product of communist propaganda; he even repeats hackneyed lies that Moscow gave up on decades ago! Even worse than the author's political bias and historical shortcomings is his terrible grammar. The author should have written a simple art review for a European, socialist-type magazine and called it quits. HOW did this over-expanded piece ever get published as a book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The journey continues","review":"This latest work from Ruth B. McDowell continues where her book on piecing leaves off. It overviews many of her quilts with details on where the design started, how it was developed, why were the fabrics chosen and what do they do for the quilt. While this is not a formal text on creating an art quilt, she does use use many concepts one would expect in a good fine arts class. The difference is that the medium is fabric. No patterns are provided (her works are copyrighted and not intended for duplication), but the intent is to inspire the reader to design their own works. I hope that as her work develops further that she will be able to write more books of this kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's wrong","review":"I am very disappointed in this camera. It has very slow reaction time when I turn it on--sometimes I have to bang it against my hand to wake it up. The software doesn't work with my PC--I haven't been able to use this camera.Follow up from my original review. Samsung replaced the original camera, but it took close to six months and many messages and emails to their customer service department, which never called me back. I have not had the same kind of problem with the second camera. I solved the download problem by purchasing a USB card reader that I can plug in anywhere to look at pictures--I don't need any software. It is very sensitive to movement and half my pictures are blurry--use a tripod when you can--it's the only way to go. I'd like a camera with a normal viewer so I don't have to use the screen--my old Olympus did this and I never had shaky pictures. My rechargeable batteries seem to do a pretty good job--I can take pictures all day on one set of batteries usually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even last 6 months","review":"This camera was worthless. It cost me a lot of money, and the quality was horrible. It took a long time for the pictures load and it had a slow shutter speed. This camera didnt even last for 6 months. and even before that a lot of times it wouldn't turn on right away and I would have to turn it on and off several times before it would start up. It was a very poor quality camera, for a lot of money. I dont recemmend this camera to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaky at best","review":"I am a little disappointed with this camera. It seems to drain the batteries even when camera is not in use! I took it on my last vacation and it does take great pitures but it takes a lot of blurry pics too depending on the settings. The movie mode seems to work nice. You have to really watch your settings and adjust it constantly to according to your lighting conditions, etc... It seems to be very slow to take pics with the double flash. The cameral doesnt always turn on, I have to turn it on and off a few times even with good batteries for the power to turn on. Really annoying! The zoom I love but with all the great potential pic moments I lost because of because the recover time from taking pic after pic, ruined pics because a lot came out blurry I would recommend something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst camera","review":"The features are neato, but the designers forgot one of the basic issues of electrical engineering: POWER CONSUMPTION.

Sara's book is honest and warm and touching. The story is compelling, pulling the reader into the emotional roller-coaster world of having a crisis pregnancy and premature baby. Having my preemie was one of the most difficult things I've ever gone through, and I found it so helpful to read others' stories and learn I was not alone. There are so few books journaling the day-to-day extreme ups and downs of high-risk pregnancy bedrest and the NICU experience; this book fills a great void, and does it so well. I recommend this book to anyone going through a difficult pregnancy, anyone with a premature baby, or anyone who wants to better understand what it is like. This is a story of faith in difficult times, and is very inspiring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very informative","review":"All this time, my friends and colleagues have told me that Bill Clinton was \\"the most pro-Israel President of all time.\\" They could not have been more WRONG!

I was hoping the griddle would just sit on top of the grate and then just remove it when I want to use the grill, and I was hoping the entire grill could fold up with the griddle inside - No Way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cook breakfast on your Coleman Grill Stove.","review":"I bought a Coleman propane two burner grill stove. The one with the blue lid. The grill part of the stove is for barbecueing only. If you want to fry eggs or cook bacon, for example, you need to buy this griddle to use in place of the grill.

So buy the griddle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman Grill Stive Griddle","review":"I read the previous reviews before purchasing this item. Reading the reviews made me skeptical, I'll admit.

HIGHLY RECOMMENED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor explanations... Poor examples...","review":"Through my college career, I have run into incredibly well written books. This is not one of them. Explanations are short, and half-arsed. Many examples leave steps out, implying that you should 'know' them. I'm not one of those students who can sit through a lecture and understand everything the professor says. I rely heavily on books to explain anything and everything that I might have missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money","review":"This book is perhaps the worst book I have ever used in my entire student career. There are few examples and explanations to solve the problems, there are NO ANSWERS!!!!!!!!!!!! on the back of the book to help you check your progress. The examples provided during the chapters are sometimes non-representative of the exercises assigned for students, and the authors usually omit clarity and step-by-step solving procedures necessary for easy and complete understanding of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"Yes, this text book is a piece of junk.

Which is good, as if you do have to ever use it, the point is to get people's attention. Turning it off is tricky, but again the point is that a would-be attacker wouldn't be able to easily turn it off. The light is handy also. The only thing I don't like is that it's a little big for attaching to a key chain, I wish it were a little smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great so far.","review":"Pros: Nice and loud.

The prior two books addressed getting out of unlikely scary situations, and that made them vicariously exciting. But most of these situations are so normal that we've all dealt with them already. The \\"helpful hints\\" come across as Grandma's Home Remedies rather than the 007 Instruction Manual.Some hints are so obvious that you'd think they were written for an alien. For example, did you know that benzoyl peroxide can help with pimples? To stop a shaving cut from bleeding, apply a tiny piece of toilet paper. If you have an obsessive Ex, then be firm when rejecting them. Gee, thanks.Plus some of the suggestions are downright odd.

After all the colorful ones in Aurian (I'm reminded of those involving Thara and Chathak, in particular), the ones in this book were dull. Most involved \\"perdition.\\" Why in perdition, and where in perdition, and what in perdition. I was tempted to reread it just to see how many times this word was used.But that was just a minor irritation. I was most disappointed by the way things played themselves out. As someone else wrote, it just seemed that she wanted to get it finished before deadline. And on that note, let's just say that it wasn't finished. By leaving unfinished business in this novel, the road is paved to the fifth in the series. When will this end? I loved the first three books, but this one has to be my least favorite.

Obviously, U2 took good notes. Especially when it came to the overall thick, textured guitar sound and implicit lyrics the of the Comsat's.

It is written by an author from the UK and his concept of operational or \\"operations\\" auditing may be different from yours. The whole book is devoted to internal control.

But besides the numerous inappopriate and gratuitous modifiers, there is nothing here. The conflict feels grafted on by an author who recognizes the dullness of his tale, the plot surprises would only surprise the comatose, and the predictability of the whole thing left me weary. A book for those who feel rather than think, for the feelings are all good in this. Nice man, nice boy, nice girlfriend. Nice make-believe story line.Nothing in here approaches real. Nothing is thought out. It is the harmless cotton candy of modern fiction, tastes great (in very limnited quantities) with no content whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"true to life tale of single parenting","review":"A warm thoughtful story of a father's daily trials of raising his four year old son alone. I wasn't sure it would hold my attention at first but the language and scenes rang true and reminded me much of my own sons early years. The author's attempts at giving the story deeper meanings seemed contrived and I wasn't always sure where he was going with the remembrances of his own father. The story tackles many interesting single parent concerns highlighted by attempts to get on with life after a spouse has left, moving to a new town, taking a new job, finding a new lover. I like best how this father's love for his son permeates this story even in those parenting moments when he is frustrated or impatient. A book whose total was greater than the sum of its parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance Real Slow review","review":"Dance Real Slow is quite simply the best book I have read this decade. It is a simply story, brilliantly crafted with insightful attentiveness to details which makes it both refeshing and revealing.

I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good Movie!","review":"I purchased this movie thinking it would make a fine edition to my blaxploitation collection. However, I was most surprised to find that, instead of the majority of films in that genre, this was a serious, well-acted movie with an excellent plot. The story of a young man who set his sites on becoming a crime kingpin and succedes only too well is intelligently written and makes for a movie that takes us into the life of a career criminal. Gloria Hendry is superb and redeems herself from her campy portrayal in Black Belt Jones. I found myself captivated from beginning to end. I give it 4 stars only because the production aspect could have been a bit better, but they probably worked with a limited budget and made the most of it. Highly recommended as a look into the life of a young black man who decided to choose the criminal path and follow it to its extreme expression."},{"rating":"2","title":"what can u say","review":"this guy was suppose the the man back in the 70s so I bought it low in behold I actually like it so, what can I say but great movie I won't say I will look at it every year but I did enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Ceasar Great movie","review":"This is a great movie to watch.

I think James must have seen it a few times and finally got the theme after the movie was done. There is violence against women in this one. If you are using today's morals, it is totally too macho and male dominated for today's time. But the violence all is a dance with a simple meaning at the end. The woman he rapes gets her payback. America is a place of isolation and if you see the characters in that light and in terms of the 70s, this was better than Shaft, but a notch below Superfly. It explains street thinking without glorifying it.\\"Here's a dime boy.

I have not, as many others have not, heard of Tatsumi and that is a shame. It is good to know, however, there is a plan to release more volumes of work (please hurry). Sixteen stories comprise the first volume and all are powerful. Angst ridden? You don't know the meaning of angst until you read this book. There is very little hope in this with tales of unrequited love, murder, abortion, prostitution and transvestism, peeping toms and suicide. The central character is always a man in some state of despair. The tales, though, some quite wordless, and the drawings, beautifully rendered, pull the reader quickly from one to the next. Despite being a potential downer (and some may cursorily say misogynistic), the stories are actually darkly comic and well told.

Second, the work lacks any considerable citations. In most of the cases, making statements, Fay doesn't care to cite the source. Consequently, there is very little we can discover about Shostakovich's personality in this book. Third, Fay ignores some considerable and valuable sources, like Shostakovich's letters to Glickman, as well as she questions the statements of Elizabeth Wilson's (Life Remembered) book.My first feeling, when I read this so-called biography was, that it was a merely English abrupted translation of the Shostakovich's Soviet biography by Sofia Khentova.Fay doesn't trust any letters or memories. On the contrary, she widely uses the publications of the Soviet officialese, including Shostakovich's articles and speeches, most of which were even not written by the composer himself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable, yet cruel","review":"This book is an attempt to describe the life of a Soviet composer without reference to, or apparently any knowledge of, the conditions that the composer was working under. The author's obvious ignorance of the milieu created by the Soviet regimes under which Shostakovich worked results in a work of overwhelming dishonesty - one that cruelly misrepresents the composer and the works he created. This book is so misconceived, both from the standpoint of empathy for the subject and overall scholarship, that it would take several pages to address even its most blatant errors. Fortunately, for those who might be tempted, for whatever reason, to check this out of the library, or even, God forbid, to buy the thing, there is a website where one can read an intelligent and balanced discussion of the sort of feeble anti-revisionism that this book represents (see below).

The life and times of DS are facinating, tragic, and heroic, but in the hands of Ms. Fay, his story becomes just plain dull. Worse, it's just plain wrong.

Evidence - such as the experienmces of those who had the misfortine to live there - were dismissed as looney tunes or fascist propaganda or some such.

The key change to The Arms this album is dual vocals. In the past Brendan and Chris have taken turns with vocals. On this album the boys combine their efforts flawlessly. The clean vocals of Chris trading off with the snotty nasally vocals of Brendan creates a fresh sound and in my humble opinion, the best Lawrence Arms album to date.Another plus of this album is the production.

Her friend, Elissa, asks Lauren to absolve her of the murder charges pending against her for the murder of her wealthy aunt. Unbeknownst to Lauren, she's beeing stalked by a psychopath. To add to her misery, her relationship seems to be falling apart, and there's seemingly nothing she can do to stop it. This began as excellent series, deteriorated into the doldrums of a so-so series, and with this entry, has come full circle. The writer evokes the Village so we know how the wet streets feel, her characters are well drawn and likable to the point that the reader finds herself hoping Lauren's relationship with Kip can be saved.

I eat these movies up like a zombie, which this movie didn't have any of.I only heard of this movie yesterday so I rented it. Everything is solid, story, acting, etc. It gets 4 stars because it doesn't really add anything that we haven't seen in various other movies, not really, although it is a bit darker I will say.

It has a few \\"zombie movie\\" cliches - but for the most part, this is a really decent post-apocalyptic drama with a young cast lead respectably by Chris Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci. Those two play brothers who are driving a car (and stealing gas, etc.) to get to a beach where they think it'll be safe after some kind of terrible virus has swept out the world. I was mostly impressed with the acting (Pine especially is memorable) and the mood the film creates. I'd recommend to people who like drama with a bit of suspense thrown in. For horror fans, you could be disappointed unless you're in the mood for something quieter with less gore.

The book does have a nice layout and a lot of great pictures..... but thats it - a pretty book it is but the drawings and technical illistrations you need to build it are not included.... IMPORTANT things like neck thickness, neck thickness at the neck joint, any many other important things are not covered at all. A dimentioned neck end, and neck pocket detail are not even included. A body layout is shown and again not dimentioned. The only dimentions that are given are for a template to route the pickup and bridge holes... The most important topics are barely covered like setting the neck and bolting it on, alignment etc.....Nice - but I would not tell anyone to buy this book,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Excellent But Sometimes Silly","review":"I agree with prior reviews that the book is fun to read and, to the degree that it sticks with describing the wonderful, mysterious properties of numbers and the symbolic understanding of those properties, it's top notch. Occassionally, however, new age wishful thinking takes over. For example, as evidence of the cosmic significance of the number eight, it is noted that the sum of the angles in an octogon add up to 1080 degrees, the same value as the radius of the moon measured in miles. There are a number of other similar cases in the book when one feels that the author is really stretching in order to make a \\"significant connection.\\" That said, the same enthusiasm that leads the author onto thin ice also makes the book a fun introduction to the romantic and mysterious aspects of mathematics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and very interesting.","review":"Wonderful resource for my high school Geometry classes.

Now I know what those numbers \\"are\\". This book is precious. It allows one to see the magic and the mystery in common objects and relationships around us. Nicely written. A lot of fun.

It is absolutely incredible, and the guy who wrote it is up there with Stephen Hawking as far as I'm concerned. To be able to make such astute observations about the mathematical and geometric patterns in the reality we live in and be able to document them in such a concise manner, all the while still managing to make the book a thoroughly enjoyable read is nothing short of ingenious. I'd give this book ten stars if I could. Twenty stars. It is fascinating to read, even if all you do is look at the pictures, and the second you get it in your hands I really think you'll agree.....but you ain't getting your hands on my copy :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something so simple yet so complex...","review":"A Beginner's Guide to Constructing the Universe is a fantastic volume for anyone that enjoys numbers but is not necessarily adept with math. Not at all over the head of the layperson (me) this book will take you through a whirlwind tour of something that we all use daily (numbers) yet whose history is rich with detail and subtlety and integral in pretty much everything we see from the spirals of crustacean shells and galaxies to the proportions of our own bodies. Truly a great read for the chronically curious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best descriptioin of math to give to any child or student","review":"I have purchased six of these books to pass along to family and friends as I consider it one of the best introductions to numbers.

Schenider has taken high level abstact concepts and brought them down to examples in our everyday environment. Great man - brilliant mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few gems--mostly blather","review":"Reminds me of people who see number patterns in everything--even when it's mere coincidence. A few good ideas and concepts, but trying to tease them out is a chore. And some of the books statements are flat wrong--sorry, but nature is sometimes horribly prolific with resources, not studiously careful. If you are interested in a kind of metaphysical approach, it might be very interesting, but if you are interested in real numbers, real math, real life, um, not here.

The idea that geometry and philosophy had any ties were ridiculously explored in this book. It achives nothing, but on the plus side it isnt very long, giving lots of space for drawings and quotes that have nothing to do with the subject matter.I tried to approach this book with an open mind, but all I got was a headache and innumerable brain cells to flee in the overhwelming horror of how awful this thing is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abundant resource for insights & illustrations about sacred geometry","review":"Colleague Michael Schneider (who I had the pleasure of interviewing on community radio/TV a few years ago) wrote this outstanding book that has wonderful little illustrations and photographs showing how geometry and number remind us universal archetypes every where we turn in nature, art and architecture.

It isn't really a blaxploitaion movie at all. It seems more like they were experimenting, trying to see if a black female lead could carry a non-black movie on her own. It was a somewhat interesting movie, maybe for historical value, but not really entertaining at all. A typical \\"kung fu\\" movie of the era. The sad part was this character wasn't really the same one that I liked from the original movie.

For example, why is it that I can be attracted to a man and then not like him just because of how he smells? (\\"The Nose\\" will tell you why - biological destiny) And why is it that I can \\"sense\\" when others are happy or angry or when someone has been someplace, even when I can't smell it? I am a history buff (I teach high school social studies) and in particular I found the history unbelievably engaging. I couldn't put this book down!

It is a translation authorized by Al-Azhar University which certainly is as good a recommendation as one could ask for. In addition to the line by line translations there are hundreds of notes that help a great deal in clarifying obscure points and possible misinterpretations. I found the title of the work a little misleading, though, since aside from a very brief historical introduction and the excellent notes, there really isn't a lot beyond the Arabic text and the translation.

The tales and vignettes in it are called Teaching Stories because teaching is precisely what they do. They teach the reader how to escape from the confines and limitations of usual, normal thinking processes. They do so by showing the reader to himself or herself, reflected in the actions and motivations of the characters in the tales. The reader can learn how to operate more free of bias. The effect is similar to suddenly coming across riches, the riches buried within ourselves. Repeated readings reveal more layers and depths, each guiding the reader to greater understanding and freedom.

Certainly if you are a person who abhors blood and gore, then this film or any other movie by HG Lewis would be a bad selection.I can only recommend this to people interested in horror/exploitation and filmmaking. Because its director was considered revolutionary, it would be a good plan to view this if you are interested in film. Yet, I learned more about what not to do with cinematography. Yes this was an older film, but other early horror classics managed to utilize the camera properly.All in all, it wasn't a complete waste of 72 minutes.

It's about a little old lady who runs a wig store that does booming business as the hair is so \\"realistic\\": that's because she lures college girls to her home, only to throw them into her basement for her retarded son to scalp with his electric carving knife. The acting is seventh rate, the budget lower than your average porn movie (this makes DEEP THROAT look like TITANIC budget wise) but this is good for a laugh and in terms of gore, this is probably the EXTERMINATOR of it's generation.

The Godfather of Gore's semi-classic gore flick \\"The Gruesome Twosome\\" has infected DVD technology. Notice I gave it a single star; well, that's not always a bad thing! Honestly, I've had lots of fun watching this terrible cult flick, but do you think that, just once, Lewis could shoot a second take when someone messes up their lines? It would probably take most of the fun away, regardless.The most upsetting aspect of this film is the shameful lack of gore. A good majority of screen time is dedicated to goofey chicks jumping on beds eating fried chicken, dancing on the beach, or chowing down at the local hang out. Reminds me in ways of a Frankie Avalon movie gone bad, if such a thing could happen!

It is now incomplete, but still a pretty good resource for the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice fan but construction flaw","review":"If the design were not so badly flawed I would rate this a 4 or 5 star product. For its size it moves a good amount of air and provides welcome circulation. However- I definitely had the problem other reviewers mentioned- the magnet assembly on one of the two I bought had already separated when the package was opened, and it broke free on the second one on only the second use. I hope a good helping of superglue will fix the problem, otherwise there is no way to mount these and they will be all but useless. I'll report back once I try the superglue idea.Update- superglue seems to be working just fine. Amazing that Coleman has not fixed such a simple flaw.Update 2- after just a few uses, the fan blade keeps falling off. On the verge of demoting to 1 star. Not at all worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"this fan is awesome!","review":"We got this fan before a river trip in the desert- a hot one at night! These fans worked great, the batteries lasted through multiple nights and we would have really suffered without them. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile Blades","review":"I have one of these fans. It worked great until the blades broke off. I got about 4 or 5 camping trips with it. Next time I took it out of the camping chest the blades were broken. Not much good now & don't know how to get more blades. I would suggest instead of this item to find a tent fan with a good cage around the blades to protect them. No chain is stonger than its weakest link, and these flimsy unprotected blades are its weakest link. I would think Coleman could do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got one bad unit","review":"I purchased two of these fans; one of them broke after just one use. The on/off button didn't work anymore (you don't hear the 'click' when you press it) and the lips that hold the battery compartment closed also broke for that same unit, which means that the back part with the magnet doesn't hold on any longer. The other unit still works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"fan\\" of this fan","review":"Me and my friends bought a couple of these to try and keep our tents cool out at coachella music festival.

I was really looking forward to a cool breeze in our tent. Much to my dismay, this puny fan did not provide ANY breeze. Holding it in your hand, 6 inches away from your face, it is a mediocre personal fan. It might work for one-person tents, but for families or hot climates, this isn't worth its weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I recently moved from WI to TX. I did some camping in May and realized that I needed something to move the air around when sleeping! So I purchased this fan! It worked great! It was silent to allow me to sleep and it really moved the air around. Make sure to if you are sleeping more than one person in the tent to buy more than one! It moves air but not very far so purchased one for each member in the tent to make there lives easier also! Great product and highly recommend! Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy Camper/Hiker","review":"This is a rather adequate small, portable fan that will put out some air circulation. It is rather lite-weight, until you put in the monster sized D cell batteries. The weight gain is considerable. The battery power does not last long either, approximately three (3) hours if you are lucky when using this in non-stop mode. Have to agree with one of the other reviewers that when you insert the batteries the fan does tend to bulge out and then you have to wrestle with it trying to put the cap back on. I, too, broke the tabs on mine but that was fixed with duct tape. If attaching this item to your tent ceiling using the provided magnet, it will make the ceiling sag quite a bit, especially after inserting the batteries. Recommend using this item in a tent where you have some head room and not worry about banging your head on it. The fan blade is made of plastic, so, theoretically, you should not have to worry about getting cut. Overall, an alrite item."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucks.","review":"Sorry, I just don't know any other way to put it. The on/off switch didn't work, it didn't move any air, and after 20 minutes, the blade fell off and wouldn't stay on anymore.What a waste -- I paid $17.99 at Sports Chalet for it. I sincerely wish that I hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman Tent Fan","review":"Still have to try this out in the tent this weekend. It was a trick getting the D cell battery in this thing, but after pulling, tugging, cussing, and busting out a butter knife, I finally got it open. I slapped the battery in and fired it up. She moves some air! This can be mounted on a wall with screws, attached to a metal surface, placed on a metal tent pole, or sandwiched between the tent material with the metal base. I live in Florida, so hopefully this will keep me cool on those hot summer days, Hahahaha.....right! It only has one speed and is a little heavy for those wanting a light load."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"This product is small and not very powerful. I have used it numerous times and eventually went out and bought two battery operated standalone fans...this didn't do the trick for us and didn't circulate enough air. I also really don't like the magnet mechanism that holds this in place - especially when using with a mesh area, it really pulls and could damage your tent.I would not buy this item again. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I listen to others","review":"Cool Concept but it broke the first camping trip.I sent the receipt to Coleman requesting a replacement and never heard anything back from them so I pitched it.

BY AN O2 COOL FAN MUCH BETTER FR THE MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great! WHEN it works.","review":"I bought this fan for a week of camping in the Ozarks. I was absolutely thrilled to see the unit ran all night for the first two nights on a single battery. As a precaution I changed the battery on the third night. The unit was not working in the morning. Assuming it was a bad battery I changed it. It slowly began to run and just stopped. I was unable to get the unit to run any longer than a couple of minutes at a time, and then only by spinning the blades to get it started. I gave up after the fourth night and eight batteries later. We disassembled the unit and bypassed the switch. Still nothing. By squeezing the motor, we got it running well. Clearly the motor wasn't up to the task as the brushes were most likely gone. This was unfortunate as the unit provided a decent flow of air, and was quiet enough to sleep with. However, the tiny motor is not good quality. Also, it costs just enough to be frustrating, but not enough to go through the frustration of returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't really do anything","review":"don't recommend this product. it is a very low speed fan, and doesn't really hang well anywhere it would work in a tent.

The weight caused by the batteries in the base is extensive. When it worked, it was so great that my girlfriend pointed out we needed a second one. The weight of the batteries in the fan portion deformed the little plastic flanges that hold it to the backing, and two of the four broke within 48 hours. The fan will not hang now, and can only be held or set on a table edge. Poorly designed, given the weight of the fan mechanism and the batteries..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little fan packs a punch","review":"When my fans arrived I wasn't sure about them.

Fresh out of its package we mounted it in our tent, flipped the on switch, and \\"Wheeeeeee!\\" down to the floor the blades flew! It worked GREAT as an amusing propeller toy!! No matter how hard we jammed the blades back onto the unit, \\"Vroooom!!\\" off it would go, sailing around to the bottom of our tent once again! Had to return it, needless to say... But hey, we had some good laughs with it! (Roasted that camping trip though...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like it will do its job...","review":"It is very simple fan, so don't expect anything fancy. Upon arrival the magnet together with its metal cage separated from the fan. I had to glue it. However, it was not a big deal at all. Now its glued and fixed. The fan puts out decent amount of air flow and I think that it will be more than enough for my tent during my upcoming rafting trip in Ocoee, TN. So far Im happy, and Im giving it 4 stars.

St. Benedict's Rule was originally written in the Sixth Century (A.D.). Furthermore, it is the most widely used life-guide in modern western monasticism. Joan Chittister takes Benedict, word-for-word-intact, and brings him into our contemporary situations. She illustrates the universal and fundamental insights of Benedict and how they are highly compatible with Hindu, Sufi, Toaist, Zen, Jewish and other major thought/values traditions.An added benefit is Chittister's editorial technique of dividing Benedict's Rule and her associated commentaries into specific dates on the annual calendar. This enables the serious reader/reflector to read over each mini section of the rule and this associated, wonderful commentary on three different dates within each calendar/liturgical year."},{"rating":"2","title":"It captures the spirit of the Gospels and St.Benedict!","review":"St. Benedict wrote his rule based upon the spirit of the Gospels and Joan Chittister has captured the true spirit of both. Jesus asked the crowds to examine their motivations and actions and the author continues that skein of query using the Rule of Benedict as a springboard. This is the best spiritual work I have ever read outside of the Bible; it is clear, insightful, and yes, even makes the reader confront the inner self which is what every good spiritual writing should do. Simply wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Benedict For Today","review":"An excellent resource for anyone who wants to apply the Rule of St. Benedict, written in the 6th century, to today."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good idea, a bad edition","review":"Unfortunately, the author's distortion of St. Benedict's text through using inclusive language and the highly subjective interpretations of his rule from a feminist political perspective ruin this work. The author makes a historical error by asserting early on in the text that St. Benedict saw the anchoritic life as being self centered and less than the cenobetic life. This is not true. The Cenobetic life is the life in community where one is schooled in asceticism. But those few who can successfully leave and enter into the anchoritic life have entered into the final and highest stage of asceticism. I would recommend that reader's consult a scholarly and historical translation and study of St. Benedict's rule and then work through the text with a spiritual director who is orthodox in faith and practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"By far one of the best and most honest writers we have today in the Catholic Church.

Given that it was written well over 1000 years ago for men living together in community, it's a bit hard to translate for everyday circumstances today. Sister Joan's commentary is, for the most part, spot on and helpful.

Indeed, the dancing is superb and it is probably difficult to see something like this one in our days. However, Margo F. is desperately and hopelessly old here, and although her dancing is perfect, I could not totally believe her interpretation because she was playing a 14 years old girl. She is well over 40 when this was filmed and it showed. Somehow, I also noticed some rigidity in her movements. I agree with some critics who say that she reigned in Royal ballet for too long and was careful to destroy all competition. The result is this, although technically perfect but not very believable performance. Nevertheless, it is still a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"fantastic dance","review":"I bought the dvd because I love Prokofiev and Nureyev so I was pretty sure the combination would be great.

Having read many of his columns and Poliquin Principles, I found Charles to be very informative and thought provoking in the past. But this book is nothing more than a brochure disguised as a book.

This is simply a way for him to make more money. Stay away.

The data in the book is backed up by the analysis of Poliquin's athletes over an extended period of time with multiple advanced athletes at the top of their game.Methodologies are presented based on their effectiveness and what is required to achieve similar results. e.g.theses athletes needed to complete \\"X\\" amount of reps at \\"X\\" percentage of your 1 rep max to elicit an improvement in strength etc.There are very few books around with this type of data presented in a clear an concise style. If you picked this book up for in depth theoretical information I would suggest Mel Siff's book Super-training which has a lot more scientific data - if however you picked the book up to apply the knowledge within then you will become extremely knowledgeable over time with the advanced practical methodologies present within.Supertraining"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mumbo Jumbo","review":"This book is a sad attempt to cash in on the notion that weightlifting is a complex science.

I have a love for different knife blades and handles. The Freeman handle was attractive to me (as was the Profile-Fixed Blade). I am quite pleased with this knife. If you read this, please know that my hands are medium, not large, so the handle fits my hand well. If your hands are large, you may not like the feel of this handle. The blade is sharp but probably not as sharp as some reviewers would like. The sheath is a ballistic nylon, not leather. My sheath was in fine working order upon receipt. Please understand, this knife, is what it is....an attractive, inexpensive fixed blade knife for use in the field or in and around the home. If you are looking for anything more, then don't buy it.

The handle is very comfortable to hold, the knife itself is very sturdy, and it's pretty much a perfect size; not too big, not too small. It hasn't had any heavy use just yet, so I can't say how well it holds its edge, but it was sharp enough out of the box to shave hair off of my arm. The sheath that comes with the knife is nice, but nothing too special; just a nylon sleeve with a hard plastic insert to keep the knife from cutting the sheath. Overall, a great buy at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Can't recommend it enough!","review":"Red China Blues is one of the best books on China I have read. Jan Wong really knows her subject. I lived in China for two years, including some of the time she was there, so I could really relate to what she wrote. An easy and quick read by an excellent writer. Her description of the Tian'anmen massacre is one of the best I have read. This book is both educational and entertaining. I particularly liked how she described her infatuation with Mao Zedong when she first went to China as a teen-ager and how she gradually became disillusioned with him and the system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but unprofessional","review":"There's certainly an interesting story here, but it's bogged down by the author's clumsy, insensitive and pathetic attempts at humor. Although her personal story is integral, many of her anecdotes seem poorly woven in or completely irrelevant. It's worth reading for the information and unique perspective, but also a relief to be finished with because this journalist's style is much more grating than gritty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Entertaining","review":"My husband and I are in the process of reading this book together, and are thoroughly enjoying it. Wong tells her story with candor and humor, never neglecting to describe the horrors and failings of the revolution while also making sure to relate the positive, uplifting, and sometimes humorous aspects of the system. An enlightening read with unique perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interested in recent events in China? Read this book!","review":"What I most enjoyed about Red China Blues is Wong's astute look at herself -- her developing disillusion with the government of the PRC and her active search for both the good and the bad in the country, the ideology and the people of her second home. Another strength here is the first-hand account of the massacre at Tien'an Men Square; Wong watched it from a hotel balcony, and was sometimes right in the line of fire. But this book: it's a real eye opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"More accessible to Westerners than books by Chinese","review":"You'd think that the best way to understand China would be to read books by native Chinese. And certainly works like _Wild Swans_ would tend to confirm this theory.

I really hate whinging book because it leads the readers nowhere. The essence of reading a book is to broaden our knowledge, enabling us to reflect upon our past so that we could build a better foundation for our younger generation. I believe Jan has done just that. Ashamed that I couldn't meet her in person when she gave a talk regarding the book in Christchurch 2 years ago. Believe me, her sequel, Jan Wong's China is just as good or even better than her first masterpiece.

After that we all took a few test shots when we started every game to make sure we were good. The other thing i don't like is that you have to fire a few rounds off to take it off.

He owes a lot to Elmore Leonard but really outdoes most of his books with this funny and exciting tale. I remember reading my first Michael Connelly, and my first DeMille novel in the same way. There is nothing like discovering a great new author and I plan to delve into his other novels immediately. My one complaint is that I did not like one of the characters that he created known as \\"One Way\\". His whole bad acid trip induced lifelong psychoses felt unreal and forced, but beyond that it has been a very long time since I have enjoyed a plot as clever as this one. This is a real page turner that I whipped through in two days, and I am not the fastest reader on the planet. I think I heard of him through an Amazon plug, though I simply cannot recall. Whatever the case, I know Winslow is getting more popular with every book and he should soon be as well known as the aforementioned novelists. He certainly deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I am a big fan of Winslow and have read most of his novels at this stage.

He uses very few brush strokes to create an almost tangible adventure in the underworld of Southern California. And the tale is almost Shakespearian, complete with a protagonist who must overcome his own tragic flaws (aided by a homeless prophet, no less) before his world crashes down violently upon him. The author's use of the low-life vernacular is superb -- and fun. Vibrant action, sex, greed, and betrayal. Like most books, the characters in The Life & Death of Bobby Z have interesting strengths. The distinction here, though, is that they all have flaws that are twice as compelling. And Winslow avoids the genre's tendency toward cliches. But I won't: this book is a \\"must read!&quot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"If you haven't read any of Don Winslow's books, you are in for a treat!

It's a bit hard to tell if it's going or not, so I kept my eye on it--and it's a good thing I did, because the molded plastic case that surrounds the heating element had caught on fire.

This DVD drags on for almost 2 hours with shot after shot of hot low rides. The show is hosted by Martha Sanchez, who is a little too overweight to be the \\"star\\" of the show.

The people from different backgrounds got together for a common aim, the development of the dark continent. The love story is unique in itself, an eye-opener for people from different religions and cultures. This book unites a diversity of thoughts. The religious verses, stanzas from poets and sayings from prominent politicians are a inventive addition at the start of each chapter. I was absorbed in thought by reading these.

This book will bring joy for generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indian pioneers in Africa","review":"This is the first book I have read that focuses on the development of East Africa as viewed through the eyes of the Indian community.

All the existing literature focuses on the European pioneers and developers without so much as giving any credit to the Indian community. Full credit to Pally for having the courage and commitment to write a book that puts the emphasis on the Indian community and their contribution.

It seems completely clueless. The plot is weak, the acting poor, the dialog bad and the action(?) scenes third rate. Save your money, there are hundreds of far superior action movies out there than this. Billy Blanks may be a talented martial artist, but if he is, this movie would never quality as evidence in court. The movie tries to combine elements of Bloodsport, Rocky and Enter the Dragon and fails in every effort.

Cities are torched but strangely reinforcements are not thought about until america invades canada. Apparently the empire was brought about by luck because britian seem to become idiotic when confronted by american forces. The chapter dealing with the canadian irregulars surrender was unrealistic. It is mentioned that england has vast experience with siege warfare because of the crimean war, so surprise they go on the offensive agaisnt the constantly stated larger union army. Wouldn't it make sense to let the union bleed itself at least a little before attacking. The anglo-confederacy states the answers but still acts opposite every time.

As an American (and Northern for the record) I would obviously like to see 'my side' win but this book paints almost everyone & everything Southern/Canadian/English as incompetent, arrogant, ignorant etc. Once the antagonists have painted as obviously inept again and again the story becomes very predictable.

I also feel that it very seriously underestimates the advantages of the British Empire, and the fact that the Brits were the technological world leaders in 1862. Yes it would probably take the brits 12 to 24 months to ramp up, but the author needs to take a look at what was accomplished in the last year of the Crimean War. As for US Privateers devastating British trade, this leaves out the fact that the british built far better steam machinery than we did in the 1860s and Built better warships, guns and armor. Examine what the British were building in the way of guns, armor, and ships by 1865 compared to what the Union was building. This without the influence of a shooting war.

It takes place during those obscure years tucked in between disco and Big Hair bands. America was still recovering from the shock of having elected an actor as President, an actor I would say was far better than any that appeared in this roughly edited film.The movie uses the \\"killer's point of view\\" technique which means they jerk the camera around during some of the scenes, but they don't use the technique effectively. There was no character build-up and while we saw the killer, they didn't drop clues as to why he was knocking off the girls.? What was that line dance thing? And did we have to see the whole thing? Sex and shower scenes with no nudity and they dare to compare it to an 80's slasher film. It falls short of an 80's style slasher.

On screen for a few seconds somewhere in the middle if I recall correctly. The plot? Guy with hammer does some, ahem, home improvement by eliminating several sorority sisters.

I couldn't wait to pop this film into my DVD player but upon viewing it was definitely a let down. The acting was bad, didn't care for the way it was filmed and the concept and look of the killer could have been done much better. Some of the killings were a bit gruesome but looked totally generic.

Adrenaline tells the story of Nick and Jeff, two lovers-who-just-met, busted by a couple of cops with some pretty big issues. They find themselves running for their lives as the entire LAPD hunts them for a murder they didn't commit. A classic chase story, Baker's Hollywood script-writing skills show through already, as does his brilliant and black sense of humour. The horrific is rendered absurd and hilarious (but not ineffectual) as Baker crashes gleefully through the boundaries of good taste. And if you ever found the Osmonds a little too sickly-sweet or hated homophobic cops (and let's face it we all have), there's something here for you. This book really lives up to it's name - it's a riveting story that you just can't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Unforgiving","review":"I first read James Robert Bakers book in 1987, a friend lent it to me telling me that this book is an excellent look at the underbelly of what we as outsiders look at as the perfect place to live.

The pace is extremely slow, the events covered not nearly as interesting as the glimpses of them in the other books promised and, worst of all...where's Polgara? The first person narrative is clearly an imposter for the cool, wry, disgruntled sorceress we have come to know and love. This one's overly emotional, especially in the Arendia section. One would almost mistake the three-thousand year old for a girl of thirteen! There are a few cute parts, and her view does round out the entire thirteen part saga (including the book of various prophecies recently released), but slowly...slowly. So, go ahead and read Polgara the Sorceress if you're on a Belgarath the Sorcerer high, but make sure you've got plenty of time and attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't pick it up","review":"I loved the other books in this series, and was looking forward to this book for quite a while. To give you an idea how much, I read the set 4 times in 1997.This was the first Eddings book that I could easily put down. In fact I found it a chore to finish it! There wasn't anything significant which was new in this book. There were a few tidbits mixed in, but for the most part there were no surprises.Its not that I'm against the biographies... Belgaraths story was enjoyable. But at least it offered something original."},{"rating":"1","title":"3000 long years with no new plotlines","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Belgarion/Malorion series. I liked the quick wit, the humorous exchanges between the characters,and the plot. I had really been waiting for this new Bel/Mal book to happen.But \\"Polgara\\" left me disappointed, retelling that already twice told long story of what Pol and Belgareth did during 3000 years when noting much of a plot happend, before the actual series (Bel /Mal) started. Just adding the angle of Polgara's perception is definately not enough to salt this journal-of-a-time-of-waiting. It has little entertaining value, and a shrill lack of tension. If the Eddingses wanted to show that this is simply what longevity is like, well, than the succeeded. But I think it's a real pitty, because there is so much more that can be done with the good set of characters the they created in the Bel/Mal.

According to reviews, the majority of the other books got straight 10s or 9s but Polgara has scored a few marks less than 5. Polgara is written with a complete different style from all of Eddings books, and I think that is because is was written more by David's wife, and not David. The book has a a very womenly feel and has less action and humour than all the other books. Though I thought it was a wonderful book, it is not his best, but I thought it wraped up the Belgariad and Mallorean world quite well, with only a few thousand questions still left. (Like what sex are the twins!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale and disappointing","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I am a big fan of Eddings', the Belgariad and his other fantasy series. As I started the book, it was interesting, particularly in the development of the ongoing Arendia problem and Polgara's handling of it. However, after that the book lost it's way and became a documentation of events rather than a rich story. I get the feeling that David and Leigh lost patience with this book and were anxious to finish the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Eddings!","review":"Well, Eddings does it again. Stupidest fantasy book on market. Who can read the same jokes all over again from previous books? Please try writing something new if you're going to write any books in the future.

The book was well below his and Leigh's usual excellance. I wouldn't want them to see this review, because I'm sure they worked very hard on the book. But I must suggest you read the Belgarion and Mallorean and stop there!Polgara is a fine and noble character, but halfway through this book she becomes a shrewish, annoying egotist who doesn't learn or say anything new. I was fascinated by her tales of growing up, and thrilled by her years as the Duchess of Erat. Good stuff there! New characters! Killane is wonderful.After that, I'm afraid it deteriorates into one long whining rehash with only an occasional glimmer of her original nobility."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book deserves no stars at all.","review":"This really was an effort to finish.

(The Belgariad)I have gotten tired though of hearing in his latest works how perfect and wonderful the good guys are. His evil characters are all bumbling fools. They never seem to give any challenge to the good guys. His works has just gotten boring. He needs to come up with new stuff. And to write evil characters that could actually succeed in winning.Polgara just hit the same old stuff in a very boring, humorless sort of way. Her jokes are not funny. And she came of as a whiny harridan. When I started praying that the bad guys would get rid of that annoying Killane I knew the book was just bad. I forced myself to finish it, but I will think long and hard before buying anything by the Eddings again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically Bad","review":"It's incredibly dull and I didn't like the writing. For example, I don't like reading that somebody \\"actually blushed\\" and \\"actually laughed\\" and so on. Why not just say that they \\"blushed\\" or \\"laughed,\\" why throw in the word \\"actually\\" over 200 times in a 754 page book? And that's just one example, and I'm serious about the 200 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good finish.","review":"The Belgariad and Mallorean are the best fantasy books I have ever read. And to all these people who give it a bad review, then don't read them. The world was a complex and rich tapestry of characters and Events. While my favorite books were \\"Pawn of Prophecy\\" and \\"Queen of Sorcery\\" this was also a very good book. And when I bought it I knew what it was about. It was about \\"Belgarath the Sorcerer\\" from a different perspective. And though it was an excellent finish to a great series, I hope it wasn't the last. There is plenty more to write about. Geran and Wolf? Polgara's twins? Where Poledra was? What happens to Eriond? Are the sorcerers still going to live thousands of years? What eventually happens to Zedar? Not to mention every other character from the series. You see there is a wide array of interesting things to write about. So PLEASE!!!! David and Leigh don't let this end here. Sincerely, a devoted fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book","review":"I found Polgara the Sorceress entertaining and worth the wait for the last volume of the Belgarion world. The story in Arendia was well scripted, and not the just the expected \\"love story\\". Garion's family members were more than just stick figures, as in the past. Polgara herself was strong and beautiful, with a strong vein of common sense. The story of Asrana and Vo Wacune was especially entertaining.I agree with the Eddings that this book should be the last in the series. While I enjoyed it, and enjoyed the series, a new world will be fun to anticipate. The last pages seems to hint at further mysteries about Geran and his friend Wolf - nice ending, but just for us to imagine?Anyway, I recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happen?????","review":"Nobody is a bigger fan for the Bel/Mal series than me. As much as I loved those books and Belegarath, I hated Polgara!!! What happen to the wit and fun? This book plods on and on about nothing.

I felt the next 5 were milked for all they were worth (the story could have been told in 2 volumes without all the padding). Belgarath's story was pretty interesting. BUT this last one is disappointing. The only new thing to tell was Polgara's stay in Arendia, which reads a lot like a Harlequin romance. There are lots of inconsistencies among these books, especially in describing the magical powers. Sometimes magic can do certain things, and sometimes it can't. Another point that has always bugged me is: shouldn't it be Beldurnik now that Durnik is a disciple?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coat Tails","review":"Obviously a case of Leigh doing most (if not all of the writing) and riding on the coatails of her husbands name recognition.

She acts like a spoiled 16 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"This, and I say this as a fan of David Edding's work, is one of the worst books i've ever read.Why?I think it was the tone that annoyed me that most. As a narrator Polgara comes across as very patronising and just a bit smug and she seems to spend most of the book putting the world to rights because, you know, she's just so much cleverer than everyone else.Sorting out warring nations by treating their leaders like naughty children and telling them to behave (and i'm not taking the mick here, that is pretty much what she does) does not make for a riveting read.Another problem is that because this story is trying to encompass however many thousands of years it was between Polgara and Garion's births everything is very rushed and in places it reads more like synopsis of a story that a story itsef. Supporting characters come and go I couldn't of cared less about any of them as they get no characterization at all.Not recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda dull","review":"Well, when I first started reading Eddings, I thought his books were amazing. Fortunately, I had started out with the Belgariad. Although his other works are imaginative, the humor gets a little stale...it's all the same thing!

This book has nothing to do with the rest of Eddings books; I hoped to find a book with lots of action and I found a very slow book, with no action and poor characters.

I'm thoroughly bored by Polgara, who seems to know what's good for everyone. Knowing what she was like as a teenager was totally unbelievable to me. I've started rereading the Bel/Mal series and this last book has managed to spoil those for me. I've come to the conclusion that the best part of ALL these books is the first page of the first book: the smells in Faldor's kitchen. What's beginning to irritate more and more are the female characters, they are flat as (rice)paper. They seem to develop or change but three books later they still react in the same smug manner.

It takes thing that should have been simple and goes on and on about them. Being a big fan of David Eddings, I have read the belgarion/mallorean/elenium/tamuli countless times and have enjoyed them all. This whole book, however, was almost like filler. I think everything contained in this book could have been squeezed into \\"Belgarath the sourcerer\\" with most of the same effect. On the whole, Mr. Eddings might consider going back to the Elenium/Tamuli and telling us whether or not Ulath took king Sarak's bones back home, if Kalten cut up the nobleman who had assaulted his soon-to-be wife and if Stragen ever catches Elron (Along with krager's demise).

Ug, what a slog. I have never wanted an arrow to pierce the heart of a protagonist until now. The main character, Polgara, is a self indulgent, controlling, snob. Somehow she has all the knowledge of modern day living, as well as the language, sans technology, but she lives in a feudal, medieval society. She is incredibly condescending and patronizing to everyone. Also, somehow everyone around her seems to be an idiot except herself. She has no qualms about condemning the immorality of her adversaries and then has no issue with using torture herself.Unless you are a huge Eddings fan, this book will simply make you gag. She is basically a spoiled princess goddess among men and treats everyone with that attitude. If you have ever had to deal with this type of personality, you just want to slap them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to read, but not as good as the earlier books.","review":"Polgara the sorceress is a good book to read but gets a bit long winded in the middle, during her time in Vo Wacune.

However, Polgara's book is a disappointment. I waited for it for so long and, after reading it twice, am unhappy with it. She comes across as whiny and not as powerful as we have been led to believe. The Eddings' humor, which I loved so much in the other eleven books, gets a little old by the end and there are some fairly obvious inconsistancies, both in reference to the previous series and within the book itself-- they seem almost like editing mistakes.

The only thing, however, I found dissapointing, were the few discrepencies between Polgara the Sorceress and Belgarath the Sorcerer. Such as the wording of what was said.

The narrarator will commonly tell you to go into some pose, or do some move, but she's using a name like, \\"temple pose\\" without explaining it.2. There is no slow break-down of the moves. I can see how a highly experienced dancer might get bored by that part, and therefore, enjoy the lack of direction in the DVD. But some of the moves can harm your back and neck and there is no attempt made to teach these moves in a safe way. I call that sloppy and irresponsible.3. Eh. Nothing moved me.

In one particular song he outright lies when he sings the lyrics \\"no, I don't have a gun\\"...and I think we all know now that he in fact did have a gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Is Too Good!","review":"If this scale was backwards this song would rate an easy 20for the most disgusting thing EVER commited to audio!Why?Reason Number 1#Grunge covered the rest of modern rocklike a blanket and almost all rock music in 2004 isactually grunge very thinly disguised.Reason Number 2#The song isn't among Nirvana's bestand is poorly written,poorly produced and ABYSMALY sung!Reason Number 3#While boy bands and kiddie pop needed abreak in 1991 lousy punk wasn't the way to do it.Reason Number 4#The bands overall message of cynicismresulted in a whole generation of disaffected youth andlet's not forget Kurt Cobain's suiside,the Kip Kincklemurders oh,and Columbine;all fallout from the world thismusic helped to create.Reason Number 5#The most ridiculous music video of alltime!Oh,and the song is better heard covered by jazzartists.And there you have it-my opinion on the downward spiral ofpopular music as of this historically destructive song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow this is unparalleled","review":"Short and sweet - this is a great single. One of the best ever, probably. Teen Spirit was a teenage anthem with good reason, it had amazing sound, the supreme rocking riff, deep relatable lyrics, and passion. Following Teen Spirit is another one of Nirvana's best works ever Even In His Youth. Kurt wrote pain songs like other people would write love songs, and they're incredible. I can't imagine why Even In His Youth isn't on the greatest hits album, it has the same passion as YKYR and the same groove as Floyd the Barber. After that is Aneurysm, I think the live version is a bit better but it's still a great Nirvana song with brilliant vocal yelling.Nirvana's got tons of worth while material and this is one part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"If I die before I wake, I hope I don't come back a slave\\"","review":"A great single. \\"Even in His Youth\\" and \\"Aneurysm\\" are extremely raw and quite sloppy, which may put many people off (on these two songs, don't expect consistent technical quality in the vein of \\"Teen Spirit\\"). The sloppiness only bothered me in \\"Aneurysm\\". The Incesticide version, overall, is better, but the intro on the SLTS version beats the Incesticide version's HANDS DOWN. In other words: The first 6 seconds are excellent, and the rest of the song is... not the best (to say the least). But I have to say this, though: \\"Even In His Youth\\", despite its raggedness,is one of Nirvana's best songs. So good, in fact, that they should've scrapped a song off the second half of Nevermind (perhaps \\"Lounge Act\\" or \\"On a Plain\\"), and replaced it with \\"Even In His Youth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song with 2 songs to back it up","review":"This is one of the most worthwhile single I have seen in a long time. First, it has Teen Spirit, which is probably the most well known Nirvana song, and to back it up it has two songs which most people have never heard. both songs are great (I myself prefer \\"Even in his youth\\", but both are great) It is a very good buy for the avid nirvana fan and is well worth the cost. I highly recomend this single to any one who enjoys great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a great single with Smells Like Teen Spirit, Aneurysm, And Even In His Youth, From The Hormoaning Import. If u like nirvana this is something to get along with the other 5 singles they have.

It is uplifting and inspiring, if somewhat idealistic, but after all, if we can't be idealistic in our reading what else is there to inspire us?

The main character Darby is so cool and real, and the stories she tells about her time growing up in the 1920s with a black best friend are perfect. It was entertaing, pretty, and funny a lot. It even got exciting. She's brave and doesn't try to be, which is the best thing. I've never read a book so fast and enjoyed a story so much for just the way it feels and sounds and kind of goes. I wish all of the characters were around here for me to meet, and I wish I could see Bennettsville where she lives. I try to imagine it a lot now. I try to picture her and back to when she was a girl, and it's so different, like how her twelve year old brother can drive and black and white kids aren't supposed to be friends but they are anyway, even though a lot of adults don't like it. I think it's the best book I'll ever read, with the best type of story and the best way to learn about the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great historical book about a little girl named Darby","review":"I really enjoyed this book about a 9 year old girl and her family. Dary Carmichael is a 10 year old girl growin up in Marlboro County, SC, with Evette her black friend, her ma , hre pa, Aunt geer, hr brother Mcall and her friend Beth. it is about when Little Darby desides to be a news-paper girl and publisies a story in the local news-paper about toads, after that great report, she writes about her great Uncle Henry bein' blind, next she writes a story that gets the Ku Klux Klan all active again. Darby writes a story that showed at that time that kids were smarter then the grown-ups, will peace ever restore it's slef in Marlboro County? read this faboulus book and find out. I reccommend this book to people who like hisory and reading about the civil war, for the ages of 9,10, 11,12 ,13 year-olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good book my teacher made us read","review":"My teacher made us read Darby, and I didn't want to. Now I'm so happy she did. It was the most intresting story I've ever expirienced at school. It was so good that I was entertained the entire time I read it. I loved Darby as a girl and I wish I was her . It's important issues that she was involved in, about race and how everybody needs to get along better in the world. It really might be the coolest story. I know it was the nicesyt a teacher ever made me read. I would read it without a teacher telling me to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sink your teeth into Nocturnals","review":"Ths sourcebook is filled with great art, intriging settings and a plethora of information on everyone's favorite midnight defenders. The book includes an original story that leaves you with a cliff hanger to run with. Characters in the world of Nocturnals are designed to be a little less powerful than your typical Mutants and Masterminds heroes, which is good for the pulp-style that pervades the beloved comic book series.Most of the text is statistic free, with the exception of the last section, which is filled with stats on every character in the book. I think the rational is if you are not a gamer you don't have to sift through the rules to get to the story. IN my opinion, the character generation portion was kind of weak (as I was looking forward to getting the skinny on some creepy powers). Unfortunatly that did not happen. Other than that weakness, the book is great for comic and game fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is a very pretty book that reads like the worst gamer geek telling you about how cool his character/campaign is. It opens with blow by blow accounts of several Nocturnals books that show why some stories are better as comics than prose.I'd like to give it the benefit of the doubt and say that Nocturnals fans (I've not ever read them) might enjoy it, but from a straight gaming perspective it was less than useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, Kleenex ColdCare is a good product.

The tissues were very soft to my nose, and I liked how they came out of the box still folded. That makes it easy to get a couple and stick them in your purse. I have to fold or just wad up OTHER tissues when I need to take a couple with me. I'm positive that I'll be purchasing this product in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"While these tissues are extremely soft and absorbent, ...","review":"While these tissues are extremely soft and absorbent, the addition of menthol actually lessens their practicality, as they cannot be used near my eyes. When I have a cold, my eyes get very watery; using these tissues for whatever small, temporary positive effect the menthol might have on my breathing would mean keeping a second box of tissues at hand to dab my eyes. Regular tissues in conjunction with some VapoRub or a decongestant seems a much better solution. This isn't a product I would buy or recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this product a lot.

However, after 5 minutes of reading dialog about the history of the hospital and 5 minutes of reading what the nurse thought, the actual first surgery was a let down. It was difficult to use the remotes for this game and the forceps did not work well to remove glass from the wound. The style was Japanese anime with lots of reading dialog (no talking). The surgeries were lame. There are much better medical games for the PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely inane","review":"I am so glad we rented this instead of purchasing it. Over 90% of the time spent on this game is used to follow a soap-opera like storyline. This is beyond annoying. Very little time is spent actually operating. Except for one of the first few scenes, you don't really operate on a person with a real disease. Everyone seems to come down with this mysterious affliction of GUILT. Then you chase little bee- or fish-looking things around inside the patient with the hopes of eradicating their GUILT-induced disease. How STUPID! Save your money folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish....","review":"I wish I could have played this game. It didn't work at all! I can't even tell you how the first screen starts off.

Nice game which uses the numchuck and wii-mote extensively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The surgery parts of this game are fun, albeit really cheesy at times. I wanna perform real situational surgeries, not terrorist bugs things in the patient's body...The storyline in between operations is especially cheesy and annoying. I ended up just punching the button a million times to fly through it and get to the next operation. And during surgery, the obnoxious nurse talks your ear off, frequently interrupting mid-procedure to talk about it. You get a good flow going and she stops you to talk for a few moments. Not to mention, if the stats fall too low, she says there's a problem when it's too late. They die immediately after she says it. Good nurse...waiting so long to say anything. Overall, I'm glad I just borrowed it, and didn't waste money on it. The surgeries are relatively fun but the stories, the music, and constant interruptions are too annoying to make this game enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rental - Dialog heavy","review":"In short-- The surgery is fun. However, the BABBLING is Awful. It can takes minutes to click through the screens you arent even reading. After three hours of playing I eventually handled like 5 or 6 surgerys. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Rent for the novelty but dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring unless you like to read","review":"More reading then anything, game was accurate.

If you could skip past it, it wouldnt so bad, but every time you kill a patient, you have to endure the dialogue again and skip past endless screens just to try again. The gameplay was awkward and confusing at times. No instructions within the game, and I'm too lazy to read the booklet, so the learning was trial and error, and it was not intuitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, It's a Good Game","review":"This game is fun.

Why doesn't the company in charge of this quit jacking up the price?

Adequate animation, horrible scripts, even for a cartoon. Always the same plot, always the same resolution, and always the same line \\"I would have gotten away with this if it wasn't for you meddling kids.\\". Generation X grew up watching this tripe (along with Superfriends), and they continually obsess about it to this day on how bad it is. They have yet to admit that it destroyed their young minds with its mediocrity. The series is ridiculously redundant, tiresome, and about as interesting as a rice cake. Now you may say \\"it's just a kids' show\\", but does a kids' show have to be so bad? Schoolhouse Rock is a great example of how good children's programming can be.

This collection has both seasons packaged in one really nice collection, priced for only $20, when normally a collection like this would cost $40 at least. In my opinion, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? was the best show version of Scooby-Doo with the best and most memorable mysteries. If you're a huge fan of the original show you can get every episode in this collection for a really surprisingly low price. I used to watch this show all the time as a kid, so this brings back great memories watching it again and remembering the first time I saw each episode.

The \\"evangelist\\" walks away thinking he's done good for the Kingdom. The \\"convert\\" walks away feeling bruised, bullied, confused, and glad it's over. This is a great technique if you want numbers. It is a horrible technique if you want changed lives. There is no magic prayer that makes you a Christian.

I agree with the positive reviews below but want to point out that the theme of the 60s is very important to the novella. The action takes place in the midst of that urban catastrophe, NYC in 1970. The assault on the Bentwood's comfortable lives comes from all directions but also the increasing cultural decay of the era, from crime (the break-in at their country home) to the drunks having breakdowns outside their window to the piles of refuse lining their street. The writing is excellent and the imagery very imaginative.A big turn-off for many readers is that the characters are not sympathetic -- not a one. I highly recommend it to the reader who doesn't insist on liking those he/she reads about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quietly desperate book.","review":"This story is so potent and powerful it takes your breath away. Otto and Sophie, a married couple living in the 60's lead lives of such deep desperation that a single, seemingly ordinary event manages to bring out all that is truly desperate about their lives. Sophie is bitten by a stray cat, and worries about rabies. That one event takes us through one entire weekend with Otto and Sophie, and that one weekend tells us more about them and their lives than their own autobiographies could. Sophie and Otto are childless, and while Otto suffers the intense pain of the loss of a valued business partner, and Sophie suffers the near certainty that she is rabid, the author takes us into their hearts, around their souls, and through their lives in a journey that you won't soon forget. It is as though there is a deep, grey, chilling fog around the book itself, and each page absorbs you into the fog, until you too, are quite desperate to see what happens in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a masterpiece....","review":"A middle-aged woman is bitten by a cat, which serves as a metaphor for the wild chaotic world that surrounds her. Her world, her life, her marriage, is out of control. If Jonathan Franzen hadn't lobbied on behalf of this book, we never would have heard of it, and no one would have been worse off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Clearly I am not in sync with other readers of this book. I could not get interested in these people. Being bitten by a stray cat seems to be the most traumatic and interesting thing ever to have happened to the heroine. She appears clueless: about her life, about her friends, about her husband...She drifts, and so do the other characters. Nothing seems to have any purpose. And I got frankly tired of reading about the state of the wound on her hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fox-Franzen Connection","review":"Having just finished \\"The Corrections\\" and \\"Strong Motion\\", I listened to Jonathan Franzen's interview on NPR and notched up the volume when he was asked to cite his favorite works of fiction. With utmost trust in his recommendations, I then immediately acquired both of them -Fox's \\"Desparate Characters\\" and Christina Stead's \\"The Man Who Loved Children.\\" \\"Desparate Characters\\" is indeed an artfully crafted, exquisitely written novella, and would make an equally artful film or stage play if Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey agreed to work together again as Sophie and Otto. Franzen's worshipful preface, however, embarrassed me for him. Perhaps that's just his way. Ms. Fox's influence on his writing is evident throughout his work and I thank him for helping me discover her voice. My teenage son discovered her voice several years ago, when he read \\"The Slave Dancer\\", so readers with adolescent children might want to point them in her direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neglected masterpiece","review":"This book, along with \\"Revolutionary Road\\" by Richard Yates and \\"The Recognitions\\" by William Gaddis, must surely stand as one of the most neglected great books of this century. Fox engages morality rather than painting mordant pictures of supressed decadence and in doing so surpasses decades of American writers that would follow her. This is a book everyone should read for its sad and beautiful profoundity flourishing through a vein of realism that breaks the heart. Surely the best book I've read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novel for \\"intellectuals.\\"","review":"This book has some very good sentences in it, but that's about it. There is no story, and no characters. These two -- Sophie and Otto -- are humorless, pretentious people living in a gentrified section of Brooklyn and who do nothing but gripe about the \\"conditions\\" of the neighborhood. A homeless person actually urinates across the street! Isn't that just shocking! The whole incident with the cat bite I thought completely contrived and not credible for a second. The tone here, too, seems off: is this some kind of satire? If so, what's being satirized? It's not over-the-top nor humorous enough to justify satire. Is it supposed to be an earnest drama then? Then please, give us some characters who actually have conflict -- the stuff of drama.It astounds me how many people rave about this book.

I like playing freemode, or as it is called in Vegas Tycoon sandbox. For my taste it is just too easy. All you have to do is build a large hotel and you are already making $3,000 a day. You do not get to customize the inside of your hotel, just the casinos, that is if you build one. And as I noticed the people do not really care about how nice your lot looks or how well the casino is layed out, they go in there anyway and spend the money.

I tried this game out, and there's so much stuff you need to do in order to make your town a success. You need to build a bunch of buildings in order for ONE hotel to get good ratings and stuff. The other disappointment is: when you build a casino, you have to put one machine/table at a time. You can't put multiple machines/tables at once, and it gets really frustrating. Not only that, but you have to change the bet settings on each machine, and it takes too long, so I gave up. I dont think this game is worth it, so save your money and buy something else that isnt so frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I guess I'm just used to more \\"building\\" in the sim games.

It states that you will receive three different rings and that's a lie. I got mine in the mail today and opened the box and all three were the same. I was disappointed even though it's only five dollars which is still a deal. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one. I haven't tried them out yet so I can't say anything about that part. But the material looks very cheap and the ring itself is small so I'll probably have to cut it down some so that my boyfriend can put it on. Bottom line is that it's false advertisement.

But God Forbid is now among my favorite new bands with this incredible album Gone Forever. Of course the main tracks that make this bad boy great are \\"Antihero\\" and \\"Gone Forever\\", but the album goes way beyond. \\"Force-Fed\\" is a nice opening song with a fast tempo to a catchy chorus. And \\"Better Days\\" is a nice track following \\"Antihero\\", the way the track is put together is awesome. The rest of the songs are really great, and if more God Forbid albums are like \\"Gone Forever\\", God Forbid could be one of the greatest bands of all.God Forbid, these guys kick mayor whiplash!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking metal back to its roots","review":"OK enough with all of the genre labels people throw on this type of music (e.g. metalcore, nu metal, hardcore, etc.) This is simply an absolutely brutal HEAVY METAL record. You can't help but get a little nostalgic when you listen to it if you're a fan of pure metal like Slayer and Pantera like I am. Great guitar solos are found on almost every song, which is rare these days. If you are a real heavy metal fan, this record is perfect for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Forbid really must be Gone Forever.","review":"Yes, the album title is quite appropriate because everything that made this band amazing on previous releases (the shining example being Determination) is far beyond gone. God Forbid traded all of their originality for popularity and a new streamlined sound. Gone are the amazing and catchy two-part guitar harmonies and the incredible breakdowns. Gone are the amazing lyrics that used to accompany thier music. Gone are God Forbid as far as I'm concerned.I gave this album two stars for effort. The band is still and incredibly talented band, and I can respect the risks involved in introducing clean vocals into music that used to have almost none. The vocals are quite impressive, and the instrumentalists are still rather talented. This album is far too streamlined and hackneyed for this fan. If you want to hear a really stellar album, check out Determination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Since In Flames has gone down the tubes and few other bands in europe are releasing new albums, 2004 has really been a good year for American Metal. One example of this is the latest God Forbid album. The tracks are solid, and unlike your typical American metalcore, there are alot of good technical leads and solos. The clean vocals are also excellent. Some reviewers have had a problem with this, saying the singers don't have a good \\"emocore\\" voice. WHO CARES?? If you want emo, just go listen to Yellowcard or Coheed and Cambria. I could care less if the singer sounds emo. Its just melodic vocals, if you are looking for music that sounds like typical at the gates wannabe riffs with emocore vocals metalcore, try another band. If you want a solid metal release with good solos and plenty of energy, this album is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got under my skin","review":"I heard good things about these fellows and bought their cd. I was impressed that the guitar solo seems to be returning. But the simple lyrics and extremely annoying (in my opinion) vocalist allowed for me to only give it one listen. Beats the crap outta Nu-metal and new-Metallica for sure. Two stars for decent solos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Lyrics","review":"Generic lyrics kill this album. Nothing separates this band from so many others that are coming out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of 2004!","review":"For any guitarist this album is a audible earthquake! Never before has an album come together with roots from the past and sounds of the present to create a sonic masterpiece. Gaining respect from the successful album Determination, Godforbid has made a name for themselves with relentless brutality, beautiful harmony and extensive touring. An all around respectable band with solid talent coming from all aspects of their sound, Godforbid has talent raniging from the onslaught of Corey's drums, the perfection of Dallas and Doc Coyles guitars, to the trueness of Byron Davis's vocals. Derived from their humble roots Godforbid has paved the way for modern heavy metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"B-R-L-L-I-A-N-T!!!!!!!","review":"This album is perfect from the first note to the last. The music always differs and you may never know what happens next. It is interesting since they use some keyboards and little orchestration and some singing. These guys have to get more famous later on. this is a band which you should not miss. buy this cd right now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MetalCore Fans","review":"This album has everything that is great for metal today. Over the passed years I have been waiting for a heavy sound that will either take over the world or make a large impact. Metalcore has done its fair share. However, with Killswitch selling out the way they did (new singer sucks....Jesse is doing stoner rock, which is pretty good), finding a good Metalcore band is hard to do. However, God Forbid is a good band. Guitars, barking, and clean vocals...enough said. It isn't the hardest album in the world, but is great to listen to for background music, whatever you're doing. Not for the hardcore fan. Perhaps for fans who like Shadows Fall, Unearth, and old Killswitch(new Killswitch sucks...too emo). Buy it if it is your taste, or don't. Or see these guys live, then make a decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Wants you to get this CD","review":"This CD is a pure pleasure to listen to. Brutal and melodic at the same time. Thought provoking positive lyrics,combined with crushing choruses. The clean vocals are not used much but are great. The melodies are pounding and extremely catchy. Byron Davis's screams are great and the Coyle brothers riffing and solos are amazing. Excellent production and great songs make this cd much better than Determination. For fans of Shadows Fall and Killswitch Engage, as well as fans of swedish melodic death metal riffing. May not be quite as good as new releases by Shadows Fall, Lamb of God or Unearth but good enough to get consideration for metal album of the year. Again this album is very catchy and will have you singing along to many of the songs. Thank God for bands like God Forbid."},{"rating":"1","title":"owned 3 Karcher washers","review":"I purchased a Karcher washer thinking ,(if its German it has to be good), (WRONG).

I contacted Karcher customer service which replied that the hose would have to be replaced. At my expense. I purchased the hose replacement through pressure parts .com and was surprised that the replacement hose has all brass internal fittings not plastic and a longer handle at the hose end to ease screwing into the machine.

Would have liked to re-visit Annabelle and Heath a little more because they had such a great story. The only thing off with this story was the ending. It was like SEP didn't know how to end it.

As usual, with snappy dialogue, humor & insight she hits the mark with Blue & Dean. And it's nice to see a quirky, unusual heroine - something else SEP tends to specialize in. Not a drop-dead beauty that most of us cannot relate to.I also liked the 2nd romance (SEP always has a secondary romance that seems to start at the mid-way point of the book) between April & Jack. The relationship between the fading rock star & the former groupie has some nice bittersweet ache to it, without being sloppy-sentimental. I know publishers would never invest in a relationship between two \\"mature\\" people with a past history as a stand-alone novel, so it's nice to read this strong secondary story mixed in with the story of the main couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"WITTY YOU BET IT IS !!","review":"My favorite novel of this author has always been Heaven Texas but this book has completely taken over first place!!It is so full of warm, witty characters who continually make you laugh throughout the book, really a jewel of a read.This is a book you will not want to put down and you will be sad when you realize you have finished the story.I really cannot pick my favorite character there are so many,the verbal jousting between Dean and Blue and Blue's adoration of Jack,who is Dean's father and I loved the retorts Blue thinks up when holding her own with the rude pugnacious Mrs. Garrison who owns the small town where Dean's farm is locatedand as Dean says in the book his family is like Norman Rockwell on crackI highly recommend this book to anyone who loves razor edged wit and a good laughIf only men were as interesting as the personality the author creates forDean's character sigh....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, characters","review":"SEP is a very witty writer and I enjoy her books very much. I like the hero, he's supposed to be movie star handsome and loves to look good too. I didn't understand his attraction to Blue, especially the way she was written up the first 70 pages. I had a hard time believing Dean was so desperate for a distraction that he would take her on a road trip. Blue's description had her looking like a mongrel puppy...maybe nearer the end of the book, I tried picturing Reese Witherspoon with a pixie hair cut.My favorite parts of the book were the exchanges between Blue and the cranky old lady. The aging groupie and the little half sister were interesting side stories too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been a SEP fan for several years. However, with each of her recent books she has chosen to insert more and more personal political points of view through her characters until that's now the story. I read a novel to get away from that. It pulls the reader out of the story and into the New York Times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I thought the heroine of this book was one of the most unappealing characters I have ever read. The beginning of this book and the costume was ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Light read!","review":"If you are a fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips, I think you will enjoy this book. It's not one of her best books, but I do belive it was a really enjoyable one. It has its funny moments, its spicy moments and its tender moments. All in all a very fun and light read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.......","review":"As usual, another SEP story that had me laughing. Of course I bought it on CD because no one could tell the story the way Anna Fields always did. I'm saddened to hear of her most unfortunate tragedy and she will be missed. I loved the way she played out each character. I really can't believe that anyone else will be able to narrate SEP's stories in the way she did but I do hope they can find someone comparable. I love how the characters all tie in from previous books which allows me to relive the other great books by SEP. Read this. It was hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"And to Think I Found This One by Accident","review":"I was just browsing one day, looking for something to read and was turned on to this book after reading the jacket flap. How can you resist a book whose main characters are (and I'm only naming a few) a middle aged ex-groupie, a bitter football star and a rock idol? It's not often that an author can make me laugh but Phillips' dialog had me chuckling long and often. What a find! I can't wait to read some of this author's other offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic seems to be gone","review":"The first book I read by Susan Elizabeth Phillips was \\"Dream a Little Dream\\" and I was immediately hooked. I went on a one-week bender and purchased all of her prior novels and enjoyed them as well. Her last few books have been disappointing and this one is continuing that trend. The characters were not very well developed and, with the excepton of Riley, not sympathetic. The themes were fairly cliche...damsel in distress and taciturn, sex-oozing stud who by the end of the book becomes emotionally evolved. All-in-all, if you wish to read a SEP books, I would not recommend this one. I hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought she was going to break from her pattern","review":"But she didn't.This is the first novel of SEP where I thought maybe the guy would fall in love first.But OF COURSE NOT. It's the girl who has to have the hopeless love first. Then he graciously manages to fall in love with her, and it doesn't ring true.The pattern she writes is over and over the same thing: plainish girl (pretty but no knock out) meets big celebrity guy who can have any woman he wants. She falls in love with him and realizes she can't have him, because, of course, he can have any woman and won't settle for just her.Then miraculously he decides he loves her in the last couple of chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Born Charmer","review":"I loved the book as I have loved all of her books. My very favorite book by this author is \\"Lady be Good\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment !!","review":"Too many \\"Dysfunctional Characters\\" What a depressing plot, everyone had so many emotional problems steming from their early backgrounds it was hard to keep score. Story lacked the usual humor and sharp quick witty dialogue I was so used to in Ms Phillips previous books. ... Too hard to find a likeable character!! (I was so glad I borrowed the book from the library & didn't waste money on it!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powder Puff Football","review":"This book is way out of my league (pun intended.) This reviewer generally avoids \\"chick lit\\" and prefers non-fiction and depressingly real and realistic True Crime. But, on a search for books on Da (NFC/NFL) Bears (depressing this season) I input Chicago football and there was this book about fictional AFC Chicago Stars fictional quarterback Dean \\"Boo\\" Roubillard and romantic, off-field hi-jinks. .Being down in the dumps about recently being dumped, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did!Susan Elizabeth Phillips is not the typical Harlequinesque bodice-buster boiler. You gotta love a book that starts withIt wasn't every day a guy saw a headless beaver marching down the side of the road, not even in Dean Robillard's larger-than-life world.The story is engaging, the characters delightfully well-drawn, and the dialogue witty and snappy. Though this be fluff, it's feel-good, fun fluff!/TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't keep it down","review":"I love books where the girls are just so spunky and outspoken. It was fun to read.. But, I gave it a four star only because I never really liked how most of her books she has so much going on with her other characters as well. That's just me. I would recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters and snappy dialogue add up to another winner!","review":"I'm drawn to SEP's books because of the strength of her wonderful characters. This book is hilarious and heart-breaking. The fast pace and great dialogue makes for an entertaining read. Natural Born Charmer is part of the \\"Chicago Stars\\" books. If you haven't read the others, you're missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read...but not one of my SEP favorites","review":"Entertaining read if you are an SEP fan but not as good as some of her other books. The hero, Dean Robbilard, is charming and definetly a looker but the heroine, Blue, with her biker books and negative sarcastic attitude never really musters enough sympanthy by the reader to make her worthy of Dean's love. It just felt like he was being forced into loving her because well that's the way a romance novel has to end, but their love had no real depth to it.If you are a fan of SEP books you'll find it entertaining but will probably agree its not one of her best. I fell in love with her book, \\"Match Me if you Can\\" because of its witty-comedic-romance and just had to read the rest of her books after that. The hero, Dean, makes several appearances in that book which naturally made me anticipate Natural Born Charmer to hear about his story. But I was sadly disappointed it didn't hold a candle to some of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback.","review":"I'd like to preface this review by saying that SEP used to be one of my favorite authors. I loved Kiss an Angel, IHTBY, Heaven, Texas, Dream a Little Dream, Nobody's Baby But Mine, and Lady Be Good, but it seems that ever since she went mainstream with hardcovers, that her books have become predictable and formulaic and NBC is no exception. Beautiful and brilliant but troubled jock with too much money falls in love with a quirky, poor woman who also has family issues. For some reason, her earlier Chicago Stars books had some elements of realism, but I feel like she's lost her touch in writing relatable characters and plausible story lines. The plot was too far fetched and didn't focus enough on the two main characters. The book lacks the steam that once made SEP famous. I think the book is less of a romance and more of a mainstream family story since the subplots really took over the book.While it had some great lines and some great scenes, it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a natural...","review":"Before I bought Natural Born Charmer, I read some of the reviews on Amazon. Based upon these reviews, I was expecting this book to be a flop. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. This book had all the charm of SEP other novels: sharp dialogue, quirky, well developed supporting characters, and a great love story. Sure, it wasn't a 'sexed up' as her other novels, but to be honest, I was quite okay with that. I loved all the characters, even crochety Nita, owner of the town, but especially Riley, Dean's half sister, and April, Dean's mother. SEP's heroine, Blue, is spunky and interesting. Her hero, Dean, is gorgeous and kind. SEP's strength is creating a world of characters that the reader truly cares about. She has a knack for building up rag tag families which feel like our own, or ones of which we wish we could be a part. I am happy to say that SEP hasn't lost any of her natural born writing talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Fun","review":"Have never read this author before. A friend gave me this book. I have to say, I laughed out loud many times reading this book. Especially the beginning chapters. The author writes with humor and is very descriptive. I had a visual of everything going on. I loved the book. I also liked the fact that the woman character wasn't some terrific beauty and how the relationship between her and \\"Boo\\" developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrrrrrrrrrrring!","review":"Too many characters with problems. Borrrrrrrrrrring! The dialog between the two main characters, Dean & Blue, was unrealistic, wisecracking all the time. Who really talks like that? I believe the best character in the story was Nita, the mean old woman yet a softy inside. Her friendship with Blue was most entertaining to read (therefore the one star rating)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast delivery","review":"I have purchased this item a few times.

I don't know why, but the company has set up the device backwards... The mechanical filtration is before the biological and chemical filtration. Every other filter system has mechanical filtration before biological and biological before chemical. If you set this up properly, it works GREAT.Also, the picture is a bit deceiving; the filter has to be at the level of the water otherwise it won't work properly. If you place it on the floor it won' t work. I will try to take pictures of mine next time I take it apart for cleaning, but for now it seems to work great.Only reason I'm giving it a 4 and not 5 is because the instructions are retarded. It was kind of a headache to set up, so much so that I almost returned it.

Comes with dodgy instructions that are difficult to follow to put it together. Seems backwards in the way it runs. I usually have to try 5-6 times to get it to run after I clean the water - it's difficult to prime.For smaller turtles this would be a great filter, but it simply can't handle the mess from bigger turtles.

It does not keep the water completely clear and the first time I cleaned it, it worked for a couple of seconds then bubbles started appearing in the intake and tube then stopped. Called the customer service four times and the person who helped me was very knowledgeable and informative said air was getting into it. It took me about eight tries before I got it to work. The next time I cleaned it, I just flushed it our from the intake side, put it together and hooked it up and the same thing happened again so I just removed it.

When I called the company for a replacement under the warranty, they did replace it but only after a small amount of complaining on their part.Later, I ended up shelving the filter for a while, because I got tired of cleaning it. It was a small tank, so I just cleaned the tank by hand. Now, my turtles are bigger and I got them a large tank and pulled the filter out of storage.Guess what? The filter doesn't even start up. Again.Sorry Zoo Med, I can't recommend your product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crappy directions","review":"For those who are having trouble getting this to prime, here are a few things that helped me. The directions fail to tell you that you must plug the spout over the sponge into the intake (inside the sponge) There must not be any air inside the filter before turning it on or it won't work. Fill it up to the top before turning it on. The top must be closed. And no, you cannot fit in all the media that is included. Just put enough of the white pieces so that the top can close easily. The carbon bag that comes with this sucks, so it would be a good idea to replace it with a better one like others are recommending here. Otherwise the filter works surprisingly well for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"value and longievity","review":"I don't understand how this product is crapping out so soon for some reviewers.

It must have been running without water for days! When I got home, the motor was still hot but it had stopped running. I wasn't able to revive it.This filter is fairly cheap, dependable, and whisper quiet. It may take a bit of leaving it tilted to get the \\"shooojsh\\" out until it's fully primed. Then it's practically silent. The only thing I wish they'd change is to make the top easier to remove. I have to use a lot of force- but at least I know it will never leak!I have a large lizard and use this filter in an about 5-8 gallon pool.

Since then he has written several excellent songs but the majority felt rushed and/or incomplete. Rather than spewing them out in rapid succession, which he certainly has a talent of doing, he should work a little longer on refining and completing his ideas. This album is just another example of his apparent listening to producers and star-struck fans who are encouraging him to produce quantity at the expense of quality. True, there are a few good tunes here but nothing to the level of work with Wiskeytown. If you are satisfied with initial impressions of ideas rather than complete expression, this may be for you.

His interpretation of ancient chants and oms touches the very core of the listener's being. The throaty timbre of his masculine voice,.....confident, strong and soulful. Donna DeLory also makes her presence known with her distinctive and melodic background vocals. The first track, \\"Ma,\\" makes a beautiful and spiritually grounding statement.

Pope Gregory had a concern for the propagation of the Gospel among the \\"heathen\\" Saxons in Britain, so he sent a group of monks, led by Augustine, to Britain. Wolf and his father go with them. They land there in 597, and the story follows Wolf as he returns to the land of his fathers, and as the Gospel is preached in Kent. My children, aged 7 - 13 enjoyed this story being read to them, and it really complemented our study of the time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Info from inside dustjacket","review":"\\"The year is A.D. 597. Across the dark sea the shores of England loom shadowy and strange. The journey from Rome to Kent is about to end, and a great battle is soon to begin. Whatever the outcome, young Wolf has made up his mind to see it and serve the leader of Pope Gregory's long-planned mission to England, Father Augustine, In a story full of adventure, Wolf meets Fritha, a Saxon girl whose life and destiny are soon entangled with his own. At Canterbury, the old Roman city, Fritha and her father become Augustine's first Christian converts. In anger, neighbors burn their farm and Fritha barely escapes to find Wolf in the village of his ancestors. There the account of two bold young people reaches a surprising climax. And in the once pagan city King Ethelbert of Kent is baptized and Augustine is proclaimed as the Archbishop of Canterbury.\\" by Barbara Willard."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is worthless","review":"The fixed magnifier mounted to the tweezers is not the right distance from the affected area.

She'd done the right thing, yet her friend was upset. Instead of going to her friend, she figures she'll just do other things. She leaves town without even telling her sick mom where she will be. She seems to have some serious, unresolved issues with her past, but then we never learn what those things are. It was hard to relate. I also wished the mystery had been harder to figure out.

Boots up fine, but about two minutes into running 3dmark03, the machine reboots itself! Basically, the passive cooling on this board doesn't work. Note, this wasn't even in my HTPC, but in a normal Antec case with plenty of fans cooling it. I replaced this with a (full height) passive X1600-based unit from Asus, and now have no problems.

The earphones, by the way, are excellent! What this device suffers from is poor sound quality, with meager means of customization. You have two options when it comes to sound processing: Bass boost on (which makes the music sound blown out and distorted) or bass boost off. Overall, music sounds unpronounced and muffled. I've tried using the player with a few different sets of earphones, all with the same effect. This device towers over others, especially at price-point, on functionality. I mean, it does it all. But unfortunately, sound quality suffers on this device. If that's not important to you, this might be a good player for you. If you want to hear high quality playback, this isn't for you. I really think that if JVC had included more options for equalization (EQ), the sound playback issues wouldn't be so overshadowingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery perfomance","review":"Poor battery performance and the difficulty of making sure the unit is completely turned off have spoiled my satisfaction with this CD player. All too often, I have tried to play a CD only to find that the unit has mysteriously changed to the FM mode (I never listen to the radio so I never turn that mode on) and exhausted the batteries. Although the unit will turn itself off if accidentally left on while playing CDs, this does not apply to the FM mode. It will play until the batteries are exhausted, and with only 20 hours battery playtime to begin with, this means FREQUENT battery changes. There should be an AC adaptor readily available for this player with the other available accessories, as this is the only way I am going to be able to afford to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valentine54","review":"Interesting characters but the plot screams soap opera.

Nice idea but not really suitable for a child Age 3 and up. My daughter has shined it in her eyes a few times (as it happens so fast some times it's hard to catch) and now I'm worried I need to get her eyes checked to see if she has any eye damage.

While one is used to type text even when the finger hits a corner of a key on a conventional keyboard, this doesn't happen in this portable keyboard and the character or space won't appear when the finger hits the corner of a key on this portable keyboard. Some re-training (at home, not at work) would be needed in order to get used to the keyboard, and the typing speed (slower at first on this portable keyboard) could gradually recover and increase to its normal speed.

Although the flow of text is somewhat discontinuous but the author clearly explains the underlying concepts. The examples are very illustrative and have a real world feel. The author has been on the frontlines (clearly evident throughout the text) and this distinguishes the book from rest in the pack. Very few books talk about ISO 17799 and BS7799 in detail. This book goes beyond just reproducing the standard and explains the positioning of such guidelines. The tables and checklists found in the appendices alone are worth many times the cost of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate Historical Childrens Book","review":"There is far too little literature out there for young kids regarding Native Americans. But Kenneth Thomasma is trying to close that gap. Om-kas-toe is a wonderful story which takes place in the 18th century of North West America.Om-kas-toe has a sister who is his twin and the story deals with the luck the twins bring the Blackfeet tribe.

Examples of the factors are:- age- hormonal profile- race (lowest incidence in American Indians and highestincidence in Afro-Americans- diet- weight problems- occupationThe author spends some time describing the conditions precedentfor prostate cancer. The process starts with microscopic changes in the cellular lining of the prostate. Age plays a role in multiple cancers. The PSA elevation is the classic evaluative test followed by a biopsy of the prostate. There is a nerve sparing prostectomy for lower risk cancers. The high risk cancersmay require the radical retropublic prostatectomy.This work has a fairly comprehensive description of the currentdiagnostic approaches and treatments.

Instead, I found that the book did not flow well. As other reviewers have noted, Ron spent too much time trying to convince his readers that porn stars are actors and actresses.

Going into this book I thought it would be filled with sorded tales of celebrity sexcapades and \\"behind closed doors\\" type stories. Instead what I got was chapters filled with relentless name dropping and Ron's sob story about trying to break into mainstream acting. Here's a hint Ronny, Porn stars NEVER break into mainstream acting roles unless you count cameos or comic relief. Instead of choosing roles wisely like most actors with any talent do, Ron just goes through life accepting every low level, piece of garbage role he was offered. In a way I still admire him for getting paid to do what every man dreams of, but on the other hand I feel sorry for him because he is basically pigeon-holed in the fat porn star role for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"the original recording of this","review":"This was an original radio broadcast on the old Z-ROCK nationwide radio show back in the mid 80's.I was listening the night it aired back to back with an Anthrax concert.I loved this then and I still love it now!Classic Metal Church..wondefull"},{"rating":"2","title":"Theif of Bagdad 1961 movie","review":"The movie arrived in a protective plastic cover with the origial box & cover.

The Dear Hunter is such a band. Started as the side project of Casey from The Recieving End Of Sirens, The Dear Hunter allowed him to play songs that didn't quite fit their \\"controlled chaos\\" sound. The result was two of the most experimental and musically brilliant rock albums created in a very long time (Dear Ms. Leading, and this albums predicessor Act I). This album is a continuation of his musical masterpiece, crossing all generes into such priviously unmixed genres as Ragtime, Jazz, Lounge, Swing, Classical, Latin, and Progressive Rock. Add that kind of musical tallent to Casey's incredible vocals and storyline lyrics and you have Act II. Definately one of the best albums of this year, if not the best. A flawlessly crafted musical experiance, and a must listen for anyone who considers themselves a music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"mindblowing","review":"I stumbled upon the receiving end of sirens about 2 1/2 years ago and was blown away. I saw them twice live and it was incredible. I was surprised to hear Casey was leaving the band to start The Dear Hunter and couldnt fathom that it could be anything better or more creative than what he did with TREOS. Act I was incredible in itself, but Act II is mindblowing. The album has so many different sounds and instruments. Anything this guy Casey does turns to gold it appears. If you havent heard of this band check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Album","review":"My musical tastes cover a pretty good range and I have favorite artists in many genres so my smart aleck answer to the question \\"What kind of music do you like?\\" is \\"Good music.\\"The Dear Hunter is \\"good music.\\" That they are comfortable playing so many styles is awesome, but even more impressive is how they weave it all together without it sounding like a musical garage sale. A list of bands I'm occasionally reminded of by their music would go on and on and sound ludicrous: Queen meets Justin Timberlake meets Nine Inch Nails.....Take Oracles on the Delphi Express for Instance. The rhythm line is snatched from the 20s and the song is adorned with jangly piano and banjo but the soaring harmonies make the song sound timeless.Red Hands has rightfully mentioned as a standout track, but I have a hard time picking any to talk about. They are all pretty awesome and they need to be experienced as an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dear Hunter - Not As Good As Act III, But A Solid Effort","review":"This one is the second album in a trilogy that tells a conceptual tale about.......well to be honest I am not really sure what it is all about. I picked up the 3rd album prior to this one and I am still not exactly sure what the story is or who the characters are. Anyway......the Dear Hunter are a pseudo progressive rock band that walk a line between pure pop / rock and more experimental epics. The band's vocals and lyrics occasionally steer into emo territory which is not a good thing, but most of the time the material here is relatively challenging. In some respects they remind me of England's Pineapple Thief with some lesser similarities to bands like Muse and Porcupine Tree. These guys are definitely a band to keep an eye on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I heart Lynn Freed.","review":"I saw Ms. Freed do a reading and I just had to get some of her books.

A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autobiography from a fascinating novelist","review":"Lynn Freed offers a portrait of growing up in privileged South Africa in Home Ground.This is a loving and merciless view of a theater family made up of three parts histrionic narcissists, two parts evaders, and one part Lynn. Freed is also merciless concerning her own abuses of power in South Africa as a child, the lines she thoughtlessly steps over to explore and satisfy her drives. No excuses, just the events, leaving the reader to draw her own conclusions about the \\"why.\\" The lack of justification or complaint is refreshing in a memoir.Freed creates very real people for her readers, but just as real is her gift for conveying beautiful, exotic settings in all their fullness; the clothes, furnishings, the light, what grows outside a window, the sounds that drift in that same window.Recommended especially for fans of Freed's novels, who will appreciate the insight into the politics of race, colonialism and gender that fuel her fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"DO NOT BUY!

As a secondary benefit of psyllium therapy, my doctor advised that psyllium can be useful for reducing cholesterol levels. I use the product twice daily on the road, and have never had any complications from it; further, my cholesterol and digestive health are excellent. If you want to use a fiber supplement, this is the most convenient I have found, especially for people who travel frequently.

How easy it is to think we know the facts, yet how hard it is to truly understand the situation. Read this book and review your history. I think you will find that this author has given new light to the subject. She does not ask you to take sides, but shows the humanity, love and compassion in a family who loved their land, their home and their Rabbi neighbor,only to lose everything when they had to flee the country. Even the olive takes on a new meaning. This book is powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entrancing and Educational","review":"This book was extraordinarily eye opening for me! I was made aware of my ignorace in the plight of the Palistinians. I like many Americans believed that they were all terrorists, this book showed me how wrong I was! Moghrabi's Olives shows the strength of one family through many conflicts. It is historically accurate and not radical. The author does not ask the reader to choose sides in the debate, just to understand more of the facts in an abiguous battle!! This should be required reading for all people of all faiths."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great eye-opener","review":"This book is an incredible emotional journey through history from a Palestinian family's perspective. One can almost relate to the situation as if they were there and feel the weight of all the life-threatening and life-changing decisions that had to be taken by Kamel Moghrabi in order to protect his family and his identity.

These shoes would fall off of her mid-flight, and she would fall flat on her face. Last summer when she was 4, I bought these thinking they may stay on better because of the back strap. I was wrong. These are worse. She ran, tripped, and landed flat on her face. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought they may be too big, so I put them away until this year (she is 5), and again, the first day she wore them, she runs, trips, falls on her face, and gets a fat lip, bloody nose, and a huge scratch on her beautiful face.

Most entries clarify word spellings and meanings, which a normal dictionary does just as well (with the advantage that it lists all words, not an arbitrary selection). A Google or Yahoo search will instantly clarify the rest, such as corporate names. Grammatical or stylistic advice is rarely given, and adds little to Strunk & White's better-organised and clearer The Elements of Style.

It is long (to my ankles - I'm 6') but not overly loose. It does feel heavy (5lbs) but that's fine.

The complete lack of editing and organization made this book nearly impossible to read. The poems read like an 8th-grader's scattered journal entries, minus any punctuation. I felt like I kept reading the same angsty poem over and over and over again with no new insights. This chronic repetition revealed a complete lack of depth for any subject matter.

He liked that one so much that we ordered one for him. I contacted First Act and requested that they look into providing more song sheets. It may or may not happen. So, I traced the shape of the song sheet onto a piece of paper. Then, I made light lines where the strings would cross. This I scanned into my computer and printed onto card stock.

Hmmm, where we seen this before, snooze. A few times the movie had glimmers of something scarry ( paranormally speaking ) but crash, it leads NO were. About half way through the movie I was so disappointed, no good effects with a crap budget and no real eye catching scenes. I dont understand why other people like this snoozer of a movie. It is so typical of the current trend of hearing sudden noises or weird noises in a dark house, whew I'm wetting in my pants and covering my eyes , can we say Paranormal Activity number who gives a hoot rip off.

Not interested in her killing everyone while naked with a screwdriver to the back of the head. I stopped paying much attention so probably lost alot of the plot to the movie but it wasn't worth knowing to begin with. The only part I liked was the end where she walks out to some thing in the woods. Glad it was on Netflix so I didn't really waste any money with all the tons of movies and shows I watch on there.

I think the lead actress did a good job in that role as she desends into madness from a happy newlywed to a possessed killer. What I liked most were a series of special features that do a documentary-style backstory on the history of the house.

Totally original but draws comparisons with Kill List and Lars VonTrier's Antichrist. If you need a plot totally spelled out for you, this is not your film, but for those of us who like a little mystery and controversy, this is it! I'm watching it now for the 3rd time and I can't get over how good the acting is. The \\"found footage\\" genre is a little played out but it's a very small aspect of this movie. And despite the tag lines, it has nothing to do with exorcism or possession. This is a film about mental illness and abuse; subjects far scarier than the paranormal because they actually exist. Warning for those with sensitive ears: there is a high-pitched buzzing in several intense scenes and I assume the purpose is to raise the discomfort level. It was kind of painful to me but my male friends say they can't even hear it.

I pride myself on being open-minded and respectful of others' tastes, but still, there's just nothing new here, folks. I simply can't imagine why anyone would consider this a particularly good flick. If you like to dim all the lights and be frightened, and the same old stuff--footsteps, eerie voices, and so forth--still does it for you, then \\"Lovely Molly\\" may be worth it.

But even that scene was ruined before it could end, and its gravity was completed negated by the following scene.

I was immediately disappointed. #1 It's extremely loud, making it almost impossible to trim ear hair. #2 it does a poor job trimming body hair as it tugs on every other blade of hair. and #3 it's attachment is a real POS!

Even though the model numbers keep changing, probably due to cosmetic differences, they are all virtually the same with the same interchangeable attachments, etc. The thing I like the most is that if the battery gets depleted, you no longer have to wait until the battery is recharged.

I think that confidence is what convinced me to look beyond the less-than-stellar reviews associated with this Groomsman trimmer.

After charging this thing overnight (and more ) the trimmer starts out barely moving. Within 5 minutes it speeds up some, and after you have cut most your beard and mustache at this slower speed the machine finally gets close to what I would say is 3/4 speed when I'm already done. So I tried to \\"outsmart\\" the machine and turned it on for 5 minutes to warm up, but when I did, the machine went even slower and never got up to speed. It drove me crazy. I have a full speed Oster hair trimmer that is corded and that really is the only thing that has the power to tackle any hair cutting,since it does not rely on a lame battery.Get a corded 120v cutter of some type.

Received today...","review":"I just received this Wahl trimmer today and am very happy! I bought it after reading many other reviews on Amazon, and many of the good reviews were true. The trimmer has already given me noticeably the nicest trim I've ever had. It trims very fast and smooth, very evenly, and does not catch or pull on any whiskers like some of my other trimmers have. Also, the main adjustable length attachment trims very close on my mustache under my nose, where some others have not.Some of the critiques that I read are correct also. The trimmer is quite noisy, though I don't mind that too much. Also, the plastic attachments were difficult to use. They didn't attach easily the first time, but I assume that will become much easier with some practice.So far, I'm very satisfied, especially for the price!

It's not perfect, but no manufacturer's beard trimmers are (and believe me I've tried a lot of them). At this price point it's still a bargain. I'd be delighted if wahl made a higher-end product and would gladly pay more money for it. Apparently they've decided their customer base can't/won't support it.Pros - inexpensive and represents good value relative to like products; easy to take top screen off in order to clean the head unit; attachments mount easily as long as you understand you'll need to gently spread the attachment at one end, fit the other end on to the head, and then fit the spread side on to the head.

Nothing half as easy as the Panasonic or Phillips. There is no easy way to store the attachments either. The base only has room for about half of them.

Trimmer guide unstable","review":"This trimmer appears to be a quality-built product, and after about a year of use I can't complain about the trimmer itself. My issue lies with the adjustable trimmer guide. The guide itself is a cheap piece of plastic that snaps on to the trimmer. Unfortunately, this arrangement is none too stable, nor are the settings on the trimmer. As a result I've had to drastically shorten my beard twice now due to the trimmer guide slipping to a lower setting mid-trim. The second time happened yesterday - thus I'm on Amazon now to find a replacement trimmer.

This one was bad, really bad. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trims well","review":"This product works very well. The 3 cutting guides allow you to pick the correct length.

It is easy to use, comfortable to hold, and does a reasonably good job of trimming. I owned a model made in the mid-nineties that was much inferior in quality and frequently shorted out, discharged the battery, etc. The only change in the new model I don't like over the earlier model is the trimmer attachment design - it is quite difficult to get it to snap (and stay) in place over the blade set. Also, the instruction booklet offers little or no help in explaining the easiest way to snap the trimmer attachment in place.

After 5 years or so of service, the Norelco conked out, and its only modern analog from Norelco, the T980 has a goofy vacuum feature that sounded like a gimmick to me. So I bought this Wahl.It takes way more passes over the same spot with the Wahl to get my beard to look even close to uniform length. And it still can't get the same uniformity as the Norelco T860 did. The Wahl is also narrower, so it's more passes over the same spot and more passes still to cover the whole beard, so it just takes a lot longer to use.Also, the adjustable length attachment on the Wahl doesn't lock in place very well, so it slipped a couple of times and left short spots.I gave up and bought the Norelco T980 with the goofy vacuum and \\"turbo\\" features. It is gimmicky as predicted, but it works a lot better than the Wahl for trimming my beard, so I can overlook all the silly business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Nice looking trimmer. As stated in previous posts - the attachments are worthless - very hard to put on and change. I tried to put one of them on and ended up breaking it - so I gave up on the attachments.

If you needed it for versatility with different attachments - I would not recommend purchasing.UPDATE:It lost holding it charge after about a year and ended up throwing it away.

Its such a bother now that I almost never use it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good trimmer, poor design of adjustable trimming guide","review":"Overall this trimmer seems to be of high quality and works well. However there is one glaring flaw in the design. The trimmer comes with a \\"6-position guide\\" attachment that allows you to adjust the trim length without changing attachments. It is a great idea with a flawed implementation. One must still remove this attachment to do edge touch up, and to clean the blades. I find this adjustable guide very difficult to remove, and even more difficult to put back on. While trying to do this the adjustable guide came apart. The instructions note that the guide comes in two pieces that should not be separated. Well, if that is the case why make it in two pieces? I eventually got it back together and back on the trimmer. What a PITA! I have to struggle with this thing every time I use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid Trimmer - Poor Attachments - Second Opinion","review":"The metal trimmer is excellent quality. But it is no better than the attachments that allow trimming. These attachments are almost impossible to attach to the metal trimmer.

But this was sooooo pretentious. I stopped reading the inserts from the book-within-the-book after dragging my way through one or two boring, opaque selections. There were other parts of the book I didn't understand because they were about academics. Let those in the know enjoy. The rest of us would prefer to have the author help us out.

That just isn't Ms. Clark's style however. Even with an ending that I felt left too many loose ends, I didn't come away from this read with any true dissapointment. I would definitely recommend this novel to any reader looking for suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read Higgins Clark for quite some time, and was looking forward to this one.

Maybe because I was younger when I picked up her first novel, I did enjoy her writing but not anymore. I will admit the story itself was O.K., but her style of writing is so sophomoric, that I can not stomach another book. Yes I did read to the end to find out what happened, eventho I did guess a little over half way through, but noone talks or thinks the way she writes. At least this book left out all her 1930 phrases such as calling everyone \\"darling\\" a phrase used very little now-a-days. I'm sorry to be so harsh, but I just don't know how this woman has become the best-seling author that she is unless it is that quality of writing is no longer a prerequsite for a good novel. I also have to agree with other reviews that I was very disappointed in her use of psychic phenomenon.

This was the first book I have read written by Mary Higgins Clark and I was completely disappointed. I read all these reviews about how great it was and considering it was about ghosts and psychic phenomena I decided to go ahead and purchase it. One of the reviews had stated something about MHC's writing being choppy, which I found and there really wasn't much about psychic phenomena or ghosts in the story. I was waiting for one of the chapters to grab my attention, but the only one that did was the last chapter...when I was finally finished. Oh well, on to a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only mystery here is how did this book get good reviews?","review":"I've been an avid fan of Mary Higgins Clark since I was a teenager and in the last 4 years or so her books have gone from well written mysteries to a sort of just cranking out another formulaic story for her legions of readers. In \\"Before I Say Goodbye\\" there is no real psychic mystery, no real sense of connection with her one dimensional characters, and certainly no real sense of menace that used to pervade Mary Higgins Clark's books. Instead it just seemed like she was going through the motions and taking the easiest and the least challenging way out. Why did I bother finishing the book? Why did I even buy this one after disliking her last 4? Sentimental feelings I guess. I have to confess that Clark managed to redeem herself from page 256 til the end. In those 18 pages I read what I have expected from MHC all along, well written suspense. Maybe there's hope after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"GHOST, anyone?","review":"I have been a MHC fan for years, and anxiously await her new novels, but while reading her latest, I felt like I was reading a piece from the movie GHOST. While I did enjoy the novel, I was a tad disappointed in the storylines. I feel that the herione's character was not developed enough, and instead of feeling empathy for her, I began to wish that it was she on the boat, instead of her husband. I've been noticing a trend in MHC's latest novels...they are beginning to seem like V.C. Andrew novels- there's the good girl who has all of the horrible, non-deserving things happen to her, (yet of course, she is an ultraprofessional with the best wardrobe), in comes a handsome stranger who enivtably will make it \\"all better\\" and they both live happily ever after.

It was poorly written and poorly edited. One major inconsistency was already mentioned by another reviewer, but there were many others. For example, two characters have the exact same conversation with each other only 15 pages apart. Another example that is difficult to illustrate without giving away the \\"surprise ending\\" has the \\"villian\\" thinking something to him or herself in the beginning of the book that would have been impossible for the villian to be thinking.

Mary Higgins Clark has once again succeeded in creating a suspenseful all-too-familiar tale of a troubled woman looking for answers, but this time the story may go a little differently than expected. It's not the first time Clark has gone supernatural on us. With one of those surprise endings she's famous for, Clark ties up the conclusion with some fancy penmanship you won't want to miss.

She is also contacted by a famous psychic who claims to hear Adam's voice and gives Nell his love... But things are not as simple as they seem, and the tangled ending reveals a well planned scheme.The story line is weak and uses too many 'coincidences' for my taste, such as 2 simialar jackets...

The system 17 is the same 7 exercises as in the 7 with a few more 'difficult' variations, which is an improvement. However the best of the series is system 27 which feels like a more compressive work. Overall, the best about this set or Rael's 'workouts' are the flow and transitions between the exercises.

The acting is great and the set is very unique; however, the singing is not so good. Bonfadelli's voice is fine, just not suited for this particular role (in my opinion). The dynamic range of Bonfadelli's voice is not that great...there are many chances for beautiful, controlled pianissimo singing and it just doesn't happen. I think that the phrasing and breathing could have been a little more accurate. In the \\"Mad Scene\\" the staccato notes are good but the legato phrasing is a bit chopy. As I mentioned earlier, the acting is good, the facial expressions and mannerisms are very good, but the voice does not reflect what we see. I would highly recommend purchasing the French version LUCIE with Patrizia Ciofi...her voice is stunning and the acting is done very tastefully and holds true to the character. The French version is slightly different but still very pleasing to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mondo Porn","review":"Many years ago there were the Mondo movies. These movies took the viewer to exotic locations to witness strange occurrences and rituals. The idea was that by acting like a documentary, the film maker could show violence and nudity that would otherwise be censored. This movie seems to have been influenced by the Mondo craze.Set like a travelogue, Pleasure Spots journeys around to \\"educate\\" about certain sex practices. These include the known like legal prostitution in Nevada, and the unknown such as three people on a single marriage license. But for all its detail of so-called facts, it is all just an excuse to show people having sex.

Biggest disappointment was it did come with a sheet of paper labeling each tool from A-Z but no picture of which tool was which letter so that was useless. Last thing was it does not have a pin removal tool of the sort you can buy here for 4-20 dollars so to remove pins you have to use a hammer and punch and a block that would not fit my bands.

I know it is illegal, but its awareness is most critical especially when the whole corporate world is being \\"globalized\\".

In comes in a generic type box and all you can find out about it is that it was made in China. Of course most kitchen products are and so are all those made by MIU that I currently own, but it's ridiculous that this product is listed as a MIU France product when it clearly is not. So much for paying more for the name; I'd go with a lesser brand at a better price than paying more for something like this. The style of it is nice but the top lid has no seal and is not very tight. Therefore you could never use it to shake any specially mixed oils up even if you cover the spout with your thumb.

It may be the best thing that the publisher has produced. It arms the believer with scriptural tools that answer many arguments. If you don't want to use the New World Translation bible quotations, then use any other bible that you want. In spite of differences in doctrine, there are faithful servants of god in many religious groups. Whoever the actual person was that put this thing together, he clearly was of the chosen of god. And you can't beat the price on the used market. Why this book is out of print, I'll never understand. In my mind it is a masterpiece. Someone told me once that it was taken out of print by the publisher because it gave too much power to the faithful.

As I followed the code in creating these projects I encountered numerous bugs. No updates are made available for the code in this book. The bugs occur because of this books dependancies on Visual Basic 5 components. This is rather poor for a book that touts itself as being the Bible for Visual Basic 6.

If you want to know more details, forget it. Look elsewhere and save the trees. The online help that comes with Visual Basic is *way* more useful, both as a reference and as an introduction -- even if you are completely new to programming.

I doubt any experienced programmer would disagree with this opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited!","review":"I tried to follow this book to retrain myself. Unfortunately, the authors or editors did a very poor job of checking for continuity.

The book and Xenophon has been denigrated through the millennia for not being truthful or rigorous, but the book, nevertheless is interesting to read through to get a first hand account of mercenary life in 400 BC as well as a hint of life in Persian lands. On the other hand, the book has been read throughout the ages by school children and those learning Greek.The translation is very easy to read and the lengthy introduction spells out the shortcomings of the book: there are several other accounts of the Ten Thousand that do not offer the same account of events as Xenophon's.Regardless, if you are interested in antiquity, primary source material is limited, making books like this worth while. I'd also consider Robin Waterfield's translation which has much more extensive footnotes"},{"rating":"2","title":"The thrill is in the translation","review":"This is one of my favorite Classical texts--a thrilling \\"true\\" story of Xenophon and the 10,000's roundabout retreat out of what is now Iraq and Turkey from an angry Persian army. However, kudos to Rex Warner's translation which makes it a thrilling narrative that will hold a Grecophile on the edge of their seat better than, say, a lot of other academic translations of Classical authors. The hardest thing to get used to at first is Xenophon referring to himself in the 3rd person. This passes; however, I wonder why some bold translator has never just gone ahead and translated Xenophon in the 1st person.

The greatest thing about this book is the author and writer, FRANK THOMAS and OLLIE JOHNSTON!!! Two of the veteran and master of Disney animation. They have been working with Disney since Sleeping Beauty and Peter Pan... the 40s and 50s! The writing is also very descriptive and easy to understand.

I bought to take to my son's football games and practices. I love the way you don't sink in and it doesn't cut in the back of your thighs. Table and drink holder are great there is also a mug handle cut out really great on the cold 8:00 game days. I think it is classifeid as more of a camping chair but I say it's great for tailgaiting games etc. and you don't look like an idiot trying to hoist youself out.

Sometimes angering, sometimes depressing, this video is essential to understanding the downfall of an American icon. Those critical to the premise that Marilyn had affairs with both Robert and John Kennedy will find it hard to deny the affairs in the face of the plentiful interviews and evidence in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Featureless Review of Marilyn's Last Days","review":"This documentary covers Marilyn Monroe's last days and focuses on her links to John and Bobby Kennedy. Unfortunately, with just one exception, the players in this story (particularly the narration) appear to be bored with the whole affair. The lighting is too dark and the music sounds like it came from a 1960's stag film. For the MM cognoscenti, very little new information is presented. The highlight of the film is the riveting testimony of Deborah Gould, who was the ex-wife of Peter Lawford. Even though she was probably just 10 years old in the early 1960's when all of this took place, she is as stunning as she is believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one!","review":"This tape has actually very little footage of Marilyn, the rest is just more of the same old, tired murder conspiracy. I think this tape confuses things more than it clears up. People have to realize that a lot of money is being made writing books and stuff about all these different theories, very little can actually be backed up with facts. It is truly a shame.

Don't Buy!","review":"I bought this phone largely based on the very positive reviews on amazon. First I bought an open box item on an auction site, as the seller said they'd tested all the basic functions. The battery was too old to hold a charge and even after replacing that the unit would not communicate with the base unit, even after \\"reregistering\\" it. Was out $47, as they had no returns of open box items. So I came back to amazon and bought a \\"new\\" one from a 3rd party vendor. Although the box seemed sealed, it did not contain a battery and the \\"quick setup\\" guide wasn't in the box either. Not sure it was all that new.Bottomline, I'm not sure you can find a functioning unit and I will not be buying another.

Despite what many people seem to think (\\"bigger is better\\"), the only significant difference with a 5.8 ghz unit is it will not interfere with other wireless devices in the home/office.The sound quality of this telephone is not so good as the reviews indicate. The highest volume is still quite low (the same criticism as I read about the 2.4 ghz model). Quality of out-going message is very bad - sounds terrible to the people who call you.After one day, I have decided to return this thing and will not bother with Panasonic phones again.I am going to buy another Uniden TRU-8885.

There has never been a problem with it at all. I can take it in the yard and the sound is crisp and clear and all functions work. The quality is outstanding compared to other cordless phones I have owned. My only negative would be that the phone book only holds 50 entries, but then I really do not need more than 50. I just put the 50 most important in the list and I have a cell phone that lists 1000 entries, so I am okay with that. This phone is also on the original installed battery.

The \\"Outer Suburbs\\" were really generalized which was not helpful to me as I will be relocating to a western suburb of Boston.

In February 2007 they told me they couldn't fix it and I would see a refund check in about 6-8 weeks. It is now August 2007 and I have not seen a refund check and every time to find out when they will send my check they tell me to call back in a few days because the finance dept hasn't updated my case # yet.

It is certainly the definitive work on the subject, and I strongly disagree with the few reviewers who did not like the writing. What are they looking for? a comic book? In fact, this is one of the best history books I've read in the past 8-10 years (the best history book, and probably the best book, period I've read in that time is John Barry's Rising Tide, about the Mississippi River-- and yes I've read most of Steve Ambrose's work, and Doris Kearns Goodwin, and so forth). This book goes deep into the characters involved and the country in general. If you have any interest in either this subject or American history, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and dusty, like the Plains it once conquered.","review":"Only zealous history buffs will relate to this work.

The author tackles a fascinating subject but the story collapses under a ton of boring details. A skilled editor could take a chainsaw to it and come up with a shorter, more enjoyable version. I gave it one star for good photos and maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Achievement","review":"Mr. Bain said he spent 14 years working on this book, and it shows in his detailed portrayal of the characters, the land and the times that brought forth this engineering, construction and financing marvel of its day. Some great reviews have been written here, so I won't add a multitude of words. Suffice it to say that apparently I am alone in wishing that the financing mechanisms, the impacts of interest rate fluctuations, the subsidies, the costs of supplies and labor and the ultimate profits had been presented in a little more detail. This project was, after all, depending on how you view it, either a great triumph or a gross abuse of capitalism in the gilded age. It is fundamentally a business story, and yet relatively little detail is provided about the flow of money -- other than to politicians. Still, it is a wonderful book well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Topic, Poorly Written","review":"I was very excited about this book until I tried to read it. There is a wealth of history embodied in these pages, but it is painful trying to sift through the monotonously pedestrian and sophomoric prose. This book reads like a poorly written high school term paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to an interesting economic history","review":"For those interested in technological history this is a great book to start with. While it may look daunting this book analyzes the social, political and technological implications of building a railroad that spans the country. It looks at the corruption and mismanagement of workers as well as looking at how the country benefited from being made whole. This is a great place to start for understanding the United States economic rise to power after the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the submest","review":"Having read everything I could find on the subject over many years, this is the best. The research and presentation are just right, and the writing is a joy to read. While I devoured the book, a friend of mine is reading it slowly so as to savor the style. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scholarly, but too heavy on financing and politics","review":"I have to admire the author's scholarship. He covers in minute detail all of the Congressional and company machinations, and the role of an extensive cast of characters. However, by halfway through, I was wishing there was more description of the Irish and Chinese laborers life and work, as well as the engineering and construction problems that were encountered and solved. In short, this has to be the definitive book on the trans-Continental railroad planning, financing and politics, but I wished I could have visualized the physical construction and the nature of the country better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight","review":"easy to handle, adequate power.

I am not bothered by the former, but why Christ? Regardless of whatever the producers believe, how fools do they have to be to mock the Christ who provides them air to breath and light to see? It is one thing to doubt God, but quite another to make a movie mocking Him and profiting from it. If you would like to exercise your \\"free-will\\" and become an unbeliever, good luck to you! But, at least, please show some respect for divinity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I ever saw","review":"This is an atrocious and ridiculous movie.If the movie makers were depict/portray other religions (e.g. Islam or Buddhism) this way, there would be such an uproar about it. Instead, this movie belittles Christianity and dumbs-down the intelligence of youths. This is a bad movie. \\"Save\\" your money and skip this \\"movie\\".After such a promising lead in \\"A Walk To Remember\\", Mandy Moore's acting career has been forgettable. Her recent movies such as \\"How To Deal\\" and \\"Chasing Liberty\\" were not only bad but awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clear attempt to welcome gays into the church","review":"If you believe the Bible and the gospel of Jesus, don't waste your money on this film that makes a clear attempt to welcome gays into the church, while villifying Christians. By the end of the movie the gays and fornicators were shown as normal, while the Christians were depicted as lunatics. Typical for Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"This movie is a poorly done satire on Christian life in a Christian school. I've taught in Christian schools and the movie is simply RIDICULOUS! Also, I'd like to see a satire done on another religion; people would get sued. Christians are a free for all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for the clueless","review":"I found this movie perfect for those who are egocentric. The basic moral of the story is that it is OK to do whatever makes you feel good. For good measure the writers of the movie included a strong message that all christians are hyprocrites that have never heard the true message of Jesus Christ. Don't waste your dollar on this junk. One more thing, since when did Lexus make a \\"gold series\\"? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE","review":"What a waste. \\"SAVED\\" is such a bad movie that I couldn't even finish watching it. It was so sac-religious. Not only that but the movie has no real plot and seemed like it was written for 5th graders. It was clearly an attempt to make fun of christianity and presents a very false view at that. Don't bother wasting your time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive at best","review":"We turned this movie off within a few minutes of it starting. Maybe it was better later, but it is very offensive in the first few minutes. We watched the trailer and thought it might be interesting. It is offensive at best..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"Biased, there's no argument about it.saved! mocks Christianity and tries to justify doing so with a half-hearted hypocritical message.But keep in mind this is still a teen film and treated as such to draw and appeal to the target audience.The basic plot is predictable (a terrible structure and conclusion) and the acting is poor. The dialogue is often rushed by the young actors and at times barely audible, a result of amature film making.Realize that this is a product that was marketed to you and nothing more than that. You were exploited by Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I thought this movie was very funny, but also had a great message. The cast all played their roles very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost.","review":"Ha. if you think its exaggerated, you havent attended a Protestant Christian school. They're mostly religious fervor at the expense of education.As I spent most of my school days in a Christian school, I don't think this movie is too overstated in their portrayal of Christian School Life. There really are an abundance of overzealous nutjobs.The movie is funny, and really makes the point that you don't have to be religious to be 'good'. It is a little bit cheesy at times, and the ending may be sappy, but its still worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably funny","review":"If you can prepare to suspend all disbelief, this movie will be hilarious. Treading the fine line between blaring liberalism and witty comedy, Saved slips only a few times throughout the film. It's pure laughter if you're unfamiliar with the world of \\"ex-gay\\" programs and rigid religious hypocrisy. If you've been where the central character has, however, it can turn into an unexpected tear-jerker. The producers were apparently out to push all kinds of buttons--homosexuality, unwed teenage mothers, anti-Semitism, and....hmmm....bitter highschool paraplegic students. Somehow, they succeed in scoring laugh after laugh while they're at it. It's rare to find a movie this clean that successfully tackles that hurdle, without relying on gutter-humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie... Bad DVD","review":"The DVD version of this movie comes complete with a copy protection scheme that makes it impossible (for me at least) to play the disc from my computer's DVD drive. Many people are using Media Center PCs these days as the hub of their entertainment center. The copy protection scheme on this disc robs people of the ability to play their legally purchased DVD on those systems. So, if you're a computer-based viewer (one who's not going to go through the effort to crack the so-called \\"copy-protection\\") I'd reccomend skipping this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent movie about tolerance","review":"This movie will open one's eyes about the need for religious tolerance.

It just mocks them\\".What do you think mocking is? Being for it? Of course its anti christian. And talking about open mindedness how about making a movie mocking other religions? This movie is just another example of the Intolerence shown to christians in america."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I saw this movie recently on TV and thought, I must buy this one. It is hilarious! I love satires, because they are just too true; and this movie is no exception.

Everything bad that happened in life...\\"we must pray.\\" Ah, such bittersweet memories I have left behind...thankfully! I certainly would not call this movie an endorsement of Christianity, but that is the beauty of it. It's an in-your-face movie, so don't watch it if you're a fundie with no sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reality film with a touch of humor","review":"I loved this movie and have watched it at least 5 times. I think Macaulay Culkin was magnificent, if only a minor part. The part of Hiliary Faye reflects the attitude of many Christians who are so judgmental and feel if someone doesn't think the way they do, they'll burn in hell! This film tells us all at the end, that we're all the same in the eyes of God. It's absolutely that simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overdrawn Charicature","review":"Has some funny parts but is mostly a charicature of a small segment of conservative Christians, and so not a great satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of people must think teenagers are really stupid","review":"I see so many good reviews for this, and all I can say is, were all of you payed to give this movie great marks? This not only stereotypes Christians, but teens too! It basically says that 'normal' teens can't make their own decisions, take drugs, get pregnant, and drink in bars without giving a care for anybody else. Um, hello, teens are people too! This film acts like those who drink and take drugs are smarter than college kids and their future will surely be wonderful. Why wait to have sex when you can just get rid of the kid is the message this movie sends out to viewers. A bunch of trash as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced acting with dumb jokes","review":"It does try to make a point about Christians judging others and making up their own standards, and that sort of works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saved - for the dumpster","review":"I love how political correctness dictates that it is wrong to make fun of certain lifestyles, skin color, etc., but the Christian faith is fair game. This movie is tasteless, horrid and something typical that those who protect evil in Hollywood are cooking up these days. 'Save' yourself some trouble and go buy a copy of Passion of the Christ.If there was a movie out there poking fun at a Muslim school, the you-know-what would hit the fan dead on in how mean spirited and offensive it would be. If you think this movie is funny, you need to look in your own soul. Probably a one way ticket to a very unpleasant place in your future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself from \\"Saved.\\"","review":"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's disrespectful to Christians of any denomination, especially evangelicals, which I am not. I'm Catholic.If it were actually funny and/or sensitive, it would be tolerable. It's neither. 90% of the film spends its time ridiculing Christians. Then at the end it tries in vain to redeem itself. The heroine of the film is a \\"Jewish Bad Girl,\\" who smokes and swears, but somehow has all the answers to the students' various problems.Save yourself from \\"Saved.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Make a Film That Stereotypes Atheists Next!","review":"This film is so much based on stereotypes, it's not even funny. I bet if a Christian made a film that portrayed Muslims or atheists as stupid weaklings who have to have everything right, they would be shunned away from Hollywood and their movie would get as many bad critic reviews as Carter has pills. If you barely know about Christianity and are a really shallow person, you'll enjoy Saved!, but if you're actually intelligient and you know a thing or two about modern Christianity , this movie will dissapoint. One of these days Christians are going to make a movie that makes atheists be a pun of a bad joke, and I bet Hollywood will cry its tears out and whine that the film is too controversial, but make a film like Saved! and you get praised like a king from here to Hawaii."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not balanced","review":"As a Christian I fully realize that American Christian culture could well deserve some biting satire. But this story is way out of balance, more a caricature of this culture. If you think Christians are unhappy, repressed, narrow, hypocritical, unable to deal with reality and, yes, homophobic, then you will like this movie. Those who reject fundamentalist christianity, and embrace drunkeness, adultery and, yes, homosexuality, are shown as happy and best able to deal with reality. If you believe that, you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sort of John Waters' Interperates the Bible","review":"\\"Saved\\" is not for everyone. It is funny, sweet, sad, and quite enjoyable to watch. It is not to be taken seriously, and has some very clever moments. Bible thumpers with no sense of humor or the real world need to stay away. Yes, the kids do some bad things, but there is some morality in this film. It deals with teen pregnacy, homosexuality, and passing judgement of others. These kids however, do want to do the next right thing. Like real kids its not always clear what it is.Great cast. Mandy Moore is a stitch as the bible princess. The direction flows fast, the screenplay is biting and honest. A good time if you have an open mind. If not, this is not your cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny teen movie with good messages.","review":"This really speaks to my 13-year-old son, in this time of having lots of questions about religion, relationships, navigating teenage years, and friendship. The beginning has a scene that is a little too sexually explicit for our taste, but we can overlook that and get on with the movie. The messages are right on - people are complex and not always what they seem to be at first; there is good in everyone; religion can be positive and it can be twisted and used by people sometimes; true friends stick together and watch out for one another; kids have a lot of sense (more than adults give them credit for sometimes); trust your gut but use common sense too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie makes you think","review":"I didn't think I would like this movie and never planned on watching it, but someone brought it over to my place one day and of course we were bored and watched it. I really loved this movie. It shows how judgemental people can be and how certain things can change your point of view. I did not like Hillary Faye and I think she got what she deserved in the end. I don't think the point of the movie was to bash religious people at all. I just think it was to show that people can be judgemental and that we shouldn't be."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SATIRE on religious zealots","review":"Fun, irreverent, ironical, it's obsessive in its attempt to \\"tear down\\" a certain incarnation of religious fanaticism.The uproar it generated in its country is understandable; only some of its compositions (cadgrages) are claiming for an excommunication :).It's still a commercial movie, even if in an unconventional way. Like \\"American beauty\\". Unlike films like \\"Storytelling\\", which do not \\"shy away after screaming\\" and truly honour cinema.Everybody will have his \\"preferred characters\\";I choose \\"Hilary's gang of rejects\\" (Matarazzo and Thai). And, of course, \\"Cassandra\\" *(name !).Some days the \\"bad guys\\" will have good lines too, and the \\"good ones\\" won't be that perfect. Until the day big studios realize, we still have a film with guts. Specially in this times of intolerance.That's why I give it a 5, when it probably deserves one star less for the \\"Shirley Mc Laine\\" sort of ending :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underachieved","review":"someone else wrote:\\"This film has a great premise and I was really looking forward to it, but the plot wears thin and the script is boring.

I was very disappointed. It has the usual tropes of teen movies- inept hypocritical parents, teens spouting all of the wisdom of the movie, pranks and prom. The movie was slow paced and I was predicting lines of dialogue upon the first viewing before the actors got there. In the end, the Big Message of the movie seemed to be \\"I'm okay, you're okay.\\" A much better movie along these lines is \\"mean girls\\" and you can find the same characters in that movie with better performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie...","review":"\\"Saved!\\" was the only movie I *really* wanted to see this summer. It looked funny, and was soppoused to be different from most teen-acted comedies. I even went to see it the night it came out in theaters. After a half an hours time, I knew that it wasn't worth the hype. I wanted badly to leave, but forced myself to keep watching, thinking it *might* get better. It just got worse and worse, and more like a cheesy, everyday teen comedy. The climax even takes place at the big seinor prom. It wasn't funny, either. I don't think I laughed once. The annoying cast of charectors made it all the more worse. Despite my hate of it, I *must* defend it on one point; it's NOT meant to mock Christianity all together. It's meant to mock Chritians who take thier religion out of hand. I noticed that many of the people who have given this a one-star rating all comment on how it makes fun of Christianity, and I want to know; have you ever actually *seen* this movie???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, those bigoted, close minded Christians.","review":"If watching a movie where a group of people are portrayed with their most negative stereotypes is your thing. Then \\"Saved\\" is for you.If you are like me and find that taking stereotypes of groups of people and running with them makes for an unfair representation. Then Saved will make you uncomfortable.I am an atheist myself, went to Catholic school as a youngster, have family, co-workers, and friends who are devout Christians. I do not know anyone that mirrors the Christians seen on Saved. Do such people exist? I'm sure they do. But they are far from representative of Christians as a whole. And that is my problem with this film. Would people rating this film highly do so if the negative stereotyping was done for another ethnic or religious group?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will somebody save me from watching this again?","review":"Save your money, Christian or not, this movie is stupid. I thought it'd be a great comedy based on so many reviews, but what I found was just another shallow comedy with bad acting. How come move-makers think consumers are stupid enough to watch such drivel? I'd rather watch Adam Sandler ride a chihuhaha than endure this garbage a second time. Even if you aren't a Christian, it's easy to see that Saved! is yet another rushed film to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe all the praise for this movie!","review":"I watched this movie based on a friend's reccomendation. Although in many ways a clever movie with a clever premise, it never came close to escaping the inevitable, degenerating into a pile of cliches and even a brand of dumbed-down moralism. Unfortunately, this isn't the kind of film that would try to emphasize or understand those it makes fun of -- its just a teen movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Offend Christians","review":"I think this is suppose to be satire of Christians. But you shouldn't take it too seriously. I hope Christians aren't offended. Teenager gets pregnant. Mandy Moore swears in name of Jesus she didn't do it, even though she did. Does that mean she'll go to hell? Jena Malone thinks it's God's will for her to have sex with her boyfriend. She gets pregnant on first time. Will she get an abortion? God forbids! My favorite part is when they are arguing if MacCauley Culkin was saved by miracle that he survived the accident that crippled him, when a real miracle should be for him not have the accident at all. I always wondered how God thinks. Mandy Moore is a surprisingly good actress in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie and Hillary: What's Right and What's Wrong","review":"This will be short, folks.If you want to see Mandy Moore portray a character who demonstrates much that is right with Christianity today, then go watch her play \\"Jamie\\" in \\"A Walk To Remember\\".If, on the other hand, you want to see her play a character who symbolizes everything that is wrong with Christianity, then watch her play Hillary Faye in \\"Saved\\".It's quite an education, and yes, Christianity is full of persons much like Jamie, and it's also full of people exactly like Hillary.All in all, this is a thought-provoking film that ultra-conservative Chrisitians are sure to loathe ... and everyone else will love. Enjoy!P.S. For fun, figure out for yourself why Jamie is what's right and Hillary is what's wrong. I could explain it to you, but I'm sure you'll be more satisfied with your own answers. Have at it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The right light for a nice night","review":"The Coleman Tent Light is a specialized flashlight that's versatile and lightweight. It has a xenon bulb that's about the brightest bulb available in a flashlight and it only requires 4 AA batteries. The diffuser disperses the light throughout your tent or other area. It attaches safely to your tent without taking up a lot of room nor does it add any heat load to your comfort space.The bottom line: the Coleman Tent Light is a nice addition to your camping equipment list unless you absolutely must cut to the bare minimum."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but obsolete and heavy","review":"The product works so far, but it's pretty much obsolete now. Meaning, everything now is LED powered, which are incredibly light and compact. This guy is bulky, very heavy (with the batteries and magnet), and the light is pretty dim. I have an LED flashlight which is powered by watch batteries that is far brighter than this light, and it is the size of a large pen. This light takes 4 AA batteries and still gives off a pretty dim light. And did I mention it's bulky and heavy?Hey, the light works, the magnet is strong, and it does the job, but I'll bet (if it already doesn't exist) someone will come out with an LED tent light that is far brighter and much less bulky. I'd recommend this light only for car camping and just for basic lighting needs, not for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tent light","review":"Not as bright as I thought it would be, but it gets the job done.

It was extremely difficult to position by myself, requiring me to place it my arm's length from the tent flap, which was not particularly useful. I could've forgiven all that, but the bulb dimmed down to nothing after four hours' use! This was a brand new light from the store, which came with bulb included, and a brand spanking new pack of batteries. If I hadn't also brought two LED candles, I would've been in serious trouble.

It is very easy to use, I just clipped it onto the tent and we used it every night. The battery power seemed to be running out since it only uses 4 AA batteries, but apart from that it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius, but not bright enough","review":"This is great when you just need to know where if you're going to run into your back pack on the floor of your tent, or accidentally knock something over. Do read the directions before you set up your tent. I made that mistake and realized that the magnet goes on the outside of the tent so the lamp can connect to the magnet between the tent on the inside.

The base is metal and there are magnets located under the light portion so you can put the base on the outside of the tent and the light on the inside and they hold together without any strings, straps, etc.I expected it to be brighter than it actually was but the main problem is that every time I went to move the light, I ended up pulling the cover off and exposing the batteries instead of separating the light from the base. Looks like the little clips that are supposed to hold the light section together are not properly designed and do not hold over the separating force of the magnets and the base.**Needs to be brighter.**Need to redesign clips that hold light together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light for anywhere!","review":"This light is bright, can be attached to either a metal RV wall surface or through a tent wall using the strong magnet on the back, and can be detached easily and be used as a hand-held flashlight. The batteries last forever, and I never needed more than just one of these babies to light up my entire tent or tent trailer!I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it's heavy, and if your tent walls aren't tight enough it can cause it to sag... but even that's an easy fix, just don't attach the light to the wall (it works just as well sitting on the ground)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to Camping Gear!","review":"I bought two of these last year and was very pleased that I did. I especially like the convenience of attaching it to the inside of my tent and when needed simply switch it on. Yeah! No more fumbling with flashlights or lanterns. We put the other one on our gazebo, which worked out really well too.If I had to say anything negative that would be it is not really bright, but quite honestly I don't need bright when camping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little light!","review":"Just got back from a camping trip using the coleman light.

I've used it a few times and have brand-new Energizer Lithium batteries and it is not bright enough to see any detail (like on zippers and things). It's like being in a dimly lit bar. Also it's very heavy so when you attach it magnetically to your tent it will make the tent sag considerably. You can't use those mesh shelves, it will yank them right down. So you have to reach clear up on top of the tent (under the rain fly) then have someone else hold the other part of the light (if you have a family size tent). There are a lot brighter, lighter, and better lights for the same money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for camping","review":"I bought it based on Amazon reviews.

I decided I'd read it. I'm an atheist and I'm ordained in the Universal Life Church, so I thought I'd give this a read. Easy reading, somewhat rambling. I saw it as a sort of reality check on the totally seperate cultures people living in the same general geographical locations can live in: these are things that this guy finds/found scandalous and which I find too trivial to name. I'm probably too young to have cared about many of the names dropped and i'm not really interested in the history of the Luthern Church (whatever Synod), so there's a lot of material there that doesn't impact my life.The most interesting part to me, personally, was the amount of political pull and power he exhibits in the book. That was the sobering thought that let me get through without skipping too many pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not even Glenn Miller!?!","review":"Glenn Miller is the king of big bands. His music is legendary, and although he died young in 1944 at the age of 40, his music lives on. We have very nice compilations out there to help promote Glenn's legacy.This one looks like a nice set. It's got 20 songs and all of the Glenn Miller standards. It's cheap and affordable. Sounds great, right?Wrong. THIS ISN'T EVEN GLENN MILLER!!! The appropriate title would be 'A Tribute To Glenn Miller.' And yes, the title is '20 Best of Glenn Miller Sound,' why do we need to release this? Once again, Madacy is just trying to rip you off.Buy 'Greatest Hits.' Buy 'The Essential Glenn Miller.' Buy 'The Centennial Collection.' Those are all great sets to own if you're a Glenn Miller fan. But stay far, far away from this piece of junk.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a casual fan of big band, this is a good deal","review":"First I must note that this isn't the Glenn Miller orchestra or the original Glenn Miller recordings, yet a cover by another band. If you aren't a huge Miller fan and just like his music, this will do though. If you are a big fan of the original Miller orchestra, I would advise you to look elsewhere, there are actually box sets dedicated to his early career. The songs are covered very nice though and are pretty close to the original Miller orchestra in terms of quality and professionalim, and if you are just a contemporary listener of big band, this will probably need to be the only Glenn Miller CD you need to get the best variety of his songs. I agree that it is a deceiving title, but it isn't a bad deal either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea but it needs some improvement.","review":"These logs are ok but do not heat as well as Duraflame or Presto Logs. They are a little bit cheaper to buy but you have to really burn 2 or more logs to generate adequate heat. This product also creates LOTS of ash. They do light easily and are an ideal log for nights that are not too cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"No cheery fire for you","review":"The box shows a log in full flame. You will not get this unless you start pulling it apart.The paper wrapper does not catch fire very easily, thus is hard to create critical heat to get the log going. You will get either side of the log fitfully burning. It will continue to slow burn unless you help it along by pulling it apart... which defeats the long burning aspect.I have actually had one of these logs go OUT and I had to get it going again. It also generates a lot of ash.Nice idea, but it's not there yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reacted like a smoke bomb!","review":"Our chimney was cleaned a week ago--but my experience with a 5-lb enviro-log was frightening. After it was lit, it sputtered around for a minute, and then smoke gushed from it--my living room was filled with the smoke. We opened all our doors (even in this weather) to try to get rid of the smoke. Then, all of a sudden, the log burst into flame and the smoke emission went correctly up the chimney. I will never buy another enviro-log and will use the remainder of the box outdoors in the firepit. I wonder what was put in the log to cause it to react this way?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"A nice theory, but it doesn't work. The paper wrap is impossible to light. You need to start a fire in the normal way, and then hope this log catches on fire. Absolutely ridiculous! Buy Duraflame."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are Better Products Available","review":"These logs are hard to light, don't produce enough heat, difficult to keep alight, produce too much ash, and do not remain intact during unwrapping. Get yourself some DuraLogs because these are not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea... would be better if it worked","review":"I bought these at Lowe's as a cheaper and more environmentally-friendy alternative to Duraflame and other logs. With most other logs, you simply light the wrapper and you're done. Not so with the Enviro-Log. You need to remove the wrapper and use it as kindling in order to get the log to light. The log itself is composed of recycled waxed cardboard. Unfortunately, the wax seems to be pretty fire-resistant. It has taken a major effort every time just to get the log to light, and then usually a small portion of the log will burn for a while and then go out. I've also tried dousing it with lighter fluid, and sometimes even this is not terribly helpful. Needless to say, having to add extra kindling and even resorting to lighter fluid completely negates any supposed environmental advantages of this product. It's just another \\"green\\" product that isn't. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells like cancer","review":"This is a 0 star product.

It burned for about 1.5 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS","review":"I rate this product with NO STARS. Enviro logs are misbranded and should be forced off the market. Basically, you are just burning garbage, which might be appropriate if you are homeless and burning them in an open metal trash bin, but less so if you are burning them in your indoor fireplace. They are very smoky so I doubt that they are very environmental and there is a lot of ash and residue and unburned product to clean up afterwards. Would NOT recommend these at all.

I'm sitting in my house trying to deal with an acrid waxy, plastic burning smell that refuses to go away. The first log I lit from this batch only flickered for a half hour, then went out and smouldered for the rest of the night. When I had to kill this thing before it choked my entire family to death with its toxic fumes, all this junk came out of it -- colored waxy catalogues, shredded milk cartons, Sunday newspapers circulars, all the stuff you would never in a million years put in your fireplace. Enviro-log? What a joke -- this is a scam in which they're taking useless landfill and making your fireplace a dump. Stick with Duraflame!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash logs","review":"So far the log was hard to light and smells like waxie trash. I am not a fan.

The trucking and the manufacturing kills the green thing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY!","review":"Instead of 3 hours it burns 1.5 or max two hours.

I have purchased several different starter log products and am a big fan of starting my fireplace with one and then burning real wood on top. This product is terrible. It wouldn't light in its entirety, and I had to add another product to get the entire log to catch. Before getting the log to light, it wouldn't produce enough heat and filled my house with smoke forcing me to open all the windows. In addition, it has an awful plastic/wax smell while it burns that woke my wife thinking there was a gas leak in the house.I will never purchase this product again and will warn my family members to not purchase it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad product","review":"I just purchased these logs and I can accurately say that the box they came in lit faster, gave a better flame, and didn't have nearly the same amount of ash as the log I \\"burned\\" along with it. We had to use newspapers to try and light the darned thing and it didn't work after numerous trys. The next day (with the darned, scorched thing sitting in the fireplace) we were finally able to get it lit with the help of the Sunday paper. Because the box is hard to return, we're stuck with \\"environmental\\" logs that require you to burn items along with it that aren't necessariy environmentally friendly just to get the log lit. The product is a nice try, but, it really is a rip off. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"**WARNING***Dangerous Enviro-Logs**","review":"WARNING - THESE ENVIRO LOGS BURN FOR DAYS. BE ADVISED AFTER LIGHTING A LOG ON Sunday evening, the fire never actually started. I went to bed thinking it was out. Early Wednesday Morning about 9:00 I walked into the room to find a roaring fire going in my fireplace.I know this sounds unlikely but it is very true. This was the second time this happened. The first time my 15 year old noticed the remains of a fire from days ago had a red glow. Low and behold I stuck a piece of paper to it and it ignigited in flame. These Logs are dangerous!!!!!

Yes the chimney flue was open and the fireplace glass doors were closed (but there is a small gap between the doors for air to circulate). Needless to say, after dousing the log with water, it took several hours of open windows (on a cold night!) to get the house air back to normal. It's bad enough to breath smoke from burning wood, but burning wax is really nasty...at least for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give ZERO stars I would!","review":"Don't waste your time! These logs require a MASSIVE amount of attention. You will have a very hard time getting it to light ....and IF it finally catches, you will need to keep throwing paper or sticks in to keep it going.

Much cheaper than comparable-size Duraflame, but as someone else here said about them, \\"You get what you pay for.\\" (I should have taken their word for it...) I lit this log up following the instructions on the wrapper, and after about 1 hour the log was still just smoldering and dropping flaming pieces of paper onto the hearth. Only then ends of the log actually showed any flames. Eventually I gave up and doused it with water. How sad. I would say this: If your goal is to have a nice low-maintenance fire, definitely go with another log brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"During my master thesis I read parts of this book. One thing I can say about it, is that if you don't know projective geometry when beginning to read this book, you will not learn it from here. Yes, Faugeras probably has a very intuitive feel for this field of science but he does not explain his ideas in a pedagogical manner. My advise is, read the book and get the idea, then read some other book to do it.

If I spread the earpieces far enough apart to get over my ears, the headband twists so that the earpieces are no longer parallel - and I don't have a large head.

In several of his recipes, Vehling includes Bell peppers, which while tasty, are definitely New World. He further neglects to have his Latin originals for comparison. When compared to the Anthimus letter, written in about 450-470 CE, the techniques and ingredients used by Vehling are very modern indeed.

Too, the 26-page introduction explains over and over what can be summed up in a sentence or two: That unless something is fatal to an organism, it'll probably be passed along to the organism's offspring.

However, my enthusiasm faded very quickly. The book is a ham-handed effort to teach about the energy business and investing, in my opinion. Weak writing at best, even worse intellectual logic, Mr. Duarte cannot seem to follow a single line of thought for more than a few sentences. Further, the book suffers terribly from his attempts to be much more certain about events and connections between events than one can possibly be. A must avoid, in my view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energy sector","review":"Precise and easy to understand.

A somewhat \\"seen many times before\\" script of people engaging in a type of bait and switch scheme to get some money out of an insurance company.

Time you wasted","review":"In this film, Mickey asks what time it is toward the end and everyone debated what that meant. What type of con scheme was he planning next? What remotely does this have to do with anything else? I think it means someone who could have had Academy Award nominations wasted time re-editing the film for an unbelievable fairy tale conclusion. I haven't seen The Convincer, but no one has mentioned whether it ended any differently. The film had great potential as an unplanned realistic crime drama, but as is, it wastes your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"um, wanted to like.... but no","review":"greg kinnear / alan arkin , good stuff (little miss sunshine pair), wanted to like this story. the story of greg's demise as he makes strings of bad decisions with bad luck is ok. the final \\"gotcha, nothing was what you thought\\" was pretty bad and annoying, and one could blow a hundred holes in the idea, but it's not worth the time. I guess the ending is supposed to explain why alan's acting is so ungodly bad in the movie, however it doesn't take back the pain of the tacky performance. It seems like he almost broke out laughing in a few scenes because his character and dialogue were ridiculous. Greg and Billy tried to bring some drama, but the script and concept are really a dog overall.

He understands Islamic history much better than any of my Moslem Professors. The book does trace the history of Islam from its inception. While it is difficult for a Moslem to see the Prophet criticized (we are not allowed to criticize any Prophet, including Christian and Jewish ones), I have to admit it is hard to challenge the author. He is factual and analytical. He writes remarkably well. Most impressive is his possession of enormous facts.

At times, it reads like a political propoganda rather than objective history. Following Bernard Lewis, the author seeks to undersytand the current politics of the Muslim societies in the light of both Islamic theology and Islamic history, neglecting totally the realities of the modern period -- colonialism, nationalism, cold war, and global economic forces.

As someone who is on the left, I have *never* stated that the west invented these conditions. However, the system of slavery that brought Africans to the \\"new world\\" was different than any form ever known before.

Its just another chapter, since Mohammed came out of his cave in the 7th century and declared himself a prophet. Iran...the same goal, conquest, pure and simple. Middle Eastern tribes have been fighting each other since the beginning and continue to do so. After reading this book I now seriously doubt if we will ever have peace in the Middle East.

The only saving grace to this book is that it gives an interesting historical account of the development of Los Angeles and the surrounding area. That said, this is the typical romance novel where most the characters marry the wrong person and continue to be confronted with tragedies which never turn out well. Jealousy, misery, envy, malice, and sibling rivalry are the main themes running though this book. And to top it all off the ending is terrible.

It's great stuff. 'Sugar Bowl' is hilarious and affecting both musically and lyrically, especially in light of the fact that this was originally released in England on the 'experimental' Virgin Records . Sounds like something you might hear on Radio Disney these days in some Beefheartian matter/antimatter warp, and that's a compliment to both the Captain and Radio Disney. The album as a whole, though, was too weird for the casual listener and not weird enough for the purists. Well, there you go.This is the more melodic and accessible side of Beefheart and the world would be a poorer place without it. Listen to it back-to-back with SAFE AS MILK and pretend it's a double album.By the way, this 2006 reissue makes the previous one obsolete. The sound is far clearer, far crisper.

(Could Barry Manilow do Trout Mask Replica?) The title is obviously a tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that his music is normally anything but commercial. This album is shocking because it features tuneful songs that really connect (\\"This kiss is for the first time\\") from someone whom you usually associate with musical Surrealism. It's like Dali got all sentimental on you (as he did from time to time, about Gala.) I'm a Beefheart fan since 1969, and I caught the Magic Band in London in 1975; I love this guy, and I think he's on a par with the Greats. If you don't get UG, the joke might be on you.

We are taken to five different places, such as the Bogs of the Hinterland and the Depths of Despair.

I normally love this type of book and although I snickered a few times I just couldn't understand what his major issue with Amazon was...- come on there must be someone out there with some genuinely interesting stories about working for Amazon.

And it just ends. For someone who can be, at times, expansive and philosophical there is nothing in the way of an ending to wrap things up effectively.If what he says is true, my appreciation goes out to those who went through the experiences Daisey describes.

Plenty of references to Woo, Hark and Lam as well as their Western proteges like Besson and Rodriguez. On the level of pure actioner, it is also quite nice with some old school bravado. They ecshewed the more recent \\"Matrix-inspired\\" trappings of outrageous physics and used the basic slo-mo and bold stunts to win the day. It is a return to form and for me a hope that future HK films can get back to this standard. The only thing that marred this for me was the seemingly slapped on ending with the police chief. His subplot seemed to come out of no where and while the grande finale battle was wonderful to behold (with a Metal Slug reference, to boot) the set up was rather weak.

Some of the material is recycled from other works, but my main grievance with the book is it lacks detail regarding counterfeit detection. There is little more than a solid chapter of the book dedicated to the subject of counterfeit detection, yet; this topic is mentioned on the title. Additionally; all that the reader is ever truly explained is how to spot a genuine coin, not how to spot a counterfeit. I understand the approach the author takes towards counterfeit detection; but he should provide a 360 degree analysis on the subject if he is going to include it in the title of the book. The coin grading portion of the book is great for written descriptions, but lacks pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot of Information in One Place","review":"You know what they say: \\"buy the book before you buy the coin.\\" I bought a few dollars on ebay before I got this book.

Although other material in his extensive catalogue may not have been as commercially successful as these two late 1970s releases, all of Al's albums are worth checking out.This 1980s album didn't seem to get much attention when it was released or in the years since its release. Too bad, it's definitely a good album. Two of its songs, Josephine Baker (about the famous Jazz Age dancer)and the title track, Last Days of the Century, have all the qualities that made songs like Year of the Cat, Time Passages and Song On The Radio so successful but, unlike those late 1970s tunes, these got little or no radio airplay or critical attention.The rest of the material on this album is up to Al Stewart's usual high standards.Don't Be Put Off By the Cheesy Cover Art-This Is A Really Good Album"},{"rating":"2","title":"a mostly faithful reproduction--better than most other stand-alone games out there","review":"Probably even better than what I expected for the price.

But if you can get into this, you may well find it mind-boggling. Ant (as another reviewer pointed out) seems to be playing around a lot with alternate tunings here. Partly because of that, every one of these tunes sounds like something even he could not recreate to save his life.

Unfortunately, this e.p. does the latter. The middle-track, an instrumental, and the best one on the e.p., is bookended by complete throw-away attempts at el records razzle-dazzle circa '86 & The Cyrcle (see \\"Red Rubber Ball\\") circa '66. \\"Judy Is a Dick Slap\\" (brilliant title), however, is worth it to me: an updated take on Felt's middle-era instrumentals played with a moog which they somehow make orchestral in the best, most expansive sense of the word.

Hilarious and spot-on!This single is amazing for the simple fact that they refuse to give the people what they expect. Who the hell are the maisonettes? They can't sing a lick, in the best way possible. Where's Stuart's sad and sexy vocals? Where's that easy to follow melody and easy to be hip guitar part ripped from Johnny Marr?

Mark Kurlansky, the author of the book \\"COD\\", worked for many years on commercial fishing boats so he had a backround of fish before writting the book. Kurlansky's use of words in the book not only explains to you in detail the way of life of ancient Basque fisherman, but he makes you feel as if you were in the times of when Basque fishing was an uprising prominent respected job. The book is so intruiging the way Kurlansky sums up the history of cod, and describes it as an adventure of the century. To read this book would broden ones horizon of the history of our past and would enlighten the reader that cod not only changed the world but made it what it is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have no life, so I read this.","review":"This is an amazingly wonderful book about cod. Cod are fish that live in the water, and they are fish. I would say this book is very good, because it really illustrates life as a fish. Now you may ask yourself, \\"why would I want to know what a fishes life is like?\\" Well fish are very dynamic animals who can breathe oxygen out of water, woah! Cod are very diverse, they came from China and adapted to life in the United States. Now I don't want to be a spoiler and tell you how this magnificent fish changed the world, but I highly recommend that you buy this product. I say this because it just tells the story of a fish so good, from a fishes standpoint of view!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cod: a well written history","review":"Cod is an engaging history of the fish that changed the world. As an eye opening adventure, cod takes the reader from low impact commercial fishing of ancient Europe to the destructive power of modern fisheries. Mark Kurlansky shows his creativity and skill as he brings to focus the plight of cod. The author further illustrates the ability of super consumers to deplete a previously perceived inexhaustible cod population. In this biography is shown the effect cod fishing has had on individual lives, nations and the world. The book keeps the reader thirsting for more. The main weakness of this book would be the abrupt ending to the enchanting tale. Cod is for historians and scientists alike. Fishermen and those that enjoy sea food will appreciate this book. Cod is a book that should be read and reread by everyone as a reminder of mankind's dependence upon and responsibility to conserve earth's diminishing supply of natural resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book","review":"This book came highly recommend to me. I enjoyed it very much, especially the first half which dealt with the cod's place in history. The second half does serve as interesting moral for our times in dealing with other supposedly unlimited natural resources such as oil and natural gas."},{"rating":"2","title":"My what big fish you have.","review":"Cool book. Very readable. Cod takes a look at exploration of the New World from a different and refreshing perspective- fish as prime motivation for exploration/settlement/ecomomic well being.A quick read that history buffs will enjoy. I never really understood the process of fish preservation by drying and/or salting. Now I do and it is very interesting (believe it or not)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really different take on history","review":"I really enjoyed reading this interesting history that takes a different approach to history - how a fish can affect human history! Very well written - I've begun interesting my friends in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Querido amigo: le�� tu libro y me encant��","review":"No se si este texto llegar�� a tus mano, ojal�� asi fuese.

HIG��N TORES"},{"rating":"1","title":"Salt was better","review":"Not a compelling read. Believe it or not, I thought Kurlansky's Salt was a page turner. And although Cod is interesting, I don't find myself rushing back to read the next chapter. That assessment may change, of course, as I've only read a few chapters so far. But if you read any food book, let it be Salt.Update: I just couldn't finish this one. It's been weeks and I have only two short chapters left, about twenty pages or so, but I'm going to abandon this for the Wreck of the Medusa: maritime catastrophes, mutiny, murder, cannibalism, spectacular failures in leadership -- it ought to be more engaging than this snooze fest. I can hardly believe the same guy spat out Cod and Salt. The James Beard Foundation should have waited for Salt before handing out their award."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I like to read (or listen to) non-fiction- but not tedious, weighed down non-fiction. This non-fiction book is not tedious! I have recommended (and at times purchased) this book to numerous friends. The book is enlightening, engaging and exceptional. A book to be relished (pun intended). (Regretably, I cannot say this for the author's next effort.) I think Cod is one of the most fascinating, enjoyable books I have encountered. One great book. I have no idea why it is shown as two stars when I gave it five!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Food History Book","review":"Mark Kurlansky manages to squeeze quite a bit of information into this rather short book, and yet it doesn't feel like he left anything out. It is truly amazing what an impact cod has had on our world. What at first seems to be a fairly insignificant little fish with an unappetizing name, is shown to be the entire driving force of the economy of several different nations and communities. Mark explains the importance of cod to the world economy, why wars have been fought directly and indirectly over cod, how the cod trade not only supported but also perpetuated the slave trade, and the ramifications of greedily over-fishing. This book is highly recommended for anyone who has any kind of interest in where their food came from, even if they've never eaten cod before. Many things about the cod industry have parallels in other food insustries, such as beef, pork, and poultry production."},{"rating":"2","title":"So help me Cod...","review":"Kurlansky does a wonderful job of showing how a seemingly insignificant fish is intertwined with our history, our culture, and our future. I recommend this extremely endearing book to anyone, but especially to those who have an interest in history, ecology, or fishing. Kurlansky has created a classic of non-fiction as profound as Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\", but much more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Market economics caused an immense disaster.","review":"Darwinian science declared that cod - for centuries a basic global food source - could never become extinct. But predictable and preventable market response made rather quick work of a once indispensable species. Kurlansky's scrupulous and almost impassioned explanation should be obligatory reading for citizens young and old, and certainly for teachers and people aspiring to public office. Almost incidentally he rewrites the history of the American revolution. I have to admit, though, that parts of the account decreased my appetite for codfish cakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cod","review":"Two thousand years distilled into 233 pages, plus a bunch of recipes, on the history of a fish. Okay, when I put it like that, it doesn't sound so fascinating, but take my word for it, you won't be able to put this book down. The Vikings only made it to Greenland and America because of the Atlantic cod, the West African slave trade was in part made possible by Atlantic cod, Iceland only survived as a nation because of Atlantic cod, and Pacific cod was one of the reasons the United States bought Alaska from Russia. Very much a cautionary tale, basically a primer in how to completely deplete a resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a book about a fish","review":"This is not just a book about a fish--the groundfish or cod. It is also and primarily a work of economic history. Each chapter suggests an entire subject. Examples: The role of the Hanseatic League in the development of Atlantic fisheries, and the similar role of the European Union; The role of New England merchants in the slave trade through providing the sustenance for Caribbean slaves; the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the degradation of the Atlantic fisheries; the role of international bodies in the 20th century, both in elevating environmental issues to international prominence and in providing a forum for lesser national interests such as Iceland and Canada. Aside from these issues and their human focus, the book is also about a fish, and the role that such a creature can play in our lives. It is a very interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting history of the Cod.","review":"After spending a few days in Newfoundland and seeing the many ways this fish was used and how important it was to their economy,I just had to read this book. I was treated to a local dish that, I was informed, was very important and tasty. It was Cod fish lips. After having to sell most of the fish for a living, the lips were kept for local consumption. Years ago it was not a classy dish but today a specialty. I was disapointed that it wasn't mentioned in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enhance your eating pleasure","review":"Whenever I eat cod now, I can't help but share a nugget of the history of cod with my tablemates. I've loaned this book to three other people and they all loved it. If you find it fascinating to know the history behind why things are as they are today, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A CLARINET LIGATURE!","review":"The Rovner 1M is for a metal alto sax or a slim tenor sax mouthpiece, not a clarinet!

Personally, after reading every Karen Cushman book and disliking most of them, I was hesitant to read this new one. However, I was surprised to find that this book was very detailed, descriptive and most of all interesting! The Loud Silence of Francine Green was so good that in fact I finished it in one day. At the end of the book however, I was very disappointed. Karen Cushman threw in too many events that she did not clear up and left bold questions in my mind. She also left suspense at the end of the story where there could be a sequel but it would not have a point. Although the Loud Silence of Francine Green's ending was not impressive I still thought the book a friends who live in the world of Hollywood was an excellent story and I highly recommend for the [...] age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for reviewing","review":"I am very pleased with the Appleton & Lange test review guide. It has been more than a year since I graduated and the detailed answer section was very helpful in jogging my memory on some of the topics that I was a bit rusty. Also included in the back of the book is a handy test answer grid that you can copy and test yourself multiple times, rather than marking up your book.The book contains a wide sampling of all areas and even on some subjects that I would not have thought to prepare for such as the technological section which covers computers, electricity, physics and robotics.The practice test also has a Subject Listing which was insightful. This allows you to determine what subject areas any incorrect answers occurred in so that you can go back and focus on those particular problem areas for further review."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"this book came in very good condition, would def. recomend buying used. no need to buy new, and no need to buy, when you pay for your certification test they will send you a massive book similar to this to study from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I have used other volumes of this book in years past.

But I wanted to give my husband a super birthday gift. IT WAS A DISASTER. His pole broke on our first game! The paint on the balls came off too! I felt like if I had bought a 2nd hand item. No quality control or true warranty from manufacturer (Dewey USA) who to my surprise was quite nasty about giving me a refund. Upon returning set, I had to pay all shipping costs.

If you like appetizers with with no main course this is the disc for you. This disc at first glance looks to be the motherlode that many jazz fans have been searching for on DVD. The lineups are spectacular. The filming and sound is pretty much excellent throughout. So what's wrong? These are ticklers. They are basically 4 minute segments from other TDK filmed concerts. They end uncerimoniously in mid solo, with a few exceptions (McCoy Tyner manges to complete Naima in the required time limit). I find it very upsetting to fade out in the middle of a Joe Henderson solo. This is the rule not the exception. So what is a jazz fan to do? Just try to find the concert films on line !! You will only find the total collection at Amazon UK for very hefty prices. If the material were accessible at reasonable prices I would applaude this disc. As it is I found it upsetting, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"I was very disappointed that this had corn in the ingredients when received.

Tracks like Malibu Dreams and Peace are some of the soft pop tunes that are his trademark. This is a good album for the Kenny G fan, and for those that like that Smooth Jazz/Latin feel to music. For a new album, I give it a four. Sound-wise, he stays in a certain area here, and doesn't explore his instrument as much as earlier albums. That's why I say, it's not his best, but it's still got that Kenny G feel to it. Over all, a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"not jazz","review":"I totally agree with 'hylmunchkin'. This can't be called jazz. This is just a smooth music or soft music. I love jazz and for me jazz died after 1980. This cd I wouldn't reccomend for jazz fans. If you are into smooth jazz, then i would recomend Paul Desmond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jazz??? Not!","review":"I see people calling this tripe jazz. This is NOT jazz, its muzak without the variety. This stuff numbs the mind. Kenny G. is the Thomas Kinkaid of music, a McDonalds and K-Mart class of elevator music. The only high point in the entire dismal assault is \\"One More Time\\" with Chante Moore. Kenny G. should be remanded to playing backup for her. Kenny G. is a way-overrated studio musician. And who ever called that fagpipe a saxophone? What a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles Who?","review":"\\"Paradise\\" is ample proof that Kenny G. is a force to be reckoned with in the world of jazz. Forget about Miles Davis or John Coltrane. They should listen to \\"Paradise\\" to see how a REAL jazz album is DONE. That's right! I'm not kidding. I'm extremely serious. I'm so serious, it's not even funny. Kenny G. can play rings around those jokers Davis and Coltrane, who know nothing about originality. And to be honest, records like \\"Blue Train\\" and \\"Kind of Blue\\" are overrated disasters that would have never have seen the light of day if it weren't for Kenny G. Just like Elvis invented rock and roll, Kenny G. invented jazz. Then again, Kenny G. IS jazz! Buy this disc, for it is already shaping up to be the album of the year.

The main thing that will strike you about this album is that it is most definetly not Hammerfall which is both good and bad. Its bad because most peopel have a very clear musical path in mind when they think of Joacim's voice. Its awesome because the different musical contribitors to this album such as Mike Chlasciak, Steven Elmgren, Mat Sinner and Tom Nauman all leave they're marks on this album. if you're a fan of any of those guys bands including Hammerfall go get this.

This 1999 Canadian television production could not have paired together two more unsuited actors in Laura Linney, a superior actress with the lifeless and untalented Steven Weber. Weber's performance was so stultifying that any hint of chemistry between the two was lost. After seeing this done live on stage in 1998 as a reading, this teleplay adapted by the playwright A.B.Gurney himself had all of the stage emotion and life choked from it with Weber's numbing performance and Lee Holdridge's sappy 1970-esque musical scoring.

It is straight, mainstream history with little that is any more wierd than history generally is. Because of that, I think it verges on false product labelling. It gets 2 stars instead of one as the history that is contained in it is interesting and well written.The personal memories of a participant in various portions of history are not strange in any way. They are, in fact, the basis for much that is written as history. I am content that the book has some value to me as a student of our civilization, but do feel that the average reader will find it dry as dust.If you are looking for a book that has a humorous approach to the subject, look elsewhere.

That L shape allows them to slide under most couches or beds in order to get surface closer.The adjustable height and incline are very convenient.The only problem I have with them is that the cup holder is pretty useless (I leave mine in all the time) and that the surface of the table tends to bend.

Sure, it's slightly warped now but is perfectly usable and stable enough. My 17 pound cat likes to lay on the keyboard so the table is sturdy enough to hold him and my laptop. (It does wobble a bit though when he's walking around on it :-)) The table is big enough for my 16-17 inch laptop and a laptop mouse to the side. I love that I can pull my laptop right up to me to on my couch so I'm comfortable working. This is the only such table I can find that goes under furniture facing me. I've seen laptop desks that go under furniture, but only sideways, like on a bed. Until I can find one that is similar to this that's a real desk, i will be using the tablemate.

I use them when we want to eat meals or snacks while watching TV and on the rare occassion when I serve my husband breakfast in bed. I have never had a problem with these folding tables and so far, have no problems with the cup holders. I do use a placemat on the woodgrain tops to protect them from our hot dinner plates. With normal usage, the woodgrain probably would wear off but maybe woodgrain Contact brand covering would restore the tops. As for the holding up to 50 pounds, I will not test that claim!The three tables were shipped in one large box and then each table was boxed individually and arrived without a dent or scratch and were delivered at my front door in record time.

There are metal pop up things that you must hold in - while you press one piece over another to 1. have it stay together and 2. to adjust the height and 3. to flatten for storage.

However if you are looking for a table that will hold drinks, meals, PC's etc. This is the best TV table going.

I love how it slides right under the couch, letting me pull it as close as I need it to be. I would give it five stars, but I am concerned about it possibly warping as time goes on and the tray itself is not as strong as I expected. Someone stated it was rated 50 lbs but I would not put anything 50 lbs on this table and expect it not to warp. However, I believe it will do just fine for what I have purchased it for, which is my laptop, supper, and occasionally hobby table designing jewelry. It is adjustable, both height and the angle of the tray itself.I will update my review if I have any troubles with it, but I have owned it for just over a week and use it daily with no troubles at all. Oh, and I do not leave my laptop on it all day...only an hour or two in the evening.

It's not so much prog as it is just rock. That's not to say that it is bad though, it's not. It takes a few listens before it really starts to sink in. The opening track \\"Not Today\\" is catchy but it is also something that will be a bit fresh with each listen. Some of the songs have catchy riffs, some don't. All of them are really good though. It's good to hear Myung do something a bit different from Dream Theater though. Ty seems at home through all the songs as Rod doesn't seem out of place either.

I have read about the 'live' not being truly 'live' etc... but Al's vocals, band and sound are all pretty solid here and the 'live' recordings sound as if you are part of a small audience and he is truly feeling what he is singing.

Stand outs are \\"When God Fearing Women Get The Blues\\", \\"Stranger\\", \\"Independence Day\\" and my favorite track, reminiscent of Randy Newman's \\"I've Been Wrong Before\\"(beautifully covered by Dusty Springfield in the 60s..), is \\"Wrong Again\\". A clever, yet simple song, delivered perfectly by McBride.Overall, McBride does a good job at navigating between the ballads and the uptempos, although her steel-strong voice seems more suited for rangier material, it's nice to see her keep it under control and strive for the \\"less is more\\" approach to singing.However, a few tracks go a bit overboard vocally, (\\"Where Would You Be\\" has her screaming too much), but most of the time she tends to stay away from the oversinging common to several current pop divas and for that she must be commended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martina's GREATEST Hits!!","review":"This CD is AWESOME!

'Concrete Angel' really drives home the horror of child abuse. It has a beautiful melody, but more than that it conveys (as well as a music video can) the situation of so many kids who are in abusive environments.Since I first heard 'Concrete Angel', I've sampled several of Martina's other songs including 'Independence Day' and have been impressed by her clear vocals and straightforward lyrics.

All I can say is \\"Wow!\\" I was completely blown away by the four new songs on the album, as I was with all the previously released tracks when they were originally released. As it was when I first read the track list, my only complaint about this collection is the absence of \\"Cheap Whiskey\\" from Martina's first studio album, \\"The Time Has Come.\\" I realize that while this track wasn't really a great hit for Martina, but I find that her vocals in that song are just so amazing that it belonged on her greatest hits album. Even with that in mind, I recommend this album to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This was music to my ears and music to my wallet.

At anytime throughout the day if you are ever feeling sad, lonely, or maybe your just taking everything way too seriously. Then just put in the cd and let the music give you something real to feel. Their music is a very raw, solid feel. You know that they actually have talent and haven't been sold out by the mindless media. I always get a genuine happiness when I listen to their music. But above it all, I believe that Adam and Kimya have the most beautiful collaboration of singing voices. When they sing together they have such a strong energy. I have never heard any other duo that can sing different verses at the same time so graceful and beautiful as them. Their voices were meant to be together. So bottom line is if you have an imagination and don't want yourself to be sold then get this CD somehow, somewhere, someway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Wonderful","review":"You know, this album is really outstanding.I'm a brit living in the US and this was a recommendation made to me while back in London visting my friend Paul. I had never heard of the Moldy Peaches but when back in CA I ran out and purchased the album...such a good decision.These clever people take their NY smarty-pants, faux-innocence to such an extreme that their songs emerge grounded, natural and even touching. Of course this twisted confessional gels wonderfully with their truly low-fi recording style. The language is unsuitable for church gatherings but is in no way excessive or forced. As other reviewers have noted this is the kind or recording that really allows one to rise above depressed moods and embrace the joyful absurdity of life.Sample lyric: \\"Withot 40oz of social skills, I'm the ass in the crack of humanity. I'm just a huge manatee\\"Just Wonderful...purchase immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't The Frogs do this better? And with some class...","review":"Seriously, there is nothing here that The Frogs haven't did better on their own releases. It is difficult to like music that seems so uninspired. I don't like these people giving themselves the Anti-Folk tag, it just seems rude somehow. I don't get what the appeal is. It would be cool if one of the Peaches actually had a decent voice, but at least Kimya is a good writer, although that talent is not on display on this sloppy and dreary release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music For Idiots, Savants, and those With No Clue","review":"Only the very briefest moments of humor save this CD from being one of the wrost I have ever heard.

Some people like watching B movies because they're so bad they're good. This CD belongs in the same category.The voices (one male, one female - I don't dare compliment them by calling them singers) are horribly tone deaf, out of sync, and just plain bad. The band is just as lame, sounding like some 6th graders who just got instruments at their first garage practice.I can't imagine this band going anywhere. When they finally give up (which can't happen soon enough) they can compete for minimum wage jobs like the rest of the useless people who will ensure the next generation does worse than thier parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"beyond pathetic...","review":"...if you enjoy this band, you are obviously a masochist. If you don't personally know at least 2 bands that sound exactly like this, you are either old or need to get out more. Once again, the emperor is going au'naturale... At least The Strokes are mediocre! Listen to Violent Femmes, The Frogs, old Ween, old Beck, early Zappa, The Fuggs, David Peel and the Lower East Side, or even Tenacious D before giving this band the time of day!

They are also riding on the coat tails of the current NYC music craze, what with The Strokes getting so much hype in the media for the past year or so. Whatever it is The Moldy Peaches do, it has been done before, and with far better results than what you'll hear on this CD! Go about purchasing a Ween, Frogs, or early Beck album, before you waste any of your precious cash on this pathetic collection of songs. In fact, anyone reading this review can make far better music than The Moldy Peaches, so hop to it! Also, it is sad that a band like this is actually able to release recordings and play \\"High Profile\\" gigs. There is something painfully unworthly about the recent hype that has surrounding this group. The Moldy Peaches are not skilled as musicains, singers or songwriters? They are overly sarcastic and also very bland on top of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snicker Snack!","review":"That was a great tour of the Homelands.

Well those days are over with the Linear MINI-T. It's not that tiny, but it's small enough to slip into most any pocket and any bag. The range on this thing actually surpasses the larger version surprisingly enough.As others have pointed out, attaching some sort of key ring/chain to the built-in loop really does help when carrying it around. Also moving the dip switches does require some sort of tool as most fingers aren't going to fit in that little space. Try using a bent paperclip; it worked perfect for me.The only drawback to this is that it uses 12v batteries, which can be harder to come by than the conventional sizes. Also make sure you're replacing the correct garage door opener before purchasing!

This video is good because it teaches basic vocabulary and fun songs in French. It uses English to explain what the French words mean, which I find helpful in an \\"introduction\\" to the language. Is your child going to become fluent watching these DVDs? No. But your child can get a decent introduction to the French language and have fun in the process. One element of this DVD program that I really liked was its interactivity. The DVD pauses and asks the children questions in French, encouraging responses. This is a crucial element because the child actually gets to speak French. I have found that if I model the responses with my 2 year old daughter, she eagerly joins in. Now I don't even have to be answering the animated cat for her to answer him. And she has started singing the French songs around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Subtitles","review":"i bought both the 1st and 2nd volumes, and my rating is more about the 2nd one. unlike the 1st, this one didn't show the french words on the screen that you're supposed to learn and repeat. the recording is ok, but not totally clear, so it would have been a lot more helpful to actually read what the dvd was talking about. there's no companion book that comes with it.in the menu, there's a glossary of terms, but it's such a pain to flip from the lesson to the menu to the glossary, back to the menu, and finally back to the lesson. i would try a different dvd if i were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not good enough","review":"I found this dvd set to be just ok.The animation effects are outdated and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Give Me The Notes!","review":"That's right, the author of this book either thinks that his readers are so stupid that they will not understand the blatant points and arguments his one-dimensional characters debate that he puts notes in the margins.

Regardless of whether you extend this stand fully or peg the legs in place IT IS NOT SAFE. The liklihood that your stove will fall through this stand is extremely high. I spent a long time experimenting with it before being forced to return it and buy a table. On the package another suggested use is as a stand for suspending a rubbish bag. If that is all that it can be used for, it's not worth the cash. A redesign is needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaky stand","review":"I think this product is priced too high based on it's quality (I paid $32, I think it's worth about $20). The stand is very shaky and it really needs to be staked down when used. Also if you use the stand to place a camp stove on it you need to secure the stove to the stand with velcro straps. The good news is that it is very light, compact and easy to use. The height is just right as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy a $5 thin board for a table top","review":"After reading the reviews about the stove falling through, I bought anyway but I ran out to the local hardware store and bought a sheet of cheapo compressed board for $5. Cut it to match the stand with a little overhang and then I cut it in half, re-taped with duct tape (so now it folds in half). It fits fine in with the stove itself in the Coleman stove leather bag. Used it this last weekend and it worked great, extended to max, shoved a few stakes in the feet and put the board on top and the stove right on that. Was super sturdy and no possible way for the stove would fall.They should include something similar with this, small slats that fold out or something. I didn't care too much, it literally took me 3 minutes to cut a $5 thin board, stick some tape on it and done.They also should have a lock in place for the legs at full open, but that's minor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great safe stand for a camp stove","review":"This stand should work well with any size camp stove. Other reviews say the stand is too big and their stove nearly drops through to the ground. But a quick look at the box reminds you that it is \\"adjustable\\". In other words, if the fully extended stand is too big from left to right, then set it up for the correct size for your stove. You still need to use the support bars to set the stove on. This means it is always fully extended from front to back, but left to right is what you need to adjust to fit your stove. That's what we do and it is perfectly stable and is a great accessory. Very light and quick to set up. Glad we own one."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"The plastic clips broke on the first camping trip.

One doesn't come to such deft substitutions without years of hard work beforehand; clearly, this is a poet who has paid her dues. What appear on the surface to be mundane concerns and everyday scenes -- an argument in a restaurant, the school cafeteria social hierarchy -- are recast in meditative, even philosophical, terms by a poet with an unusually skilled ear. Look for a clever formal shift in the poem \\"In Praise of the Florida Manatee\\" and enjoy Rathburn's deft variations on the sonnet throughout the book. She also writes a masterful triolet and exhibits great flexibility and risk in poems like \\"Biopsy\\" and \\"Teaching Poetry at the School for the Blind.\\" This is not a poetry of self-indulgence. It is a striking first book from a newer new formalist, and one from which any serious reader or writer of poetry will profit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shifting Line is tremendous","review":"The shifting line is insightful, thought provoking, and at the same time subtle.

That means when you put the blade down perpendicular to the ground and attempt to use your foot to push the blade in the ground, the handle is 35 degrees away.

The bonus features are all excellent, and there are a lot of them: interviews with cast members, making of vignettes, alternate/deleted scenes, special effects how-to's, etc. As soon as this box-set came out, I wanted it, and I'm so glad I finally anted up.

The only downside to this set is the quality of the packaging. The cardboard case is flimsy and provides no real support for the films. It is for show only. The individual movie cases are difficult to deal with. The 2 discs are overlapped in the case and you must remove the movie disc to get to the feature disc. In addition, there is no release mechanism in the case for the DVD's. You just pull them off the plastic retainer. It always feels like the movie is going to break before it comes free. Still, great set for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"Needless to say, the movies are great and Amazon is great to do business with. The only complaint I have is with the packaging. The DVD cases are nearly as thick as a VHS case so there is no significant space savings here.

I always wanted to buy this set... and I finally did. The DVD's content is awesome! Lots of extras!Some Cons... Only 4 DVDs are stamped with images, the rest of them are painted in grey/silver. I would like the box to be more resistant, made in a harder material, but it's ok, and it looks great. Also would be nice some booklets, or inlays... the doble sized dvd boxes doesn't make any sense.

The only suggestion that I have if you only like sequential series is to get past the first movie.

Every Star Trek box set is like this -- several movies with Special Editions and several more movies that you'll end up having to repurchase seperately because they are not the Special Editions.If you're looking to buy something for the Trekkie in your life, I strongly suggest looking up the Special Editions individually and buying them like that and avoid buying the movies that are not out in Special Edition yet -- save those for future gifts when they get released. Whatever extra you end up spending by doing it like this will ultimately be saved by not having to buy the regular edition now and then the Special Edition later.Perhaps the casual Trek fan will enjoy this box set but even for the casual viewer, I don't see why you'd want the regular edition of some of these movies now when you can wait a few months and get a much better edition later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these movies","review":"Finally spent the money to buy a full set because we had a pieced together sort of pirated set from my brother.

Alexander K. left the band, and I think that without him the styles of this band changed dramatically after the addition of Roope Latvala. Not in a good way either. This is simplified, un-melodic, and not very good sounding. If you a hardcore COB fan like I am, then you are extemely disapointed. Their best work ever was on Follow the Reaper, with Hatebreeder at a close second. I am an American, and even I know when to use the term \\"American Sounding\\". This is it.

Although it is a very topical book, it is not written in a very lively or accessible way. The first third of the book was enough to paint the entire picture and I never got through the rest. It is not very anecdotal, and you get lost in the piles of historical stuff about tribes and tribes and skirmishes and skirmishes until it all swims together in a jumble and starts sounding alike.It is a very complete and earnest account and I have no doubt about the writer's authority on the subject, but it is more like a general survey of the history of the Taliban rather than a punchy book with a particular point."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to read","review":"I found this book very hard to read, partly because of the writing and partly because of the book's design. The writing wasn't organized enough to get a clear, linear sense of how all the conflict developed in the first place. (I do realize, though, that the Middle East has such a chaotic history that trying to organize it all and clearly trace different developments is a huge undertaking.) The visual design of the pages also didn't lend itself to easy reading because the inside margins (i.e., the ones near the spine) were so small that I had to hold the book way, way open to read the words near the spine. Plus, there was too little white space between the lines of text. I know, I must sound like a picky visual person who isn't a serious reader; the thing is, I actually read a lot, and most of the books I read are current affairs books. This book is just so difficult to get through that despite its sound factual content, it does not relate the history in an easily absorbed format."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fundamental Book on Fundamental People","review":"Ahmed Rashid is an excellent author and journalist who has written a fine study on a complex and important subject. His historical narrative is fluent and thus, makes us want to turn the pages. Rashid details the events leading up to the rise of the Taliban and through (to the time it was originally published) it's hardships. We get an interesting perspective on the common Afghan and a look into many revealing anecdotes practically unheard of by the western world, many of which regard terrorism. Mr. Rashid's book is informative and fascinating. He is an excellent writer who is able to give us the \\"definitive\\" low-down on the subject. This work is very important to today's western society and this is evident through the analitical work dispersed throughout. Ahmed has been a Pakistani journalist for over twenty-years and has proven that he is an expert on Middle Eastern Studies and History."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read","review":"A must-read. Ahmad Rashid must be commended for all the work he has put into this book. Although at times I felt the book read like a \\"text book\\", I just kept going till I finished it. With all of the author's interactions with his contacts in the region, I feel a few personal anecodotes / stories would have made the book even more fascinating and a much easier read. We now need a sequel from Mr Rashid. Maybe a book on Pakistan ?? I'm sure he has tons of material. Or maybe a collection of photographs of Mr Rashid's travels in the region during the Taliban years. Anyone thought that this would make a great movie especially with our own Taliban - the Johnny Jehadi from San Francisco ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"This book just talk of the taliban from a western point of view, which is already well-known. It does not talk of how the takiban appeals to the Afghan psyche and how the Taliban were welcomed in several towns they arrived in.

It also does talk of the Mazar-e-Sharif massacre, which i feel didnt get enough attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but sometimes tough to understand","review":"I think Rashid has done a great work writing this book (let's be real, it's the FIRTS book wrotten about the Taliban movement).

Starting with a thorough summary of Afghanistan's history and the people who inhabit it, he goes all the way up to the current day and age and gives the reader a very good idea of the main players in the Taliban, where they came from, and what they want.Ahmed Rashid knows his stuff, he has personal experience with the nation and with many of the people he writes about.It's a very well written and engaging book. From a purely entertainment standpoint the book also does well, you'll enjoy it.A lot of misinformation can be found about Afghanistan, the Taliban, and the role of other nations, mainly the US, in their creation, reading this will give you a much better and much more accurate picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading and then reading again!","review":"This book is an excellent overview of how Afghanistan became a cesspool of drug trafficking, militant Islam, and terrorism. Reading it leaves me with a sense of anger that the world allowed the situation there to degenerate to the point where the United States is now engaged in a war in Afghanistan against a Saudi megalomaniac who thinks he's a modern day version of Saladin (note: the real Saladin displayed chivalry to his enemies but not Usama Bin Laden).I say this book is worth reading again because the situation in Afghanistan and the Central Asian region is so complex, so bewildering that despite the author's extremely lucid and \\"reader friendly\\" prose, it is difficult to grasp all at once.
