But i majorly disspointed. This cd with a exception of a few songs is very bland and boring. All the songs sound extremley similar. It sounded like one big song with a few exceptions. I think suguarcult is should stick to more catchy upbeat songs then slower songs, because thats what they do best. Maybe this cd will grow on me more but i highly doubt. Hopefully suguarcult will come out with a better cd next time. Later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Wait!!","review":"I've been waiting for Sugarcult to release this album for awhile now, and it is definetly well worth the wait!!!

While \\"Destination Anywhere\\" acts as an 80's type of song... \\"What You Say\\" is one of the hardest Sugarcult songs made.. I think \\"Counting Stars\\" is a ballad for Sugarcult, just as \\"Sign Off\\" as well... a great exit to the album.. I suggest you run and buy this... it's a huge step up from Start Static...

Sugarcult has stayed true to their own style and not allowed themselves to morphe with other cookie-cutter bands who give into commercialism. 'Champage' combines retro hand claps and muted guitar with up-to-date rock techniques. Just another side to Sugarcult's unique sound. 'Counting Stars\\" shows a softer side to Sugarcult and illustrates how many people feel about their mistakes. Palm trees and Power Lines is a phenomenal CD and makes a great addition to anyone's music collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, page-turner plot","review":"The first chapter of this book, describing a ballooning accident, is one of the best openings I've read in modern fiction in a long time. The chapter was published as a short story on its own in the New Yorker several years ago, and it truly stands on its own in terms of originality, suspense, and fine writing. But this novel goes on in true McEwan style to develop the chance meeting of two bystanders to the accident into a creepy, frightening tale of obsession. I won't give away more, but if you haven't read McEwan you're in for a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story didn't leave anything to me.","review":"Too bad... This was one of a few books I got to read on my Christmas vacation. I was hungry for good stories, but this was a disappointment. The first chapter is fine, but the rest of the story is highly unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"HE RAN OUT OF WIND","review":"Great start but lost himself. The problem with McEwan is that he pictures a scene writes it out and then builds a story around it. The whole thing then shuffles along like some old drunken bag lady.Very silly bits in this story: gay obsessed stalker; husband and wife fall out because of gay obsessed stalker; attack in a restaurant; a couple in a car - with dark undertones, but whoopee that didnt have dark undertones after all(had me worried there for a bit).The ending is pretty pathetic, but it was an ending and I was glad for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a ridiculous book","review":"I am shocked that so many people found this book to be worthy of even a precious minute. The story is so incredibly ridiculous. I could hear the seriousness in the author's voice, so I know it wasn't meant to be an amusing story, but I found myself laughing the whole time. In fact, the book and its events and characters got so ludicrous at one point that I put the book down and never regretted it, never wondered what happened to these stupid people. What happened to good, believable fiction? I've read more convincing books about leprechauns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just annoying...","review":"When I read the other book McEwan won the Booker for, I wondered why. That plot was rather unbelievable and the story was rather unsatisfying.With this, again, he's stretching my credulity. As some others have pointed out, the relationship between Joe and Clarissa is unconvincing. I would buy that yes a stalker could do what Jed did. But the lapses in Joe's character and Clarissa's too just plain annoy me. I pushed through the book because McEwan is good at capturing thoughts in interesting ways. Otherwise, the characters stink.Sometimes, I feel like McEwan just collects factoids and musings and strings them together with a lame plot to make a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and over didactic","review":"Parts of this book are very well done - certainly most of the first scene is. But overall this book is weak for two reasons. First, it simply spouts too much theory and scientific philosophy - all or most of which seems to have been culled from popular science books and magazines. It's fine, it's reasonable, but you can find better in the New Scientist or Scientific American. This goes for the main phenomenon of the book: the psychological complaint from which the Jed character suffers. Second, the style is tremendously bland, as if color and wit are somehow beneath this author. Overall, it's a plodding and unstylish read, with too much borrowed material. There are plenty of better novels around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chance Encounter with a Madman","review":"This novel begins with a fateful event which leads to a stalker causing extreme stress to the protagonist and his relationship with his partner. The author develops the story with a few surprising twists and an especially creative ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"provocative, compelling, engrossing","review":"A fascinating and provocative look at madness and obsession, with many layers of veils and unveiling"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"\\"Enduring Love\\" is well-written, and the story is unique. It's plot-driven, but not a page-turner. The lack of a highly sympathetic character decreased my reading pleasure.That Parry's syndrome involves his faith may be thematically important. Perhaps McEwan is hinting that like Parry, those with religious faith are investing energy in an object with no reciprocal interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling rendition of misguided 'love.'","review":"This book is a disturbing depiction of what happens to an ordinary man after becoming involved in an extraordinary event. The main character is a witness to and participant in a terrifying event. The aftermath of this event is even more terrifying for him as he becomes the victim of a stalker. This person is no ordinary stalker but one that uses psychological as well as physical methods to make the life of his victim increasingly miserable. The main character is on a downward spiral that seems headed in only one direction - that of disaster for him and the person who has developed the unhealthy attachment towards him. It was a good read and not one that you could easily determine the final outcome. I'd give it a two thumbs up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Endure a Night Without Sleep","review":"I spent an entire night (darkness to bluish-pale-just-before) finishing Enduring Love and felt somehow disappointed at the end, reading the appendix, some kind of psychological crime report that reiterated the entire novel without the science and evolution and letters. I was highly engrossed, though, and the book was, as someone else said, refreshingly challenging (McEwan, the person said, doesn't underestimate the reader). Resent I felt when I read Clarissa's letter...I thought he developed her character not as fully as he could have and without much perspective, the narrator's voice was sometimes a little pompous. A generous character makes a better narrator, but I suppose Joe Rose was supposed to be hopelessly involved in himself and his stalker. I blame him, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book with an air of expectation and indeed it started off very well. But the menace implied just didn't eventuate, and I must admit I skipped big chunks of the text. Overall I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"am i the only one who hates this book?","review":"I have to read this for my book group, and I am suffering. It is boring, and goes on and on about nothing. Although I am normally fascinated by books about people with mental illness(The Madness of a Seduced Woman is my favorite novel), this one is full of boring thoughts from a boring man, and I am not enjoying it! There is nothing to pique my interest. Does anyone else think this book is just a narcissistic monologue? Kind of like a way too long blog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I totally agree with nelson's review of this book. I didn't like the narrator, didn't care what happened and found all the characters to be boring. I can't recommend a book where I feel nothing -- neither love nor hatred -- toward the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I ever read","review":"If you liked Camus' The Stranger you'll like this book. Otherwise, avoid it. Boring and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"rave reviews for this book?","review":"I started this book with an open mind but just could not finish it. It is one of the worst books that I've ever picked up. How did people get past the ridiculous premise? I found myself (unbelievably) laughing through most of the beginning. In addition, there's nothing particularly engaging or noteworthy about McEwan's writing.For those who are looking for a well-written, thoughtful novel, I would think twice about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious dinner party of a novel","review":"Insipid. A passion play for a culture that dreams of building shopping malls on the moon. Without strength or wisdom. Ponderous and crippled when it imagines itself tense and well-paced; banal and fatuous when it would have us believe it profound; sentimental, yet unmoving. Not only does form far outstrip meaning today, but meaning has been deleted - made an \\"unconcept\\" - as an uncomfortable reminder of more earnest, intellectual times. Here, meaning has been purged and replaced with a wicker puppet, and we're too dim to spot the difference. This is latte literature. We're given words for the eye, not the mind or heart. Cultural Newspeak, purged not only of ideas, but of the capacity even to frame ideas. This is a pretentious dinner party of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did someone say vocabulary ?","review":"When a writer uses the word palimpsests to describe some scratched-out then re-written pages in an address book he should be spanked."},{"rating":"1","title":"objectionable","review":"The whole story is that the author (who is reflected in the protagonist) attributes untenable amounts of tragic weight to an accidental death. He then infers a great moral deficiency in those who might have saved this person but were not willing to do so when their own lives seemed likely to be lost in the process. This is not just the usual over-blown socially-correct lip service most people offer in the face of a tragedy. This is a humanist to the bizarre extreme. At the same time, he also has no regard for animals. I can't think of a worse person and more objectionable view of things.The writing is very good, but the values of the protagonist are so offensive that most people I know have put the book down without finishing it. The book won accolades, but consider their source, the same who lauded \\"Disgrace\\" by Coetzee. Unless you are as squalid as the author, it's probably not your kind of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"twisted like a snake","review":"I so enjoyed this book. After the initial two chapters, the ones that caught my breath, I fell into the story--eventually becoming like the narrator's wife, believing he was a complete crank. I had lots of evidence, all dutifully tallied in the margin. Boy, was I in for a surprise. I liked the faux scientific lingo of it all. And I loved the ending--in which I was left with so many theological questions. How can we love a God who will not answer back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, intense and violent.","review":"An accident with a balloon disturb the calm and organized life of Joe Rose, marking the start of a obsession,that test his racionalism.

A good story with many twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrifying, gripping","review":"i'd read \\"amsterdam\\" during christmas- it was a good, dark little story but nothing amazing. i'm tearing through \\"enduring love\\", about half way through and totally mesmerized. even as he finds answers i'm cringing as narrator's grip on reality erodes, and putting a diagnosis on jed's condition doesn't make it any less chilling. an excellent psychological thriller that i suspect is going to totally mess with my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I couldn't put this book down, and it still haunts me. The story is compelling and the prose is lucid and gorgeous. I've grown very bored with contemporary American fiction, so this novel, along with books by Julian Barnes and Jeanette Winterson, was a literary oasis for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dressed Up\\" Thriller that's actually conventionally cheesy","review":"I expected this book to be a lot more clever and psychologically probing/provocative than it actually was. Which is why I totally misread what was going on (much to my disappointment). Without giving too much away, throughout most of the novel, I thought Parry was just a figment of the increasingly erratic and paranoid narrator's imagination. His creation of Parry stemming from his midlife career/identity crisis and fear of commitment. I kept going back and forth: Is/isn't Parry real? I thought that was fascinating and was unpleasantly surprised that it was just a mundane \\"Fatal Attraction\\" type thriller. I was truly annoyed. Don't get me wrong. It was well-written, especially the first chapter (which has already been stated many times.) But as psychologically insightful and twisty, it left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I must disagree with everyone's adulation of Enduring Love. It was difficult to care about any of the characters. Parry's obsession comes out of the blue. The balloon accident means nothing to the real point of the story. Really, I hated these characters. Is this any achievement in writing? I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I hate when someone gives me a book as a gift. Then, I feel obligated to read someone else's choice. When life is so short, and there are so many books this feels like a terrible burden. I usually refuse to do so on principal.Out of boredom, I broke this rule last week and read this book which I got for Christmas. I will never break this rule again.It was gripping in an irritating sort of way. There were many times it was suspenseful and I couldn't put it down, but the many climaxes were very disappointing. And the characters were HORRIBLE. I didn't like any of them and frankly, I hoped that bad things would happen to each of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success is counted sweetest by those who ne'er succeed","review":"This is a review of the anthology edited by Richard B. Sewall. It gives much useful information and analysis of the poetry of Dickinson. Sewall's provides a useful introductory essay in which he centers on the significance of the 1955 first complete edition of her poems ed. by Thomas Johnson.I was surprised however by so many negative notes on her poetry, especially those of Yvor Winters, and Richard Blackmur. It is as if they were truly to hold her and judge her by some kind of objective rule for poetry.But a great poet and she is truly a great poet makes a rule of their own.Emily Dickinson creates a language and a world, a way of seeing things and feeling things so deep so unique so metaphorically adventurous and beautiful that it is one of truly great works of poetic art that we have.\\"Speech is a symptom of affectionAnd Silence one,The perfectest CommunicationIs heard of none.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to argue with...","review":"This is research, folks, in a very readable form (mostly).

The book probably would have been better at half it's length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad!","review":"\\"There wasn't a man alive she couldn't charm, seduce, or just plain outsmart.\\" The plot of this book revolves around Fancy Holleday, a former whore, who is supposedly so amazing she can use all her wiles against any man and win. Yet, she is thinking the quote listed above as she is walking in freezing temperatures after her lover tried to kill her during their train robbery when she was no longer useful. Then, she was left to freeze to death by another outlaw she had saved from certain death at this very same train robbery. She may have been good at seducing men, but this character proved her idiocy within the first two chapters. The dialogue in this book is horrible, and it left me cringing and shaking my head. This is undoubtedly one of the worst books I've ever read. Fancy describes the Marshall's legs as \\"stumpy and bowed\\". Was I seriously supposed to get into this romance when now I think the love interest is short, bow-legged, and looks like a weathered cowpoke?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"With all the good historical western romances out there, this one really wasn't worth the time it took to find out how bad it was.

My advice would be to pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was surprised at how captivating the characters and dialogue were. This is my first book by Adrienne deWolfe and it won't be my last. I can't wait to start Texas Wildcat! Nevertheless the plot was refreshing, I'm so tired of reading about innocent doe eyed heroines, Fancy was NOT the typical heroine. She could actually do for herself even though she frustrated the hell out of me with her devotion and naivete concerning the antagonist.

This is the focus of this story, a lawman and his prisoner traveling to Carson City, their final destination to have her placed in jail.

It didn't all end up as some weird dream side show. The story was fast paced, always interesting, and very emotional.

It stared Suzanna Ling in her only movie; so this is one for your shelf so you can prove you saw here.Susan Bradley (Suzanna Ling) was raised in a mortuary which adds to the ambiance of the story. She is shunned by her mother, coveted by her uncle, taunted by her so called friends, and well you get the picture.Her only recourse is to unleash here furry pets on pet-a-philes and those that pet -turb her.

If steve harris begs and pleads enough, maybe paul di anno and dennis stratton will join the band again, to help iron maiden get to the level that they once were. Because with this band line up as it is, iron maiden will only slip farther down into obscurity. They will be known as a band that \\"used to rock\\". My advice is to take a lesson from Judas Priest and spend some real time finding talented musicians to join your band. The problems on this album is that you can't hear the vocalist half the time because he has no range, i had to turn the treble way up on my stereo to half the time to hear the guy sing on the majority of the songs.

In Maiden's case, the history is even sader, since this band was present for so long time in the hearts of so many people (myself included). So, I watched in disbelieve when events unfolded in a disaster. (...)In came another polemic choice by Harris, anonymous singer Blaze Bayley, whose, worst than his studio performances, delivered ludicrous stage live performances.

After Adrian Smith left,maiden has not been the same.Dickenson leaving was the final straw.I have nothing against Gers or Blaze but they will never match the power of maiden in the 80's.Steve Harris is my hero and the best bass player in metal, but maiden needs to find that old magic and it's not happening with this album.This is the worst album that they have recorded in my opinion.The songs are cheesey and have a \\"pop metal\\" feel to them.

The clues are subtle enough to make it interesting, and not too far out or complicated to be make it unbelievable.The narrative is fun and casual, making this a good book for reluctant readers, but also enjoyable for the avid readers (like me).

That is the reason that I do not like books such as Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys because I can figure out who did it before the book ends.

It provides an introduction to some of the key players in the upcoming season, and adds a little context to what will take place there. It's also a chance to see Jack Bauer outside his normal element (i.e. not facing imminent death every second). Beyond that, however, it adds little. Don't run out and buy this thinking you'll be lost without it or missing a key ingredient for season 7. This movie-length episode lacks the energy and intensity usually found in 24. You also won't see any of the supporting cast you are used to. This is strictly for diehard fans who have to have all things Jack Bauer.

The Spiritual Warrior never seeks to enter into battle.

After numerous listens, I'm quite impressed, and the whole disc is consistently good. To my ears, they're similar to The Cult or Love & Rockets, and are a rough mix of pop/goth/rock. The earlier material here like \\"Bruises\\" is definitely more moody, yet enjoyable, while the later stuff like \\"Jealous\\" is really going for the hook-filled alt-rock sound. Both eras are great though. I'm glad \\"Voodoo Dollies\\" is in chronological order, and my current favorite songs are \\"Stephen\\", \\"Sweetest Thing\\", \\"Motion Of Love\\", and \\"Break The Chain\\". All equally strong. The last track \\"Who Wants To Go To Heaven?\\" is a nice almost sing-a-long, and a great way to end the disc.

Franks continues to grow as an artist and explore new avenues of jazz. With this release , he climbes gracefully into a sound that can be best described as 'traditionally smooth.' All of these new cuts combine very rich melodies of piano, vibes, and a terrific horn section. His new songs seem to embrace the more quiet and meaningful lyrics of albums past, with a more smooth sound. Not to dissapoint though, he still adds a few cuts that remind us of his earlier work-less instrumentation, and more vocal. His wonderful voice shines through!!

Considering its age, the special effects hold up very well. However that can not be said about the plot of this movie. There first half of the movie starts slowly and it attempts to build supsense until the monster arives. Unfortunately the monster itself is so preposterous that its arrival only brings a major let down in the plot. The extended chase sequence is straight out of 'Alien' but holds none of the emotional tension that 'Alien' succeeds in providing.This is a movie that tried to replicate the success of 'Alien'. It is really just 'Alien' placed underwater with none of its suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst movie ever made","review":"Horrible. Predictable. Everything predictable--even the part where you never get to see the monster, and even when you do \\"see\\" the monster in the end, you're not really looking at anything but a random conglomeration of bogus latex.

Instead, Leviathan unabashedly tries to make money, almost scene for scene, off retred ideas and comes up flat.

If you don't buy this CD, you're truly missin' one the greatest albums ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Haapened?","review":"The only track I really like on this album is 15 the last one.

He is simply amazing with his vocabulary and the way he just flows without stopping. He has the perfect voice for rapping. It isn't high pitched, its kinda raspy which is good for battle rapping. It's a shame his beats were mediocre before. But not on 2000 BC. It's back up to par and canibus rips the mic on every track."},{"rating":"2","title":"The illest","review":"Canibus is probably the illest emcee ever- the fact that he can get Rakim to feature on a song and make him look average says it all. People that dont like canibus often dont give reasons for it and its probably because his lyrics are complex and they cant understand them or dont like the fact that jewellery cars and hoes arent the main cornerstone of what he raps about. The lyrics on this are formidible and he deserves more credit then he gets for them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"Yo canibus is the best lyricist there is no doubt about it this album is a classic with lost @ c being my favorite track everyone should buy this album the 1st album is also great but this one is just the best by far the best rap album in the year 2000 people gotta stop hating on him check you out"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Illest MC","review":"After listening to CAN-I-BUS, I knew I was hooked. No other rapper spoke, even less imagined the things that come out of Canibus' mouth. The man is a genius. 2000 B.C. was a worhty sequel for him. I truly enjoyed the first one, and 2000 B.C. just kept it going for me. Tracks like \\"Mic-Nificent\\" and \\"100 Bars\\" will show you what this kid is about. Get the album, you will not...repeat...will not be dissapointed!!!Neo101"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best, clearly a classic","review":"this album is awesome i love every track. the beats , lyrics and guests are phat. i suggest you get this because i didn't think it was good till i sampled it at the record store. i think canibus is one of the best lyricists he is better than nas and even eminem (in some ways). this cd i can play it from #1-#14 without skipping i suggest you check this out.I garantee you will not be disapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"Canibus is a bad man on the mic. His voice is raw, his energy is contagious, and his lyrics are a unique combination of hardcore and intelligent. Now, if only he would drop some non-battle tracks. This album gets me amped, to be sure, but I would love to hear Canibus drop on more substantial topics. I've heard him do it before, but he certainly does not have a single non-battle track on his latest effort. It's definitely worth picking up if you like the hardcore aesthetic. Just don't expect Illmatic or Nation of Millions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relentless....","review":"Canibus' last album was dogged cause of its weak beats not its voracious lyrics. This time around Canibus and his collaborators are better suited. 2000 B.C. is a raw and fast battle against those that question! No real politics, just pure battling, plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the first one","review":"Yo, I'm glad Canibus was able to get some tight beats on this album this time to go with his wicked lyrics. The best song on here is by far \\"2000 B.C.\\", followed by \\"Watch who you beef wit.\\" I would give it a five, but the hooks on the songs aren't up to par, though it doesn't ruin the album. I've waited for his second album for a long time and it was worth the wait. THIS is how his first album should've been. I think Canibus has established himself as an artist, not just a battle-rapper. Don't get me wrong, NO ONE can flow better lyrics than Canibus (not Slim Shady, not Common, not Madd Skillz, NOBODY) and the fact that he actually had good songs is a plus. Pick up this album now, IT IS HOT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"Can's most complete cd.But at the time people were ignoring it.It is a classic from start to finish. Some tracks have beats that take a second to get used to though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album is Raw with tight beats!!","review":"Yo, this album is a classic for this underground hip-hop cat. He spits rhymes after rhymes and basically brings rap back to its form. Whatever happen to his first album disregard that one, but please pick up this one. This album had a lot to do with Canibus and he know who messed him up on the first. That person was no where on the album. His new friend Journalist is off the hook. The four horsemen watch out for these cats I hope they drop an album sometime in the future.

It's darn good imo and the next one is even better! I can't say there is a bad song on this one and I bought it off the shelves in the late 90's. The cover is very strange , and it made me hope that someday they'd do a song about zombies! Anyways if you are fan of melodic metal then you'll enjoy this one. It's less poppy than their later 80's work so it's more solid too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Crap!","review":"I was a mere lad of 22 when this album came out. After hearing a few of their hits on the radio a good friend turned me onto more of their material (the EXCELLENT \\"Workshop Of The Telescopes\\" two disc mini box set) and I was hooked. We went to see them in San Juan Capistrano at the Coach House and they tore it up live. They played three songs off of their yet-to-be-released album \\"Heaven Forbid\\" and received standing ovations for each. Needless to say, when it came out we raced to the store and picked it up...and so should you!!!Only two negatives: The album cover artwork belongs inside, and the artwork inside belongs on the album cover (like the european release). I think the monster scared away some people. Also, the live version of \\"In Thee\\" is pointless and inferior to versions I have heard in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise","review":"The boys are back.

I have to rank it as one of their best efforts, for two reasons: all the songs stand on their own, unlike some of the \\"album fodder\\" on earlier releases, and the tunes are musical yet still heavy and urgent, a mix of qualities that is becoming scarce among the heavy metal bands these days. If you like BOC, you will like this CD. If you like melodic hard rock, you will undoubtably like it as well.

Well, it saddens me to say that Heaven Forbid only confirms that the BOC have lost it. The nearest to a good song is the live version of \\"In Thee\\" (a very old song), but even that is not a patch on the original studio version. Most of this album is crude thrash metal with very little in the way of tune, let alone the melodic inventiveness which characterised BOC's first few albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it, You will be surprised!!!!!!","review":"Heaven Forbid, BOC's First album in 10 years pleasently surprises by kicking butt on almost all cylinders. Harvest Moon, should be a top 40 hit but never will, No radio station dares play much BOC, there are seen as either to much of an INSIDERS band or to obscure to have written anything good lately. I BEG TO Differ, You will Love Harvest Moon, You will not be able to stop singing Damaged, the Real world's lyrics will not stop running through your head. You Will Love this Album.

None. \\"Harvest Moon\\" is a great song in the Burning for you vein, and the later live version is even more stunning. there's 2 or 3 other songs that are worthy of the great rock seal of approval as well. it rates a 4.

However, it is hard to follow all the twists,turns and names that Radzinsky includes.

(1 and 12 stars)","review":"I know Im going to be the only one to say it but....Sylk E Fyne sucks! She is easily the most corniest female rapper since Trina. Her first album, Raw Sylk was painfully bad and this one is just as worse. The first song on the album, Imma Give It To Ya let you know that listening to this album was going to be a painful experience. How Hot, Player's Comin Up, Dirty South Central all suffer from weak rhymes and hooks. JT Money busts the worst verse of his rap career on Tha Cum Up and it was still better than Sylk E Fyne's verses(HOW INSANE IS THAT?). Lick It is so stupid it provokes uncontrollable laughter and Dirty Game is as drab as it gets. The only decent track is Ya Style featuring Bizzy Bone and Snoop Dogg. Both of them saved that track from being an utter waste.Bottom Line: Sylk E Fyne's Tha Cum up is one of the worst releases from the most corniest female rapper this side of Trina and L-Trimm. Weak beats, even weaker rhymes makes an ugly album for 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Girl Pimpin music","review":"This Cd is great!! i have listened to it many times and am amazed at how great the lyrics are. i find that the music has a great beat. the rap is very diverese also. overall it is a great cd!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My girl","review":"Sylk e. fyne is the second best female rapper out there besides Storm from tha outlawz.This album is off the hook and that's real,the beats is tight and her lyrics is too.She got Snoop and Bizzy bone on here on the same song,and that's song is so tight that's my favorite cut.She got Jt money on here too but I really don't like him that much but the song he featuring on is off the hook,I was shocked cause he was flowing.Sylk e. be talking about that ghetto life in South Central through the album wit a couple of good happy songs as well.And it's just full of hardcore and real songs that you can just boogie to and enjoy.

I really this is a very biased and prejudiced view -- treating the Afghanis with the attitude that only the \\"white European\\" can save them from the confluence of events.

While a careful and reasoned reading of the tragedy and gore represented by the exploits of Alexander the Great makes the folly of war clear, the author of \\"Afghanistan - A Military History\\" never seems to see that himself, or be aware of the inappropriateness of his glorification of war. His point of view seems dated.I have only read the first couple of chapters, and with the way in which the topics are presented in a pro militaristic way, I may not finish the book.I commend the depth of research, but the author also tends to speculate too much, drawing his own conclusions that sometimes seem less than fully substantiated by the evidence cited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding History of Afghan Warfare","review":"While this book does not equal the breadth and fluidity achieved by Ahmed Rashid in \\"Descent Into Chaos,\\" it nevertheless manages to fully convey the difficulties army commanders from Alexander the Great to Gen.

It's designed for strength, durability, and ease of handling by making the telescoping sections out of lightweight oval shaped aluminum. The oval wide axis is vertical to the rake resulting in far less tendency to bend when fully telescoped out to 17'. It stores to a manageable 6' length and the rake part can be easily detached for storage. This innovative design puts Ames well ahead of other Roof Rake manufacturers.

Because Xcom and its predecessors were written early on in windows history, the first and second Xcoms do not run correctly on AGP graphics cards. If you are going to buy this game, be sure to have a PCI graphics card handy in order to play.Have fun! And Enjoy the Game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is a great CD!

My paperback copy clocked in at over 360 pages of poorly written dribble. There's a lot of filler here, and over a hundred pages of redundant material could be excised. The author needlessly writes the story as though it were an excerpt from the main's character's journal, a literary device Simpson probably employed as a way to hide his poor writing skills.Though its billed as a horror novel, 'The Editor' mainly focuses on the dysfunctional romance between a grieving man and a middle-aged blind woman. There are very little thrills to be found here. The title hints at the book's final twist, that of an unreliable narrator. The twist doesn't work as it contradicts everything that came before it. By ending the novel with a such cheap shock, Simpson negates whatever investment the audience had in the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book, poor writer, poor Ellen","review":"Well at first you will think that is an excellent book, I can't tell you why I finished the book it really doesn't worth it, nevertheless the finish of the book is excellent but you can imagine the end when you are at half of the book.

I am a great fan of suspense/psychological thrillers and was hoping I had found a new author! Boy, was I wrong. I don't know why the author chose to use a journal format for this story. It was extremely distracting, especially since it seemed to have no relation to the plot. Sam is basically telling stories(and not very interesting ones at that!) and randomly inserting dates to break it up. I don't know about you, but I have kept a journal for 20 years, and if I am writing about something that happened, I am not in the habit of writing a paragraph a day. I FINISH the story. Besides the fact that I really didn't like the style of writing (have I emphasized that enough? :) the story was not suspenseful or entertaining. I felt little or no connection with the characters and was grateful the book was only 356 pages! Sorry, Mr. Simpson. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever Disguise","review":"The Editor is filled with lusty details, psycho-analysis, and dives right into the mind of Sam Adams, the narrative and \\"editor\\". Told in first person and written as one would write a journal, the story starts off slowly, giving the autobiography of the narrator. But it moves into another plot, as the story unfolds. The past is mixed with and affects the present. The editor/narrator jerks the reader along, painting one picture after another, one story after another. We get to understand his mind, his experiences, the pain he's suffered. But is that pain handed to him by the gods or is it self-inflicted. Do we have an objective account, the truth, or does he know that someone else is reading his diary? Should we really feel sorry for him, or mutter \\"tisk, tisk\\" at the game he is playing in his mind....and with you? Of course, this book is by Thomas William Simpson. And, just like his other books, he keeps us guessing to the end. This is another book well written by Mr. Simpson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assurance That God is Able","review":"A wellspring of encouragement for those who are looking for spiritual simplicity, without dogmatism. Merton's flowing prose carries the reader so effortlessly, that I often had to stop myself, saturated, and put off going on until I had the capacity to absorb more. The greatest challenge of this book is not in comprehending his points, but in accepting them as actually possible, and internalizing their meaning for one's own life context. Merton opens a door to a place of potential joy, that many will desire to pass through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"I bought this for my friend as a wedding present.

My only criticism would be that they should not have bothered doing \\"Waiting for my man\\" as I believe that the legendry \\"live \\"version of this song by \\"The Wasps\\" is now the definitive version and cannot be bettered.

Full of humor, tragedy, and suspense. There are 14 individual stories, but all have the common thread of their setting: Sacramento Valley (California). Each heart-felt tragedy ends on a note of hope! Mr. O'Hara's writing style is smooth and free-flowing. The book is well written and book cover eye-catching! I really enjoyed this book and it will be one I will reread for the simple pleasure of reading an interesting and good book! I highly recommend this book and look forward to more books by Mr. O'Hara.\\"said Linda D. Delgado author of the Islamic Rose Books series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is one of the best short story collections I've ever read, much like John Steinbeck's \\"Pastures of Heaven.\\" Author Andy O'Hara takes the reader on a magical journey of a valley never explored quite like this and certainly never through so observing, humorous and compassionate an eye. He ignores the popular Gold Rush days of the Sacramento Valley and goes instead to a different kind of treasure, the modern day lives of its people.A swan, a trademark of the valley marshes, is the beginning theme on a farm as a boy and girl fall in love and ends with the baton being passed, years later, to another young boy who sees their dream winging north in the night sky in the form of two companion swans. Between are tragedy, laughter, life and the inevitable acceptance of life's end. Well worth reading a second time, \\"The Swan\\" is a quiet but lasting masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This dark ambient stuff just isn't for me.

Red kongs, black kongs, brand names, off brand...you name it, my dog can reduce it to pathetic pieces inside an hour. Not so with the Hurley. This thing is amazing. It took weeks for him to even be able to get a little chunk off, and almost a year before it warranted replacing. If you have an insatiable chewer you should give this a try. All those other \\"Tough\\" things are awfully disappointing and you might be reluctant to shell out money on toys that the dog tends to wreck the same day, but this one honestly is different - the Hurley really does last! Also, it floats. I liked the old blue color better than the neon turquoise, but I am pretty sure the dog doesn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening to this one","review":"Well, Six Degrees records strikes again!! How do they find these talented people? This CD has great musical integrety while making a lot of use of synthesizers and dubs. The World vocal crossover stylings on a couple of the pieces contrast very well with the dream spaces evoked in others. There is never a dull moment wandering through this landscape. Some of the pieces have been played on Hearts of Space, while others would be more suited for a trance outing. All are excellent. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent edition","review":"The Kalmus editions are reproductions of the 19th century Bach Geselschaft edition.

After two seasons, it has literally fallen apart: axle is rusted, bolts repeatedly fall out (since they didn't provide appropriate washers), and plywood has failed along leading edge (where metal frame is attached -- holes are too close to edge of wood). Happily, a half-sheet of 1/4\\" plywood and [...] worth of proper galvanized bolts, washers, and wing-nuts will restore its utility, but it sure makes me wonder why I spent [...] to have something like this shipped over from China?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Polished Affair","review":"This is refreshing, uplifting music. Earl Klugh is a rare talent, a perfectionist and an accomplished musician. I love his humility and his staying true to the meaning and heart of jazz; teamwork, improvisation and some very memorable call and response that reminds me of the haunting expositions of Wes Montgomery (although Klugh himself does not readily embrace the label of jazz). All members of his band are allowed to flower on his albums and Peculiar Situation is no exception. Now and Again is a work of true genius and just when you think it might be the tour de force of the album he conjours up Private Affair. I am loving Klugh more and more after many years of looking past him. I think he should be acknowledged as the master of his genre and one of the greatest guitarists of our time. If you love guitar or are just looking for an artist who can set your mood every time you listen to him then get this album and start your collection.... \`cos this cat can play."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIFELESS MELODIES THAT ARE NOT UP TO EARL KLUGH STANDARDS.","review":"I SAW EARL KLUGH IN CONCERT LAST SUMMER.

It's interesting to see the characters discover more about themselves, their duality, their conflicted feelings about doing good or bad things and what the outcome will be, whether it's okay to do something wrong in the short term so that others might benefit later, and so on.

It's a now message for this generation - a harbinger of things to come. Lost people looking for redemption is never a false story.The twisting of heroes and villians is way overdone. I can't deny the relevancy of the Heroes' struggle with darkness. \\"Am I a hero or a villian?\\" \\"Am I living up to my gifts?\\" These are great questions and it used to be uplifting to watch each character's struggle with their brokeness. The main failure of this series (volume 3) is that the story now completely blurs good vs. evil. Calling a bad guy good without redemption is a false story.I simply can't enjoy the story anymore.

Most of the episodes were rushed stories and pretty much the only episodes that were Manga episodes were the ones in the first two DVDsBuy this DVD if you want to collect Ranma merchandise, but I don't suggest this to be your first box set (it was unfortunately mine). Buy the Random Rhaphsody set, its theme song is great (the name is Zettai part 2) and the made up episodes are funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranma does it again!","review":"An old friend got me hooked into Ranma in highschool. It was the very first anime I had ever seen and I LAUGHED my BUTT off for hours as I watched poor Ranma's plight.The 3rd Season contains the entry of many new characters, including my favorite character, Ukyo, the mistaken male Female, and Ranma's \\"cute fiancee\\". It also includes my all time favorite Ranma episode, \\"Am I Pretty?\\", where Ranma gets hit in the head and believes he's really a girl!If you want to laugh, and laugh HARD, deffinatly pick up this and the other Ranma seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repair manual","review":"Manual arrived ahead of projected schedule and new in the wrapper.

I wish all authors could learn from the beauty and teaching methodology of this book. Everything is explained with sheer simplicity, without making matters more complicated than they should be. It is very concise and to the point, without any unnecessary waste of paper. So many computer books are becoming bloated and heavy without offering any substance.

This girl cant belly dance, she doesnt know any real technique, feeling, or have timing. Her music is almost as bad as her dancing and her costuming is tasteless and sleazy! THis is a digrace to this art. She needs to learn how to properly belly dance! As an Arabic woman it is sad to see. Amira Mor is not taken seriously in the field and after watching her videos, it is easy to see why!Scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"The title alone is a slap in the face to all serious belly dancers. On her website the video is described as thus: \\"will teach how to do a sexy improvisation that will mesmerize your lover and encourage passionate experiences you've only dreamed of.\\" This seductress image does nothing to help our dance form. If Amira really loved this dance, she would not insult it by making a video like this.Once more, it doesn't even accomplish what it says it will. I showed her supposed seductive dancing clip to my boyfriend and all he did was ask \\"what is she doing?\\". I told him she was seducing him and he just rolled over and took a nap instead of watching the rest. The dancing is so bad I don't think anyone could get off on it unless they REALLY used their imagination, or had a thing for bad dancing.

Unfortunately, Across From Midnight is packed with largely unmemorable material, lacking not only in modern or well-known song selections, but most importantly in punctuating interpretative quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORGANIC WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW","review":"....and those of us who thought JC had reached a pinnacle with that album will not be surprised that Across From Midnight does not quite make the grade.

Pro-Choice followers will definitely identify with the power of the struggle to legalize abortion & the pain & sorrow of the times when it was not. My husband & I are Pro-Life followers, & we own this DVD because it is so important for any person that has a belief or conviction to not be naieve or blind to the opposite side. I applaud the directors in their ability to convey each aspect, & both sides of the abortion issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and wonderfully challenging","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. It was incredibally thought provoking. I think that this would be a wonderful video for young women (and guys) to watch as an aid to a sex-ed class. It really makes you evaluate all sides of the issue. I also think that it's a great film for people interested in the history of abortion/women's rights. It shows how far we've come, as well as how far we yet have to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"If These Walls Could Talk is an excellent movie about abortion! I think the most powerful segment is the one with Cher. It doesn't seem like until the end, when Dr. Thompson(Cher) gets shot several times by a man who is against abortion. It looked so real it was terrifying! It brings up the question of abortion very strongly. Cher is not only an actor in this, she is also the director. Cher is always thinking. Please, if you are thinking about getting an abortion watch the movie first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"I had an abortion at 13 and now (at 23) I counsel women who suffer from Post Abortion Trauma. This movie tries to make abortion seem like it's not a negative thing, however the topic goes well beyond black and white. Don't count on this as your education regarding terminating a pregnancy. Instead volunteer at a clinic and watch the change which befalls women afterwards. The vacant look you see in their eyes will overpower you much more than Demi or Cher. I assure you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I supposed to feel sorry for these women?","review":"Okay, putting aside my pro-life persuasions, this flick is anything but thought-provoking. Maybe in 1960s it would've been \\"controversial\\" and \\"groundbreaking\\", but in 1990s... Whom are you kidding? It's next to impossible to shock or outrage people these days. There is nothing unique about the three situations presented in the movie. Three middle-class broads get knocked up because of their irresponsibility. I have a hard time feeling compassion for stupid and careless people. As usual, those traits go along with weakness and cowardice. If Cher wanted to the viewers to feel sorry for the characters, she should've made them more... victimized? I can understand and pity to a certain degree a junkie or a prostitute, a woman whose situation is desperate in the first place. But when three middle-class broads find themselves \\"inconvenienced\\" by their unplanned pregnancies, I can't find any compassion in my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful portrayal","review":"I will never in this lifetime understand why any mother would believe that killing her own child would be in anyone's best interests (including her own). Biology and Physiology are simple subjects...there are no anatomical changes of a baby after 8 weeks (most abortions are performed at 12 weeks), the baby only gets bigger. Basically what the rest of the reviewers are saying is that the bigger the person is physiologically, the more of a person they are. A person is a person whether they are one pound or a thousand pounds. Many people have much more difficult complications in their lives other than pregnancy. Only two categories exist, the uneducated and the profiteers, many whom which enjoy performing abortions at 40 weeks. So many people can't have children, I don't understand the gross selfishness. I'm so glad my mother didn't think of me like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful description","review":"I thought this book captured the doctor's life extremely well--it came alive.

At just 104 pages, AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MADE SIMPLE is priced at $0.19 a page. At this rate, the new Harry Potter would cost $150, and you're likely to find just as much worthwhile insurance information in THE DEATHLY HALLOWS as you will in this book. Not only is everything contained in AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MADE SIMPLE common sense, outdated, or available online; the book is written for New Jersey citizens only - despite the fact that this is not prominently disclosed.

Without doubt, the beats are much harder on The Loa Project, Volume II than previously, but on tracks like \\"Juliet,\\" it causes an interesting friction between the melody and the rhythm. Cam also continues his pursuit of strict hip-hop (like on \\"Mental Invasion\\"), but it's not as abrasive as on The Beat Assassinated. \\"Candyman\\" samples from the horror movie of the same name, and, as you'd expect, it's quite creepy. On this album, as well, DJ Cam also explores house beats (\\"DJ Cam Sound System\\") as well as soul (\\"You Do Something To Me\\"). Even on the final track, \\"Angel Heart,\\" you can hear what made his earlier albums so great. This is a welcome step back in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Van Zant II ... but very close!!","review":"I bought this CD after almost wearing out my Van Zant II CD.I'm a big Lynard Skynard fan and make every concert when they come to this area.

Right Side Up is listed as being inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughan for getting his life together. The brothers are only given credit for the vocals and writing the songs. Hat's off to the players that contributed to this effort. The guitar playing is VERY bluesy,while also sounding distinctly \\"southern\\".I think Ronnie Van Zant would be extremely proud of his sibling's effort.I'd buy this again...you should get you a copy yourself.Keep the faith..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother to Brother","review":"This is an excellant CD!

This cd has the combined sounds of Skynyrd, .38 Special and of course Johnny's talents from his own albums. Ironic!

However, other reviews claim this book is unusual. I was unimpressed by the female character. I very much wanted to sympathize with her, and of course hated the baddy right off. Unfortunately, she continuously rolled over, not standing up for herself and gaining any sort of backbone until the end of the book. I was distressed that after her four year stint as a divorced lady (during which time she recieved what amounts to regency counseling) and gaining some peace, she returns to her previous powerlessness. While some of the lack of power is believable and understandable, especially given the time frame and circumstance, her inability to protect herself, and her refusal to act responsibly to protect two other young women, left me frustrated with the character and skimming just to get the book done."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real downer","review":"This book did not work for me.I knew the subject matter going in, but was surprised that Balogh seemed to have spent more time on the molestation scenes than she did on the consensual interactions between the hero and heroine.I also found the hero judgemental and harsh. His fear that the heroine would contaminate his sister and fiance in Bath really tuned me off him and he never regained my regard.Balogh did a good job in coneying the vulnerabiilty of a woman alone in that society, but is was just too much. Maybe this could have been rectified by showing scenes of a re-united couple reintering society. So much time was spent on the pain, but not much was made of the joy.The story would have been better served if the writer had instilled a greater balance, preferably with the scaled tipped in favor of happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...).

I was very impressed with this book as it did a fine job balancing lessons from Buddhism with the motifs of the Highlander franchise. It was especially interesting as Duncan McLeoud's character is perpetually trying to balance his onus as an immortal and his propensity towards conducting himself morally and kindly. The Dalai Lama, an immortal of a different variety, recognizes Duncan in the present, as someone he spent much time with in a past life. The story jumps back and forth between present and past (of course this is nothing new for this series) but what sets it aside from other episodes within the canon, is the nature of the relationship, as the Dalai Lama's cycle of reincarnation only allows him glimpses of his past lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another thumbs down","review":"As a recent convert to the Highlander subculture, I am enjoying catching up on what others have been enjoying for 10 years.

There isn't enough room for the G7 lens to extend before it bumps into the teleconverter (and puts the camera into damage control shut down mode).The Canon 2x teleconverter (which costs much more), is designed slightly differently so it works with the Canon lens adapter.The Canon lens adapter does work with the Opteka wide angle adapter, but it's disappointing not to be able to use the 2x teleconverter."},{"rating":"2","title":"the beloved Drina series","review":"This is the first in the Drina series, and the book introduces us to young Andrina Adamo, or Drina Adams.

Drina is one of the most lifelike charecters I've ever read about, and Ms. Estoril writes such a compelling story about her that I have considered her books my favorites for 10 years. For anyone who has ever wanted to dance, I recommend these books highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite book","review":"For anyone who has ever dreamed of dancing, this book is for you. I fell in love with the story of the young dancer Andrina Adamo, who goes by Drina Adams, and her struggles to remain dancing at all times, against her Grandmothers' wishes. This is the first in a series, and I have 7 of the 11 books, and will look for the rest until I find them. They are the most cherished possesions I own, for I feel as feverently about ballet as the young Drina."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful celebration of American heritage","review":"Part of the \\"History's Heroes\\" DVD series, Paul Revere: Midnight Ride is a 3-D, computer animated video for young people presenting American history in a lively and entertaining format. The friendly Ellie the Eagle encourages poet Ralph Waldo Emerson to retell the story of Paul Revere's crucial ride to Lexington, in order to warn colonial leaders that the British had mobilized. Half a day later, the \\"shot heard 'round the world\\" marked the beginning of the American war for independence. Ideal for students ages eight and up, Paul Revere: Midnight Ride reinforces learning through humor, engaging storytelling, and catchy songs by Marty Panzer and Don Grady. A delightful celebration of American heritage, highly recommended for children's library DVD shelves. 30 minutes, English and Spanish subtitles, color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best case I have ever seen","review":"This case is definitely the best case that I have ever seen for an ipod. It's a little costly, but believe me, it is well worth it. The case looks, feels, and is VERY strong, and the ipod doesn't slip at all when placed in it. Also, every part of the ipod is covered and safe, including the precious color screen. There is a hole to use the scroll wheel, and it doesn't feel weird or too deep. It also comes with a belt clip should you want to be a dork and put your ipod on your belt. I highly recommend this case to anyone who really wants to protect their all-too-scratchable 5g video 30 gig ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I read lots of steller reviews about this product about how the ipod is so protected inside etc. Well, this product is extremely heavy and made in ipod twice its size, and the belt clip kept breaking. what would happen is I'd be wearing my ipod on the belt clip and then there would go my ipod in the case on the floor while the belt clip was still attached to my pants. I guess, rhinoskin's protection did help my ipod with stand a few falls, but with a better case it wouldn't be an issue. I returned this product right afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucked!!!","review":"I opened the package and the plastic clip disintegrated in my hands. Now it is useless. This sucks!-David"},{"rating":"1","title":"Protects screen but not click wheel area","review":"I purchased this product soon after I bought my ipod. Had even left the annoying shrink wrap on until I had a proper case... The result? Two months of use and huge gouges in the face near the click wheel. Even upon slipping the ipod into the case the first time some scratching occured across the click wheel. The case fits much tighter on the lower half of the ipod with a gap between the face of the screen and the case. Through normal use the occasional piece of sand/pocket [...] worked its way into the case. Since there is no way to remove the ipod other than slipping it in and out I watched in horror as the scratches occurred in the process.Other negatives:-Case adds alot of width to the ipod-Opening in bottom not sufficient for connection to Belkin auto adapter.Solution:Use the Apple supplied case..you're much better off"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindless Fun","review":"I hated this show when it first aired on Cartton Network.

A lot of concepts came from the contributions of \\"The Three Stooges,\\" \\"Pink Panther\\" and great films and put those concepts in a more appropriate fashion. That was how I saw the cartoon.I am not sure if the final season will air on Cartoon Network, but this could be the only show to have a special ten year anniversary after all of the years, cheers, and tears. I will never forget \\"Ed, Edd, n Eddy.\\" Never.

The quality of the transfer is fantastic, but I have one MAJOR GRIPE. The episodes are out of order. The first episode: The Ed-Touchables, is the second episode that appears on the DVD.You'd be surprised but the episodes have some kind of continuity between each other. In the very first episode, the Kanker sisters are introduced. In the first episode on the DVD, the boys already know who they are. That freaking sucks. I would much rather have all the episodes in the order of their releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto - not worth the money","review":"Same thing happened to me with this product. L shaped center support broke - which caused the axle to bend, which caused the wheel bolts to bend.

This was on the third use - had probably done no more than 10 acres total."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Although assembly was cumbersome, it was not that difficult. My yard is a little over 2 acres.

Other pluggers I researched may make nicer, more uniform plugs but I was concerned about how well they would last on the 3 acre lot in the country with lots of trees. Of the 48\\" models I read about this one had the heaviest shipping weight so I assumed it would be constructed of the heaviest material. It is well built. Assembly was uncomplicated. I used it on the entire 3 acres 1 day after a rainy spell lasting 2 days. I used 4 bags of sand for weight rather than cinder blocks and it worked flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pocket Belt","review":"The belt pockets are too small, because standard photo IDs & credit cards (CC) are too wide to fit in the pockets. Thus, if you are like me & are ordering this item so that you will be able to put your ID, CC & cash in the belt pockets instead of having to carry your purse/handbag to an event then unfortunately this item will be useless to you. The manufacturer needs to slightly increase the pocket dimensions to accommodate an ID & CC!

Sometimes almost all performance qualities are excellent, but usually one factor might be a little weak. I first heard this recording while driving, and even accounting for the car phenomenon that seems to make many performances more involving, this one excels at most everything. The Serkins interpret this wonderfully, and the voices are euphonious. As I react differently each time I hear any work, I hope hearing the live audience reacting the same way every time doesn't bother me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this text","review":"The language is out of date and unnecessarily academic (as was the style back in the day).

Professor Murray was a'Free Offer', 'Well Meant Offer' man and it shows in this book. Why, on page 56, and following, he even states that Jesus diedfor Reprobates! He died for them, but his death for them wasonly short of salvation. That's how so-called 'Common Grace'is accounted for by Murray. He has put it in the Atonement.My Bible says that Jesus laid down his life for the sheep. BewareMurray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A discussion of Redemption for thoughtful Christians!","review":"This work by John Murray, originally published in 1954, is indeed a blessing to have still available today. The atonement is the very center of the Christian faith and few have explored the biblical passages dealing with the necessity, nature, perfection, and extent of the atonement as penetratingly or precisely as Murray.Murray also deals with the distinct steps to be identified in the Bible's presentation of how the redemption accomplished by Christ is applied to the life of the redeemed. You will find helpful expositions of scriptural teachings about calling, regeneration, faith and repentance, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, union with Christ, and glorification. This is not new truth, but old truth that seems to have been lost by much of the church today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I found nothing in this book of any use.

I recently bought this movie for my younger brother because he's into the skating thing and there aren't many movies like this being made. As I was watching I noticed the acting to be very mediocre but the plot was pretty solid.The best thing about this movie is the skateboarding celebrities doing a little acting. Tony Hawk being one of them. There's a lot of \\"old school\\" skate tricks going on and just looking at the huge boards they used shows how much stuff has evolved.Overall I think this will appeal to the younger teen audience.

Any intelligent romance reader will take pleasure in this magical story of timeless love."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and confusing","review":"This book was a real snooze.

At the very end is an interesting interview that reveals where the band was at that point in their career."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just isn't the same","review":"To me the classic Skynyrd album of all time is One More for the Road (especially the extended version). On this one, Johnny sounds too redneck and the older songs are given too much of the power chord/38 Special sounding treatment. On One More for the Road there were 3 distinct \\"clean\\" sounding gtr sounds and the great Ronnie VZ voice. This record sounds like a pretty good Skynyrd tribute/cover band. I still enjoy them in concert where the differences are not as pronounced over a loud PA system.

I think that misses the point. The point is: have they created the best 10-12 tracks they can create within a reasonable time frame?I believe they have. Further, I believe, compared to the *5* year hiatus by Jimmy Eat World, this is a masterpiece.Second, and to the point, if only for the 5 \\"*\\" title track Move Along: Buy this CD!It doesn't have the faint tinge of keyboards that their opening CD utilized (and that is the sole reason I knocked 1 \\"*\\" of the rating); however, the premier tracks are great:Dirty Little Secret, Top of the World, Move Along, 11:11 PM.In a world of \\"here today, gone later today\\", these are NOT Rejects.

Atleast when BSB and N*sync were popular, people knew who they were listening to. I couldn't tell this band apart from countless others if i tried. Tired, boring generic riffs, coldplay-esque piano songs every other track, an almost bored sounding lead singer, and meaningless, mundane lyrics. Yep, they're gunna be big alright.

You will soon be singing along with every song on this CD...although the songs are from a band that has matured...there are still tons of catchy lyrics and great melodies. BUY THIS CD TODAY...it is sure to impress you."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sophomore Slump","review":"I admit I was a little worried about the AAR falling into the same hole many bands do on their follow-up album, but this does not disappoint. As good as their first album was, \\"Move Along\\" matches, if not surpasses it. All of the songs on this album are really catchy except for a couple slow ones, but they are great in their own way also . Overall this CD is better-written and heavier than the first. There is more guitar and more muscle. The band has definitely matured a lot over the last couple of years. If you liked their debut, don't miss out on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is actually good","review":"This is actually good. I didn't realize it would be. A lot of suprise songs I didn't know they sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Faceless Crying","review":"To keep it short, this band follows the classic mold of assembly-line artist manufacturing. Whining, talent-deprived vocals; beyond-simple guitar; and other such tasteless implements of modern music.

LITERALLY!?!?!?!","review":"This is without a doubt, the worst band of the past two years. Look at all their whining songs they've released trying to be all romantic but you know they've never gotten any in their entire lives... until the stupid groupies flooded them because they think the \\"deep\\" lyrics of this lame band are actually genuine. \\"Dirty little secret\\", twice as bad as their single last year, with that cute little chorus \\"swing swing from the tangles of my heart!\\"... are you kidding me? This CD and band is a joke don't be a fool and fall into the grouping of people that are seduced by the ratings people have given this joke of a band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay CD","review":"This CD is gay.It is pure gayness.Every song is lame and pointless.

I REALLY ONLY FOUND TWO SONGS ON THE WHOLE CD THAT WERE WORTH PUTTING ON TO MY I-POD \\"IT ENDS TONIGHT\\" AND \\"MOVE ALONG\\". AS FOR THE OTHER SONGS I THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY \\"CRY BABY\\". THEY ALL SOUNDED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS FOR BEING MAD AT SOME GIRL FOR EITHER DUMPING THEM OR CHEATING ON THEM.

It wasn't brilliant or mind-boggling, but it was good. This album, Move Along, is better. It has more diversity than their debut, which focused mainly on love lost. Their songs are catchy, like the first album. But the topics and styles of the songs have variation, something the first cd lacked. From \\"Dirty Little Secret\\" to \\"Dance Inside\\" to \\"Can't Take It\\" Tyson Ritter shows a maturity in his voice that he lacked in his first effort. Most importantly, the band made progress. They improved, something that doesn't happen too often anymore. The All-American Rejects are different from the typical punk rock bands. They have something unique. If that's what you like, then definitely buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mature development","review":"I have to admit that while I really liked All-American Reject's first album, I felt something was lacking and as a result they were not in my top ten bands. The new album is a great development from their last, their music has matured without loosing the essence of AAR and they have explored more different sounds to add to each song. Each track is no longer a repetitive collection of riffs, more like a collection of riffs highlighted with various additional instruments to create a more melodic collection.If I could, I'd give them a pat on the back for their progress. This is definitely something you want to buy if you are already a fan of AAR or if you are in to Panic! At The Disco, The Rocket Summer and Fall Out Boy, among many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Rock Album","review":"I am not usually a fan of this genre of rock, but boy am I a fan of this album! Every song has a catchy tune and even catchier (sometimes tongue-in-cheek) lyrics. This is one of those albums that you want to pop into your car, put the top down, and cruise along while singing along at the top of your voice. Exhilaratingly enjoyable music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then their first album","review":"The first time i listened to this album i didnt really think much of it.

I was very disapointed by this one. Its seems that they lossed all orriginality. I guess the lyrics have grown up a bit but they arent as perfectly strung together and addictive. Their sound used to be differnt from other bands like them but now it sounds like every other band on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointing","review":"I have read all the Rebus books which for the most part are excellent and exciting. This story is overly long and lacking in suspense. I suspect Rankin's motivation for writing is to get on to the political bandwagon of exposing treatment of immigrants.Rebus' concern for immigrants and his interest in the immigrant activist don't really fit with his character of the past. Instead of the gritty, witty iconoclast we now get a much different charcter.It seems that as with so many successful writers of series that eventually they focus more on the money or their own political leanings, so the quality of their stories suffer greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A betrayal","review":"I'm halfway through this book and like other readers, will probably give it up as soon as I find another book to read. I feel betrayed by an author who lures you into spending your money buying his book and your time reading it and then proceeds to batter you over the head with a political agenda. Never mind that I realize most of his points are valid; he could have gotten them across more effectively by just allowing the situations to speak for themselves. If an author feels he must espouse a cause, please let him do it subtly or, even more honestly, express his views in non-fiction. We get such a ceaseless diet of this type of thing every day from the media that some of us would like to just enjoy a good mystery, especially from an author we had trusted to deliver one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Rebus is years","review":"I love Rebus and Siobhan. Have for years. This book is so boring. I am 3/4 of the way through and have no interest in finishing. The subject of the racism is so old. The writing is so trite. I can predict the next sentences of the characters -- maybe I've read too many Rankin.I can't believe that this book is putting me to sleep. Ian Rankin in the past has been one of my favorite authors--just read a non-Rebus book--Witch Hunt-which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe It's Just Me","review":"I found this book boring and flat. Bought it in hardback because I enjoy Rankin. Very disapointed. Was Rebus always a wisecracker? I don't recall that. I felt it struck a false note.

Got me hooked on all the books by this author, all of which are worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a good read.","review":"Let me just start by saying that this book is the reason why I own an Irish Setter today. Anyway, continuing on, it's just one of those books that's good - it's full of adventure the nature descriptions are realistic and the characters aren't flat. I read this when I was probably seven, and it's one of those stories that's stuck with me for ages afterwards. Definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"written with real affection for the natural world","review":"JimKjelgaard loves the mountains, and he loves dogs. He loves men who can make a life in the back woods, reading the seasons and living off their wits.This is a slow-paced book geared toward *patient* children. It takes a long time for the story to develop. Danny and his father, Ross, are both reticent, complex mountain men without much to say. Danny intuitively knows what Red *should* be, but of course he can't articulate it. Several rescue scenes to keep things moving.Plenty of hunting action, including a bear and an \\"Injun devil\\" -- a wolverine! A few words we don't say: Damn him, damn his ugly hide, hellion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Kjelgaard was one of my childhood companions.","review":"Jim Kjelgaard and Robert Heinlein were two of my constant childhood companions. Nearly fourty years have passed since I discovered Jim Kjelgaard and I can still remember the excitement and frustration in searching the library shelves for more of his books. In searching his list of books today I found myself smiling and reliving his stories and the good times I had reading them. Timeless stories for young readers"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book Ever!","review":"Big Red is about a boy named Danny and a dog named Red who have unending love and loyalty towards eachother and go many adventures together. I liked Big Red because it was adventurous, exciting and always had some action going on. There was hardly anything I didn't like about it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes adventures or dogs. I would also recommend it to anyone who's looking for just a good book to read for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Jim's best, but pretty good","review":"This book was definetly great. My favorite is still Wild Trek but I like this one because of the dog show refrences. I like reading about show dogs and dog shows and I think this book pretty much gets out to people that you don't have to live in the big city to own a show dog. Other than that the story kind of gets to what you would expect from a Kjelgaard book. Not in a bad way,but it really should have talked more about dog shows and owning a show dog. But,what can I say, not many people are a interested in show dogs as I am. It's still a good book for people who have read other Kjelgaard books or just love dogs.Thanks again Jim!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it. It has alot of exciting parts and normal parts.","review":"When I read this book it was boring at first. But as I kept reading it got exciting. And I like the way it turned out.

Not this story. Other than one part, the story is about the same as any other dog story. THE DOG DOESN\\"T DIE.During the story, some showdog helps a trapper kid in his trapping, and helps the kid in his \\"quest\\" to kill some big bear named Old Magesty. The book is pretty good, but it gets a little boring at the beginning. The book is pretty cool, so buy it and remember that the dog doesn't die."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic tale of a boy and his dog","review":"I read this book in 9th grade, about 15 years ago, and am purchasing it to read to my daughters. If you love dogs, and have ever felt that special bond with a dog, you will enjoy this book.The writing is about a 6th grade level, so it is an easy read.

The relationship becomes essential and explosive. Shobei Imamura's mature tale is seductive and confounding.

As an analogy for societies underlying supressive and pious attitudes about creative copulatory co-options it speaks volumes. Based on an old Asian mythology about the joyous release of inner inhibitions & muscle control and how said personal development attracts the bounty of the Law of Attraction.Without calling personal theology into question, the director leans towards a revealing of the characters \\"do under others as you would have under yourself\\" motivations. He can't stop looking, wondering and wanting the warm wet waterful wonderment of her quiet cautionary secret.A tale of 3 fish - one out of water, one pregnant with water and the others enjoying the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Speaker, NOT a Speakerphone!","review":"The Good:Speaker quality is good, as is the Skype integration with the LCD display.The Bad:Microphone volume cannot be adjusted, outbound voice is useless.The Ugly:The lack of tech support on the product. Support is outsourced to people who are unfamiliar with it, and there are no drivers available on Kensington's website.My initial review was an insane rant due to the frustrations I had with the product and the lack of competent technical support. This product had 4-5 star potential because of the LCD display and Skype integration, but first and foremost, I want a speakerphone that WORKS as a speakerphone, which this product evidently is NOT.I returned it and bought the Polycom Communicator through Amazon, got it the next day, and the Polycom JUST WORKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone volume too low and can't be set","review":"Short answer: The microphone volume on this is set too low relative to the speaker volume, and cannot be adjusted independently--either through the device or at the O/S level.I spoke with tech support, and they said this was to keep the echo-cancellation software from having issues.So as a speakerphone, this device is useless.I'd have given it one star, but the rest of the device is actually very well designed, easy to setup, and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best.","review":"I got this speakerphone to use with an older laptop I have which doesn't have a microphone. It looked cool, had mixed reviews and it was cheap so I figured I would give it a go.What did I think of it? Lets just say I used it once and never again. Sure it looks cool, and technically it works but the sound quality was terrible. I tried it out on a couple of different laptops, one of which has a build in microphone, I set up a Skype call and it was terrible... I couldn't hear them well, they couldn't hear me well, I unplugged this thing and just used the stuff built in and the other person could have been in the same room.Maybe I got a bad one, maybe it might work better connected to different hardware or using different software but ultimately I can not recommend this product for anything but it's looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVERLOOKED","review":"I have always been a fan of the Fixx. They have recorded a significant amount of great music over the years which has barely been noticed. Elemental is a solid album which features what could be the best song the Fixx has ever recorded \\"Two Different Views\\". For this song alone the album is a worthwhile purchase. If this song had been a single back in the early 1980's when the Fixx enjoyed their greatest commercial success it would have been huge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"The Fixx always has been one of my favorite bands. Their break-up deeply upset me and I felt these men deserved much better than to remain in obscurity. I think \\"Elemental\\" is their best music. Their craft is fine-tuned, the melodies exquisite and Cy's singing is at its best. Jamie West-Oram's guitar is well displayed and so are Rupert's keys. This album is extremely well recorded and if it does not bring this great band back into the limelight, I will be quite surprised. If you never have heard of the Fixx before, this would be a great album to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adult contemporary. The Fixx?","review":"I can not believe this is The Fixx. I lost track of them at Ink and was pleased to see there are a couple of newer albums I had not known of; the Fixx are one of my favorites for such a long time, but this??? This album has few Fixx qualities other than Cy Curnin's voice. Why does this album sound so boring and bad and just plain cliche in all it attempts, I do not know why. I believe one reason I can not stomach this album is the missing Dan K. Brown on bass. His influence on The Fixx funk is larger than the little credit he gets, he kept them on a serious groove for so long, now their sound is closer to American Idol-styled bastardization than anything else.Oh well, I still love the Fixx, but this made-for-adult contemporary poop is not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This album has amazing range to it - from great acoustic numbers, to all-out rockers, and even one tune that could have been recorded for 1983's Reach the Beach - this new CD is easily one of their best. Not just an 80's revival band, The Fixx show here that they can still make a great album that is fresh and inviting. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY'RE BACK!","review":"This CD is worth buying for \\"Ocean Blue\\" and \\"Fatal Shores\\" alone,but the rest is thought provoking and very well performed and recoreded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellower than most but still awesome!","review":"I can't understand people bagging this album.

Good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"After using this litter for a while, I decided to find a less expensive one that would be OK. There isn't one. It is the only one that actually eliminates odors and clumps so well that the box is much easier to clean. It seems to clump in such a way that no moisture is left after you pick it out. I tried all the grocery store brands and decided it was worth a little more to get the performance this product offers.

I have used it for years and would not use anything else. If I have to save money, I will do it somewhere that doesn't smell. Plus, I think it is a better value than the less expensive litters because you don't use so much and you don't have to spend all that money on therapy to counteract the stress of a smelly home (I have five cats). Amazon does a terrible job of packing this product for shipping. They should take a page from their outside vendors who have apparently taken a moment to figure out the best way to ship it.

I don't have a scoop schedule, so... when I started smelling it 10 or 14 days later I just went ahead and replaced all the litter. So I'm not saying you should forget to scoop for two weeks like I did, but if you go by the \\"when I can smell it\\" system, you might need to come up with a schedule!I haven't had an issue with tracking, but I have a litter box with a little staircase in it to catch litter.

I would have found it much easier if the step-by-step instructions were listed more clearly (e.g. Step 1, Step 2, etc.). Additionally, the sample database files (as of 3/29/03) were not password protected, although the book instructs the reader to enter a user name and password when connecting to them.

The range of meanings and insinuations she is able to draw out of the lyrics of good song puts them over the top and makes them great songs. While she works the material on Dirty Little Secrets the material is all sub par and no amount of vocal emoting is going to rescue it.

The only working female singers to be her equal are Norah Jones, Stacey Kent, Diane Krall, and more recently, Anjani. She hadn't released a CD since 1999's Katherine Whalen's Jazz Squad. I waited patiently for Dirty Little Secret. What a let down. A profound disappointment. The warm voice is gone. The mixing is terrible. The background music is loudly out of proportion to her voice. It blares on relentlessly, almost as if she isn't there. Why did such a fine artist put her trust in this producer? Hopefully, she'll find a mentor who will take her back to where she belongs: the smoky, sultry, small group format------and choose vocal material worthy of her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty Worthless","review":"The warranty for this product is worthless. The documentation at the manufacturer's site http://www.soft-sleeper.com warranties the product for 10 years. After 1 (one) year's use we experienced breakdown of the mattress in the head and hip areas. After numerous emails to the seller and manufacturer (no phone numbers available for the manufacturer) we were told a replacement after 1 year's use would cost 50% of a new mattress. In addition, we would be required to ship the product back to the manufacturer at our cost for their confirmation of the problem. If they disagreed with our assessment of breakdown of the mattress, they would charge us another $45 to return the original mattress to us.

His chronicle of the newsboys' strike is vital history. The book is more controversial when discussing the actions of the so-called 'child-savers,' one of whom actually included social activist photographer Lewis Hine. He dismisses the action of these advocates as puritanical and fundamentally ignorant of the real conditions of the children's lives. He decides that children are neither powerless nor defenseless, and this decision is, of course, a double-edged sword when dealing with the very real abuses of child labor and child exploitation that still pervade the U.S. and the globe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"A good read for somebody seeking to research that specific topic.

A lot of good stories in here, written in an easy to read fashion.

This was a comic made for adults; it actually had a plot which was not only interesting, it had a flow to it which made for a \\"must read\\". The utilization of Catman as a central character was brilliant; like many of the villians the reader is shocked to see how capable an opponent he is. Without explaining any \\"powers\\" he might have, the writers were able to convey a sense of competence and gravity to his character that frankly is lacking in most DC major heroes. The whole idea of the \\"Six\\" was perfect as well, and each of the characters were interesting, with the possible exception of the Parademon; I think we've just seen to many parademons used as fodder over the years to take this one to seriously.

Elliot's prose style is the most similar to Jordan's I have come across and matches his concept of a matriarchal dominated society though perhaps not to quite the same degree. It also touches on Sara Douglass' use of the 'we originated from the stars' concept but it blends both elements perfectly into a well written and utterly captivating series. I suspect it'll turn into one of those series you just don't want to ever end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, but alot of character development","review":"I found 'Child of Flame' to be very good. I enjoyed the first 3 books in the series, and was not dissapointed on this one. I did find that the 'character development', (basically chapters where nothing of substance happens, but you get to know the character better) was a little excessive. If you are willing to read these type of chapters, you will be well rewarded for your patience. I found I appreciated the book more when I took the time to understand the characters.The cast of characters is pretty big, with many plots and subplots. I like to read this type of book, as it makes me think more.Throughout the whole book, especially with Laith, I sensed a building of tension and drama that was on the brink of explosion right as the book ended. I am eager for the next book, and am sure it will be just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed and tiresome","review":"Well, that says it all. I've read them all and the first was the best. It was coherent, focused and balanced. Not the rest. Ms. Elliott seems to be trending toward an increasingly out of control jumble."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid take on fantasy with a twist","review":"Kate Elliot's ability to intertwine several story lines makes this a good read. As with the other books in this series, she follows several interweaving story lines in different times to present a believable world. The only problems I have with this book are1) One of the main characters in the book keeps doing stupid things. Certainly heroes (or heroines in this case) can be humanized, but I still prefer that they be intelligent, especially in classic fantasy. The choice between power and family is a great theme, however.2) She stresses the lack of sophistication of medieval society. This is a somewhat biased vie. There where certainly uneducated folks, but at the same time it was not hard for many kings to field armies in the thousands.Certainly a good read, I liked it a lot more then the Jaran series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny book.","review":"Dave Barry is the funniest man writing today, and this is by far his funniest book.

Some think Luther is the king of the makeover song, but they have not heard or appreciated Will's interpretation of a song and making it his own. For example, \\"I Try,\\" \\"Wishing on a Star,\\" \\"Girl Blue,\\" \\"You Sure Love to Ball\\" and a country song, \\"I go Crazy.\\" The man is tough! This cd is much more r and b inspired and based on the reviews of other consumers I bought the cd and was glad I did. I bought it at Will's concert in the bay area jazz club Kimball's East and let me tell you, if you haven't seen Will live, you are missing a great performer. You will not regret purchasing this cd, however my fave from Will is A Dream Fulfilled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WD continues to make the music!","review":"Much love to Will, \\"All the Man You Need,\\" is truly all the WD you need. Tracks 4, 7, & 11 are classic Will and any true Dowing lover will appreciate this CD. He did a few new things, and I ain't mad at him, but I'll never tire from the Will that makes a night something to remember and a memory something you'll never forget. WD's music makes loving more special each time and takes you back to particular moments in time that are forever etched in your heart and soul. A must have in the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!

This CD, like all the others, is smooth. I bought it the day it was released and played it over and over again. If you haven't purchased a Will Downing CD, you can start with this one. After listening, I am certain you will want more Will. His wonderful voice is displayed from the beginning to the end of this CD. Listening to this CD is as wonderful as seeing him live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half the Man...","review":"Years ago I was in a Record Exchange store and someone was returning a Will Downing Album... I purchased it, and I've been in love with him since that moment I placed the needle onto the wax. I have gone to every concert he's had in Cleveland, OH, I have purchased every CD, compilation, or guest appearance CD he's been involved with, even when he sang \\"House Music\\". I've even had the honor to meet Will in person (He is a wonderful person) So naturally when this CD came out I order it before it's release date, received it in the mail, rushed in the house to listen to it, and was highly disapointed... It's Half the Man Will use to be. I miss the heart warming music he has become know for. I patiently await his next project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downing Falls Short On Latest Project","review":"Switching to a new record company, Downing not only changes labels but also decides to change his sound. Abandoning the smooth jazz adult contemporary sound that made him famous, in favor of a trendier, hip hop urban sound...the results are very disappointing. Downing's rich voice simply sounds out of place on these selections, which are much better suited for someone of lesser depth, like R. Kelly or Sisque. Unfortunately, Downing has lost a lot of radio airplay with his new sound. It's too Urban to play on Jazz or Quiet Storm formats and Urban/Hip Hop stations have refused to embrace it. Hopefully, the singer will take note of this disaster and revert back to the formula that has worked for him over the past 12 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"One pleased Man","review":"I have always been a fan of Will Downing, but this CD that was recorded in the year 2000 was the best that I had heard from him yet!

Fits fairly well, but the back does not make it all the way to the ground (about 6 inches short). I think this would be a problem with any sport bike.Bottom line, it keeps the rain off and has bungees to hook across the bottom so the cover doesn't get blown off.

This is a book well worth reading at least twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like very bad fan fiction","review":"There are plenty of sites out there where you can find Highlander fan fiction. I would suggest doing that instead of reading this book, because it is so poorly written that the worst internet fan fiction out there would be a better choice. Why? Because it sucks no worse, and it won't cost you anything!I have a feeling that most of the positive reviews here were written by Lettow herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was simply awful. I suggest you skip it. This entire series of Highlander-inspired novels has been a disappointment. Hack writing (this novel being only slighter better than Captive Soul) at its...best?

Yes, that will do."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't \\"Highlander\\"---it's Middle East Zealotry-Light!","review":"Ms. Lettow manages to submerge the protagonist, Duncan MacLeod, in a once-over-lightly polemic on terrorism and the Middle East. In the process, any resemblance to the mythos of \\"The Highlander\\", and the epic fantasy, is irretrievably lost. She seems uncertain about the established character and persona of MacLeod and gives the reader the odd sense she doesn't even like the hero of the novel very much. This creates a strange feeling of disinterest in the reader for the events taking place. Although the author was a junior member of the series' writing team, she seems unable, on her own, to bring the flavor and character of the Immortal Highlander to life. We end up with a flat and unsatisfying historical propaganda piece that is \\"Highlander\\" in name only."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book left alot to be desired.","review":"i like a book that goes back in time. everytime she bumped her head, she switched centuries. it got really annoying because everytime it got interested, she switched centuries!! i really didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too light for me.","review":"I love time travel romances so I bought the book after reading the great reviews but I thought it had a slow and simple beginning which read like an Americana romance and not a time travel.

Typical of people today to want a shortcut. Rather than put in the true effort, we want an easier method; something 'revolutionary' (as if training dogs has changed). Why not do it right? Your dog is an investment, so my suggestion is to invest the time/expense required. Go for the best of the best and read either Bill Tarrant and/or Delmar Smith? The 'Delmar Smith Method' is the bible of the sport, and I am sure that Wolters has studied this thoroughly.[Just look at the book covers - do you want a picture of your dog with you pointing at the clouds, or do you want a dog that will end a successful day of hunting at your side?]"},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disapointment","review":"This was a waste of money, I bought Wolters Gun Dog afterwards and it made this video look even worse.If you are interested in this video let me know and I will send it to you for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gun Dog: Revolutionary Rapid Training Method","review":"Succinct, easy instructional read that works.

She's amazing: incredible voice; quality lyrics; solid music!Unfortunately the music industry doesn't know how to categorize her sound. Some say she's a black Alanis Morrisette, or a female Lenny Kravitz, or a younger Tina Turner, etc. She proves that black female artists with talent aren't limited to rap, hip-hop, gospel and R&B.Simply put: it's rock'n roll with a whole lot of soul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good To The Last Drop","review":"This CD is one of my favorites from 2000 because it's inspiring, original, bold & sassy. Kina's lyrics make me smile and her music makes me move. She's a real talent in today's racist music business. She's young, gifted and black. All of the songs turn me on except for \\"Me\\" because it contains this offbeat thing that annoys me when I hear it; maybe it was a production glitch or something. \\"Girl From The Gutter\\" is an anthem for people who breakthrough after being let down and put down. \\"I Love You\\" is my song! She's singing that one to me. And there's a hidden track that I call \\"Dark Cloud\\" that raises my spirits and rocks my world. Kina is great to work out to, great to run to, great to drive to, just great. The CD is good to the last drop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD","review":"This cd draws you in immediately. It is not one of those cds that has to be played over many times before you get used to it. Kina expresses her emotions and her songs are positive. The only problem with the cd is that it is not longer. I look forward to her next cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something New and Exciting","review":"When I first say Kina's video, I though it was kind of weird. But one I started listening to the words, I instantly fell it in my soul. Kina is one of the best new and most talented singers out their. If you want to hear good heart felt music then this is the C.D for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Three Worlds","review":"Imagine the soul of Lauryn Hill, the angst of Alanis Morrisette, and the rock egde of Tina Turner all wrapped up in one explosive singer- well then you have the latest dynamite artist to hit the scene. Her name? Simply Kina. The Detroit-native's voice is a welcome addition to what has become a scene dominated by bubble gum pop and trailer trash rap. From the ripping \\"Girl from the Gutter\\" to the catchy love yourself \\"Me\\" to the heartful \\"Have a Cry\\", Kina should be a front runner for New Artist at next year's Grammys. Every song on this debut CD exemplifies Kina's wide range of song style and lyrical prowress. MTV did the right thing making her video for \\"Girl from the Gutter\\" buzzworthy (the first time I heard the song), because the buzz surrounding Kina has just started and should continue to build to well-deserved peak of popularity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"When I first heard \\"Girl From the Gutter,\\" I thought it was one of the freshest, most original songs I've heard in a while. The CD wasn't out yet, but I was hoping that this woman wasn't going to be a one-hit wonder. She won't be. KINA is one of those rare CDs where EVERY song is incredible. Her voice and lyrics are powerful and very moving. It rocks with plenty of soul. If this CD isn't nominated for a Grammy, there is something very wrong with the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new voice must be heard!","review":"You know, this really isn't my type of music. I listen to mostly alternative and trip-hop, but, I was persuaded to buy this CD through some pro-Kina reviews. Kina really doesn't present anything particularly new on this album, but, she certainly does it really well! My favorite track is \\"Me\\", but, really all the songs are worth a listen. Someone here said that Kina's voice wasn't all that great. Huh?! What are you talking about? Her voice is great! She really does sound a lot like Tina Turner. Compare her to Alanis Morissette? No, I can't do that. I guess you could in some ways, but just because she uses a few choice words and is rock oriented isn't going to win her a comparison. I'm sure her and Alanis would create something really unique if combined though. Kina really is a respectable new talent. It'll be interesting to see what music she'll create in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average","review":"I Guess With Macy Gray Blowing Up The Powers that be saw fit to find Another one.Kina sounded Good with Brownstone.on this Disc you hear Traces of Alanis Moressette&a Little bit of Tina Turner.but Overall she is Factory Product.She Ain't Anni Defranco.more closer to Billy Meyers.Girl From The Gutter is just a 2nd Tier You Outta Know.I give Her Credit for her Vocals in parts but overall the same old old."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad music a review from kevin f","review":"this ia a peice of c... i hate all the songs i cant belive i heard this cd its sucks"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this CD!!","review":"Listening to this CD is like having lunch with an old friend.

Kina sings songs from her heart...a been there done that sort of experience...her songs step up to the plate in expression of feelings; full of emotion The lyrics are a combination of soft or fearless. The songs are diverse, something for every mood. Kina is not coy or shy, but up in your face.

The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around.

If you are looking for a versatile and well-made bag, consider this one.That said, a couple of \\"wishes\\": I wish it had more pockets (or better designed) to carry all the cords and accessories we all have to deal with for various electronics. I wish it had a fastener of some kind so you could secure it to a wheeled carry-on (piggyback style) for moving through the airport, etc. It sort of sits on top but there is nothing to secure it from falling off.Have not yet detached the bag from the wheeled base and frame, but it's nice to have that option. Very good value in my opinion and very smart-looking case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I researched a lot of cases and typically depend on other reviews before making my decision. This case seemed perfect for me. I really wanted the brown but the cost was much higher. I really liked the feature of the removable base. However my first impression was the smell of Chinese packaging. Upon further inspection I was unable to get the handle extended. After several tries I finally got the handle extended. The most impressive feature to me tuned out to be a dud. The removable base. This feature offers absolutely no practicality in real life. This feature is just to complicated. Unzip three or four zippers, I do not remember. However if you think you could easily put this back together on the way to the airport, think again. I ended up returning it and purchased a Delsey from Mori luggage.

I have struggled with the simplicity of the Christian message taught by many people and churches that encourage one to just admit they are a sinner and believe in Christ and you will be saved. In fact, I often ranted about what happens next? Now that I have my \\"golden ticket\\", what am I supposed to do with the rest of my life? Many times people focus on not sinning and doing good deeds. If you are a Christian, but struggle with the hypocrisy of your own life, then this book might help you. The message is one of real hope and true joy. It addresses who you have become and the relationship with God available to you because of Jesus through the Holy Spirit. How we think of ourselves has a huge impact on how we actually live our lives. This book is a big help for understanding what God has to say about who we are. The Author explains these concepts in just the way I needed to hear them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born again","review":"This book is for Christians. It makes no sense for anyone else.

I am so glad I did not spend much money on this book.I was very disappointed in this book. The book was almost entirely illustrations. The only pictures in this book were on the first page of each chapter and even that was a letdown. In chapter 3, there a photographs of three floor designs, one with a set-in square. Nowhere in the chapter did they tell you how to make that design, just generally info on laying out the design you want.I gave it 2 stars for the information, but feel it would have been a really good book with actual pictures of the steps. In these types of projects, pictures are much better than diagrams for me. For a great guide on laying tile that INCLUDES photos, I recommend Working with Tile by Tom and Lane Meehan.

I think Kina has real star potential and from what I have heard from her debut album, she is going to make it big! Her sound has changed from R&B to more of a universal pop/rock sound, which I think was a smart move. I'm not sure if the lyrics to this song are autobiographical, but they are very inspirational and emotional. But her voice is the thing that attracts me the most - she sings with so much passion.

In the age of Britney Spears and her lookalikes/soundalikes, it's good to see that some vocalists are able to find a way to stay true to themselves and resist the urge to buy into that formulaic Pop sound. Her music incorporates a little bit of every genre though the single is very Rock-oriented.

If this book were to be proofed and cleaned up it would get a much higher rating.This author seems to have potential, but I really hope he either educates himself, or gets a good editor to clean up after him before unleashing another book.

Many of the sites that the scripts try to \\"scrape\\" have changed their layout since this book was published, braking the scripts.

Only 2 things that bug me a little: Although the LCD screen is easy to read, the control buttons are not backlit, so they are hard to see out on the deck in the dark. Also, some of the lists (such as \\"purchased\\" songs, or playlists) are not in the correct order--just in a random order. I've found the best way is just put it on shuffle and let it go.

The poems are ones the kids can relate to and enjoy, while also modeling different poetry styles. Student's imaginations are sparked and they are eager to create their own poems. There are 3 parts to this book. First is a series of fun poems about and for kids. The second part includes several poems and space for children to illustrate the poems on their own. The last part is for children to write their own ideas and poems. Some of my favorites from this author include: \\"First Day of School\\", \\"Keep a Journal\\", \\"The Terrible Zoor\\", \\"School Lunch\\" and \\"Immigration\\". The black and white illustrations (by the author's son) are fun and exciting. Addie Meyer Sanders' poetry reminds me of Shel Silverstein's.

Perhaps it says something about me that I have read both and enjoyed their work. They are Calder Willingham and Hamilton Basso.I finished Basso's \\"The View from Pompey's Head\\" just last week. It is slow moving in a pleasant, languid, distinctly Southern manner. Basso gradually develops memorable characters, crafts fine scenes and steadily hones the plot - with the ultimate Southern shocker of miscegenation!\\"The View From Pompey's head\\" spent 40 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller List in the 1950s and was made into a Hollywood motion picture starring Richard Egan and the ravishing Dana Wynter. Basso published 11 books and edited The New Yorker for 20 years but is virtually forgotten today.

Woolf accomplishes this by portraying Jacob as seen by those around him - his mother, friends from school, strangers on the street, and the women who adore him - as well as by intimating the reader with Jacob through brief moments inside Jacob's own mind. The result is a forceful novel that speaks boldly against the evils of war and on the superficiality of perception, love, and life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"This IS literature at its best. There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said rather eloquently by the first review of this book, 'Stitched Seams of Color, Subjectless, and Brilliant,' January 17, 1998 Reviewer: A reader from Deerfield, Massachusetts, so go read that one. The other reviews were too superficial; futile exercises in trying to describe a plot that is not there. Woolf is remarkable. This novel is a reflection of Woolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harcourt annotated kindle edition - riddled with typos","review":"I'm shocked by the apparent lack of copy editing or even proof reading on the electronic version of this edition. The scholarly apparatus is excellent, but hard to access readily while reading because there is no functioning table of contents. The text itself frequently includes not only misspelled words but random punctuation marks, such as parentheses substituted for \\"J\\"s. No wonder it's less than 3 bucks. Why can't they just use the typesetting from the print version?That said, the scholarly material in this edition is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Stream of consciousness\\"","review":"\\"Stream of consciousness\\" really says it all. I read three chapters and quit. If you read Ulysses and loved it, you will love this. If you hated it, don't read Jacob's Room. There really seems to be no story here. A scene is described in great detail, someone's thoughts, then another description of another scene. NOTHING HAPPENS. To me a story is about people and their experiences, dialogue, events. Here is just one example, \\"But intimacy--the room was full of it, still, deep, like a pool. Without need of movement or speech it rose softly and washed over everything, mollifying, kindling, and coating the mind with the lustre of pearl, so that if you talk of a light, of Cambridge burning, it's not languages only. It's Julian the Apostate.\\" If you can make sense of that, by all means, read this book. I can't, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"This was the first Virginia Woolf book I had read, and the \\"stream of consciousness\\" method did not work for me. I was expecting there to be a plot eventually, but there wasn't. It seems that Woolf was a talented writer, although a little complex and difficult to read, like William Faulkner. However, with Faulkner there is a clear development of a story that can keep me interested. I know this was experimental writing, and I plan on reading another of her books, one that is a more conventional novel. I'm no literary critic, and my judgement certainly means very little, but I didn't enjoy reading the book very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kessinger Edition ruins the rhythm","review":"I am teaching Jacob's Room this semester and wanted to provide a reasonably priced edition. Unfortunately, the Kessinger edition has formatted the entire novel as if it were being read off a computer screen, with block unindented paragraphs, each one set off by a skipped line. Woolf's novel is told in fragments --there are eleven in chapter 1, for instance-- but this rhythm is entirely lost in this edition. I regret buying it for my class, and recommend that people buy some other edition of the book.Of course I find this frustrating. Jacob's Room is a beautiful book, deliberately plotless with a protagonist whom the (omniscient!) narrator never gets to know.

Stanley, a crossword puzzle aficionado, is a perennial loser despite his impressive command of the English language.

At one of those moments he states, \\"Keep the Eleventh Commandment.

As a fan, I am compelled to do things like this. However, I would not recommend this film for the usual purpose of entertainment.

I have probably read Grapes of Wrath four or five times since first reading it in high school, but after reading Gregory's description of the way these poor south-westerners struggled with poverty and at the same time maintained family unity and cultural pride, Steinbeck's book takes on a whole new meaning. Gregory goes step by step to show what motivated many to move, and then what motivated them to stay even though they suffered great privations and predjudice. I especially enjoyed learning about the influences of country music not just upon the migrants, but on the entire nation. A must read to make Grapes more clear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not finish it.","review":"I love American history but this book is not what I expected. Very very dry. Reads like a textbook.

Relativity is approached from several vantage points -- gravity, energy (E = mc squared), time shifts, and distance shortening. Of course, it all goes back to the same theory, so I liked having the multiple views presented to help me understand.The biggest complaint I have about the book is that it's over 20 years old. This makes the last few chapters fairly useless since they are based on observations using 20-year-old telescopes. The first three-quarters of the book are still valid and insightful, which makes it worth reading.

However I will acknowledge some of you may find it a good read and I urge you to try it if you have reason to think so.Descriptions and explanations appear to be designed to include readers who have NO math knowledge. The author actually apologizes when he mentions that gravity decreases with the inverse square of distance.In my opinion, the time-gravity examples that are more difficult and less interesting ideas than the more famous examples that are usually covered. I think the author felt these example required too much math understanding which he was avoiding, but I strongly disagree.The author seems to think ANY math is too much. But he does not set the stage by explaining the elementary ideas of velocity, acceleration, or Newton's laws.There are much more compelling (and enjoyable) treatments available than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating Science Fails To Entrap The Average Reader","review":"While the subject of Einstein's Relativity is one that one can marvel over for hours, Calder's simplification lacked the elements to inspire one who does not have a passion for physics.

Yet more often, Calder simply was translating a difficult theoretical papaer into one with more common words, leaving the reader to get bored, becoming lost in a sea of scientific jargon and ideas that cannot be well visually conceptualized without the aid that Calder did not provide.

Complete with all the basic Yes ingredients - high-pitched vocals, Rickenbacker bass, banks of keyboards - Druid went off hell-bent to prove to the world that they could sound like Yes. The point of this exercise in mimickery remains a mystery. Toward The Sun is one of the few progressive rock albums where the mellotron is so over-used, it actually starts to get on your nerves. Fluid Druid finds the band a little leaner and meaner, but the unhealthy Yes fascination still grates. After just two albums, Druid wisely called it a day.

The white man and the Indians hated eachother. The white man wanted to steal the Indians land. I think the characters were described the best! They were described so you knew just how they looked and just the way they felt! If I were the author I would change the part when they leave Woelfin alone in the woods.

I read it for the first time in 1995 when I was 13 years old. My 7th great grandmother was Barbara Leininger, Regina's older sister, who escaped from the Indians. It was interesting finding a book on the market that pertained to something that I knew had happened in my family. Although I am not descended from Regina, I still feel for her and what she could have gone through as a child. I don't think everything happened to her that is mentioned in the book, but I do know that it must have been a miracle to see her mother from just singing a song in German, when she had been speaking the Indian language for 9 years.

I can't say that I really enjoyed it, but it wasn't terrible...The problem with 'Regina' is that the story inches along without any real purpose or definite plot. At the start, we are thrown into some fast-paced blood and gore and action, but then the action fades away and what are we left with...?Boredom.In theory, this is a great story. A young girl stolen from her white family and forced to live among the Native Americans!!! She struggles to find her identity amoungst these 'savage' people. It is an incredible story...IN THEORY.But it isn't written all that well, and the characters are not all that memorable or endearing (especially the main character).I wouldn't recommend this book (at all)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible book","review":"This book was disturbing. It featured many themes that are completely unnecessary, including an attempted rape, drunkenness, and a few morbid scenes of death and despair.

I had to read it for a school project, which was the only reason I read it. Now, I crave books. It borders on an obsession, but this book was so awful that it made me mad.It fails to intrest older readers, but has too many adult themes to be suitable for anyone under the age of twelve.

The only (albeit fairly big) flaw I see on this album is the singer - or maybe just the mixing. This band would deserve a way better lead singer or at least the vocals should not be this much in the background. This problem with the vocals is the reason of the 4 and not 5 stars rating. Their first album, 'Diary of a blind angel' has the same style - and unfortunately, the same vocals. The music is excellent though - get it if you can find it.

It's difficult to describe the issue completely, but the track on the door is the same width as the track on the vertical part of the frame. To see why this is a problem think of a shoebox. It has a lid that is slightly wider than the base so it closes. Imagine that box with the lid the same width as the box. It won't close at all. You can't secure the door to the frame. The vertical track needed to be slightly wider than the door track.Now there are clips, however, if you screw them flush in the vertical track the same size tracks still won't clip together properly. If you attach them to the door they don't stick out enough to fit into the vertical track. Basically, the clips need to be taller by quite a bit.That is my only complaint, but it is a huge one.

A person CANNOT get on a jury like Cusack did, just to try and arrange a verdict. All of these people were guilty of jury tampering, which is a felony, but no no one ever acts the least bit concerned that they might go to jail. What was the point of all this as the gun company could have easily gotten a new trail because Cusack lied duing his jury exam and apparently gave a phony name, ID, etc. Also, what was Jenifer Beals doing in this movie? She was on the jury, but never spoke a word (that I remember) and really had no part at all. Was her part cut from the movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good legal thriller that has some issues to deal with","review":"The movie has a lot to say about the nature of guns and violence, but other than that, it's still a pretty good movie regardless of the issues raised. The acting is very good(I pretty much agree with everybody that Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz stole the show) and the tension is fairly high for a movie of this nature. It's worth the rental if you are looking for a great night for movies at home, and does entertain for the two hours you spent with it. So regardless of your views of this subject, it does set out on what it's trying to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for an anti-gun movie","review":"I am a strong believer in people being held accountable for their own actions, so I cringe when faced with films made by people with an Agenda. Far more murders are committed by people using things such as hammers, crowbars, and ballbats, but you never see anyone calling for a 5-day waiting period for buying a Louisville Slugger, or suing Stanley tools.Ok. Enough of my own rant. On to the movie.As a general rule, I like John Cusack's comedies much more than his dramas, but this film was excellent. The plot had some interesting turns, and the twist at the end was a nice touch.I'm also a fan of Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman, and their performances were excellent. I was also happy to see Cusack's long-time friend, Jeremy Piven in the film, although his role was not all that extensive nor developed.I really have to disagree with the reviewers who didn't like the film. It was a most enjoyable 2 hours, even while I was getting preached at about the eeeeevil of firearms."},{"rating":"1","title":"See it for Hackman and Weisz, other than that don&#65533;t bother","review":"Dumb, and contrived caper that insults the viewer in every level with it's unbelievable clutches, and it's preaching to the choir views on guns which in a way makes not sense considering that the movie is more about jury tampering than guns in the first place. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz do a great job considering that the script was written by about three or four people and they make you care about their characters. A hard thing to do considering that you really don't care after a while about what is happening on screen.I usually don't agree with the majority but I really do in this case. See it for the good effort made by Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz for at least doing their best to keep you interest in the movie. If you don't want to, I suggest renting much better movies by them and skip this movie out right, because it's really not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias film that waste the good acting of Weisz and Hackman.","review":"Low grade John Grisham drama does not practice what its preaches by skirting the issues its trying to convey and goes for the throat in its bias views about gun responsibility. Do we need some kind of moratorium for gun responsibility? In my opinion yes but we do not need a movie that skirts the issues raised by going on a self effacing crusade of judge and jury with out hearing all the facts from both sides of the case. Besides all of that, the actors in this movie do their jobs by giving very good performances despite the hack job of the script they had to work with. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz are the standouts in this film and they give the best performances in an all star cast that includes the great Dustin Hoffman, and the charming John Cusack. They are the reasons to sit thou this movie, even when you are moaning at the script self righteousness, and bias smug view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a John Grisham story?","review":"Tacky adaptation of John Grisham's book lacks not only the original story but also a real plot to go with it. Not only are the motives of some of the characters not even explained but also some of the tactics used in this movie makes no sense what so ever, and the whole gun issue is so out of place here that its ridiculous. I agree with everyone that the acting is the only thing that makes this film bearable with the great acting turns by Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman, John Cusack and Dustin Hoffman. See it for their performances, other than that, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat.....","review":"Other than the good acting of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman (which both deserve a lot of credit for making the movie bearable) The movie is just a mess from beginning to end. The plot which is an taken of the John Grisham novel of the same name lacks the story of that novel and the showmanship and puts in a story about guns that does not even fit the structure of the court proceeding that follow. Dustin Hoffman is fine for the time he's on but after a while he disappears and the direction that follows the other actors don't even do them any sense of justice because the camera work flashes way too fast from one scene to the next. The story is called Runaway Jury but we don't really have time to really know the jury at all because we are stuck with what happing outside the courtroom other than what is happing in the courtroom. The movie excels because of the acting of Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman but I suggest you rent other movies from them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it, other than the acting, there is nothing here.","review":"Dismal retention of the novel by John Grisham leaves out the important stuff and heads for the bad in order to please sensitive people who can't handle the truth about guns and violence in our society.

The picture had lots and lots of little boxes of colors and you could not see the movie itself, just the boxes of colors that seemed to be quivering.Please send another DVD of Runaway Jury, one that really works well and as soon as possible. And noooooooo I do not want to buy an envelope and go to the trouble of having it filled out and shipped back to you since it doesn't work in the first place!!!!!Now, if I receive another DVD of Runaway Jury and it works the whole way through and more than one time, I will then rate you a solid 4.My head hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours of thinly veiled lefty propaganda","review":"If you think you might enjoy 2 hours of anti-gun, leftist propaganda, then this is a great movie.

They didn't even try to make good arguments for the pro-gun side. I hate to use the term Liberal Bias but in this case it fits like a glove. The cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie I felt like the gun companies were the underdogs. Pure garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was not what the book was about.","review":"The book was about the cigarette industry. the movie was changed to the gun industry. The cigarette industry has a monopoly on the negative information that people know about cigarettes. I was taken aback when the movie ignored the details of the book. This movie should not used the titled from the book. The book told us a story about the power and influence of the cigarette company. How they lied to us about the safety of their product. How they addicted young americans (10-12 years old) so that their product will have a long lasting clientel. Nicotine is used to addict the smoker. The industry of death corrupts our legal system and our government. This movie makes a statement that confirms the book original intent. which is that the cigarette companies are the worst scum on this earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"If you read the book before you see it you may be disappointed in the movie. So much happens in the book that it would take a four hour movie to fit it all in. A little hard to follow if you haven't read the book. I didn't really like the way the ended the movie. I much preferred the book ending. Still worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jury is still out with this one.","review":"Derivative John Grisham thriller that puts the gun manufactures on trail but lacks enough evidence to not only put on a compelling case but lacks enough of a punch to put on a good show. Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz and Dustin Hoffman do their best with what is given but they are working with a script that not only lacks teeth but also lacks a real story to work with. The setting of the film is distracting to the point of nasal, which is pretty bad considering that New Orleans is a great place to behold. The book which this movie came from had enough intelligence and heart to make a real and compelling movie but the studio seem like they wanted to please someone and just thou out everything that made that novel great for this. I wonder who did the studio try to please? Hmmm, Paging Michel Moore Please...Talk about conspiracy theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it only for Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman.","review":"Weak minded and painfully inaccurate film about guns is a slap in the face of those who are trying to find a real solution to the problem. Its really easy to try to find a bad guy in all that has happen but in the real world, the complexity of the problem is more profound than good guys and bad guys and happy ending are hard to come by. Other than that, the script is really choppy in places and the director over stylizes certain scenes a little too much, forgetting the age-old rule of less is more. The acting is great with Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman stealing scenes left and right, making the movie a little better than it should have been but other than their strong talent, the movie suffers from a misguided purpose of self righteousness. A purpose mined you that are full with Hollywood fantasy.I rather see something with a little more reality to it than a fantasy film that leaves out the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy used to be a lawyer?","review":"A great idea for a movie gone awry. It is far too hard to believe anything like this could happen in such a way. A sequestered jury going out for drinks? A sequestered juror with a text-pager... who is able to run away to a secret midnight meeting... a juror sneaking booze into a courthouse... a lawyer with a suitcase loaded with electronics including illegal cameras and recording equipment... seriously, I though Mr. Grisham used to be an attornety. This movie is so hard to believe that it isn't worth attempting to suspend your disbeliefe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth your time.","review":"Runaway Jury is as bad as they say it is. The story makes no sense what so ever, and the politics involved don't jell with the message sent. The acting is good with Rachel Weisz, Dustin Hoffman, and Gene Hackman doing their best to keep the movie afloat while the script keeps punching holes into it.See it for the performances of Weisz, Hoffman, and Hackman because they do make this movie a better experience that it's really is, despite the bias politics involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has the usual Grisham twists and turns","review":"This movie has some major departures from Grisham's book by the same name, but having said that, it is still an interesting movie judged on its own merits. The all-star cast features John Cusack as a young man who insinuates himself onto a jury in order to influence the verdict, Gene Hackman as the relentless lawyer who manipulates everything about the trial in order to win the case for his gun-manufacturing bosses, and Dustin Hoffman as the idealistic lawyer who is representing the widow of a murder victim. There are a few places where the viewer is required to suspend belief because of plot lapses, but generally this is a fast-moving, interesting film which gives a chilling look at the possibilities of influencing a jury in order to favor certain interest groups. Although Grisham has come in for a lot of criticism in recent years, he still produces entertainment which captures and keeps the viewer (or reader's) attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing 2 hours of liberal indoctrination","review":"Watching this movie I was definately convinced that the Democratic National Committee played a role in this movie. Evil Capitalist businessmen, victimization, entitlement, and class warfare intertwined in this hollywood type libral movie. Gun dealers were portrayed as icompetant survivalist wackos. But my favorite was the private room meeting with all the overly done stereotypical \\"gun\\" business owners. I am sure the \\"gun\\" will be replace with fast food, oil, walmart, and tobacco for any sequel. Just change the setting and recast the same characters. What we are left with is great actors using their talents as a campaign spot. Hackman at least holds his own.

Gene Hackman gives an Oscar caliber performance in this film, and Rachel Weisz gives one as well, not only holding her own with him but almost even surpassing him as well.

It wasn't ABOUT that, it was about the story, which was great to watch unfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runaway from this movie.","review":"I enjoyed the book very much but the movie did not cut it for me one bit. Not only is this movie an abomination of the book that it came from but a good portion of the film did not make sense. I agree with the whole that the acting is the best thing here, and Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman were the best things this movie had going for it. They at least held my attention while the movie began to fade away. Hopefully, Rachel and Gene can star together in a better movie that is really worthy of their talent other than a movie that wasted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz make a bad movie look good.","review":"John Grisham should be livid over the way they butchered his book for an advertisement for gun safety. The original story of the tobacco industry is thrown right out in favor for a democratic approach to gun control that is bias to say the least. The only plus here is the performances, and I really do mean plus because if the performances were as bad as the film, I would have definitely walk out of the theater. Gene Hackman is very good as a man trying to secure a verdict for the gun manufactures, and Rachel Weisz is also very good as a woman trying to secure the verdict for her own gain. John Cusack is good as a juror with a motive, and Dustin Hoffman is fine as a layer with a passion for the truth. With a better director and a better screenplay, the movie would have been Oscar worthy, too bad it's not. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very faithful to the book at all.","review":"Decent courtroom spectacle that is not faithful to the John Grisham book and makes a mockery of a serious subject. If it was grounded in reality, it would have been ok but it would rather play the good guys and bad guys' routine other than to face the problem of guns head on in a realistic way. The acting is the movie's only selling point with Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman giving superb performances that the film did not deserve and John Cusack doing a fairy decent job as well. It's an ok film but it could have been much better if they just been faithful to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Jury should be sequestered.","review":"Cliché ridden movie that can't make up it's mind whether it's a court room thriller or a sappy lesson in gun control that fine tuns its message to an irritating noise that does not stop. The actors are good (I agree with every body that Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman make the movie better than it should have been) and there are some suspenseful scenes that do make you jump but the movie does not handle them with any clarity, or any purpose other than to hind the fact that story has too many plot holes to drive anyone who is watching it batty. Maybe the actors should have waited for a better script before they committed to this movie because it even shows on the expression on their faces that they even think this movie makes no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and Forgettable","review":"I would write a review, but I've already forgotten it.

I had to stop it sever times and take a break from the boredom. 1st of all it is soooo farfetched. 2nd of all I think Hackman shows in this film that he's played one bad guy too many, by his lack of perfomrance, he needs to try some other role. Hackman's bad guy acting in this film would be more suitable in a James Bond film, petting a white can, while talking about taking over the world. In any case the lead guy is boring, and come on now hidden cameras set upo everywhere to select a jurer? And 20 people at evil Hackman's service night and day. This is so unbelievable, not even an artistic film. Don't waste your time. Only the 1st two minutes of the film is exciting, and it's downhill, the rest of the way.

Why not sue hammer manufacturers, afterall, people are killed with hammers all the time..how about bathtub manufacturers for making them so deep you could drown?

Now public people's private lives are turning into movies, what next, a movie about a talking ant, oh wait that already happened.

I saw this movie right when it came out on DVD a while back. I mean, you've got to be tempted by the cast which includes Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, Rachel Weisz and John Cusack. Pretty impressive. Ok, the cast is fine but what's the problem, the movie! It's plain boring, stupid and well BORING. By looking at the cast, I forgot about one very important detail: based on the novel by John Grisham. I've never read one of his books and really never intend to because after seeing this and The Firm, WOW. Gene Hackam must really like his books..because I don't know why he'd accept to be in such horrid movies.

Both Weisz and Hackman do wonders with a dumb and extremely predicable script that is not help by the directing, which is not up to par at all. The story of the original novel is push aside for a whining voice for gun control that makes not sense what so ever, and some of the scenes that occur in the film leads nowhere in terms of the story itself.If you see it, see it for the fine acting from Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman but I recommend renting something from their other work than to sit though this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but only Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman do well here.","review":"Lazy movie that rips off a very good novel, and does not even stay true to it. The acting is the only major thing going for this film, and that is a god sent because I would have turn off the DVD player if it was not for the actors involved in this mess. Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman do miracles with a bad script, and they alone make this movie respectable despite the fact that its does not respect its audience.

However, the movie was a major disappointment to me. I thought Gene Hackman played a great role. However, changing the major theme from the tobacco industry to an attack on the gun industry was all but inspiring. I think it was Hollywood's ploy to send it's anti-gun (a.k.a. anti-constitution ) message to the hard-working movie-watching world. In addition to portraying the gun-manufactures as the killers of society, the director also attacks the NRA. Same as it did in Lethat Weapon III.

Not only did it held my attention but it rally made me think a lot about issues brought up in the film. I think the major thing that made the movie so good was the actors involved. I've been a Gene Hackman fan for ages, and he really made this movie work, and I think that Dustin Hoffman was great as well. The best acting though does go to Rachel Weisz who was tough as nails, and took no prisoners. I've admired her work before, and this proves to me that is one hell of an actress. John Cusack is another fine actor and it's nice to see him do more diverse roles.All, and all, a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runaway Jury","review":"I am from Mississippi and a huge John Grisham fan, but this movie/book is a huge disappointment. It is the sad epitomy of Mississippi jurys making poor poor decicesions. Don't take my word for it, MS was ranked poorest in jury decisions in the lawyers nationwide journal. Runaway Jury goes on to make the gun companies the enemy in the current violence of America. The movie incorrectly portrays the gun companies as evil businesses that enable criminals to buy guns. The only people in a legitimate business that can even be entertained as enabling criminals to obtain guns are the actual gun dealers. While I strongly disagree with the point of view expressed in this movie, it is actually somewhat entertaining, althoughh very Hollywoodized. Watch the movie, just don't take it to heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite the good performances the movie is not that good.","review":"One sided court thriller that attempts to entertain but lacks the necessary ingredients to be successful. The screenplay is a joke on so many levels that it's an eye sour and certain scenes really isn't necessary to the plot of the film. The acting on the other hand is very good with Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz doing their best work and making this film much more that it deserved to be, which is a shame because both of them deserve a much better movie than this. Dustin Hoffman is fine is a relatively small role and John Cusack is decent as well. The movie begins to unravel when it stars to preach its values other than to give compelling arguments for them and loses its way during the course of the film. It could have been more but with a script that needs a lot of work, it's a hard thing to come by."},{"rating":"1","title":"The strong performance of Rachel Weisz is the only plus here","review":"Derivative thriller that not only does not stay close to the book but also lacks the insight to give a better show. The script has too many problems and the pacing starts and stalls at will in the most starling of moments. The acting is fine with Rachel Weisz stealing the show and doing better than she should have consitering the script is flat and Gene Hackman doing his best work in years. The whole espionage aspect to the film just does not work, and in reality, the case would have been throng out of a real court. The acting is the only plus in this film and that is a miracle because the rest of the film just does not work.Thanks to Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman, the movie is just ok but if it had a decent script, it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weisz, Hackman and Hoffman are great but the film is not.","review":"Lackluster adaptation to the John Grisham novel has only the acting to save it for total disaster with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman, and Dustin Hoffman but they are working from a half baked script that in essence does not know what it wants to be and direction that is marginal at best. The tobacco story is gutted for a pure and simple look at gun violence, and the setting of New Orleans is not the original setting of the book.If you want to see this movie, the acting more than makes up for the problems it has, but not by much."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham should keep his books to himself.","review":"Very bad rendition of his best-selling book lacks Grisham's real voice of legal ethics and tight plot point in order to cry about the gun argument to an annoying tee. The screenplay feels like a summery than a story, and the direction needed more to it for me to feel compelled to sit though the movie. I feel sorry for all the actors involved for giving their all for this lackluster of a movie. I will also give special notice to Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz for giving outstanding performances in a movie that really did not deserve it, and to Dustin Hoffman, who took a bit part and made something special out of it. Despite their efforts,the movie remains a good reason for authors to not sell their works to filmmakers because they will butcher it for their own views. ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...]","review":"Like most John Grisham stories, Runaway Jury takes place mainly in the courtroom. Unlike his other stories thou, this movie follows the behind the scenes of a trial, what goes into selecting a jury, and what happens when someone throws a wrench into your plans. What once was unimaginable, can quickly become possible when millions of dollars are on the line. The cast, well just seeing those names up there should tell you, that they were all top notch. All the main characters had two different sides to them, inside and outside the courtroom and it was great to see who they are on the surface as well as who they really are on the inside. Like all Grisham films it comes down to a verdict, which was the result of information we didn't previously know. Runaway Jury follows the genre John Grisham has created to the letter.

I won't give away any details, but suffice it to say that this film thinks that conspiracy - no matter how silly, and twists - no matter how nonsensical, will somehow add up to an engaging court drama.The original script must have been pretty good for these distinguished actors to sign on to the project. I guess someone ran away with that version, because the final product is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book and movie","review":"this book was amazing. even though i am only in 6th grade i am a very advanced reader and loved the book. the movie was just as good. it seems that although the plot was about the same the movie did a better job of making it overly dramatic. it's hollywood though so what should we expect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-gun propoganda","review":"This movie is utter nonsense done by leftist actors who hate the 2nd ammendment more than the people who actually kill people. Don't waste your time by watching this or any other left wing nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham SOLD OUT!","review":"A great book, but then J. Grisham sold out to the tobacco criminals (life reflecting art, I suppose) and allowed the movie studio to change the subject of his story (had never happened before, hmmm.) Tobacco is a weapon of mass destruction and Fox and John Grisham should have had the balls to say, \\"We're going to do it like the book, just like we always did in the past.\\" It's time the tobacco people were called before the \\"jury\\" to be held accountable for their crimes of mass murder of the people of the world! I will never read another John Grisham book or see another movie made from one of his books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a farce.","review":"One of the worst movies I've seen in years. The plot tenets were so ridiculous I couldn't believe it. I find it ludicrous to purport that major companies would be knowing consipirators in jury tampering. The backlash that would occur should they be found out would be far worse than losing just money. The movie tries to be a morality play against the \\"evil companies\\" but falls extremely short. It appears to be a movie bought and paid for by the anti-gun factions. And their arrogance about the mentality of the viewing audiences belies their narrowmindedness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Don't waste your time or your money on this. The story is shallow and boring. In a word, this is a bad movie. No wonder it went directly to DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"it stinks!","review":"As most of us know this movie is based on the book by John Grisham which is about lawsuits against tobacco companies. A ridiculous premise at best but John Grisham makes it exciting and the book is hard to put down. Now, my reaction to the movie can be summed up in two words-boring and ridiculous. I guess the producers decided to do the politically correct thing and trade tobacco companies for gun manufacturers. I think that when a gun manufacturer gets sued because some serial killer used a gun they made is beyond stupid and since I'm a gun enthusiast I take it as a personal offense. That aside, movie is boring, John Cusack is boring and a lousy actor. The end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"John Grisham's bestseller \\"Runaway Jury\\" becomes one of the best movies after A time to kill. This time we have the famous and charming John Cusack playing as Nick Easter, an ambitious guy who \\"despises\\" to attend at a court as a jury but who would do just about anything to be selected as a jury and remain there until the verdict gets reached.In the meantime his girlfriend is in contact with attorneys from both sides. Requesting millions of dollars from them if they want to win their case. And this case is all in the hands of her and Nick Easter.So many movies that were made based upon novels - seemed so different from what we've read. This one is not. It was such a tremendous joy seeing the same story I've read and the characters coming to life. It all seemed that I was in that part of the world and that I am having a deja-vu feeling.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs up for Weisz and Hackman but Thumbs down for the rest","review":"I did like what I saw in the film but that was because of the effort made by Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman,who both manage to make this film somewhat much better than it really is and that's pretty good considering the fact that the movie is not that good at all. Both actors are able to make lemonade out of a real lemon of a script that makes no effort to try to explain itself during key scenes and manages to contradict itself in certain parts of the movie.See it for the great acting by Weisz and Hackman but only see it once. The rest of the movie does not live up to their performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"The so-called 'anti-gun' bias is the best thing in the movie","review":"Have you noticed how some people use the term 'politically correct' in an insulting way? They do this to excuse their own antisocial or reprehensible behaviour - mocking 'political correctness' gives you an excuse to be a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, or a gun-loving psychopath like some of the previous reviewers. You aren't fooling anyone, you know.As to the film... I enjoyed it; tense and absorbing story with what are, I'm sure, VERY ACCURATE portrayals of the evil Gun Company's staff. I haven't read the book - John Grisham writes turgid, one-dimensional novels, but some of them have been adapted into quite decent films. This is one of the good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Trust the Reviews on Amazon...","review":"I saw this movie and it wasn't the worst movie of the year but it wasn't very good either. A waste of time and money. Very flat and unimaginative. Better to see it on cable. But the first review of this movie posted her on Amazon made me suspicious. I have heard from others that since Amazon doesn't screen the reviews of anything posted, it's more than likely that people who need/want a product to be sucessful (including movies) will deliberately post overly positive reviews knowing that people are all to easily fooled. I suspect it with this post. Please...don't waste your time and $$$ with this movie. It's simply not worth it when there are other, much better movies out there like \\"School of Rock\\", or \\"Lost in Translation\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Adaptation","review":"This movie is fantastic. I read the book first and then saw this movie soon after. The only thing that's different is the issue that is focused on. Instead of tobacco it's guns. Also there are some differences with the plaintiff and his reaction to Marlee. Anyway, it is a fast-paced and fun thriller. The only difference b/t the book and movie is the issue that is explored. It's a great movie that's very faithful to the theme of the book even if it doesn't explore the same driving issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this film....but alas","review":"I was shocked at how lame this film was. I really like most of Grisham's films, so I was excited about this one, especially given the cast. Basically the plot involves a woman who sues a gun manufacturer after a maniac kills her husband at the office. Okay, so a maniac uses the gun to kill her husband, and she sues the gun company?!! Hokey premise, but of course, the gun company hires Gene Hackman, as a hot shot attorney to 'fix' the jury so that his high-priced client wins, unbeknowst to him, one of the jurors, played by John Cusack has his own manipulations in mind. Rachel Weiss turns in a nice performance as his co-conspirator. The problem in this film, is not the acting, or performances. It's the lack of punch. Hackman is never truly evil or bad, and the consequences of the outcome are not that earth shattering. I was hoping for a film like Grisham's 'The Rainmaker' with Matt Damon, but unfortunately I got a bad rerun episode of tv's L.A.Law."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for special effects ONLY","review":"I liked the movie until it finally dawned on me how many lies are in it and how biased the story is against NRA members and gun owners and manufacturer's. It had excellent effects, but I don't appreciate the film makers, actors, and writers implying that I, as a NRA member and gun owner for 30 yrs, and Proud of it, am some sort of thug who condones selling guns to criminals. Hoffman and all the others who twisted this film (The book this movie is based on has nothing at all to do with guns) should keep their political agendas and bias out of the films, since some of the story plot is half-lies and some of the truth is (conveniently) left out. The effects a are good though and it has plenty of action. Still, I'll never rent it or watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro-gun control propaganda masquerading as a movie","review":"Could the pro-gun control agenda of this movie had been a little more subtle? I mean, everything from the evil gun company CEO to the portrayal of every 2nd Amendment supporter as a white trash, backwoods idiot with a mullet...I just couldn't tell what political agenda this movie was trying to advance. Even with all the cheap anti-gun emotional appeals, I still didn't catch on. I think I'll go out and do all kinds of stupid things, because after watching this movie, I no longer have any concept of personal responsibility. I can always find someone or something to blame for my own stupidity...Hollywood says I can!!Geez. Worst Grisham movie ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"The \\"plot\\" just doesn't work or make any sense. Never mind that the political overtones are just ridiculous preaching rather than an an attempt at anything logical.

This is one worth seeing at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good!!","review":"This is a type of movie that makes you have lots of questions in your head as the movie goes along and the acting is just fantastic! I most especially love Hoffman and Hackman's first ever scene together! They instantly drawn me into the picture. I also like all the triller action going on too.

Watch it and you won't regret it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A legal bind of creative proportion.","review":"Flat legal Thriller that has a great cast but does not have a great script to go with them. Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman all do well with what is on the script but you can tell that they are giving it more heart and substance than what was on the written page. The direction is fine but lacks coherency and the setting of New Orleans is not fully represented to it's full potential. I have not read the original book that inspired this movie but judging by the word of mouth, the book is considered much better. I give thanks to Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman for making this movie a much better film than it really is but I also feel bad for then for not having a script that helps them move this picture along to a much better end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all.","review":"Minds numbing adaptation to the John Grisham novel lacks his artistic punch and flare for justice and replaces it with a typical Hollywood movie that caters to speculation other than fact. The script has too many holes to be considered a passable story, and while the direction is decent, it lacks a real sense of depth. The acting on the other hand is good with Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman making this film much better than it deserved to be with their very good performances, and Dustin Hoffman is fine as well but he's not in the movie as much. John Cusack is decent and the rest of the cast makes due but the movie does not do them or the viewer any justice in terms of storytelling.Thanks to Weisz, Hackman, and Hoffman, the movie makes a fine rental, but its only good for a few good moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda You Pay $ for","review":"I was tricked into seeing this at the theater.

Although John Cusack, Gene Hackman, and Dustin Hoffman turn in great performances, the movie falls on its face. Any soundtrack seems non-existent. There is not much suspense. Cusack's girlfriend, the main female character, is completely cold and unsympathetic. She does not have an ounce of warmth in her body. And she is supposed to be someone you root for through the whole film. I wanted her to get her comeuppance, but unfortunately she did not. The movie ended up being a preachy film about gun control.The opening sequence is one of the best I have ever seen. If only the rest of the movie was as good as the first five minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runaway Hit!!","review":"This was a great thriller, with just enough suspense, romance, violence, and plot-twisting.

It isn't a \\"keep you on the edge of your seat\\" kind of movie, but it is exciting enough to keep you interested. By switching the legal assult against the Tobacco industry, as it is in the book, they have changed the focus to the gun manufacturers. With the boiling issues on gun control, this movie couldn't come at a better time. What it lacks in plot it makes up for in star power. You have Gene Hackman playing the notorious guy everyone wants to hate, and the mild mannered, idealistic counter-part played by Dustin Hoffman. These two charaters are a great contrast to each other and add enough to the movie to make you want to see it. Then you add John Cusack and Rachel Weisz, playing both sides, makes it more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is great.","review":"Suspense, action, and romance, you have to watch this movie twice to understand every bit of it.

The film is set in New Orleans and centers around jury tampering in a potentially landmark case about gun makers responsibility to victims of gun violence. The film has a nice premise and nice plot twist at the end, but overall the film seems pasted together. The performances by the stars Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, John Cusack & Rachel Weisz aren't bad, in fact all are quite competant. It's just that they lack any real feeling, sort of like going through the motions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific sound quality","review":"Incredible artistry, but the sound of Dexter Gordon's tenor saxophone is captured so awfully that it sounds like a buzzing cell phone.

Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. Many details in the story, including Dillon's looks, (He's white blonde with hard, clear eyes, not dark haired! And he's short, too!) the heroine's character, and the eventual outcome were completely ignored. And I'm sorry, but that submarine looked really crappy. This is one of my favorite Higgins books, and I can't believe they slaughtered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short!","review":"I have to say, I am a big Jack Higgins fan but hadn't read this book and foolishly bought the DVD first. I doubt now whether I will bother with the book. Having seen \\"The Eagle has Landed\\" in the cinema years ago I assumed this would be another cracker - how wrong I was, as from beginning to end it was truly awful.

But if you are looking for something new and refreshing about an unusual theme, you might well be disappointed. Smalley and Trent have taken what could have been an extremely dynamic topic and melded it around their common themes of family and relationships. The end product - full of their usual case studies - has little in common with the scripture references foundational to the book: the Blessings as seen in the Old Testament, with special emphasis on the patriarchal blessings found in Genesis. Specifically, they have taken what was meant to be a unique event in one's life and turned it into everyday occurrances through touch; spoken, meaningful words; and parents' commitment to see blessings through in their children's lives. Of course, these are important elements of relational life, but the Old Testament Blessing is so much more. Unfortunately, this time around, Smalley and Trent missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 x 5 inch recipe card protectors","review":"I did not like it because it looks cheap and it is too big size for my smallest recipe card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick up \\"Night Ranger's Greatest Hits\\" instead","review":"This CD and the one entitled\\" Night Ranger's Greatest Hits are almost identical, but are different in this way:\\"Best\\" contains \\"I Did It For Love\\". \\"Greatest\\" contains, instead, \\"Rumours In The Air\\" and \\"Restless Kind\\".

Good manners and self-respect never go out of style! And for the record, some of us who are older, can re-aqauaint ourselves with the principles.

What it really is is the original Family Prodcutions 1971 release. Someone came up with the bright idea of digging up an old record, dusting it off, and transfering it to CD. Obviously, someone was leaning on the turntable slightly to slow down the record in order to \\"fix\\" Billy's chipmunked voice. These are not the master tapes whatsoever. You are better off hitting an old record store that stocks vinyl and finding an original copy of the 1971 album that proved to be a disaster event for its composer. True, the album was edited and cleaned up when acquired by Columbia records and subsequently rereleased, but some things were changed. \\"She's Got a Way\\" had a drum track, \\"You Can Make Me Free\\" was twice as long, consisting of a guitar jam, and \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" used to sound more like its SONGS IN THE ATTIC counterpart. The rest of the tracks are exactly identical to those currently available. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"They got it wrong, again!! For Billy Joel completists only.","review":"While I'm very happy that most of the old Billy Joel stuff has finally been released onto CD's, this is a rather below-average product. The biggest problem is that the pitch issue has -not- been corrected; whereas the original error had the album mastered too fast, this release is too slow. I don't understand why this has been a problem given the abundance of correctly-pitched takes of songs like \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" and \\"She's Got A Way,\\" it should be as simple as putting on Songs in the Attic and using that as the tape speed reference. As far as I know, the first chord of \\"She's got a Way\\" is G when he plays it live. To this product's credit, it is very interesting to hear the extended takes of some of these tracks. If you're a die-hard fan and/or piano player that loves Billy Joel, and you can get past the low-fi recording quality of this release, you'll probably dig it. You can usually find a good used version of it super-cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Collection complete, but will you listen more than once?","review":"I jumped at the chance to listen to Cold Spring Harbor at the correct speed.

The Harbor Sessions was really tough on my Billy Joel-loving ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very beautiful faerie barbie","review":"I bought this Barbie when it first came out.

This Lone Hill Jazz import CD -- \\"The Billy Taylor Trio with Ed Thigpen & Earl May\\" -- is another of my Berkshire Record Outlet discount discoveries. It features twelve tracks made over four recording dates in late 1957, with eight of the tunes originally issued as \\"The New Billy Taylor Trio\\" on ABC Paramount. There is nothing earthshaking here, mostly standards with a few originals mixed in -- just another solid piano trio session from the man with those trademark glasses. This \\"new\\" trio would be short lived though, as drummer Thigpen's next gig would be to join a trio which would become famous, that of Oscar Peterson. Don't pay big bucks for Billy, but if you can find it cheap like I did, then this disc's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't put it together yourself","review":"I agree with the other reviews.

It was the band at it's best configuration. By far this was the best thematic compostions of any of Brand-X's releases. There is one song in particular that joins the two albums; The 'Take Off' theme that echoes throughout the album finds an eerie echo in themes heard in '...maybe I'll lend you mine afterall' from Morrocan Roll. Overall the songs on this album (Marscape) were the best of the writing team of Lancaster/Lumley. Beautiful layered guitars over acoustic piano and synths and Lancaster's haunting sax. The wonderful percussive style of Phil Collins before he sold out and one of the finest underrated bass players of all time Percy Jones.

Not that I don't enjoy Daniela. Any fan of Brazilian music should have a couple of her CDs to truly appreciate the range of sounds coming out of that so very musical country. Daniela has it totally down in terms of the very slick but still very tasteful commercial sound. More power to her, but let's get back to her sister. Vania's voice has a richer timbre than Daniela's and her delivery more controlled, more low-key. (I agree again with the reviewer below in preferring her voice to Marisa Monte's....) Vania's is the sort of hip music that you put on when you have real musiclovers over for dinner. The songs here are great and well-arranged. It would be interesting to hear the two sisters sing together, but the choice of song and arrangement would be crucial to avoid any elements of gimmickry. Check out Vania, music fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ibuprofen Works","review":"My life before Ibuprofen was rough. I was in the medical field, driving each day, working a different shift(s) each day, and on some days working 16-18 hours on little sleep. Headaches plagued me, along with sore muscles and a sore neck from having a hand always on the steering wheel.Ibuprofen saved my life. There is no other pain reliever that cures my headaches within 30 minutes like Ibuprofen does. When I pop 2 Ibuprofens, I know with confidence that my headache will be gone in 20-30 minutes. And it works 99.9% of the time.Ibuprofen cures stress headaches, sinus headaches, caffeine headaches, headaches from little sleep, and headaches from too much intense work. The only thing Ibuprofen doesn't handle as well as I'd like is muscle aches. Despite this drawback, Ibuprofen is the best in my book. I always keep a bottle with me in my car, at work, and where ever I go.If you haven't tried Ibuprofen, you need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and very slow going","review":"A psychological study, rather than a whodunit, this book was on my \\"most wanted\\" list for years due to its reputation.

In addition, he seems to play everything in straight time. No rubato, none!

For the Nocturnes - Moravec or Pires, and for the Etudes - Lortie or Wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This was a technically accurate performance but boring. It failed to move me.

If you compare Li's Sonata No.3 op.58 with that played by Kissin, you will find that Li is more expressive, more emotional and has got more dynamism also. Li had interpreted Andante spianato & Grande Polonaise op. 22 in a most natural way. I haven't heard any other pianist playing this peice in such a natural way. His Fantaisie Impromptu op. 66 is simply fabulous. Not only had Li played this piece with impeccable technique, he had injected in it great imagination and passion too. While he played Etude op. 25 no.11 with equal virtuosity as Pollini, he is not clinical like Pollini.Li has got not only extraordinary musicality, he has got virtuosity as well. Yundi Li is really a pianist to watch out for as it is really not easy to find one possessing both such qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This is perhaps the most important Islamic book that has been translated into English."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY poorly made!!","review":"I was very excited to receive this item, but when I did I was extremely disappointed.

The overall body stocking wasnt made with enough lace to stretch comfortably around her body and she could barely get the thing on. It has nothing to do with the leg position, but more along the lines of the torso/mid section of the body stocking being so short.

On the contrary, it's a very sweet story about a horse that wasn't as 'beautiful' as the others in the Irish farm where he's growing up; much like the Ugly Duckling. Dandelion's (the horse) unbreakable spirit and his discovery that his thoughts have the power to lead him to wherever he wishes to go in life enable him to eventually find his place in the world. And though sometimes hard to maintain, his faith in that 'something' grand is awaiting him keeps him going even during the toughest of times. The ending was so moving I couldn't stop the tears ... poignant & inspiring! I read it over 4 years ago and I still think of Dandelion sometimes when I might need a little inspiration.

It takes some practice, but this model works just as well as any other inexpensive model I have tried. Listening for the fetal heartbeat is more a matter of learning to feel the vibration than actually hearing the sounds, which is why using the headrest improves your ability to hear. Also, you can cut the tubing to shorten it, and this improves the sound as well. The less distance the sound has to travel, the louder it will be.

When we mentioned it to our OB at our next appointment he told us that anything at this price isn't going to work well. The fetal stethoscopes that doctors in his office use are about $300 & that's what is needed to get the sensitivity to pick up the heartbeat.

You can also set it so that the computer turns the printer on and off when it needs to rather than just leaving it on all the time. Having two paper trays is another useful feature.I bought some of the generic cartridges from ebay (note: voids warranty) and they seemed to print ok for emails and such but not so good for photos. I switched back to the OE cartridges after they were used up and can't get rid of the white steaks in the blue. So it seems that a new printer head is needed (will buy a new printer because it comes w/ ink & warranty).The printer makes great photos just don't buy generic cartridges (didn't work for me at least)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink made of gold","review":"We all know that the printer business model is all about the ink - they sell the printer for a loss and make it up on replacement inks. All well and good, but there is a tolerance level for this pricing model that I feel Canon has crossed over. I think I paid about $100 for the printer to get marginally better photo printing quality vs. my old Epson. But then I discovered that it uses ink like an Eldorado uses gasoline. There are 5 cartridges (2 blacks) - about $17 for just one color, and they need replacement every 3 months. You can do the math. Not only is the cost way beyond reasonable, but it's inconvenient to have to buy ink so frequently. Unless you need a desktop printer exclusively for photo printing, leave this Canon on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great desktop printer.","review":"This is a fabulous color photo printer at a great price. I have one at home and one at work and I couldn't be happier. I used to buy only Epson photo printers, but their quality seems to have declined in recent years. After a brief warmup, this printer is fast! And the color quality is excellent. The multiple ink cartridges can be a bit of a pain (2 separate black cartridges!), but it's worth it when you see the printed result. This printer even does a good job with the cheaper photo papers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Pixma ip4200 does the job","review":"Bought this photo printer to replace an HP Photosmart 7680 that had been in use one year. The HP did a poor job of adjusting color, even with HP inks. And of course, HP ink is more expensive than Canon or Epson.The Canon ip4200 won me over quickly. It does an excellent job. I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"This printer is driving me up the walls. You can buy and install generic ink, but it won't work as it does not have the chips. I tried everything i can find online regarding resetting the printer. Nothing worked. Finally i took out the generic ones, leaving only the Canon black ink (which is full) and it still won't work. I called tech support, only to find that you need all 5 ink tanks in for it to work, otherwise it will damage the print head. All i want is to print black and white copies!!! THe color ink costs about $45. Almost the same price as the printer when on sale. I'd suggest getting a different printer. Read up on the consumer guide or maybe check out that kodak printer that was on the Apprentice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful little printer.","review":"Disregard comments from reviewers who say you can't buy ink refill kits or individual ink cartridges for this printer - you can.So far, this is the best printer I have ever owned.

Canons are notorious for clogging when much less expensive non-Canon replacement inks are used, and Canon has other little tricks such as including chips on the ink cartridges so that a half-full non-Canon replacement cartridge may register as empty. I have years of experience with Canons, including the IP4200; I'm tired of these tricks--it's Epson or HP from now on for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reliability","review":"My administrative assistant picked this up for me for use at work. The first one never accepted or recognized the ink cartridges, so it got sent back. The second one started out OK, with nice photo prints, etc. However, it started skipping a line on most prints, and it began periodically giving an error message and locking up in mid-print. It got so bad that I would have the error once a day, at least, and I took to simply sending my prints to a community print/copier.After having the marginally functional printer on my desk for a few weeks, I decided that I will no longer use a Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"Prints beautifully when it's working, which is rare. This printer has a software interface with the computer that is designed to monitor ink tank levels, etc. This software is constantly telling you that there is something wrong with the ink cartridges when there is not, even with brand new cartridges. The software is constantly in your face, basically compelling you to go buy some more ink cartridges (which are exorbitantly priced). You cannot circumvent the software and will find yourself in a situation where you desperately need to print something and the Canon Corporation demands that you go and buy some ink cartridges when in fact there is nothing wrong with the ones you have. Overall, this printer is a piece of crap. I'm about to go out and run over mine with an automobile tire. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Printer","review":"There is a reason this printer is so cheap. it's unreliable. paper gets stuck and you can pull it out, but the driver still registers it as being stuck, so you have to go through five or six procedures (30 minutes) to fix it. Cartridges are really expensive and they designed the cartridge so you can't get imitation. They have found a way around that, but I will never buy a canon printer. This one was free with my mac, but it has still more hassle than it is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor photo printing","review":"I have owned Canon products for years. I have bought 5 DSLR cameras (sold 2 after about a year) and found them to be excellent. Now I know that this is an inexpensive consumer color printer but the photo quality is just poor. There is no nice way to put it. The skin tones appear washed out, in fact, all colors appear to be washed out. I'm using Canon paper and I've calibrated my monitor. I guess you get what you pay for but I really expected higher quality from Canon. Color documents are fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pixma iP4200 printer","review":"This inexpensive printer has been great so far.

It prints slowly, and the ink runs out very quickly and is expensive. If you are only printing photographs it might be great, but as a general printer I printed less than 100 pages and the ink cartridge ran out. Also, if there is a problem with the printing, the troubleshooting sucks large amounts of ink out of the cartridges. When I first received this printer I had to call their customer service three times and have them send me replacement parts. They were very pleasant and helpful, but it was frustrating since waiting for the new parts took more than two weeks (where I was without a printer). Also, the troubleshooting that they walked me through took up TWO cartridges of black ink. Again, this review is for those people looking for a fast, economical printer for documents. This is not that printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but slow","review":"I like this printer - small footprint on my desk, quiet operation, nice print quality. But, it's s l o w. Prints fast enough once the actual printing starts, but it seems to take forever for the thing to start to print. So, if you print lots of individual items throughout the day, you might get a little frustrated with this one. Overall, however, I would recommend this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Every 2nd or 3rd print this printer tells me I am out of black in ink when I am not.

My old Lexmark $50. basic inkjet printer could not do 1/10th of this printers functions - BUT IT ALWAYS WORKED! - I have a tech support backround and have tried everything, including reading the manual & online documentation.

Each ink cartridge have a computer chip that it will not allow refilling of the tank or use of any non-Canon brand ink cartridge.Overall a great printer, but if you do not feel like buying only Canon brand ink cartridges, you might want to look into higher end Canon printer that does not require the same ink cartridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this printer","review":"It's only a year old, I bought new cartridges and I still have no red ink printing.

My gripe is with the cost to replace the cartridges. You can buy generics, but they don't have the chips to make them work. You have to remove the ones from the original Canon cartridges. Believe me, this is not an easy task. I tried it and was unable to fasten the chip so it would stay on the cartridges. I tried refilling the cartridges myself, but what a mess. If you plan to print photos you should probably stay with Canon cartridges.

It has worked very well but for two minor issues.1. In the month that I've used it (~250 printed pages), it has twice fed two sheets of paper at the same time. Both times the second sheet was offset 1-2 inches from the first causing the printing to be cut across the two sheets. But to the printers credit, one of those times I was printing duplex and although I had to re-print it, the duplexer handled the problem without getting into paper jam.2. When printing duplex, I could print a single copy without any special adjustments. However when I tried to print multiple copies (of a single, two-sided page), I got an error message saying that the image exceeded paper size. After a frustrating attempt to use the Canon web-site, I got a Google hit (to somewhere, I don't remember) to turn on \\"fit-to-page\\". But only for multiple copies. A single copy of the exact same document didn't need this option."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Priced Canon Ink Cartridges","review":"I never would have bought this Canon model had I done some research. There is nothing wrong with the unit itself, but be aware you will be locked into buying Canon replacement cartridges at about $15 a pop and there are five of them.

Canon support simply said to plug it into the computer USB - which is not an option when all I have is laptops that are mobile.

This may not matter for many people, but I hate MS Office, and still use Word 5.1a as my main word processor!Text printing using OS X was decent, but noticeably less sharp on plain paper than my 5-year old Lexmark Z42 -- there is significantly more bleeding. This could be improved by choosing 'grey scale' and reducing intensity to about -20. It could be improved further by choosing the maximum 'Fine' setting, but this caused an extraordinary increase in print time. Text printing could probably also be improved by experimenting with other plain papers or using 'high resolution' paper.I did not print any photos, so can't comment on photo quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE-DO NOT BUY. INK IS A TOTAL RIP OFF!","review":"I loved this printer until one of the color inks ran empty. Then it refused to print until I replaced the low cartridge.

It turns out that I had to buy a whole set of cartridges, at over $80. I couldn't buy just the one I needed. I had visions of myself spending $80 every time just one color emptied, as I collected a whole shelf full of colors I didn't need. I couldn't believe it, so checked other stores, and they were all the same.

Keeping in mind that it was originally published in 1901 (thus written in 1899/1900) the way things are written are a bit on the bland side, and takes some getting used to. Also, the preface would give one the impression that the author doesn't believe in the Magical arts, nor did he appear to think to fondly of the Ancient Egyptians and their \\"obscure beliefs.\\" This bothered me at first, but I must say that if he truly has such a biased, it did not stop him from writing a thorough, well documented account and record of the Egyptian Magical beliefs. He provides direct quotes from true historical documents and writings (including those within the sacred tombs) in a clear and seemingly unbiased way.

It flashes from a few pictures of fans holding tickets to pictures of fans holding tickets. There are interviews with various people from the Vancouver music scene.There is no music from or interviews with the band.

I enjoyed it for that aspect. However the \\"magnificant obsession\\" turns a Christian concept into a new age philosophy. Don't be fooled. This is definetly an anti-Christian book. The concept is that in order to gain power in ones personality one must do good deeds towards fellow man and demand that the recipient tell no one about the \\"gift.\\" That's fine. However, the book refers to a Higher Personality rather than God, and Jesus as \\"The Galilean\\" represented as some some of genius, not God incarnate. There are many other aspects that closely resemble the occult. This suprised me frankly as I loved the movie. If you are well grounded spiritually and wish to overlook these aspects, enjoy the book. But be careful not to buy into the philosophy/religion that is suggested by the author. Strange writing coming from the author of \\"the Robe.\\" (However, I haven't read that yet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than magnificient.","review":"I found Magnificent Obsession a disappointment.

It was about the change in a man's character as he he felt a compulsion to be kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this one.","review":"Based on others' reviews, my expectation was that this book would fan the flame of my desire for Jesus. Turns out it's not terribly biblical. It borrows a few isolated ideas from Jesus's teachings, but it doesn't promote the gospel. It purports to discuss a life-changing, amazing philosophy, but the philosophy pales in comparison to the truth. Sure, it's nice and all to philanthropize without getting recognition for it, but that's _not_ what fulfills you in the long run. _MO_ discusses this concept of the Major Personality (who is supposed to be God), but doesn't acknowledge it as God, and doesn't recognize that Jesus is God in the flesh. Even the reverend who plays a part in Bobby Merrick's life toward the end of the novel fails to acknowledge the truth of the Bible.

It is not a great composition in the literary sense. One doesn't read it with the thrill of experiencing dazzling artistry of words.

The most profound triumph is over self. This book explores the topic with dazzling brilliance.Timeless, moving, and inspirational, this book is one you are sure to never, ever forget. It will stay with me until I die, and I can only hope to be half the man the protagonist is. I would loved to have met the author - he must have been extraordinary.

Brian Setzer easily makes any serious top 100 guitarists of all time list. This album is too cool, it's a keeper and I give it a four out of five. The song, 'Rumble in Brighton' off of this album deserves a ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"The House Is Rockin'","review":"Even when he's swingin' he's rockin' too. This is Brian Setzer Orchestra's second album. The House Is Rockin' is absolutely not a swing title, but it's great rock 'n' roll with horns arrangement and one helluva opening title. There is a cover of Stray Cats' song (Rumble In Brighton) and (Every Time I Hear) That Mellow Saxophone. Gene Pitney's Town Without Pity is great. With a little help from his friend, joe Strummer (ex. The Clash) he wrote Ghost Radio and Sammy Davis City (which is probably the best title on album). My Baby Only Cares for Me and The Man With the Magic Touch are great swingin' titles.

I also read a lot of cookbooks -- I check out the majority of new ones from the library -- but I buy very few. This one is on my shelf, though. There are excellent, easy recipes for Shrimp and Pasta, Chicken Lasagna Florentine, and Lemon Vermicelli, which are the three that led me to buy the book. Even the Turkey-Noodle-Poppy Seed Casserole was quite good. The few to be avoided in this collection include those involving mustard or collard greens with pasta -- that's just my taste -- and the several kinds of fish lasagna, which is plain weird, but most of the approx. 175 are winners. There are also many color photos, which I always appreciate in a cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"FULL BODY SCREEN Protector for Nano","review":"Advertising is misleading.

However, if you know me, you recognize that I like variety. Recently, I came off a cycle of listening to Juan D'Arienzo, Carlos DiSarli, Francisco Canaro, and Orquesta Tipica Victor. It was time for a change, yet I was not ready to listen to \\"La Revancha del Tango.\\" I needed something a little different, yet something that is suitable for dancing.My choice of Donato Raciatti was in response to a recommendation of Joseph Bain of Montreal in the Tango DJ's Forum. Raciatti was right on the money. An excellent purchase for me. I had gotten value for my money. You will find it similar to D'Arienzo and Biaggi -- and I think you will like it as much as I do. This is especially recommended for the milonguero style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal Scholarly Overview","review":"I really enjoyed how this book looked very practically at the arts and the evolution of them within the church. It gives not only a historical requirement to continue to press for more artistic use and involvement in the modern movement of the church, but also gives practical ways in which to do so.

The first film I ran here as a projectionist was Everest. Watching the film over and over again (probably up to 200 times in its showing), I grew tired with the dialogue and even some of the imagery (since I had to watch for rips, burns, tears, and scratches). However, I loved the soundtrack to Everest. It's a must-have for anyone who loves soundtrack adventure scores."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite soundtrack of all time","review":"I first heard the Everest sountrack during the IMAX film. I wasn't even aware a soundtrack had been released until I stumbled across it at a book and music store. Naturally, I snapped it right up. The music is both hauntingly soothing and uplifting. My favorite track is Track 7: The Spirit Returns, which characterizes the entire score. I personally could live without the inclusion of George Harrison's music, but is aptly applied in the film, and integrates well into the entire score. If you like Everest, also check out Journey into Amazing Caves, another IMAX score by Wood and May, featuring music by the Moody Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice music, but where's George?","review":"As the soundtrack to an IMAX film of the scaling of the world's tallest summit, this is a fine album, full of stirring themes, mystic teases, and some well-known tunes. The biggest flaw is that the cover advertises George Harrison's name in big letters, but it contains no actual music performed by George. Orchestral revamping of material like \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" is okay, but if you're looking for any new material from Mr. Harrison (such as SUNG by him), you're out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mood Music","review":"Well, I never thought I would like anything that resembles Classical, but this CD is great. After seing the IMAX production of \\"Everest\\" , which I recommend, I had to buy this Soundtrack. These selections relax me after a hard day's work.

The new rendition of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is also very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soaring music with one notable crevasse","review":"I saw this film when it came out and excitedly bought the soundtrack at the nearby gift shop. The music is great, but the real selling point for me was the final rendition of 'Here Comes the Sun' in the movie. Alas, this version - with new vocals by George Harrison - was not included on the soundtrack. How disappointing!If you haven't seen the film you won't miss it, but if you have it's kind of obvious.

I thought this book would be a sequel to Johnson's FEM for PDEs, but instead we get this very long development of FEM for ODEs.I would recommend that you save a lot of money and buy Johnson's FEM for PDEs book instead.

Everything that Dannion had said came true. he was right about demoralized countries, strife and hatred in the holy lands, nuclear destruction, enviromental religion, China and Russia battling, economic earthquakes and desert storm, technology of the new age and viruses, and biological warfare.Dannion became a very spiritual person after meeting with the Higher Beings. He had a mission in life, and his mission in life was to make spiritual centers for people around the world. This was the best book i've ever read and i do not normally read.

His supposed revelations are pure nonsense. What a joke! I really like the NDE subject. I do believe that life continues after physical death (on the other side) but it is not the nonsense that Brinkely came up with in his book.

I do NOT believe his story. It seems very made up and full of lies. Not to mention its a very boring read. Just a very silly story that will leave you shaking your head and throwing the book away before you finish it.

This book highlights the transformation that occurs at true NDEs. The psychic phenomena that often accompanies experiencers is shown clearly here, with Dannion's ability to read minds and give prophecy. I think this book together with Psychic Gifts Tools to Connect by Tiffany Snow make some of the best reading on transformation from NDEs that I have ever read. Both also highlight how the choices we make here in our lives ripple on through to our death experience, something I also experienced at my NDE eight years ago. We all have much to gain from reading these accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"It is unfortunate that I had to give this item even 1 star.

Go to Walmart and you will get something better and not have to pay to get it shipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body and the Book Writing from a Mennonite Life","review":"Another book written to cash in on the believing ancestors of the author. Good for the rubber- neckers who want to read the stories of her childhood, even better for those who have no reference point to Mennonite life. I think the only honest things the author said were, one, her family is not impressed with her using them for the enterprise and two, that she is an Episcopalian and not Mennonite. I think the title is meant to capture a larger Mennonite audience that will be sorely disappointed in the work. I gave up reading it around the third chapter, as the book rambles too much and doesn't appear to have much of a point to it. I didn't want to give up reading The Body, I feel that anyone who I review deserves to have the entire book read, but I also inter-library loaned \\"What Are Mennonites Thinking About? 1998\\" and that fully captured my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE LITTLE TREASURE","review":"ONCE THE CRISIS HAS ERUPTED IN 2008, FDR POLICIES ARE ONCE AGAIN ON THE TABLE WITH LIFE OF ITS OWN...!!!

By the time I was done reading the book for the first time, I was in tears thinking about all that history beeing scrapped. The Constitution sunk one ship, The Enterprise kept a nation afloat.

However the refurbished kit came with the EB1812 batteries, which are only 1.2Ah and the charger that came with it will only charge them, not the other 18v batteries Hitachi sells. The picture Amazon has with this item clearly shows the 2.0Ah batteries (you can tell by the blue tabs, the 3.0Ah are yellow and the 1.2Ah are all black) While it is a good drill and flashlight, I bought this kit at this price primarily to get a couple more batteries and a back-up charger. You are better off getting the kit new with the better batteries. Better still, get the kit that comes with the 3.0Ah batteries, a reciprocal saw and a circular saw. I will probably be making Amazon take this back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mismatched excerpts","review":"I called up A Time To Remember: Original Chart Hits [1950 Original Chart Hits] and when I called up \\"Home Cooking\\" and \\"June Is Busting Out All Over\\" for samples I got Hank Williams Sr. doing a couple of his big hits.

I thought I was receiving something special as the price was $59.10. When the puzzle book arrived it was nothing more than a small paperpack with the manufacturer's price of $6.95. (I've since found it elsewhere for $10.00 which included shipping) Then I thought how could he charge me over $50.00 more for a $6.95 paperback? I was extremely angry and appaled and proceeded to contact this seller and his reply was \\"ok ship it back at your expense and I charge a 20% restock fee\\". This guy is a real jerk and a horrible business person. There are other reviews listed here of other people he has duped. DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THIS CROOK ! ! ! !

The eternal internal monologues were drudgery. A lot of it was down right corny. It was hard for me to believe that an upper-middle-class, educated, married couple would act the way the protagonists did. Didn't seem real to me. April Simpson maybe, Bobby and his wife, no. Some reviewers said this book was gripping, and moved fast. The only place it moved fast was at the end. I hope Gilstrap rediscovers his storytelling ability in time for his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already!","review":"The idea behind this book is a good one, and if it had been properly handled it would have carried it off. Unfortunately, it wasn't properly handled. There was so much going on with this book it was hard to keep the bad guys straight. Why would two normal people keep a found child that doens't belong to them, and from where did the \\"madness\\" come that made Susan think it was her lost baby? Why did Bobby go along with it? There are more quetions left unanwered than what was answered. For example, Samuel apparently goes through a metamorphisis where he becomes angry and wants to kill the people that killed his brother, and then he totally forgets this and lets them go while he goes after the child. Then he feels protection for the child and gets hurt because of it. I could go on, but that would give the whole book away so will stop. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"Being a fan of the Jonathan Grave series, I was wondering what to expect from this novel. Sadly I was very disappointed. The characters were rather one-dimensional and I really didn't buy the plot. Large parts of the descriptions were rather boring to me, and I kept thinking: Get to the point!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Problems... All in All a Good Read","review":"Gilstrap has once again amazed me with his powerful \\"family on the run\\"-type writing style. \\"Even Steven\\" is, overall, a good book. It doesn't quite live up to \\"At All Costs,\\" and is no where near as compelling as \\"Nathan's Run,\\" but not all books can be classics. Gilstraps offers situations that everyone can relate to. A mother in fear of losing a child, a father trying to keep control over his family, an older brother stuck caring for his younger sibling, and a younger brother unable to shed the annoyance of having his older brother watching his every move. Gilstrap's main lacking point is the way he caries out his plot. Sometimes it seems as though he were looking for the easy way out, and didn't take the time to make the stroy beleivable. I would consider this a bedside book. Don't be surprised if it doesn't turn out to be an instant classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of action but little else","review":"If you like melodrama - lots of action, a few decent characters, but others totally unrealistic, then you'll like this book. I enjoy a well-placed 4-letter word as much as most readers, but Gilstrap goes overboard here, even with the characters most likely not to be shouting invectives at each other and in descriptive narrative of the weather. Though fast moving, it's also repetitive. This is my first Gilstrap, so if he's still getting \\"better and better\\", I think I'll wait a few more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality","review":"This movie is so poorly produced that most of the scenes are so dark and underlit that it is a chore just to watch the video. Also, the sound is so poorly recorded that there is crackling noise in the audio and the actor's voices are annoyingly loud and distorted at times, and yet also too soft and too far in the background in certain passages to understand what is being said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but just plain bad","review":"This is yet another bad ghetto blaxploitation film from the folks at York Entertainment, whose motto seems to be: if it's negative, drug-infested stereotypes about African Americans in the hood, we'll sell it. And here we go again...The sound on this DVD is so bad, its hard to understand anyone. The images ae so dark, it's hard to see anyone. After 30 minutes, I turned it off because it was too hard to watch.To buy this film is only to encourage them to make more of this ghetto/hood nonsense. Just say no and hopefully they will go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating subject - poorly executed","review":"The book describes a fascinating subject and delivers a lot of useful historical information. So, for those interested in the topic it provides specific data. As the work of literature, though, it falls short of a good read. It feels that the author would do much better writing this story as a non-fiction. Her factual passages are closer to the expected stile of non-fiction than the fictional passages are to what is expected of a good read. The work also contains a number of proofreading problems. And closer to the end of the book, when the heroine enters Russia, there are glaring mistakes in treating the country's geography and populations spread, such Odessa being north of Kiev (it is south of Kiev) and Ukrainian peasants performing for the Madame in the middle of Russia proper. Whether these are the only mistakes of such nature in the book or not is hard to judge, but they do raise an issue with the accuracy of other information."},{"rating":"1","title":"keys wanabe","review":"It's not even a standard Peter Graves 50's B movie .

As modern technology improves, more ways are being discovered to save soil, right social wrongs, and preserve more of the planet.

It is an amazing resource of je accuse rhetoric, stream-of-consciousness anecdotes, and endless encyclopedia of pejorative adjectives and adverbs. There is no good news in this book, it is filled with hate and loathing, it is anti-American and anti-humanity. On and on it goes breathlessly denigrating every industrial and social accomplishment since the Enlightment. Taking the view that environmentalism is a religious movement, Good news for a change, can be regarded as canonical testament.Don't expect a lot of support for any statement in this book.

It appears to be made out of solid materials, and the instructions were fairly clear. It took me maybe an hour from start to finish to install it. The only limitation (which is probably the same with all these mounts) is that the mount must be attached to at least 2 studs, and although it says it slides up to 8 inches left to right, that depends on the size of the tv (the larger the tv, the less latitude). Therefore, you may not be able to place it exactly where you want it, left to right. the instructions are not very clear on whether or not you can mount the frame using the far left or far right bolt-holes, but I didn't feel comfortable putting all the weight on one side of the frame, and so I centered the frame over the studs. That said, it's a much better deal than the one made by Panasonic which sells for a ridiculous price, and probably performs no better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mount","review":"This mount really was very easy to install. It fit my LG 37 LCD, no problem. The built-in bubble level makes it easy to know whether it's straight - nice feature!

Some of the themes he portrays include: St. Lucia celebrations, scenes of Older Sister brushing Little Sister's hair, children apple picking, fishing, skinny dipping, picnicking.

I won't even mention the grammar errors throughout the book. So how is this mess ever getting recommended?

Trying to picture the impressive home ,described as a Mayan temple, along the shoreline and the action taking place within it only added to the intrigue of the book. I could picture the main characters as their fate was unfolding on the beach before me as well as at Coba and Chichen Itza. There a lot of plot twists making it difficult to try to figure out who is a good guy and who is not...even with the main characters..right until the end!

In order to shred a standard piece of paper, you must fold the pages in half, and you can only shred seven pages at a time.The credit card shredding is about the same as paper, but since cutting credit cards up with scissors is even less effective, this is a good choice for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"And they said Clapton was God?","review":"Everything said in these reviews is absolutely true.

My favorite band at that time was the Allman Bros and a much as I like the Bros, TYA was the best live show I saw. Literally crawled out of the Paramount totally drained. My friend 'Wilfred the Hunter' and I gloated for months over our non-hacker friends who did not go because TYA was not a \\"big name band\\".

Whoa, what a disappointment!

Additionally, the game ran very roughly on my computers (new one, well within the min. req)and failed to keep my interest. Did finish it, though-- in only a few hours.

Like any good sub-genre, this style is exactly as it implies, fusing steady techno rhythms with the soul and accessibility of house. Listener newbies may find this splash of color to steel techno beats, and preference to rhythm over house banging, a welcome middle ground to explore.Architecture flows seamlessly through pieces of dub and deep-end, and in typical techno form forgoes lyrics - replaced effectively with a stream of soundbites, dialogue, and radio transmissions. In fact, an hour of this may be too smooth for some listeners, with tracks selected best for the blend and not an emotional charge. Those looking for a tireless ride on rhythm, however, may have found their answer.

I actually had to force myself to finish it. The main character (Ned) in this book seemed to experience everything.. he was frends with Harvey Milk, he was in riots, friends with a porn star, went to the first Beetles concert, saw Sylvester in concert, he was in Vietnam, etc, etc, etc. Somehow he was every gay event except Studio 54! It was written terribly, plots were totally contrived and loosely thrown together. Every time the character moved his residence, I had to think of what gay event the author wanted to cram in the storyline and pretend his character participated. No true feeling to the book, I couldn't identify with the main character... I can't believe anyone liked this book!Terrible, just terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diary","review":"I didn't find anything really original in the book, it dealt a lot with AIDS and Vietnam.

It was good, but pretty AIDS-heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Great for Younger Generation to Read","review":"I enjoyed this book and looked forward to getting back to it before bed each night. Each section is full of interesting historic insights that should be a must read for the younger generation, especially those that deal with the reality of AIDS in the 80s and the devestation it bought on the gay community. Other areas of interest were the Harvey Milk assasination and Vietnam. While this book cover's a gay man's coming of age and his life journey the historic fabric is what I found to be of most interest. It is easy to forget the past and I think it is vital for the younger generation to learn the struggles of the brave members of generations past that have made being a Gay American, a better place for all. We still have a long way to go but the last 30 years have bought about sweeping changes. Enjoy the book, it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Circle","review":"When a story hits home, then that's the making of great literature.

AS Archibald takes over to add a highbrow attitude to the show we find the play Omlet featuring my favorites: THE GOURDS! It is way funny! Then the lost Goilbert and Sullivan operetta LYLE THE KINDLY VIKING is discovered. Another halarious romp. This is the first Veggie DVD and it is a nice attempt.

The problem is the script, which combines poor plot structure with leaden social commentary.

And their copy was just over an hour. The Sci Fi takes a back seat here. It is really more of a police drama. The acting was rather good.

If you are contemplating buying it...don't wait anymore...you MUST get it! In the brief time I spoke with Darryl and the stage presence he carries with him (he is so funny!)...I have grown to think Darryl is just a real sweetheart of a man...a real person who is not afraid to let you get to know the real man behind the music.

To be honest, after its initial play, I was rather ambivalent about this CD...a little too country for me. Then, I listened again....and again....and again...and again....These are great songs! And how can you not like someone who makes the effort to thank so many people who have believed in him, that it takes up an entire page of the CD insert, with the tiniest print?! Darryl Worley co-wrote 10 of the 12 songs on this CD; very admirable, indeed. My four favorites? \\"A Good Day to Run\\" (a great \\"first thing in the morning\\" song), \\"Hard Rain Don't Last\\", \\"Second Wind\\" (which makes me want to take the next jet south to the Gulf of Mexico and sit at the water's edge), and \\"When You Need My Love\\".

It and its successor \\"I Miss My Friend\\" have been in the CD changer in the car since I got the car last March, and are probably overall the most played CDs whilst driving.This album is so good that it's impossible to pick a specific track, but if I must... either \\"A Good Day To Run\\" (I bought the album on the strength of this after hearing it on satellite radio in the UK), or from a musicians' point of view \\"When You Need My Love\\" - the totally over-the-top instrumental break is the highlight.If you don't have this, buy it.

I didnt always respect country as much but this album by Darryl Worley has made me a fan again which is saying alot from a girl who listens to trip hop and trance more than country lately. But between Darryl Worleys album which I have been rotating with Shelby Lynne, Dwight Yoakam, the Old 97's, and Alan Jackson I'm becoming a big fan again. I guess you cant take the country out of a girl no matter how hard you try. So from a twenty something with wide ranging tastes if the artist reads this one this is one of the best country albums and songwriters since Dwight Yoakams albums and Alan Jacksons stuff. Great album and great songwriting. Take care and god bless. Alexandrea Kenyon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Entertaining","review":"This is a GREAT CD in a sea of millions of artists. I write poetry so words get my attention. These words got to me from the first time I heard a cut from this CD. The types of songs are varied, from heart-felt to upbeat, peppy songs.

He's not some poser in a cowboy hat or leather pants. He's just a talented country singer with an album full of great songs. Only the sappy \\"Those Less Fortunate Than I\\" stands out as a bomb.

I will admit Asylum has nothing on Michael Mfume. The only thing that could have made this movie worse, would be if the voices didn't match the lips (watch out Japan!). If they ever made a black Japanese horror movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw this in a theater!!!","review":"I actually saw this at the Westview Theater in Maryland during Winter 1993. The film's original title was The Weekend It Lives. It was released to Maryland theaters since its director, Michael Mfume, was (and still is) the son of Maryland politician Kweisi Mfume, who would later become president of the NAACP. Thus when people make comments about this being shot on a 1980s' camcorder, they're probably correct.The theatrical experience was no better than the home video one - poor picture and sound, unprofessionalism on every technical level, and a feeling of, \\"Oh my goodness, anyone can get a movie released.\\" The only intriguing part of the film was its title, and then they go and change that for the DVD release so people think they're going to see just another slasher flick. This film is an insult to slasher flicks.Of historical note only because of who directed it, Ax 'Em is as bad a film as you'll ever likely to see. For some that will make this must viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm the original \\"give it a break\\" guy...","review":"but this movie has got to be the worst horror movie. I'll see bad review on other horror movies and I'll still watch them for the fun of it. This movie was so bad that the laughter stopped about 1/4th of the way through. Then we tried to watch because we wanted to see these irritating, bad-acting, mumbling people get killed. But the deaths were [bad], the killer was a joke, the sound [was horrible], quality was non-existent and did I mention that these people couldn't act. The fact that they even tried was bad enough. To top it all off, I can't even tell what the hell happened. Forget about Plan 9 From Out of Space being the worst movie, but at least it's fun to watch (sometimes). I would try to credit these people as making this [stuff] while [under the influence], but no self respecting [individual] would have put this out.Ax'em probably refers to each and every copy of this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarro World Review","review":"Move over Citizen Kane, your place in history as the greatest ever is no more. This was an example of film making at its finest. Brilliantly edited, masterfully directed in addition to Academy Award level acting, Michael Mfume takes you on an exciting and improbable journey into a smartly set microcosm of African American society. Incredible sound, including a beautiful soundtrack give this film the ambiance audiences are looking for. Pulitzer caliber writing in adition to clear and precise camera work make this possibly the greatest film of all time. Incredibly scary horror scenes blended with witty and smart comedy will have audiences wanting for more and more. The saddest thing about this film is that unfortunately it has to come to an end after only 75 minutes. The fact this film did not completely sweep the 1991 Oscars is an absolutely unforgivable crime by the Academy voters. If you have a chance to see this, do not dare pass up the opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's MST3K when you need it?","review":"Okay, this is officially THE worst movie ever made. I'VE made better stuff than this for high school classes. Why was this made? Why was there a 15 minute scene involving a step team and a load of \\"Yo Mama\\" jokes that the viewer can't hear due to a slight ineptitude with a boom mike? WHY IS THERE A CHARACTER NAMED BREAKFAST? I really don't understand this. This movie is horrible, and this is coming from a guy who owns and cherishes a copy of I EAT YOUR SKIN. Now THERE'S an entertaining bad movie. THIS, however, is not even laughably bad. This hurts me. This hurts me so much. Please, don't buy this movie. Go for a walk. Read a good book. Take your significant other out to a dinner at Arby's. Just DO NOT, EVER, watch this movie. I'm begging you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Picture Quality, Horrible Acting,HORRIBLE MOVIE","review":"Ax Em is by far the worst horror movie or movie Iv'e ever seen next to House of the Dead. The movie starts out with a man with an ax that kills a old man(offscreen)and the opening credits show a bunch of black kids dancing and then black kids visitng the woods and then a killer stalks them. The movie is boring and unintentionally hilarious and even the background music is rap and the acting makes High Schoolers look professional compared to this mess. A terrible movie also gets some really awful video quality because the picture is blurry and colors bleed in each scene. Please avoid this trash and rent something better. Even for a no-budget horror indie flick this one is a real blunder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"Well at first I thought this movie was going to be cool because I thought these kids were gonna kick butt!. But all these teens do is run around and scream like idiots(were they trying to be serious). The suicide scene were the man shoots himself and blood goes all over the wall looks like water and the only part I liked was when the dorky dude gets killed in the beginning. The beginning credits was the only BEST part, It taught me how to dance, HAHAHA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha ha, not THIS again?!","review":"It's true what everyone is saying. Terrible acting, terrible audio and picture, just terrible this movie is. I thought I would never see this again. Basically some black collge students go together and created the worse ghettofied movie they could create. The dialogue sucked, and I think they just went with it, no script or anything. Make-up sucked too. I hope they didn't get an A for this in film class. Can you believe I got this from BlockBuster, but they took it back and gave me my money back when i bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"was this even a movie?","review":"I don't know where to start.This movie was IMPOSSIBLE to watch. The sound was awful, the video was BAD, the death scenes were HORRENDOUS and the plot was just plain DUMB!I see no reason to even watch this movie.. not even for the comedic impact!The only good scene was the \\"yo momma\\" joke sequence, and really who wants to endure 45 minutes of BAD movie until that?Do yourself a favor and don't buy/rent/barrow/watch this movie. It will be 90 minutes of your life that you will NEVER get back. Watch a crappy new school slasher film instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I don't even have the words","review":"This movie was easily the worst movie ever created. The deaths are a joke, the acting is horrendous, the dialogue is painful, the audio on some parts doesn't exist, and the cuts are childish. They didn't even try. One scene, when there is supposed to be a police car outside with flashing lights, you can clearly see a police light mounted on the wall, showing off the light. The first death of the movie is comical (but not supposed to be). There is one scene of a girl running in the woods that loops. In one scene you can see the time coding on the bottom of the screen. Getting the point? If you are into bad movies, rent this one. You're sure to get a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, it has no script, lame jokes, bad editing, poor acting.

The whole movie sound like it was recorded in a well. The acting lacks direction the movie seems to have no plot. And I don't think these people have heard of lighting or marks. Still if you know all this coming in and don't actully expect a horror flick like I did then you can laugh yourself silly. This movie was so bad it was good. I couldn't stop laughing. The funniest thing about this movie was that they actully wanted you to be scared. They were honestly trying to make a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you stand torture","review":"If you like pain and suffering, then I HIGHLY recommend watching this. There aren't enough words to describe to the agony. If a 3 month old baby made this film, then the explaination for the quality of this movie would be understandable. However, these were grown people. These people had a \\"movie budget,\\" \\"plot,\\" \\"script,\\" \\"actors,\\" and an \\"experienced crew.\\" The overall result was a \\"worse than normal\\" student film.On the flip side....If you need to relax your mind, have a good laugh, or just want to build mental endurance, then watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"Wish I'd read the previous reviewer before I wasted money renting this dog. I'm in 200% agreement that this has to be the worst film ever made. I've watched thousands of films in my lifetime; rented hundreds; and never before have I yanked a rental out of the player before the opening credits were complete. And I've seen some real stinkers!If I had to guess, I'd say the plot was loosely outlined by teenagers, ad lib'ed by their best buds and shot using a single video tape recorder, using the built-in microphone on the camera. Then the whole thing was burned to a DVD to play from start to end when inserted like one would burn a CD. No DVD features at all.The printed statements used to introduce the plot are so grammatically incorrect as to be incomprehensible.

It's so good to hear these anecdotes and see the human side of a brilliant choreographer.What hard work ballet must be - all that endless repetition. Seeing the young students repeat practice their routines over and over was an eye-opener.I've seen the pictures of Margot Fonteyn and Alicia Markova before, but it was these personal stories about Ben meeting and working with these great ladies that brought them to life for me.This was more enjoyable than I expected. I only got the set because I've seen this choreographer's work. Now watching ballet means more to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Profound","review":"A first pass through this book makes it seem too easy to turn from a typical over-achieving, stressed out manager into a true leader. But that is the beauty of the book and Bethanis' insights into leadership coaching. Via the easy-reading, entertaining style we get to see how a few fundamental shifts in perspective, some honest feedback and a few simple tools can make profound changes in the performance and fulfillment of an up-and-comer in today's fast-paced corporate world. Great read for someone seeking self-development, looking to develop team members, or just curious about what corporate coaching is all about. Simple, practical tools are included so there is a mix of story and \\"how to.\\" This book will serve as a regular reference for me as a leader.

It is a perfect blend of hard and soft and any pop/punk fan would be at a loss if they didnt [add] it to their collection. I even had my \\"hardcore\\" boyfriend singing the songs. So its obviously a very catchy album. The lyrics are wonderfully writen, the instrumental is great. Also if anyone gets the chance to see them live I would highly recommend that too.

Heartfelt, easy to relate to lyrics paired with rock instrumentation give this band one decent addition to anyone's collection. \\"New High\\", \\"Get It On\\", and \\"I Wonder\\" are definately not your average uptempo hits, nor are they what makes this band different from the rest; songs including \\"Breakaway\\", \\"Nothing Left To Say\\", and \\"She's All Mine\\" are just the right type of calm, serene, slower balads that seperate them from all the other new alterna-pop/punk rock bands the new music scene is fueled by.

I liked their single \\"Karma\\" enough to go out and by their album Injury Loves Melody, a truly great album that was just straight out rock'n'roll. Imagine my dismay when I heard the few first songs off of this release. They have been tranformed into a generic pop-punk band meant to appeal to the teeny-boppers who buy Good Charlotte and A simple plan albums. Their songs could not possibly be more cliche. I would recommend buying their first album, but their second album makes me want to cry. Of course, their objective with this Cd was album sales, and that, no doubt, is what this album will acheive."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"Ditching the 80's glam rock meets emocore style of \\"injury loves melody\\" in favor of pop-punk, Diffuser has retured with an album sure to bring them lots of success.

And while it's true that \\"making the grade\\" was produced by Mark Trombino (the genius who brought blink 182's music to life), thats hardly the ONLY reason to check this band out. So do yourself a favor and pick up \\"making the grade\\", you'll be glad you did.P.s. alotta the \\"core\\" kids have a problem with this album cuz its energetic and catchy (core kids don't like catchy).

Not because it is such a bad song, but because in all the hype it has received in the United States, Anslem Douglas and Xtatic (the original artistes from Trinidad) are completely ignored. The song was a fun party song when it was released for Trinidad Carnival 1998 and for those who don't like this version, you need to listen to the original in its proper context - as part of the tremendous party that is Carnival (Baha Men came close though, they sing it word for word and almost beat for beat).

You're Mine, You can Do It, Summer of Love and Getting Hotter are all pretty catchy tunes.Plus the soundtrack reflects the island atmosphere and you can definitely hear it on the tracks.Overall, I think people's expectations were way too high upon hearing the initial single.

Simply the dumbest and most pointless of Yes' entire catalogue.The songs themselves.. most just don't measure up, to the best of their songs. Future Times/Rejoice is an exception..I think it's one of their best songs. Don't Kill The Whale is pretty good and one with nice enviromental theme to it. Onward is a rather nice ballad but is actually improved on in their Keys To Ascension live album set. Most of Rick Wakeman's keyboard sounds are annoying, Lyrics on the other songs flow poorly and create very stilted songs. The performances themselves are pretty good.This is a big step down from their previous album which is a masterpiece.

Limping off into the progressive rock sunset back in '78 - with all those young punk and new wave whippersnappers biting at their heals - Yes stumbled badly on the way to the graveyard. The music on this album is about as shallow and meaningless as the lame Hipgnosis cover art. Gone are the lofty ideals and epic arrangements of the previous album (Going For The One), replaced with insipid lyrics about arriving UFOs and shorter songs that go absolutely nowhere. It would take the band a good 20 years to recapture the old magic on the recently released Keys To Ascension Vol. 2. It's not surprising that this classic lineup broke up after Tormato. Musically, they had reached the end of the road - a dead end. (Actually, there was another album recorded after this one that was so bad, it was never released.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hate this album just because it's different!!","review":"The only thing that kills Tormado is Rick Wakeman's excruciating and glitzy keyboards.

Now don't get me wrong, there ARE some very good moments on this album. But even the band members themselves have admitted this was a troubled project. Tormato is, curiously, one of the most dated-sounding Yes albums, with a slightly dry and flat production sound. Chris Squire tampers with his bass sound, with not always successful results. Rick Wakeman's keyboards though are dynamic and to the fore. One of the best tracks is the rather fun \\"Arriving UFO\\", on which Wakeman seems to be enjoying himself. Other highlights are the love ballad \\"Onward\\", an atypical Yes song, and the ecological rally cry of \\"Don't Kill The Whale\\", which was years ahead of its time.

After hearing it several times now I am definitley on the side of those that like this recording. Even so there are a couple of things that mystify me about Tormato. The first is the actual sound which is not terrible but me thinks it could have been better. I mean these guys were a very successful band that seemed to have already mastered the recording side of things. Well just listen to the previous 6 or 7 recordings. Another thing is that the band almost sounds less mature. If I were told this thing came out 1970-71 I could believe it. Were they trying to be new wavey possibly?? Anyway, these mysteries in my opinion only add to the charm of Tormato. I really like it alot and feel it is a fine album that is a welcome addition to the YES catalogue. It is a bit lighter with shorter songs but the band sounds very inspired and they also sound like they are having alot of fun. Cool Stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tormato Stew","review":"1978's Tormato was the last album to feature the classic Yes lineup and it is a solid collection of songs.

Tormato helped me fall deeply in love with the music of Yes...going for the one is awesome too! Relayer...breath taking, Drama interesting...the older stuff before those, are ok and hits for the time, well worth listening to, but the stuff passing for yes music now bites...and not in a good way!

I had not heard it since first getting it back in the late 70's. I recall it being not just a little disappointing, but an absolute disaster. Something by which to be embarrassed. I was not wrong. This is an album that can be best described by three words, which are and I quote: stink stank stunk. And I don't mean just a bad Yes album, but a bad album for anybody, (except maybe Styx or Journey or another of those late 70's crap bands). How can anyone give it more than a few stars??? It's trite; Don't Kill The Whale. It's ridiculus: Arriving UFO, Circus of Heaven. It's stupid: the fake live sounds in release. One OK song: Silent Wings of Freedom. Please, let's not make this out to be any better than the crap it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"An uneven album","review":"\\"Tormato\\" found Yes in the middle of a musical crisis. The English press was praising punk and new wave bands, and bands like Yes were called \\"dinosaurs\\". Maybe because of the new musical climate, Yes abandonned the 15-25 minutes song format and concentrated on shorter songs. But the band was still short on inspiration, as this uneven cd demonstrates. Tracks like \\"Release Release\\", \\"Onward\\" and \\"On The Silent Wings of Freedom\\" are good, but others like \\"Circus of Heaven\\", \\"Future Times\\" or \\"Madrigal\\" are just plain boring. The production is quite dry: one wishes the band had hired a producer instead of doing it themselves. \\"Tormato\\" is the product of a tired band, going through the motion. It's no surprise Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left after the tour that followed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the weaker Yes outings","review":"Which is to say, it's a fine record by anyone else's standards to be sure. Some great moments surface, and the song 'Onward' is a true classic. Overall, \\"Tormato\\" is largely an uninspired affair, due to Rick Wakeman's unusually drab performances and a shockingly cold and flat production. 'Arriving UFO' may well be a silly song, but it does manage to entertain in a strange way, and Chris Squire does some amazing bass work, especially on 'Circus Of Heaven'. It seems that Yes had pretty much run out of gas by the time \\"Tormato\\" appeared, and a change was in order. Worst of all is the cover art, a really unfortuanate choice for a Yes album. After so many great Roger Dean covers, this. If you're a true Yes fan then you will have to own this. To casual Yes listeners I'd say avoid \\"Tormato\\" and pick up \\"Drama\\" and \\"Relayer\\". Certainly not a bad album by any means, but it is among the four least important Yes efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover art says it all","review":"One of the worst albums by a band that has released a ton of bad albums.

Songs titles like \\"Circus of Heaven\\" and \\"Arriving UFO\\" hint at how bad the contents of this disc really are. The only redeaming music on this cd are the two songs \\"Madrigal\\" and \\"Onward\\".

Best track is \\" Onward \\" . My guess , they were 4 minutes short and pulled this song out of the archives.

Probably like most Yes fans, I expected everything to be a continuation of earlier material, which, in hindsight, is obviously unfair.

And what's more, it seems to fit perfectly in with the \\"classic Yes\\" period. I don't know what I was thinking all those years ago.An interesting side note: While ripping the CD, the \\"Composer\\" column that appears on Windows Media Player lists the members of U2 along with the Yes as composers for Don't Kill the Whale. While I can easily imagine Bono approving of the song, this collaboration is obviously impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds better than the original LP","review":"This was the first Yes album I purchased as a new release. I was a little dissapointed and missed the lower end boom and hardness of some of their other albums but this remastered CD seems to have fixed that a bit. However what I really love about it is the extra tracks. That is what I listen to the most now and hardly ever listen to the original tracks. This is true with some other albums as well since I have heard these songs so much.I hope Rhino can continue doing all of their catalog because they do such a great job. I plan on getting every one with some as duplicate copies since you never know when they will be forced to go on the cheap and be forced to make them without the booklets etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Dinosaur","review":"This will be a short review.Tormato is bad.

Absolutely no wonder they broke up after this. It's a mystery that a band that came up with classics like 'soundchaser','awaken','heart of the sunrise','gates of delirium', 'close to the edge' and many more would be able to record something as horrible like this p.o.c.

I'm not a Yes fan, and not really a fan of Anderson's vocals either. Yet somehow, none of that matters when the guitar playing is consistently tasty and the melodies are memorable. That's the case with this album. I can't think of a weak song here, and that's really something considering I always thought Yes was a pretty spotty band throughout their career. Pick this album up, listen to it, and keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for use in car or on treadmill.","review":"What I like about this is that it presents materials and then prompts in English for the learner to translate to the target language.

I revelled in the absolute accuracy of his descriptions and the ruthless, heartless honesty of a child who must function in a world that is often alien and confusing. It brought back numerous incidents of my own childhood - the stuff that nowadays is unacceptable to disclose. Along with Tobias Wolf's This Boys Life and Truffaut's The 400 Blows, Boyhood is a wonderfully honest record of childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short informative analysis of german armor in WWII.","review":"What make this book stand out from other German armor books is Flesischer's concise analysis of the technical and operational use of German armor on a variety of war fronts (Spain & Russia). The majority of books I have read on this subject boast about the superior design and acomplishments of German armor. Flesischer's analysis debunks this myth. I've found out that all German tank designs were inferior to Allies designs in armor protection and gun callibre. The Germans were playing catch up in design inovation and mass production of tanks. Only superior German tactics and training overcame these short commings until the very end. The book is 80% pictures with 3 to 4 pages of great consise analysis per chapters (7). The picture are great in detail and should be interest to modelers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dry","review":"I picked up this book and was very disappointed--even more disappointed than after watching Death to Smoochy. It lacked all of the wit and satirical insight that Stewart usually brings with both his writing and delivery. Granted, his performance in the movies that he has been in have somewhat failed to bring forth his dynamic humor, but this book failed beyond that of even his movies. Unfortunately, the ending never delivered the cynical turnaround/punchline that I thought he spent most of the book setting up. Honestly, I can't really even enjoy his show any more.

He blames Comisky and the low wages he provided as the reason the eight sold out on one of the great ballclubs of all-time. Asinof also puts the blame on the gamblers who used the ballplayers as pawns to get rich. But, ultimately participation in the scheme was the final and fatal decision that was made by 8 of the Sox. Some parts of the book, such as the post-trial, are a bit dry, but overall this is an easy-to-read, informative novel. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about such White Sox greats as Buck Weaver and Shoeless Joe Jackson and the 1919 World Series scandal in which they participated"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still definitive","review":"The book, bar none, on the 1919 World Series fix. The details of the extremely ill-planned conspiracy to do...well, everybody thought they were doing something different...are presented very well by ex-journalist Eliot Asinof, whose writing is convincing and direct. As a White Sox fan, and one who was depressed that that team's only mention in Ken Burns' Baseball was the Black Sox Scandal, I would like everybody interested to read this book and reflect on how major breaches of trust do not appear that way to those involved, when they perceive the routine betrayals and frauds going on everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed this book","review":"saw the movie years ago, when it was just a movie to me. Watched the movie again a few years back when I was more interested in baseball history, and really enjoyed it. I read the book and was able to gather more insight into the history of it. I watched the movie again shortly after I read the book, and was able to piece together a few more things.It's one of the most memorable (infamous) things in MLB history, and this tells it wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 Men Out","review":"Baseball historians will love this book as it covers seemingly every aspect of the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The background information about baseball in the late 19th-early 20th century was amazing. I would highly recommend this book before or after you watch the much less detailed movie version of this episode in baseball history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"I teach a course to high school seniors called Baseball in American Society.

Comparing controversies that have happened in baseball over the years is part of the syllabus and the 1919 Black Sox scandal fits right in."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Does Not Get Much Worse Than This!","review":"Although the facts are somewhat basically correct, I strongly suspect that Asinof embellished the truth more than once to please his own sense of history on this subject. Historically speaking, the facts are out in the open and he needn't really have fictionalized them so much. Asinof must have been telling the same stories over and over through the years, with changes to sensationalize, and somehow this has become embedded into his mind as the absolute truth. Nothing could be further from his truth. This book, and the movie are a complete waste of time. Buying this book would do little more than feed creedence to this pack of mistruths. The eight deserved a much better fate than this. It does not get much worse than this.

In the end, I was not sure who the true villians were; the gamblers and con artists, Charles Comiskey, or the seven men themselves (omitting Buck Weaver).The author \\"possibly\\" could have framed the period more thoroughly in terms of the impact gamblers had on all of baseball, not only the Chicago White Sox, but that is my only slight complaint. Otherwise, it painted a remarkable portrait of a bleak period in the history of our national pastime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great book","review":"THis book has plenty of developed characters, a great plot, tons of suspense, and to top it off, its a true story.The only downfall in my opinion, was that there were way too many characters.

For readers of WWII naval classics some of the characters and situations are too reminiscent for coincidence. Convincing scene's of our hero's spouse caught in all the contradictions of her generation amongst the more traditional wardroom wives show Deutermann to be a talented professional in his post naval career.Occasional sloppy editing: can we really believe this U.S. frigate flew the Union Jack at harbor in Subic Bay? Annoying reliance of military accronyms in the text requires a three page Glossary.But, overall, a good read which intertwines multiple storylines into a unifying climax of naval combat, busting the drug dealers, and romance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Jargon, Not Enough Style","review":"The Edge of Honor, written by a retired Navy captain, tries hard to bring the reader into the Navy world and capture the reader's imagination, but doesn't quite succeed. With its stiff prose and bland characters, the novel plods along without building much suspense until two-thirds of the way through, when plot, action, and character finally combine to produce a page-turner. Until that point, however, the military jargon is overwhelming, even with a glossary included at the back of the book. Deutermann's attempt to have the reader learn along with the new guy simply makes the hero look unappealingly naive. A few scenes of life aboard a ship in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam war are extraneous to the plot, do not build character, and are not strong enough in a literary sense to merit inclusion in the book.Retired navy personnel may find this novel an intriguing description of an ultimately dysfunctional ship, but to the outsider it has little to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO ZULU","review":"For those us that experienced Viet Nam as junior officers in the United State Navy, this book is more fact then fiction. Americans would be well served if this novel is made into a movie, providing of course that Mr. Deutermann is given complete artistic control. America needs another glimpse of this part of our history as seen through the eyes of young Americans in a bad place, at a bad time, doing the best job they can. To all that shared this experience and to P.T.Deutermann, Capt., USN, I say Bravo Zulu and godspeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fiction","review":"As a Marine Viet Nam vet, I still retain an interest in the military.

The Edge of Honor is set during the Vietnam War and is centered on LCDR Brian Holcombem the new Weapons Officer aboard a large guided missile destroyer operating in the Tonkin Gulf while on an 8-month depolyment. Dealing with ship operations, a serious drug problem aboard ship, career issues, and his young wife left behind in San Diego combine to make this a very readable tale. Deutermann places the reader in the ship's Combat Information Center and let's him experience the stresses of naval life at sea during wartime while dealing with the very real problem of the 1970s - drugs aboard ship.

It never showed the Master's arriving and Adam escaping. At first I thought it to be from another episode but Cringer was still wearing the harness to carry Adam's sword.I am not sure if this was an editing error or a bad copy on a disc.

You can't go wrong with almost any of his Concord recordings even though they were done late in his career. He was at his best when he didn't have to shout over an orchestra.

It would have gone better if they had just kept it Hall,Nash,Hogan,S.Steiner,Curt Henning,and Horace Hogan. I thought the WWE invasion would have gone better if Eric Bicshoff was at the helm leading the NWO alongside Hollywood Hogan. Before, DX there was the NWO. Unlike DX, The NWO IS 4-LIFE.

It was nice to see the old WCW days with the NWO and the WCW storyline. The WWE is good at putting the DVD together with all the music and highlighted matches. The problem was that there wasn't enough WCW NWO and too much WWE NWO. I hated the WWE's version as they killed the whole mystique of the NWO when they were running away from Stone Cold etc. They really should have made them \\"KINGS\\" and brought them back NOT as Vince McMahon's goons but against the whole WWE or WWF at the time. That's what made it so great in the past. They came in as outsiders and not as thugs from someone else. Still, it was great to see them but they could have done a better job. The DVD has some good matches from the past and did bring me back so I did enjoy the DVD in that sense.

I didn't get into wrestling until 1998, so it is nice to look back on what I missed. The DVD goes bad once the focus shifts to the WWF invasion of the nWo. They focus to much time on this, rather than devoting more to the WCW days. Plus, it just reminds me of how Vince really droped the ball on this angle.

I walked out 25 minutes into the movie. The basic story of the movie was a good one, but he (Lawrence) just ruined it by being in it. Every step of the way, Lawrence's character is backstabbing this white cop, (who's problems started by meeting Lawrence's character) who is just trying to make it through his difficulties and find the guys who killed his former partner.I am ashamed to be of the same race as Martin Lawrence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity All Around","review":"National Security is quite a disappointment when expecting a hilarious comedy.In short, the acting and the plot are average, while the humor and the dialogues are slightly below average.Moreover, the characters are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting, not to mention that to call the ending \\"predictable\\" is the understatement of the year!In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.No masterpiece here... 2 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"This is about a guy( Martin Lawrence), who accuses a cop( Steve Zahn) of beating him, so he can get on the police force, whn really he was just beating a bee that Martin Lawrences charactar was afraid of.

Martin Lawrence is ok but overreacts way too much, and Steve Zahn is pretty good but is really giving nothing more to do than to react to Lawrence's stupidity. Eric Roberts hits a new career low as the heavy, and really does not do anything more than try to look menacing and the action scenes are so way over the top that it becomes ridiculous in certain places and in times way out of place.

The script isn't all the original and the story line isn't all that gripping either.It's the usual story of two miss-matched people coming together to accomplish a 'mission'. The characters are opposites of each other, Lawrence plays the usual loud, obnoxious black guy while Zahn plays a former cop who just lost his partner. Zahn's character loses his job as a cop after being accused of beating up Lawrence but both characters come together and inevitably become best buddies in the end. It's not the best Lawrence movie out there and when you compare it to some of his best (bad boys, blue streak) it downright disappointing.The movie did make me laugh in some parts but overall I found it to be a slow starting, not very well planned movie.2 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racial","review":"This movie really deserves a \\"0\\" star, it is Martin Lawrence's worst movie yet.

It only ended because it simply became inefficient to run slave labour camps.This is a brilliant account of the GULAG system.

Russians from all walks of life were arrested at random on bogus charges to be cattled into the gulag system which in turn provided millions of men, women and children for slave labor. The Russian economy took into account how many prisoners there were available. If there was a shortage, more were merely arrested. There were more \\"reasons\\" for arresting someone than for not arresting them. This provided the logic behind the whole system. For example, a group of brothers were arrested for winning a soccer match because they defeated the favorite team of the NKVD (a.k.a. KGB) leader. Prisoners were tortured (for false confessions), beaten, starved, frozen, raped, mutilated, traded, and deprived of humanity. Being killed or dying was the least of one's problems.

No having to deal with loose CDs and a worthless spindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made roaster","review":"I have been using this roaster for over a year with great results. It is a very quiet and very solidly build appliance; feels like driving a German car. The controls couldn't be simpler to use. As expected, it does make a lot of smoke, and proper ventilation is required.A portion of the plastic case started to melt near the exhaust which prompted me to lower the operating temperature. The power cord warms up a bit during operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The disposable Bic pen of roasters","review":"First off, I thought this roaster did a very good job. It was also nice to be able to see the roast level through the glass, allowing me to better judge when it was done. Having said that, I went through two of these in about 4 years. Both had meltdowns and incinerated themselves. The first was because I had one of the original SMALL chaff collectors that was just plain undersized. When the chaff collected, it created a tinderbox that melted the whole machine. The second time something happened where the rotating drum got jammed and, once again, the machine had a meltdown. Once the plastic gets to its \\"flashpoint\\" it's all over. It's like a nuclear meltdown. These machines are WAY too expensive to be made of plastic given their function. Bad design in that respect for too much money. I ultimately got a Behmor 1600 and, while it is not as good a roaster, it has a longer life span and is all metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally. Don't wait any longer, you have to hear Roberta.","review":"Those fortunate to have seen Roberta Gambarini perform have waited a long time for this release. I, for one, am thrilled with the outcome. Her song selection hints at her command of the American Songbook. The band(s) provides sophisticated support. The sound is clean and solid. Roberta's voice is rich, smooth, and faultless through her extensive range. Her pitch is spot on, her phrasing opens up the songs, and her time just swings.Having placed 3rd behind Jane Monheit and Teri Thornton in the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocal Competition in 1998, she went on to win the jazz hearts and minds of musicians and jazz lovers at festivals and clubs across the U.S. - but contract issues in her native Italy prevented a U.S. release. With those issues resolved, and with the release of \\"Easy to Love\\", Roberta Gambarini will finally be heard by the audience she deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally derivative","review":"Ms. Gambarini seems to have listened to one too many Carmen McRae and Nancy Marano CDs. Her phrasing, breath sounds, and tonal quality are completely derivative. It's not enough to have a nice voice and good skills. A singer has to have something unique and interesting to convey. What's the point of being a clone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was there","review":"I was at the Monk Institute competition at which Gambarini placed third. Teri Thornton who placed first is now, sadly, deceased. Jane Monheit placed second and she is a huge star. I am so happy to see Gambarini get the acclaim she deserves. She sounds like a young Carmen McRae. I love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot New Jazz Singer","review":"Roberta is the hottest new jazz singer that has come along for a long time and I hope to be able to see her live before she gets really BIG! I would compare her to Ella, yes, seriously. She has a beautiful voice, uses it like an instrument, does vocal improve with the best of them, and entertains!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking Flight","review":"Honestly, IN FLIGHT is a lot to process, but well worth the ride. The songs are Linda Perry at her best, honest and unforgiving yet gentle and subdued.The catchiest you'll get is \\"Freeway,\\" a song about \\"watering flowers all night long\\" and \\"being free of everything.\\" But that's what makes this cd so special, it was made it for no one but the artist, like a private memento.Then there are the reflective undertones of \\"Uninvited\\" and the hung-over slick \\"Fill Me Up,\\" which shed some light on the journey.But it's \\"Success,\\" \\"Machine Man,\\" and \\"Too Deep,\\" introspective pieces with hazy harmonies, that give IN FLIGHT its eternal moodiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good moody listening","review":"I discovered Linda Perry quite by accident. I was watching the LOGO channel minutes before there umpteenth showing of Torch Song, Birdcage or some damn thing (UGH! they need to buy more movies and shows) and they showed the video for \\"Fill Me Up\\" as filler. WOW. GREAT STUFF!I recognized the voice but since I wasn't a big fan of the 4 Non Blondes radio hit, it took some time to place it. And yes it does draw comparison to Concrete Blond. very moody, dark and slick.\\"Fill Me Up\\" is my favorite on the album. Probably the most commercial friendly which I'm sure is not Perry's aim. She's out to make good music and she succeeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovering true music gems","review":"Sometimes you don't understand the record labels strategies, remember the Badfinger case?In the wake of the 4NonBlondes crumbling Interscope Records allowed Linda Perry to record what soon became \\"In Flight\\", and with the job done they were unsatisfied with the result, expecting a more \\"easy-listening\\" album, the album was not promoted, sending Linda in dispair. I'm happy that I discovered this album. This is MUSIC, this is art, this is a soul-blues-pop-rock-intimate journey in a very sensitive private world, Linda's. You will listening to a very good record, and sometimes I wonder what would hapen if Linda Perry were nineteen in 1970, with Led Zeppelin or The Who going around. If you think Alanis Morisette is great expect to listen this, you were living in the wrong world ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One solid album","review":"Linda Perry's songs have sold millions of copies, and she is a Grammy nominee, but one of her greatest achievements, her solo album In Flight, was sadly overlooked. This album enthralls me every time I hear it. I think it's even better than Linda's album with 4 Non Blondes. I read a review describing In Flight as \\"dour\\" and \\"sallow,\\" but these words hardly do the album justice. Several songs are indeed moody and downbeat (\\"Success\\", \\"Life In a Bottle\\", \\"Knock Me Out\\") but there are also lively rockers (\\"Freeway\\", \\"Fill Me Up\\", which got some radio airplay) as well as songs full of joy (\\"Taken\\"), humor (\\"Fruitloop Daydream\\") and indescribable beauty (\\"In Flight\\"). The performances, by Linda and several members of the Tuesday Music Club (who backed Sheryl Crow on her first album), are solid throughout. The album isn't quite perfect; a few songs could have been trimmed, and one or two sound unfinished. But if you like mature pop/rock music, I highly recommend In Flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisenly mellow and moody and boring","review":"If you are buying this album after listening to 4 Non Blondes and hope this is volume 2, skip it. While Linda Perry is an outstanding vocalist, this one doesn't rock. It doesn't skip either. An unfortunate sophomoric effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Slick with Linda is one great duo!!!!!","review":"Grace Slick has said lately, that she doesn't want to sing-publicly, and she can't sing softly. I bought this cd to hear the latest recording of Grace. No one will be disappointed with \\"Knock Me Out.\\" Proves beyond a doubt that Grace is still in great vocal form. I had never heard of Linda before this cd was brought to my attention, but what a bonus! Linda demonstrates her musical and vocal depth/complexity throughout this cd. No simple ~ sugar music here! I'm waiting to hear more, Linda! and Grace too!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Loud","review":"This device is too loud and causes incredible vibrations throughout the house.

Her authentic Israeli sound is one you will definitely want to listen to more than once! I bought her CD not knowing what to expect, and I was completely blown away-- she makes her music a joy to listen to! Even if you don't speak Hebrew, these awesome lyrics are given to you!

The rest of the reviews on how scary and gruesome it is, is just for money. Believe me! Don't waste your money on this, maybe a rent, but I do not even recomend that! The only scene was the eating of the heart, but that was even silly. This should be called kill the animals, and surgery film. Don't be fooled, the cover and reviews sound better but it's not.

ANYWAYS, the scumbags actually let me rent it, and let me tell you, by the end of the movie, I was totally disturbed about death and dying.

But its mostly just fake scenes or old World War 2 footage of the Hollocaust and maybe some TV news footage. Its not even high quality explicit gore. Even the doco at the end of the dvd is just a \\"B-Grade\\" sham. Honestly I would not buy this movie again.

Or did I miss the point, was it meant to be funny? I did have a couple of laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"video description","review":"If you're into really gross movies, this one is for you.

How many of these people who get a perverted kick out of TRACES OF DEATH, DEATH SCENES, FACES OF GORE...or whatever would love to see their own mother (or anyone close to them) die in a grisly way?

I got this game as a christmas present and I sincerely wish my brother could get his money back. Not that the graphics were anything spectacular, but when are game companies going to realize that if there is no playability, then all the pretty graphics and cutscenes do not matter. Also, the storyline is choppy. You jump from one scene where Paul and his mother are running from the sandworm (and yes, Paul is running toward you so you can't see where you are going) and the next scene you are the Maudeep and Paul's mother has already become reverend and given birth to his sister. The overall rating and I think that is terribly decieptful. If you have any doubt, do not buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I ever bought","review":"I could not wait to get it off my computer. Arrow and other keyboard commands. If it was mouse, you could at least control the character better. I emailed Dreamcaster and even though I did not buy it from them, they agreed to exchange it for another of their games. (I got a mouse control game)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game does not deserve the name \\"Dune\\"","review":"Wow. When I saw the cover for this game, I thought to myself \\"Finally! Somebody has made a 3D Dune game!\\" Then I put the game in my computer and nearly broke down crying because it was SOOOOOO bad. I mean, this game is beyond bad. First: the story is confusing, and, as a fan of the Dune series, disgustingly wrong. Names are confused, people are referred to by the wrong titles, and it's just sad. It makes me wonder if anyone at Dreamcatcher has actually READ the book. Second: the controls are confusing at best, difficult at worst. You can't change them, so you better get used to it. The camera is dizzying and hard to follow. I uninstalled the game in the middle of the second level, because I got tired of restarting my computer every time Paul got caught behind a wall or in a wall and the controls froze. So, ultimately, if you like Dune, do not buy this game. However, if you like video games, do not buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Gameplay - could have been so good.","review":"This game was one of the biggest dissappointments I've ever had in a game. Dreamcatcher has made some great games, but maybe action games just aren't their forte. This game has terrible controls, you have to use the directional keys for movement and can't use w,a,s,d, so if you are right handed, like most people, it is realy awkward. Every action like opening doors or changing weapons is terrible. If an enemy actually sees you there really isn't much you can do but stand there while they shoot you to death. The voice work was ok, and the look of the game wasn't that bad, but all the other mistakes far outweigh any positives. I have a decent graphics card and it still took me quite a while just to get the game to work. A sad release of what should have been such a great game. I know it looks like fun but really don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge dissapointment to Dune fans","review":"Story adaption is awful, gameplay is terrible, and user interface is very frustrating, to put it mildly. It appears they didnt do a lot of testing before releasing this opus barfo to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible only begins to describe this game. Putrid tripe put out to make a buck. Could they make the controls more confusing.

Do not buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this then - Love it now","review":"I had the two vinyl albums that this CD contains - actually still have them stored somewhere. I was thrilled to see them available on CD, but after ordering I was afraid I was just sentimental about them and feared I'd be disappointed. Absolutely was not!I'll confess, I bought the first album because I thought David McCallum was so sexy in \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" - anyout else out there remember that? I thought the music, some original, some arrangements of tunes of the time, was great. The same held true for the second album.This music is still absolutely wonderful. (Of course, David McCallum is still pretty wonderful as Ducky in \\"NCIS\\", too.) I can put it on and just hum along with it all. I guess it is sentimental, but musically it is quite sound and I believe almost anyone would enjoy it.It does make me wonder if David McCallum still dabbles with music....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest ever","review":"This is my all-time favorite CD.

The songs never get boring, no matter how much you listen to them. Especially \\"One Headlight.\\" After a while most songs tend to get monotonous, but not this one, or any of the other songs on this CD. The lyrics are great, focusing on different experiences and emotions in life. I'd say the best songs are \\"One Headlight,\\" \\"Sixth Avenue Heartache,\\" \\"Three Marlenas,\\" \\"Laughing Out Loud,\\" and \\"I Wish I Felt Nothing.\\" Of course, every song on this CD is worth listening to over and over again!

Good melodic rock with good hooks. Unfortunately, being the son of a famous musician has it's drawbacks, and Jakob Dylan wasn't spared the obvious critisms and comparisons. But I think that Jakob and his band have suceeded in putting together a very good album that can more than stand on it's own. Jakob's songwriting talents are also showcased here, having written every single song on here. Yes, some are weaker than others, but all in all, this is a good body of work.

The one song that propelled the success of this album is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album will collect dust after a few weeks.....","review":"Basically I got the album for one headlight and 6th ave. heartache (two stars for those two songs). I tried listening to the whole album once, and not just those two songs, and the album as a whole is pretty dull except for a few songs. It sounds too monotone, his voice, the instrumentation, everything! It has simply been tossed aside in my CD collection. You want some music with substance? Try listening to the Smiths, U2, depeche mode, or the cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The times - They ARE a changin....","review":"Genetics - what a strange thing. From what I can tell, musical talent must skip a generation, or else it's passed down from your mother's side. Either way, Jacob Dylan has none.

The Wallflowers have captured a distinct sound, and it is well recorded and produced. Somewhat dark but inherently listenable, it has great songwriting to boot. Jakob Dylan has polished his craft. The album has five well-known tracks that are all excellent (the immaculate \\"One Headlight,\\" \\"Sixth Avenue Heartache,\\" \\"Bleeders,\\" \\"Three Marlenas,\\" and \\"The Difference\\"), but there are worthy album tracks as well: \\"Invisible City,\\" \\"Laughing Out Loud,\\" and \\"God Don't Make Lonely Girls.\\" This is a fine effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true rock gem","review":"The Wallflowers never dissapoint, and this, their 2nd album sure proved that!.

The lyrics and music are the kind that you can listen to over and over again without getting tired of them. Songs like Three Marlenas, Josephine and Invisible City show that lead singer Jakob Dylan is not afraid to convey lots of emotion in his singing. I would strongly recommend this CD to any fans of groups like the Counting Crows, Matchbox 20, and just folk rock in general :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest \\"just miss\\" album I've heard","review":"One Headlight is good but the rest is mediocre.

The group has composed some particularly good songs in this album. \\"One Headlight\\" was positively outstanding, along with \\"Angel on my Bike\\" and \\"I Wish I felt Nothing\\". Jakob Dylan's voice is enthralling and serves as the key element to the band's identity -- it's been quite some time when I got struck by a voice (Eddie Vedder). This is wonderful work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rox!","review":"Bringing Down The Horse is a truly inspirational CD. The lyrics are sensitive and powerful. Songs like 6th Avenue Heartache and One Headlight took my breathe away. Jakob Dylans voice is so unique and sounds great with the rest of the bands playing!

This book was very enlightening as to what life was like for this young man around the depression era Applachian Mountains, a boy who found much to do with his time--not always good things! In not giving away the plot nor the surprises the book hold, I can only say that it is hilarious,honest,and like a breath of fresh air compared to much on the market today. I liked the stories Mr. Rains put into the book that told some of the family's 'dirty laundry' so to speak. I also liked the telling of the capers of he & his younger sister Esther, many of which got them into much trouble, but elicited much laughter for me and my daughter. This book is certainly worth a read by anyone who is looking for humor and truth in a short biography. I hope Mr. Rains writes more and makes this a series of books starting in his Native American mothers time up to the present day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and Funny","review":"Even though these were true stories, They were very funny entertaining.

The author has a communication style that lets the mind wander to truly appreciate all the shenanigans that young boys can get into.

All I will say is ...DON'T!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kentucky Bad Boy by David S. Rains","review":"Captivating! A \\"read at one sitting\\" type book. This author does not tiptoe around non-traditional country beliefs, but more appropriately uses them as steppingstones to produce a very alluring tale. He has taken romance, humor, despair, hope, hardship, and even witchcraft, and blended them together, using as his catalyst, the perception of a youngster growing up in eastern Kentucky. Reminiscent of Steinbeck and Twain, \\"Kentucky Bad Boy\\" is down-to-earth and intriguingly entertaining. Not unlike fine Kentucky bourbon, Mr. Rains has taken the best ingredients of storytelling and blended them together to produce an outstanding book. I will be awaiting more from this writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible PPV","review":"This was easily one of the worst WWE/F PPV's in years.

This year was no exception. The Main Event between Triple-H and Undertaker is basically just 2 guys punching and spitting for 25 minutes, the actual tournament is between 4 guys who got no crowd reaction(and for good reason), the cruiserweight title match between Hurricane and Jamie Noble features lots of screeching and botched spots, the Ric Flair-Eddie Guerrero match is slow and stop-start, and the commentary is terrible. The only \\"highlights\\" are 2 mediocre matches in the form of Hulk Hogan-Kurt Angle, and Molly Holly-Trish. Not hideous, but not exactly good either.

Taker's 40 years old, and Triple H hasn't been as good since he had his surgery. The only match I would consider watching over is the Angle v.s. Hogan match, but that's just because I think Kurt Angle is the best in the WWE. So the only reason I gave this PPV 2 stars is because I liked the pyrotechnics display at the beginning and the big chair in the king of the ring set was nice.

If you are wondering what my credibility is, I have none, except for being fan for over fifteen years, going backstage at the most recent concert, talking to the band myself, and discussing Circus Animals with Ian Moss(Lead Guitar).

Unlike Groove Collective, Liquid Soul has a decent emcee that carries more than his share of a song's weight when on the mic. Still, the hornz seemed soulless, off-beat, and uninspired. The hornplay was good but not as good as the instrumentalists on from Brooklyn FUnk Essentials and Groove Collective. I will say I liked it better than Groove Collective's 'It's all In Your Mind' but just like that album, Liquid Soul left only a track or two that I'd listen to again. I was quite disappointed.

There is no dividing line, or even dividing spectrum, between gods and spirits. The very concepts may be culture-bound Western ones. Sometimes what they call \\"gods\\" are highly personal, sometimes not. Sometimes they are moral, sometimes not. In the end, there is nothing that distinguishes them except the Western/Christian meanings of the terms.That said, the case studies are very well done and interesting.

If you like these guys, definitely check out Ester Drang and Pedro the Lion.This is a fabulous album to listen to while driving, hanging out, exercising, you name it.

I suggest if you can't find any anywhere - that you buy a bottle either through a mexican market or online and then take it to your local walmart and ask them to start carrying it - Power of Suggestion. I pay only 1.88 a bottle for it through walmart; seems like somebody is making a killing on Amazon.I prefer to eat it on Fuji Apples. I only eat Fuji apples, anyway. Is also good on Mangoes (squeeze lime juice onto mango then sprinkle with Tajin) Yum. I also suggest Popcorn. Even plain low calorie popcorn sprinkled with Tajin makes the world a better place.The fact that the label tells you exactly what is in the bottle makes this product almost priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tajin Fruit and Snack Seasoning, 5.7 oz","review":"This stuff is delicious.

The realities of the small farmer are the heart and soul of the problems of this country. Just like great teachers, the farmer who knows the land and is able to farm without pesticides is a special breed. They give their lives to learning nature's secrets every season. Each year is a new story with new challenges. They are very creative artistic people who cultivate the soil, work with the land, and know how to accept nature on her terms. We need to reclaim the land with these natural farming methods. Genetically Modified Corn, Soy, Canola, and Potato must be outlawed. The idea that we can control nature with chemicals, pesticides and bioengineered organisms is getting in the way of the natural process. I look forward to more farms like Fred who convert the dead soil from pesticide farms to the rich organic soil of a natural ecosystem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmm?","review":"I found this film a bit boring to be honest and although Wes Craven had a little involvement, it was his son who produced this film. The whole thing was like ALIEN because of the environment and the acting was not all that good except for Lance Henriksen who has starred in so many top movies.

I gave it just one extra start just because it was Jet!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"I have watched this movie along with many other Jet Li films. To be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection. I was so caught up in the title that I really was expecting much more from the film. But I was very disappointed to say the least. The movie takes place in the early eighties. When Gangs dressed in leather with chains, carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally. This was not the type of movie that I was expecting Jet Li to be in. If you want some real action packed Jet Li pick up the Contract Killer which will give you alot more for your money TRUST ME you want be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tsui Hark at his worse","review":"I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved.

I kept having Karate Kid flashbacks! The story is the same old, same old, American martial arts move cliches, fighting for honor and all...in a place that is obviously NOT Los Angeles. The real disappointment is that the martial artists( in come cases obviously just local students for God sake!) are sub par and the choreography suffers for it.

While this is no Fist Of Legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going. What I did'nt anticipate was the humor. Absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops. Once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it's own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining...","review":"Although, Jet Li has better movies out on video and VCD, I thought this movie was entertaining and funny.

It's entertaining to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sub-Mediocre","review":"How could this be a movie written, produced and directedby the great Tsui Hark and starring the great Jet Li?They both were either desperate for a quick buck,under some kind of contract pressure to put out a productor cynically misunderstood American sensibilitiesand attempted to adjust their art to suit it.Do not watch this movie.It is a complete waste of time.Everything that can be bad in a movieis bad in this one.It has small bits of Hark movie styleand Li martial arts, but not enough to makeit the least bit interesting.Bad acting, bad plot, bad editing, humor that does not worketc., etc. etc.The only way to appreciate Jet Li and Tsui Harkand is to watch their Chinese productions.What they do does not translate.They are fish out of water in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward, powerful, the music flows well, delightfully charming","review":"This is a German style recording, with power and precision, using modern instruments. The tempos are a little slower than one would expect from \\"historically informed\\" performances, but do an excellent job of driving the music. All the counterpoint lines are clearly articulated, and often have a singing quality. It has solid bass lines to anchor everything, something often lacking in \\"authentic\\" performances.

In a room temperature environment (as it is supposed to do) separates itself into one part sticky clear oil, and another part the white/tan paste. The two ingredients do not work together as a whole entity and makes a mess on your hands and on the baby.

I don't put it on her at every diaper change, maybe a few out of 7-8 changes a day. And she has not had any rash so far!! I love the texture as well. I feel it is just right. Not too thin so that it comes off easily when she pees or not too thick so that it is hard to wipe off.I also have the natural version of the same paste.But I find this to be a bit too runny and greasy, although I love the fact that it is made of natural ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect fit, but broke!!","review":"I have had numberous back covers and most of them crack at the corners a few weeks after installation.

The bands performance is rocking but I can't believe that they are happy with production. I get the impression the track listing is not the actual set list. When bands want to putout a concert on CD they have to cut some songs to fit but this is so chopped up it it shouldn't even be called a live CD. Zodiac Mindwarp is a great band in the vein of Circus Of Power , Junkyard , TSOL (With Joe Wood) maybe not to well known in the US but still worth getting their CD'S.

Not only that, but the intake valve is so short that when debris is \\"sucked up\\" toward it, the water flow pushes it right back down and away from the valve.

I purchased a 3rd Hush 10 power filter, assuming my 2nd one was just a fluke, but the 3rd Hush 10 was 85% as loud as the one I was replacing right out of the box! 2 out of 3 of these Hush 10's have been a flop, I'm on the hunt for something else that's quieter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melt Banana goes above & beyond my expectations","review":"This wonderful group should be the blue-print for bands of the future.

Brandy is wise in the ways of dogdom and endears himself to his new family. He learns from another dog and in time passes that wisdom on to the new pup that is abandoned at the farm. The main lesson of the book is that there comes a time when the humane thing to do is to \\"put your dog down.\\" Since all of us dog lovers struggle with this decision in time, this book helps to put that situation in a right perspective.

The author did a credible job of bringing the era and the characters to life. I could perfectly picture myself in the midst of this quaint village that had been \\"invaded\\" by the Yanks, turning it on its head and bringing it kicking and screaming into the 20th century.

I'm typically a reader of romance novels which tend to follow a pattern. But this piece of fiction was interesting, well written and captured the spirit of the time period and the depth of the love developing between many of it's characters....not just a man and a woman.It was a very good book with my only complaint being that the author stopped a little too early in some scenes and didn't dwell more on the moments we wanted to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating historical Info About American Soldiers In England During WW II","review":"I found \\"Our Yanks\\" to be fascinating and informative reading about this period that as a child of the'50s I was not aware of.This is NOT a love story,nor an historical romance as there is almost no development of any of the characters. It is more an historical fiction.I would have preferred that the occasional incidents of cursing, were totally avoided, but they are not excessive.A very interesting book that was hard for me to put down.I enjoyed reading the different feelings that the Brits had about our American soldiers being stationed in their country,and I can totally agree with their feelings both pro and con,and I have no doubt about the incident of arrogance from the American Commander at the Welcoming party that offended many Brits.Really interesting insights to how the joining of two very different cultures was experienced by all concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Fine Finish","review":"I read this book mainly at night over the busy get ready for the holidays season.

The opportunity to load it to my Kindle is a true gift. This story of generations of a family, and the Rachels in each generation, and the diamond that ties them together, is a fantastic history of the Jewish people.For those of you who found this book by searching for Christian fiction: I'm not sure how this book could possibly have come up, but read it anyway, with an open mind.

The Books of Rachel is basically the same as that one, same historical periods, etc, but not nearly as good. I sampled this one on my kindle and decided yes, I'll read that one since it was under $3.00. But I didn't finish this one, I got to the second section and decided I didn't need to spend anymore time on it--it's boring and not terribly creative. I guess I compared it too harshly with People of the Book, which I loved. There are too many other good books out there to spend too much time reading this one. It's got a fine premise, though it's graphic and gory (but section one did take place in the inquisition, so it's not like you didn't expect it), but also dry and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many swear words for a Christian book","review":"I thought it was gonna be a a beautiful story about a strong godly woman named Rachel.

The following chapters also contain situations that are hard to read. My experience has been that any literature accurately depicting the ongoing struggles of Jews from biblical times to the present day contains plenty of painful reality. This book follows one family with many branches through the centuries, focusing on the women who were given the name Rachel. The various Rachels were portrayed so each one was easy to identify with. I vascillated between wanting to read through it quickly to determine the outcome, and wanting to pace myself to make this wonderful book last as long as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Ever!

I was shocked to see that her books are called Christian reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth","review":"I have to admit up front that I didn't finish this book. I read about half way through it. The story follows a family line over a very large time period. Because it covers so much time, there wasn't much depth to each time period. It is series of mini stories, but they are not fleshed out well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachels through the ages","review":"If you want a history lesson as well as a good read then The Books of Rachel is for you. I was not aware of the Spanish Inquisition and how terribly Jews were treated. I am a reader of Holocaust books but this book showed me other centuries and the continued suffering of the Jewish people. The good news is that there are many love stories intertwined and it is not just about sad events. The stories move quickly and keep you looking for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The books of Rachel","review":"Bad, Bad, Bad!!

However, I only got through the first few chapters because I found that the description of the torture in the inquisition scenes too graphic - it stayed with me after putting the book down and not in a good way.The author's writing style was easy to read and maybe I could have enjoyed the book; however, I have an aversion to reading for enjoyment details of people being tortured. If this doesn't bother you, you might enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewww.","review":"I was shocked by the graphic content of this book and couldn't read past the first chapter. The author dwelled on scenes of torture and sexual abuse. I expected an inspiring tale of generations of strong women and got nauseated instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Read, Not Riveting","review":"I enjoy historical fiction and while the premise was interesting, I felt it was repetitive and the repetition slowed the story. The idea of the diamond being passed down through the ages could have been more compelling. Considering when this book was published, I'm sure many people felt it was quite innovative. I gave it four stars for the fact that it was an engaging read. If there was more research done it could have been more substantive. Some of the transitions from one Rachel to another were a bit sketchy. Also felt that all the Rachels had this indomitable spirit - it might have been more interesting if the Rachels had somewhat different personalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baa Baa Black Sheep Vol 1","review":"I purchased this for my husband who really enjoys this program because of the airplanes in it.

But the owners have decided to only release a subset of the episodes.For me, I will not purchase these until I can buy the complete set.Wouldn't it be great if my one voice could send a message to those who make the distribution decisions.And Amazon, you should allow a rating of zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memories","review":"Others have detailed the historical inaccuracy of Baa Baa Black Sheep while praising the portrayal of the air war in the South Pacific during WWII. The reason I love this show so much is because I watched it with my grandfather during its original NBC run back in the 70's. My \\"Pappy\\" was a veteran (6th Marine Division) of the fighting in the South Pacific and watching Baa Baa Black Sheep would always prompt him to share some of his war stories with me.

For the most part. By and large its a guy show. With Stephen J. Cannell at the helm what else could it be? The series had the approval and blessing of the real principle character, Gregory Boyington but then again he received criticism from his contemporaries for painting them as goofballs and screw ups rather than accomplished marine aviators. So if you're looking for historical accuracy you can probably forget it. What you will get is hours of entertaining stories that are plausible enough for your grandpa to say \\"Yea, that's just the way it happened.\\" Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy. If you want real history read a book. Most of us wish we had stories that we could polish like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"This is a great show which thankfuly, is now on dvd. I remember watching this show when it aired on tv and as an admirer of the F4U Corsair and the Black Sheep Squadron it was good to see this available. Even though the show is a fictionalized telling of the history of VMF-214 it does show actual F4U Corsairs which was one of the fastest fighter planes of WW II. Even the real Pappy Boyington shows up in one of the seasons. Hopefully season 3 of the series will be released soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aces","review":"It was as I remembered when it was first on television. This irreverant look at life as a marine pilot, was a roitious adventure. Greg 'Pappy' Boyington bent, broke, shattered the naval regulations every chance he could. although far fetched at times, the series held true to the spirit of the book.The ONLY complaint is that it takes 2 purchases to recieve ALL of season one.

But because of the humor, the beautiful illustration, and the poetically just ending, it soon became our favorite.One problem was that the library wanted it back.

I could watch Jennifer go grocery shopping and give it at least 3 stars.

As for this being a \\"comedy\\", well I didn't see too muchNow of course we are eventually told they are \\"still together\\" after one year\\" -apparently another successful \\"Cinderella\\" shackup 21st century style.Wedding Planner had all sorts of nuances and interesting things going on with time for the main characters to become real, this movie lacked that.The butler actor was quite good, he did a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD ,HORRIBLE!! i would give it 0 stars","review":"It was good but it was just like a walkin the park excepta little bit different i would not by this movie it was badand her friend was always talking about SEX!!!this is not as good as i thought it would be"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible movie","review":"This is a horrible movie. Jennifer Lopez has always produced great comedies, like The Wedding Planner, but this one was a huge flop. When I first saw it, I didn't get the impression that the cast felt their characters.

This is a horrible movie and I strongly discourage you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Cinderella","review":"One of Jen's better movies... she puts a \\"realness\\" in the role of Marisa that was missing in most of her other movies.

Of Course... but it's still a sweet romantic movie that'll have you smiling at the end. I'm not normally romantic but this movie had me giggling and smiling like an idiot :-D lol.Go on and pick this up, you won't regret it *waves bye*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old.......","review":"Why is it when some actors get some success they immediately go straight to the formulaic romantic comedy? Jennifer Lopez was great in \\"Out of Sight\\" and \\"Serena\\". But now all she makes are these follow the formula bore me to tears, not so comedic romantic comedies. The only exception of late was her movie \\"Enough\\", and when you saw the preview to that you automatically knew how it ended and didn't need to watch it. It is unfortunate when talented actors go straight to the easy money maker instead of looking for something challenging like the projects that showed us how good they are in the first place. And Mr. Fienes should know better, someone must have some blackmail info on him to get into this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really is a lousy way to spend an evening","review":"One of the most inane scripts ever to be \\"maid\\" into a movie, each and every one of the actors in this tripe, including such gifted actors as Bob Hoskins and Ralph Fiennes should apologize to every viewer of this dreck for the wasted 100 minutes that we will never get back from our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"A romantic tragedy","review":"Someone told me that 'Maid in Manhattan' was a romantic comedy - at least that's what it is/was supposed to be. But pardon me, it is a tragedy (at the box-office, for sure!).And this movie proves beyond all doubt that J.Lo cannot even enter the realm of acting. I pity Ralph Fiennes, for he is such a gifted actor, who was not used properly in this flick.The story? A senatorial candidate falls for a hotel maid, thinking that she is affluent, and they realise later that though the Manhattan and Bronx come 'as the crow flies', they are worlds apart.Watch this only if you are of the very romantic types. Again, if you are too bored with yourself, then try watching this.

Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending. There's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"JLo sux big time","review":"This movie is awful.

Mostly i was just moved by this movie because i went into the theater in a bad mood from a rough day, and left the theater with a smile on my face.

Never taxing on the brain but I was happy to see some truew character development that seems to be lacking in many romantic comedies that my wife drags me to.

Yes my wife and I predicted the entire plot in the car on the parking lot before we went in but we knew what we were in store for. It was a cute, fun little movie. I would reccommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic, vomit-inducing","review":"I cannot fathom why on earth, the perfectly talented Ralph Fiennes would ever choose to star in a film like this. Perhaps it was to get away from his usual dramatic stuff. However, this is literally the last type of film I'd ever want to see him in. And don't get me wrong, he was good in this. He's good in everything. But he is just a very small part of this film. Everything, from the plot to the characters is just so unrealistic. Its almost unwatchable. Its utter rubbish, no one could ever believe in this movie. Its like Pretty Woman part deaux. Jennifer Lopez's almost unnatural sweetness does nothing for this film except to sink it lower.

It's not even funny, so it cannot be a romantic comedy. I think it is sort of a melodrama.Lopez makes it clear that is not a good actress (full of blinks, gasps and tics), and Fiennes is dull and annoying (yes: a real politician).Besides it is annoyingly full of stereotypes (see the legion of maids of the hotel, see the politician's team, see the awful scene in the jewellery). The story of Cinderella is re-visited for the n-th time and the final is really predictable. Oh, where is true love?There are no strange situations, no close encounters, no blinking gazes, no love tears and no love joy. Very superficial.I really prefer Jennifer Lopez being JLo. See whatta mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"I hated this terrible movie. There was no plot, no character development and why did Ralph Fiennes agree to act in such an atrocious motion picture? Surely he doesn't need the money. So much of PRETTY WOMAN has been unoriginally hackneyed; only this time it's a maid (in a 5 star hotel in Manhattan) who tries on a socialite's $5,000 outfit (from one of the rooms she cleans). She and her son then take a walk (with a future senator--Fiennes as Chris Marshall) to the zoo and the two adults fall madly in love with each other. I don't need to tell you what happens next although you can guess. Ironically, at the end there is a press conference aka NOTTINGHILL where the adorable Hugh Grant--I'm sorry, I mean the maid's son, questions Marshall about forgiving his mother. Even if you like the main characters (I'm actually a big fan of Fiennes) you will not like this film. Plain and simple, this movie stinks and I am warning you: Do not waste your time with this mindless drivel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Romantic Comedy!!!","review":"The other day, I watched this movie 'just for the heck of it' I actually liked it!

When Marisa is forced to put some expensive clothes on, senatorial candidate Christopher Marshall sees her and Ty and they take a walk around the park. They begin to like each other, and eventually fall in love but Chris doesn't know that Marisa is just a hotel maid. When he finds out the truth, will Chris still love her?

So we had to watch it. It wasn't as bad as I thought is was going to be. The movie was very predictable. No surprise, but still kept my attention. Jennifer Lopez is in her element playing a working class mom, opposed to upper-class Italians (Wedding Planner) or ballroom teachers (Shall We Dance?). Ralph Feines added a touch of class to the movie. Natasha Richardson provided the only humor in the movie. The little kid was pretty good. For J.Lo fans, she looked amazing towards the end.All in all, nothing new or groundbreaking, but maybe it's a movieto watch when there's nothing else on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"This movie is obviously some kind of \\"star making\\" movie vehicle for Jennifer Lopez. Unfortunately, it takes more than J. Lo. to make a movie. She was believable as a mother and a maid and as someone striving for more, but she and Ralph Fiennes have no on screen chemistry. His British accent kept popping through. Also, in one scene, Jennifer borrows the clothes of a wealthy guest and she looks just like she does in the Enquirer! You can see the end of this moving coming after just five minutes. The one bright spot is boy who plays her son, who did a great job! If you want to see a movie about people from two different worlds getting together in a love story, try Two Weeks Notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cringworthy ...","review":"I love boy meets girl films. I have them all in my collection. The only reason I was interested in seeing this film is because Ralph Fiennes was starring in it. What a shock!! The question begs to be asked, was he paid millions or was he not in possession of his five senses when he agreed to star in this piece of junk. There is absolutely no chemistry between him and J Lo at all, nothing, not a piece, not a sniff. I was bored and couldn't wait for it to finish. In most romantic films you are left wondering whether the actor and actress get together off set life because they make it look so believable on screen. If you are hoping to see another - Pretty Woman, Only You, The American President, then please save your money. This film was terrible. Shame on you, Ralph."},{"rating":"1","title":"another star vehicle","review":"Jennifer Lopez made some interesting films early in her career (mid 90s) such as U-Turn, Money Train (small part) and Out of Sight. She was on her way to becoming a dependable character actress. Then she morphed suddenly from Jennifer Lopez to J-Lo, media and pop superstar.Since then, Lopez has turned into a pretty, female Hispanic version of the early 1960s Elvis - churning out bad movies in between forgettable pop albums, one after another. Her films are largely vehicles to show off how adorable and talented she is.Lopez is clearly trying to reclaim her working class roots by making this film about an Hispanic single mother who somehow gets the rich (white) guy. If this film is another failure, Lopez should fire her agent and start looking for smaller parts in less \\"Hollywood\\" productions. Movie audiences didn't buy J-Lo, media superstar, as an abused wife or cop and they might not buy this role either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Torture...","review":"The acting is bad, very bad. The story is so dumb it makes my brain bleed. Sure, JLo has a big booty but does that mean she can act? I tolerated her wooden performance in The Cell, due to the special effects and the presence of real actors in the film; but she keeps making these horrible flicks!Let me put it this way: I'd rather watch Mariah Carey's \\"Glitter\\" than sit through this horrible JLo commercial again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchanting and Insperational","review":"Ralph Fiennes is way to hot and old for J. LO. This is supposed to be a romantic comidy, but the ending is determined when the maid(J Lo) spots the senator(Ralph) they fall deeply in love and the to be senator who we know will of course win falls in love with the maid's overly perfect and politically correct son, who's only ten and loves Nixen. Anyways when the to be senator chris finds out beautiful yet we remember we're not supposed to judge her on her looks J. Lo is maid all he can say is \\"oh\\" and then there's an expression on his face as if he knows the movie is terrible and is a complete waste of time and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Romantic","review":"One of the key ingredients for any romantic comedy is some kind of electricity between the stars. Jennifer Lopez andRalph Fiennes not only have no sparks, they are in movie that relies so heavily on formula that the formula seems more than ordinarily forced. For example, Jennifer Lopez's character has to go to a \\"ball\\" so she can seem like Cinderella, only she doesn't stay very long and nothing notable happens. Then, her \\"Prince Charming\\" chases after her and they wind up in bed. All the time Jennifer Lopez's character is being deceitful as to her true identity ... also a forced plot device. This movie attempts to create a modern take on an old classic ... that is, if the movie is actually attempting anything other than getting box office sales. There is no story. There is no romance. There is no magic. I cannot imagine anyone wanting to see this movie more than once; it is not worth having in your video or DVD library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy any DVD's from the UK","review":"I purchased this DVD but it was from the UK and those DVD's do not play in the United States.

Lo's attempt at acting! The little boy's part in the movie was endearing; however, it was overshadowed by poor casting and almost unwatchable bad acting from both lead actors. The age difference between the two leads and chemistry needed for a romantic comedy was missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story Plot Really Badly Shamefully SUCKS!","review":"Got this movie because really was curious to see how J.Lo matching with Ralph Fiennes. The acting are so so but the story plot really badly shamefully sucks. J. Lo's hotel maid character is in fact a dishonest petty thief for she stole a rich hotel female guest's clothes and then went out with a VIP rich male hotel guest (Ralph Fien) for a date during her working hours. And.... Gee..... as that's not bad enough she even went as far as to sleep with that VIP male hotel Guest in his hotel room where she worked! The producer story writer of this film perceive such despicable behavior as some sort of daring courageous heroic class act. Don't they know there's something call \\"bottom line\\" which you don't cross?This movie shamefully glorifies a dishonest petty thief maid whom they think OK to cross all bottom lines to get what she want, even to steal and to lie.

Wait, I guess it should be expected that a singer gone actress film would have it's problems, but this film has some real problems! The plot is reminicent of Sleepless in Seattle where the kid is the one who makes the parent fall in love, and gets things going. It really is a cinderella film, one that has been made again and again since movies have been around because I know I've seen this film about 20 times before. The acting is OK, but I didn't see a good mesh between the characters. Everything seemed to happen \\"the way it should\\" in these chick flick sort of films. I just wouldn't waste my time watching it again, because it is unmoving and quite bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero chemistry","review":"Primarily, I detected no chemistry between the main characters and just couldn't believe that any depth of feeling developed from their brief and uncomfortable meeting in the park. Certainly not enough to spiral into the farce that followed. Her nobility of purpose in first, not telling him the truth and second, running away from him, was so unlikely and insincere that it set my teeth on edge. The Cinderella storyline allowed the viewer to predict the ending, eliminating even the small pleasure of mystery and doubt. The child's personality and thought pattern was written as though he were a mature, asexual adult with cute playful child-like attributes to remind us that we were watching a child. The male lead was occasionally convincing with his piercing stare and undivided attention but absolutely unconvincing as the offended and decieved lover. I walked out of the theatre bored and undiverted by this film. Don't waste your money - wait for it to hit cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificially sweet and what an unoriginal storyline!","review":"This movie was so trite it was almost sickening. How many scenes can we be expected to watch that have obviously been engineered to showcase Jennifer Lopez's looks? She is not so beautiful that I want to look at her in every outfit from every angle the entire movie!I was so disappointed in the performance by Fienes (sp?). He is such a phenomenal actor - one has to wonder why in the world he would take such a soppy role and especially with such a cliched, stale script/storyline! UGH."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this movie was a recipe...","review":"it would look something like this:- take your usual romantic comedy formula (if it worked before, why change anything, right?)- add an actor who is completely out of his usual genre, to add a taste of 'quality' to the film.- add an actress who can't act, but has an impressive behind (which can be used in jokes).- try to blend in some social issue - again, to add 'quality' - like issueto the movie.The result: 'Maid in Manhattean' - a boring, perdictable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This Movie","review":"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I rented it last week with my roomates because we enjoy chick flicks, but this was just painful. There are no funny moments in it and the story is such a TIRED ripoff of Pretty Woman. Even the fairy godfather Hector Elizondo and the corrupt Jason Alexander characters are copied in this movie (by Bob Haskett and Stanely Tucci respectively).The main problem with this movie is that the 2 leads, Lopez and Fiennes have absolutely no onscreen chemistry. Fieness makes an attempt to have the audience believe he is smitten with Lopez's character, but not once to we believe she has the slightest interest in him.I give this movie 2 stars however because the young actor who plays J Lo's son is absolutely adorable and steals every scene he's in. It's too bad the story couldn't center around him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinderella In Manhattan","review":"The plot you have seen before in Disney's Cinderella, complete with midnight \\"pumpkin\\" suspense. There is a even a Bibbity Bobbity Boo-style dance scene, one of the best laughs of the show with a rotund black Flora energetically bopping about.Ed Asner as the dignified butler in a ritzy hotel steals the show every time he comes on.The child actor, Tyler Posey, as Ty Ventura, Lopez's son, did an excellent job of playing adorable child, tugging at the heartstrings without being overly saccharine.Best line in the movie:\\"Can you keep a secret?\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"Well so can I.\\"The only time I burst out in guffaws was when Lopez did her makeover converting from an exceptionally attractive Sandra Bullock-style natural beauty to Audrey Hepburn in the My Fair Lady grand ball scene with makeup by Tammy Fae Bakker, that made it look as if she had an eye disease causing her eyelids to sweat profusely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of the 1920s.","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It tells an amazing story of the people who introduced America into the modern age, it covers everything from fashion, technology, and entertainment, as well as many other things. This book is not too lengthy or dull, it gets straight to the point. While reading it you almost feel like you are a part of the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comparatively speaking . . .","review":"Yes, yep, ok - there is quite a lot here in the way of anecdotal and downright gossipy juicy goodness. Lots of little-known facts about political and social figures and about the Flapper as her own peculiar demographic.However, the author's assertions that Reconstruction was a good thing and that the Volstead Act achieved what it set out to do both give rise to the inevitable suspicion that if he was wrong on both these counts (as he very clearly was), then the veracity of his work and indeed his believablily as an historian is in serious doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorifies immorality","review":"Flappers were the strippers of the 1920s. They may be glorified today, sort of like women who wear burkas and prostitutes are alwasy glorified as being 'independent women...making their own way' but it is merely a big fallacy. These women arn't role models and the biggest problem with society is that we tell young girls this is the role model(this or a burka). For the young woman she is told \\"the only thing that matters in you is your but, your eyes, your legs and how you can shake it\\". Yes this was America in 1925, and...its is America today. The only difference is that today the academics also glorify the burka and the hijab. Yes, one thing changed...the music got worse.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read book on change in the 1920s","review":"Fascinating read about the changing mores of American society. Zeitz doesn't shrink away from presenting both the good and the bad, what was gained and its price. And any good drama has conflict of course. Information is presented as an integral part of human stories and so never suffers from the dry tone of many historical books. A must for anyone interested in American history and especially that of the Jazz Age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Loved this book! I just couldn't put it down!! Interesting, and vibrantly written. Who knew our great grandmother's were so scandalous!? I sure didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Joshua Zeitz deftly introduces readers to the everyday lives of Americans in the 1920's, from celebrities and executives living out their extraordinary dreams in the saftey of high society to the working-class populace trying to tread water in a sea of consumerism. If you are intrigued by the ever-evolving topics of fashion, advertising, film, literature, and popular culture, Zeitz's book will oblige. To add to the enjoyment of reading this book, he's a very good writer with a definite knowledge of how to present historical material in a meaningful and interesting way. I just wish he'd take up the pen again and provide his insight to the 30's, 40's, 50's, etc. as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great condition","review":"The book was in great condition to be a used copy.

Although my opinion may be biased because I enjoy the comedy of both of the main characters, I can confidently say that Bad Boys is one of the better action/comedy flicks with considerable replay value.

The movie was to loud, it was like watching a bad MTV video, and I find Martin Lawrence to be incredibly irritating.

So later my brother just keeps putting it on and he got sick of it and put it away. I can't believe they made this movie. I give this DVD 2 thumbs down way down. This movie is the worst Michael Bay movie ever. I can't believe they are going to make a Bad Boys 2 but if I see Bad Boys 2 I hope it will be way better than the first one.

Best of all there both togeher and they make an awsome team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -- unless you are a Tea Leoni fan","review":"This movie depends heavily on the interactions between Martin Lawrence (amazingly thin!) and Will Smith. To my mind, their banter seems strained and not very funny. Will Smith is always worth watching, but Martin Lawrence is obviously trying to put his lines over by sheer force. To make a rather strange comparison, it kind of reminded me of some of the dialog in the later Marx Brothers movies: Delivered with gusto, but not, unfortunately, very funny. The plot is completely unbelievable and seems pretty much an afterthought. One bright spot: Tea Leoni proves that she has the best legs in Hollywood. Wearing some super-short skirts, she is definitely the best thing in the picture. Add two stars to my rating if you are a Tea fan. Add three stars if you have a big league crush on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard fare formula cop drama","review":"Nothing unique or original here. The family man cop and the loose canon ladies man cop bust the drug kingpin.A weak story with lots of over-the-top unrealistic gun fights.I expected some Profanity but when there is so much and it is used with such abandon, it becomes pointless.

It stars Will Smith (the Frensh Prince of Bell Air) and Martin Lawerance (Martain/Blue Streak) as two Miami cops, both are two very funny actors who took to the action role very well (of course Will Smith as continued on so in this role in films like ID4 and Men in black). The film produces great action and boasting good soundtrack(songs such as Shy guy) from the talents of a great director(This film really started Michael Bay's carear and is still one of his best).I know its not everyones cup of tea, but if you like your movies fast, sexy, loud and action packed buy the DVD now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"smith & lawrence make Bad Boys a blast","review":"if one is looking for an action/comedy, cop-buddy movie, this is the one. lawrence and smith are definitly very funny in this movie and you can tell they had a blast making it.this is micheal bay's movie directorial debut and he directs it with flash and style... there is energy and excitement in each of his shots. the plot is cliche, the story predictable, the characters are poorly defined. even bay admits the script wasn't the best. but its the performances turned in by the main actors and bay's visual style that makes what could have been a standard lethal weapon rip off into one hell of a fun movie.as a side note, mark mancina's score for this movie is among the best I've heard in an action movie. he has fast paced pieces for the action scenes and slow, beautiful music for the scenes involving emotions. without his music, Bad Boys would have been a little less enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Boys","review":"will smith & Martin lawrance are wickedly funnny in this nonstop comedy action flick. this movie is sooo good. if you haven't seen it then it's a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was a really good ation/comedy movie.","review":"This movie had just the right characters to play just the right parts.

It's really nice. He also doesn't tip over easily, with only knee joints to adjust. I plan to glue the arrow and bowstring permanently to this archers hand for full draw pose, but will have to replace the string to do so, which is no big deal.

An album you can listen after a long day at the office or when you just want to sit around and relax during the afternoon.Favorites: The Way I'm Feeling Tonight, You Give Me Something (My favorite!!), Satisfied, Close to Me, It Goes Without Saying, and Some Kinda Love.I also recommend \\"Blue Views,\\" all of Carrack's works from the 80's, and give Michael McDonald a listen!

Their was a high preist that came to the artist to ask him to paint a picture of their Lord Buddas death.This painting would include all the animals that came to be blessed by budda and a cat who refused budda teachings. The artist's cat good fortune was so happy that the artist painted a cat that she died and went to heaven from being overjoyed.

The story teaches children a little about Buddhism and about the concept of reincarnation. The artist paints pictures of the animals coming to be blessed by Buddha. But, legend said that cats never came. The artist's cat, Good Fortune, wishes to be included in the painting. Finally, the artist relents and Good Fortune dies from joy. But the priests now no longer want the painting since it doesn't agree with legend. The next day, however, they change their minds when a \\"miracle\\" occurs. Coatsworth was well-known for her children's stories and this short story is one of the classics of children literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will gently change your child's life","review":"I read this book in childhood and never forgot it.

I thought my imagination was failing or I was adversely affected by a heavy work load, but I haven't had these problem with other writers. I finally decided the description is poor, and the style is jerky, disjointed -- distractingly annoying. A little \\"he said, she said\\" would have been very helpful and appreciated.

While the material of good quality and the bag holds up nicely, the shoulder straps attach in an A-design near the top of the bag, verses a H-design found on most backpacks. The problem with this is that weights in excess of 7 lbs will pull on your neck muscles in a spreading manner unless you loosen the straps, at which point the bag pulls back on your shoulders vs. downward like it should. Long story short, it will feel like you've been packing 30 lbs for 4 hours within 20 minutes of hiking. No padding on the shoulder straps also have it rub into your skin in a less than comfortable manner.As much as I like the durability of canvas, I would not recommend this pack.While it costs a good penny more, I would highly recommend theSnugpak Rocket Pak System,.

I think it's common sense to reduce sibilance when working with vocal recordings and not to increase it by using, somehow, a combination of treble boost with reverberation. I don't understand why the vocals of Katie Melua were processed in this way. It's definitely annoying and causing ear fatigue. Maybe not everybody is experiencing this, it can depend on the kind of stereo system, speakers etc. you've got but a well mixed and mastered CD should play on every system in an acceptable way.The fact that certain parts are clipping is, very unfortunately, a common aspect in modern commercial recordings. Everything has to be as loud as possible, even this kind of music, which would be so much better without being hypercompressed. It's too bad, 'cause the songs are very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great singer/song writer.","review":"Katie Melua has achived great heights in the musical sphere, world wide and especially in UK and Eurpoe.

Katie Melua is better known in the UK and still need to be discovered more by the masses in N. America. She's definitely in the ranks of other current great female blues/jazz vocalists like Diana Krall and Norah Jones. Her vocal style is different from the two singers mentioned but I found it a nice refreshing change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable to listen to again and again...","review":"I like a variety of music and this CD caught my attention while browsing in a book-music store. Impressed, I bought the album and then went to a Melua concert at the Montreal Jazz fest. She was equally impressive live, displaying a low key, delightful sense of humor along the way. On the CD I like the melodies and intelligent lyrics which don't repeat adnauseam typical of so many popular songs; solid group of musicians; and Katie's singing which doesn't try to overpower, but rather subtly insinuates and seduces. I suspect if she takes care of her voice, it will grow better and better. Mike Batt's and Melua's lyric writing and tuneful music will also, I hope, continue to grow. I don't always like a mellow album, but this one \\"works\\". However, only time will tell if Melua will be able to keep producing fresh material (along with Mike Batt).

It is not a long book you will read slowly and once, but a short book that you will first read quickly, and then again and again more carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"NR Does it again !","review":"I loved this trilogy. Book one, Blue Dahlia introduces us to a woman(Stella) and her young sons who have just lost their husband/father in an accident. Stella's life turns in a different direction as she decided to relocate herself and her children to Tennessee to be closer to her dad. She takes a job at a greenhouse owned by a wealthy heiress(Roz). She ends up living in the house/mansion with Roz, her gay cook, and her little boys. I love how Robert's makes you feel as if you are a guest in this beautiful , old mansion. The characters have such a great chemistry with one another. I love it when Roberts has the characters sitting together in a cozy room in this house sharing food and drinks while discussing the paranormal activity in the house. The paranormal issue in this story almost takes a backseat at times to the overall feeling of closeness and warmth of these characters. Love it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable - not my favorite however","review":"Now honestly I loved the Three Sisters Island story with its storyline tied in with witchcraft. I could believe that. The ghost storyline in this book isn't as believeable as it could be and feels flimsy at times. However that's not to stay that this book isn't worthwhile. Nora Roberts is a great read and she knows how to keep a reader on her (or his) seat. I like the fact that Nora Roberts is now putting a seal (NR) on her NEW works. Earlier this year I accidentally bought one of her old works - which was put out to look like a new one. This makes it much easier for me to know that this was new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Using the same formula- unsuccessfully this time","review":"Nora has a regular formula she uses in all her books, most times the stories are interesting enough that you don't care they are really canned formulas, but this attempt- I had to force myself the finish this trilogy. Also- was so sickening the way every alternate page one of the characters would start crying, emotion is great in moderation.Worst book of Nora Roberts ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Dahlia","review":"Fortunately, I only spent 5.95 on this $7.99 book. I spent$5.00 more than I should have. It is almost like it is notNora Roberts writing. I was very disappointed as I was with the\\"Key books\\". Don't waste your time or money. What happened tonovels like she used to write....Montana Sky, etc.?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Devolution","review":"DevolutionWhile I have always been an avid fan of Nora Roberts, almost compulsively so, I have found myself of late growing weary and and disappointed. Nora, the queen of characterizations, has reached the end of her archetypes. From the first introduction of Stella, a seasoned NR reader can easily predict with whom she will be paired, befriend and the demons to be fought. Roz and Logan and Harper have appeared before, each with her or his 'clever' thoughts and glib language and inevitable reactions. Nora's writing has grown lazy, with each character sharing the same pedestrian voice, and without context, each is nearly indistinguishable from the other. I long for the days of Honest Illusions and the McKade brothers, when I was surprised by the genre and amazed by Nora's ability to defy the cliches of romantic traditions. When will we see her kind again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Dahlia","review":"I love Nora Roberts trilogies, but this book is reaaaally bad! I bought this book before a long plane trip thinking it would make my trip less tedious but it was a big mistake, I just got upset that the book was so boring! There were times I thought I was reading a book about gardening instead of a romance, I had to skip several pages just to come back to the story. Really it is ok to describe a little about gardening but to dedicate several pages to it...? Way too much gardening information in a romance novel where you want to see more interaction between the characters and less info about plants! Skip this book altogether, you'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I have to agree with the others, this isn't one of Nora's best. It's not even researched that well, she writes about what a beautiful spring it is in Tennessee, and not once does she mention the red bud trees. You can't help but notice them when they bloom, the hills turn red-violet. The love story was flat. However, the supporting characters were not too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising new series!","review":"A great start to a new series! I love Stella and her organized ways - reminds me of myself, I think! But just great characters and a involving read!Roberts has been going towards \\"ghosty\\" plots and this is another one that is in the same vien. Enter the new manager (Stella) who comes into the house with her boys and then the house ghost starts acting up. If you don't like paranormal, this is not the series for you, but if you on the fence, this isn't a complete fantasy, much of more a romance, so you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Does It Again","review":"I found that like all other Nora Roberts reads this one was wonderful. Being a mother of 3, her writing invites me into a bit of an escape from the moment. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Blue Dahlia. Stella's character could be any one of us mothers and truly encompasses you into her life. I think that Nora's trilogies are among the best ever and will gladly give her \\"props\\" where it is deserved. For me Blue Dahlia was a wonderful beginning to this set of trilogies. I love the fact that in some way you can always relate to her characters, whether its the mother, friend, or lover. I'm eagerly anticipating reading the next two novels in this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next one!","review":"This is one of my favorite NR so far. The characters are appealing even if they are a little flat. I love the ghost aspect. I even liked the gardening stuff. It makes me want to run out and plant a garden- too bad it's the middle of winter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from her best book","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. I own just about every one she's ever published. It took me a month to plod through this one, and I did not enjoy it at all. It got bogged down in the details of gardening and family history. The Reader's Digest Condensed version of her writing here would be much preferable! I own the next two, but won't be even trying to read them, much as I really do love her stuff.Instead, I recommend the MacGregor series. They're all fabulous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Dahlia","review":"Though it is not the fault of the seller, I can't rate this book on audio because it is in a format that I have no means to access. I meant to order the book on CD and thought I had until the book on tapes came in."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant and heart warming","review":"The book starts out with in interesting hint of history followed by some really great characters that you immediately want to know about. You end up liking what they like and hating what they hate. Good start to a good series but if you are expecting some rough stuff like Eve from the \\"in Death\\" you won't get it. This book is softer but with more mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uneventful","review":"This was the first book I read about the oh so wonderful Nora Roberts. I was not impressed at all. This book was plain old boring. I mean who couldn't figure out who the ghost was? I mean she told us right from the start. No real details. I could see Logan and Stella a mile away. I have read the other reviews and I know that Nora Roberts is a good author/writer. I sure hope that book two in the trilogy will have more substance. I am off to start the Lighting series. I would pass this book and wait till June2005 for book two. You won't miss much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars","review":"The magic of Nora Roberts's writing is even if you know nothing about things (glass art from Born in Hot and making boats), she writes them in a way that you feel like you know about glass art or other stuff and she can paint such a vivid picture of the city or town her stories were set, I felt completely lost Blue Dahlia. I have no idea what half of them were talking about in the book when they talked about flowers and gardening and I never felt like I was in Memphis. The same with Stella and Logan, where was the romance? Most of the time they weren't together and when they were it was flat. I hope Black Rose will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Beginning!","review":"I loved this book, and I can hardly wait for the rest of the trilogy! I thought the ghost story was really fun and set up nicely for the following books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Dahlia","review":"Another one of Nora's Best! I found this book extremely hard to put down. A page turner from beginning til the end! I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Nora Roberts or has never read her before.......2 thumbs way up!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I flew right through it!","review":"Well, being the Nora Roberts fan I am, I picked this book up right away and I really enjoyed it. Stella has just moved to Tennesse to be by her father and stepmother, after losing her husband a few years before in a tragic accident. She takes a job at the local nursery as a manager and meets Logan, the landscape designer for the company. The two have a definate sizzle together and it was fun reading as they continously butted heads about everything. This book was really great because there was a little less fairy tale and a bit more, you annoy me. Which, lets face it, if you've every been in love it can be highly annoying a lot of the time.And of course there is the ghost which has decided that she doesn't like the romance between Stella and Logan. Anyways, this book definetly leaves you with some questions that all good first trilogy books do. I for one can not wait for the next book to come out. I you like Nora Roberts or contemporary romance novels, check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Nora Roberts actually write this?","review":"I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer. The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel. I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first book of the Garden Trilogy","review":"This novel tells two stories one of the women now ghost who lives in the Harper House and the second of the Stella who moves down south after her husband dies in a plane crash. The love story between Stella and Logan is fun and heated. The mystery of the ghost follows through out the Trilogy. Another winner from Nora Roberts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Fan","review":"I love Nora Roberts and i did enjoy this book. I can't wait for the others to come out. The only thing thats bad is waiting so long for the other to come out and you kind of have to go back to the first book. Other then that keep up the good work!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I really like this book. I always like strong female characters and this book is filled with them. This is just the beginning and I'm already hooked. The only part a really didn't like was the Harper ghost but a good story. Red Lily is the one I can't wait for. I know I'm going to enjoy that one because I love Hayley's character and Harper is going to be a great character to dive into!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first Nora Roberts book","review":"I purchased this as my first Nora Roberts book and just fell in love with the scenery and the characters. I felt like I was one of them. I liked it so much that I had a hard time putting it down, and that rarely happens!! I usually take forever to get through a book but this wasn't one of them. The is a good book if you are just getting into Nora Roberts' books. I loved it so much I immediately went out and bought the other 2 in the series!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Dahlia","review":"I read this book to please our Book Club leader. I guess I'm just not a Nora Roberts fan. There is absolutely no substance to this book. Boy meets girls. Fall in love. Live happily ever after. And, oh, by the way, there's a ghost in the attic. SIGH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Flowers of the Garden Trilogy","review":"As an author ofBirth (Executive Wives' Club), I understand the important of creating a family of characters that readers will love. Stella and Logan's love affair excites everyone in the household of women. They come together and share not only their problems but the joy of creating a new beginning. As always, Nora delivers with a story that makes you want more. She's the reason I love series and like to write them.So what's the best part, personally I enjoy Stella's boys and how they help the couple come together and find what they want out of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Nora Roberts seems to be dragging out this one. Other than Harper Bride Ghost, the other characters are just plain predicatable. 2 ** for the Harper Bride Ghost for sending chills down my spine. Otherwise, I couldn't wait to get to the end just to see how the story goes. And then the ending felt sudden and disjointed. Unstatisfactory read."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Book","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. As far as paperback romances go, it was OK. I read it quickly and will probably not pick up the other two in the series (Black something and red something, both flowers). Protagonist is a gardener...not really my thing, but OK book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait until the next one","review":"I completed this book and started the next one the same day. It is a little different from Nora Roberts's usual book--but loved it and am sure will like the next two as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Dahlia","review":"I 'read' this book with an unabridged audio tape. It is one of the best Nora Roberts books I have read - and I have read just about all of her books. Not the J D Robb books, but I'm not into detective books. The story was fascinating from the very beginning. In some of Ms. Roberts' books, I find myself paging through descriptions but this one kept my attention through all 8 tapes. The story of Stella and Logan is totally enjoyable. And, I must admit, I am looking forward to Hailey and Harper's story as well as Roz and Mitchell's story. I hope I don't have to wait too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"great work of reconstructing a past, day-by-day.","review":"It describes incredibly detailed the birth and the growing up of this great band, a few years almost day-by-day (not to mention the very nice pitures)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight heavyweight","review":"Buchanan seems to be a lightweight in this field. The big names are people like Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz, but their books are barely readable. Buchanan writes an interesting book and makes it compelling for the layman. In fact, I have read it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty and Unfocused","review":"I got the feeling that the author couldnt find enough material to write a full book so he decided to distort the idea of \\"small worlds\\" to include everything from the internet, to economics, to biology, to disease, and beyond. Theres no real focus, its just a bunch of mishmosh subject matter bundled together under the vague category \\"small worlds.\\" Theres no real substance to this book at all. It jumps around topic to topic with no depth nor acknowledgment to the uniqueness between subjects that result in the outcome they produce except only \\"hey doesnt this look like a small world pattern just like the all the rest?\\" The author reminds me of those crazy people who claim to see the number 12 or 22 in everything they come across. Go to a bookstore and look through this book yourself if you can. If you've read Gladwells Tipping Point, this book is no where near as insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discomfiture, anger, displeasure","review":"This book is quite an unassuming work, full of redundant repetitions, inadequate citations, examples nothing to do with the subject-matter, incoherent and obscure trains of thought and a lot of uninformative bla-blas and small-talks. Moreover, the text does not construe, not edited properly and literally worthless. A total bust, which can not be salvaged by the freshness and excitement of its issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but could be a lot shorter as it feels like it lacks focus","review":"I was interested by Mark Buchanan's work because of the understanding that it promised for networks. Buchanan does a good job at simplifying scientific theory in a similar to James Gleick at the start of the book and it certainly provides food for thought. However, the book could be a third shorter if the editors had cut out the Malcolm Gladwellesque detours which add no value to the books central premise. I'd advise you to save your money and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely frustrating","review":"The subject that Mark Buchanan addresses is, in itself, significant and fascinating. And Mr. Buchanan knows his stuff. He provides excellent visuals and thorough notes that many readers will find useful.Why, then, do I find it so frustrating? Simply put, Mr. Buchanan may be a first-class editor, but he is not a very good writer. Not that he can't write a grammatical sentence. He just has trouble structuring one that leads unambiguously from one idea to another.Thus, as interesting as I find the subject, it took me three years to force myself to finish the book. I am quite willing to reread something if, ultimately, I learn it. But I hate to be fighting constantly with the writer, trying to understand which of three possible concepts he's trying to convey.And then there's the minor annoyance of the cover stock (paperback edition). It was curling before I left the bookstore, and it will never uncurl."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Two Hour Cliche","review":"I could not disagree more with the other reviewer. This ENTIRE film was totally predictable. It was a series of scenes that we've all seen a thousand times in our lives all put into one movie. The first hour is excruciatingly boring. The lead character (besides his hideous \\"man bangs\\") just \\"broods\\" in scene after scene, troubled for seemingly no reason at all. His boyfriend, a \\"wifey-queen\\" in every respect, makes the whole scenario a very obvious role-playing thing. It's another film about an un-accepting family and the 'should a kid be raised by gays' thing, which we've all seen 100 times. It is very melodramatic, almost laughable in several parts. In fact, the very problem is--it's TOO \\"normal.\\" Is that what we see movies for? The other reviewer said 'finally something DECENT.' Must \\"decent\\" be so extremely boring?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"The canopy bar broke only two days after Christmas.Now I have a sharp end on the bed frame.

I think the pattern is adorable. The only draw back I have with this is the canopy is only in there by 2 little prongs and if you go to pick the crib up by it, it pops off there is nothing there to hold it on. I suggest getting a super glue or gorilla glue and use that so it will never come off. Also you have to slide the canopy in through the sewn hole and then put it on. Other then that I love the product I would recommend it to everyone. It roles with ease and I know the first thing my daughter did was climb inside it and she is 25 pounds and it held her. She loves it. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on Christmas day!","review":"Beware this bed although adorable and cute, it has a design flaw. Our canopy bar also broke off shortly after assembling, actually on Christmas day. Now we too have an exposed sharp bar (great for a 3 year old!) and can no longer attach our canopy.

From what theories drive human interaction, to learning gender roles and sterotypes, the perpetuators of gender sterotyping. We still choose who to marry by how we look, as opposed to intrinsic factors of humanness. Poverty? this book identifies why we need it and who benefits from it. Women and Children?....the most vulnarable population...is it governmental priority?....not hardly! Global male dominance?...alive,well, and thriving! This text should be required reading on every college prep and university campus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book ...If I could reward more than 5 stars I would","review":"This is probably the best Sociology books that I have ever read.It's both informative and thought provoking. Not only is the book full of useful chapter material that anyone... not just students, can use in everyday life. It is also filled with interesting history in \\"changes\\" boxes and fun filled facts in \\"choices\\" boxes. Even the \\"ask yourself\\" quizzes are worth reading.

After reading it, all I could do was say \\"wow\\".

Within the first few pages I was blown away. Houellebecq's honest and raw narrative is astounding and truly memorable. Although disturbing and even, at times, depressing, this novel is indeed one to make you think. The relationship between Bruno and Michel is painful yet somehow refreshing, a break from the norm. 'Atomised' is definitely one to give a new perspective on life and I challenge you to want to put it down for any other reason that to wipe the tears away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winner of the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award?","review":"To be fair, Atomised has some very brilliant, thought-provoking ideas- however, I am not into smut, which this book seems to have a cornucopia of... In between the brilliance was too much vulgarity, shallowness, sexual addiction, pedophilia, desire for incest, extreme hazing, extreme depression, dysfunctional personalities, and suicide... I suppose one could argue that \`this is life,' but my response to that would be- can't one save the money by watching the news and getting the same story versus shelling out hard-earned cash for this book? Oh, and for those of us who read Asimov's final Foundation book, the Atomised epilogue was the least impressive part...reinventing the human race...been there done that book-wise. I suppose Atomised has some interesting statements to make about the time in which it was written, but winner of the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award? I just don't see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub Zero","review":"A friend lent me this book, as it had some intellectual underpinnings. I must say that it is one of the worst books I have read in ages. The author is apparently French and was raised by hippies. One can sympathize with him for having such a dreadful upbringing. However the book is full of revolting sexual images. Reading the critical response the theme of the book is apparently with the collapse of the old morality society has become fragmented and pointless. This apparently gives the author some leeway to write about a character who spends most of his time jerking off after seeing young girls. The book is full of big statements such as \\"there is no such thing as homosexuality. All homosexuals are pedophiles who would drop their current partner for an 18 year old\\". Generally the book is dull, semi pornographic and filled with bald pretentious observations about the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, Jimmy","review":"The last several JB CDs have been a bit introspective, lacking the old free spirit feeling of the earlier releases. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, mind you, for we parrot heads simply enjoy anything Jimmy releases. That being said, however, it's really good to go back to the light and fancy free Buffett we all know and love. The original songs harken back to the good old times, and Jimmy can take someone's else's song and make it distinctly his own. I wait very impatiently for every new Buffett release, and this one has made the wait well worth while. Party on, Jimmy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I bought this CD for my husband for Christmas. We are Jimmy Buffett fans and own most of his CD's.

Best tracts are the title song which features the vocals of the entire band instead of Jimmy in the forefront, and \\"Breathe In, Breath Out\\" which is a fitting song for the people of New Orleans, telling them to quit complaining, quit blaming the government, and just take control over their own situation. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I don't know...\\"","review":"I have only listened to the CD a couple of times yet I couldn't keep from trying to decide what the heck he was trying to do on this release. He didn't write much of it so is he trying to use his following to introduce new people? Another question, why in the middle of this did he choose to do such a crappy cover of the Mark Knophler song? I just thought the whole thing was pretty uninspired. Maybe his self professed lack of direction isn't just an act, but somehow I can't believe that the guy that wrote such introspective, insightful and truthful lyrics in his 20's, 30's and 40's can't come up with somethin' better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother?","review":"Jimmy gets a writing credit on 4 of the 14 songs on here.

Only Chill has outdone his other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Great Moments!","review":"As with most of Jimmy's albums, the first time I listened I was less-than-excited. But after just a few times through, as always, I've found many moments of delight, a few that I'll skip every play, and loads of classic reminders of just why I like this guy so much. The older he gets, the \\"cornier\\" he becomes, I think. But somehow, like most things he does, it works. It's charming and fun and sometimes even a little sad, because it reminds me that I'm getting older and cornier, too. ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: \\"Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On\\" is possibly the most moving Katrina tribute I've heard. And as a native New Orleanian, I've paid attention. It has already made it to my forever \\"Best of Jimmy\\" playlist, and will remain there, and in my heart, for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy's done it again.","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect with this new album because we love Jimmy's older stuff. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. This album is one of his best and I love every song on it although Breathe in, Breathe out, Move on has to be my favorite. I hope he continues to write his music for many years to come, and I will continue to buy it.

Since then, he's gone from someone who wrote fabulous songs & character sketches to writing \\"Jimmy Buffett Songs\\", seemingly a genre itself. These have all the requisite geographical and cultural references necessary to be a \\"Jimmy Buffett Song\\". His first 4 (6 if you count his 2 earliest releases, \\"Down to Earth\\" & \\"High Cumberland Jubilee\\") albums were absolute gems, but with the issue of \\"Changes in Latitudes...\\", he drifted down a road I didn't want to travel.

I thought he might regain his senses, as he did after the Somewhere Over China disaster, but no dice. Sorry folks. This is his third straight collection of trite, poppy, humorless, overproduced drivel. Does he even play a guitar anymore? Has Mantovani possessed his soul? His rush to embrace \\"new country\\" dipsticks is a total embarrassment. Jimmy, those guys carved out their lousy careers imitating YOU! Why do you want to imitate THEM? I have been a fan since the mid-1970s and seen his show over 20 times. I am not one of those people who think the post-Volcano parrothead mania ruined his music. He put out some great stuff after that record. But this is pathetic. As was License to Chill. It's over. The thrill is gone.

The book and tape appear to have been assembled in someone's garage and the quality of the content follows suit. The sound is horrible, the design of the lessons is haphazard, and the scope of the grammar and vocabulary reviews is extremely limited. I would recommend that anyone interested in learning this language should get a firm grip on French and then find a Haitian friend and a good Creole dictionary, because this set will not prepare the student for a conversation.

The authoritative title of The Glasgow School, which collects their four singles and one unreleased album for independent label Postcard, is amply justified. The band's hooray-for-fey, anti-rockist manifesto (\\"No more rock & roll for you,\\" they chant) translated into terrific pop music pitched at the intersection of Chic's funky guitars and the Velvet Underground's bristling guitars, while frontman Edwyn Collins was suave lounge lizard, snake-hipped soulboy and lovelorn bookworm all at once. Back then, their wallflower pop attracted homophobic heckles from Glasgow beer boys; in today's climate, they could scarcely sound more relevant.A fantastic cd recommed it to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Poker Boom started HERE!","review":"Sure Moneymaker won the WSOP in 2003 and folks heard of it, but it wasnt until the Travel channel started to show the World Poker Tour on TV that the Poker Boom started.Very well produced live shows of Poker, excellent stuff, sadly only complete seasons 1-2 and a \\"Best\\" of season 3 has been released on DVD, own them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"chicane is plain awesome","review":"I think that far from the maddening crowds is a better album, but I love anything Chicane.

While it's not the energizing trance of Paul Oakenfold, it's certainly the best and most entertaining down-tempo electronic music I've ever heard. Some of the songs don't even have drums. It's great for in the car, going to sleep, or just chilling. Chicane also avoids cliched chord progressions and vocal melodies, branching out into his own style with the accompaniment of Bryan Adams on the album's arguably most \\"trancey\\" song - Don't Give Up, which was featured on The Ministry Of Sound's Trance Nation 3, a creme de la creme collection of amazing songs by famous or not-so-famous artists. That's about it. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"A friend of mine turned me onto this...it's a good office or driving cd...Bryan Adams sings on track 8"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chic-cheesy","review":"In my opinion this CD has some build up that stands unparalled. There are some moments where you feel the music rise through you, and you can't help but get up and dance around a little. But overall- there is nothing really novel about the songs. I was embarrassed when the Brian Adams song came on. It was like listening to the Back Street Boys of techno. Saltwater is a beautiful song and probably worth buying the CD for, but stear clear if you are looking for a fluid CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new definition of boredom in trance music","review":"After listening to this I'm just bored to a degree of apathy and can't really think of writing much more... the best part of this album is some tunes they stole from their former album \\"Chilled\\".

I find that from the day that I acquired a copy of it from my partner I was mesmerized. I quickly went out and bought an actual copy for myself.Now that it has been years since my first initial listen, I can still say that this album is still one of the best album I have ever listened to. I actually find it to be better than FFTMC by Chicane which to many is his finest album to date. Although I must add that I do not think any Chicane album (including Somersault) deserves negative comments as I think they are all better than half of the crap that is released.Anyhow, my favorites on this album are \\"Autumn Tactics (Justine Suissa is unbelievable), Saltwater, Don't Give Up and Overture\\" but there really is no low point in this album. Truly euphoric, refreshing and atmospheric. I just wish Chicane would release more, his talents are (at least to me) divine."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of 2000's Definitive Clubber-Comedown Albums","review":"Definitely one of the most [perhaps overly] played post-clubbing albums of the year 2000. I can't praise any of the ten tracks as amazing, but most are pretty good. Unfortunate that Chicane decided to team up with Bryan Adams for its only cheesy track, \\"Don't Give Up\\". It would have also been nice to get an extra novel track instead of including The Thrillseekers' remix of \\"Saltwater\\" in addition to the original.3.5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says that all techno has to be wall-shaking bass?","review":"Original has to be the best word to descrie this album. Behind the Sun is the newest addtition to my colection of electronica. I first heard Chicane on a cruise in the Caribbean, and asked the DJ what song it was; Halcyon (the 3rd techno song with that name by a different artist - ATB has one too). Back home I got some more songs and finally decided to buy it. Its tunes are as soothing and relazing as ATB's Two Worlds (i'm talking of the second disc, The World of Relaxation). If you like studying to music or even falling asleep to it, this is the cd to have. It sure makes for great company when driving at night, if you are looking for an easy listning. As everyone else will tell you, Saltwater, Low Sun, DOn't give it up are probably the best on the CD, but don't overlook the rest or you will miss out."},{"rating":"2","title":"polished electro-pop","review":"Chicane is one of those anonymous one-man DJ outfits most people will probably first encounter on one of the many \\"chill-out\\" compilations that are currently filling record store CD racks. That's what happened to me, and I rushed right out to purchase \\"Behind the Sun\\" just so I could listen to \\"No Ordinary Morning\\" over and over. I love electronic music that can utilize a pop sensibility (strong melodies with compelling vocals) and Chicane certainly fits that description. If you're looking for a point of comparison (always a reviewer's easy way out) think Bent, Olive or Future Sound of London. The brains behind Chicane - composer Nick Bracegirdle - has managed to incorporate unusual guest vocalists (Maire Brennan of Clannad, 80's popster Bryan Adams) without making it seem gimmicky or contrived. The music is bright, polished and listenable throughout. A great addition to any collection of contemporary electronic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicane's the Best","review":"I've do not own any Chicane CD's (they're not really available in South Africa), but I got 2 songs from a friend \\"Saltwater\\" and \\"No Ordinary Morning\\" - my favourite songs!

A great cast, strong writing, and beautiful scenery makes it that much more enjoyable.Jubal is a luckless drifter, played by Ford who is rescued from exposure and starvation by wealthy rancher Ernest Borgnine. Borgnine soons put Jubal to work as a ranch hand. Borgnine has a very young and beautiful wife, played by Valerie French. She takes a strong liking to Jubal, which not only complicates his relationship with Borgnine, but further strains his dealings with a jealous fellow ranch hand Pinky, played by Rod Steiger.

It had absoloutly nothing to compensate for it's bad language and racism. The plot stunk and was about some sort of war between the races. Even the characters were bad.

My hat's off to Malcolm Lee for having the courage to make such a film. One IMDB reviewer who complained of having been offended by white jokes doesn't have any idea of just how offensive a great deal of this was to some black viewers.

When all the chicken is filled with the serum, Undercover Brother is hired to stop the plan.I think Denise Richards is hot. This movie is a parody of Austin Powers and James Bond. I liked the part where it said what Republicans had done for the black community: freed the slaves with the Emancipation Proclamation. There are a few funny jokes, but overall it is not a very amusing film. Ironically, a white man is hired for the Brotherhood because of affirmative action. I liked this take on an outdated policy.

It is right up there near Animal House. The spoof on black culture is hilarious. It's not just the afro-pick throwing stars, the 8-track launcher from Undercover Brother's Cadilac, or his parachute pants that save him from falling. It is the way that these jokes come at you nonstop. This is not a movie built around a lot of jokes, it is a lot of jokes built into a movie.

Not so, with Undercover Brother. The writing strikes an extremely fine balance of portraying the racial stereotypes of blacks and whites in a hysterical way.

This is smart comedy, much like we get in \\"Who's The Man?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Undercover Brother Has The Funk","review":"Undercover Brother is a hillarious disorganized comedy. Eddie Griffen stars as the leading title, and is sort-of funny. Chris Kattan is Mr. Feather, who works for Mr. Man(the villain), and is a laugh-out loud comedian. Denise Richards is the sexy undercover chick who works for Mr. Man and ends up falling in love with Undercover Brother. I give this movie 4 stars because it was a goofy comedy, but it was wonderful. Definitely funnier than the first Austin Powers movie.

It was my first exposure to Christian Rock, so I don't have the complaints that other reviewers did about materials being \\"old\\". In fact, this CD inspired me to buy more CD from groups such as Burlap to Cashmere and A Ragamuffin Band. I really like the international aspect to this CD, too often in the US we focus only on what we are used to. I bought this CD b/c I went to World Youth Day 2002 in Rome, and really wanted the song Emmanuel. However, my favorite song on the CD is A Ragamuffin Band's Il Tuo Strumento. I highly recomend this CD, especially for someone who is new to Christian Rock and would like a good sampler to help them see what other bands they might like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff...but you should check out MATT WEST","review":"First off, I went to World Youth Day 2000. It was very cool to hear these songs performed live in Rome and get that kind of emotional bond with them, especially the theme song Emmanuel. Burlap to Cashmere was one of my favorite songs to the week. It is very upbeat and catchy and people would get up and dance with one another whenever it was played. However, the stand out track of the album is Heart of Every Man, performed by Gabriel's Harp. The song was actually written by a brilliant performer I went to school with, Matthew West. He came out with a couple of great cds in school, and now that he has graduated he is going to start making it big. He has written songs (some of them going to number one on the charts) for Jump5, Rachel Lampa, Sarah Groves and Salvador. His album Sellout is avaliabe from Grass Roots Music and his first major album release is coming this fall from Universal South.

Heep always were verging on the ridiculous with Byron coming on like a second rate Gillan, Hensley aping Lord etc. At their best it's good stuff but this album is radio rock fodder for the mid 70's, prety uninspired, I mean, what band has the first track without the lead vocalist?I'd recommend Demons and Wizards or Look At Yourself, but this is very poor, Byron's drinking and inter band rivalry had meant the end of the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last album with David Byron.","review":"Uriah Heep \\"High And Mighty\\" #161 (1976).9th studio album, \\"High And Mighty\\".

It does have a few good numbers in the Hensley tune \\"One Way Or Another\\", sung by John Wetton and the Hensley, Wetton tune \\"Footprints In the Snow\\". Most everything here doesn't work for me. David Byron didn't like the direction The Heep was going and he left the band to go solo. David formed Rough Diamond, they released one album in 1977. David passed away in 1985 after years of heavy drinking, he was 38 years old. John Wetton left after this album, he formed U.K..

Every song sounds the same. It is defiently the traditional Zao sound with Dan's screaming voice, the guitar riffs and drums but it doesn't have the magic as their older albums do. Fear fails in comparision to Save yourself From Hell or even Parade of Chaos. Funeral of God was an amazing piece as well. This one feels rushed to me, it came out too soon after Funeral. And the recording is really annoying, especially the ending part on the last song. It seemed endless, I thought it would never stop! I'm a big Zao fan but this album didn't do it for me. Maybe next time guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent release!","review":"I've been a huge Zao fan for years. Every album that I've ever listened to has totally blown me away. \\"The Fear IS What Keeps Us Here\\" is no exception. While not as good as \\"Where Blood And Fire Bring Rest\\" or \\"Funeral Of God\\", it still is awesome from start to finish. Something that's apparently absent is Russ Cogdell's presence from this album. But the most evident change is Dan's vocals. Instead of his heavily influenced Carcass-style vocals, it has morphed to a harsher, more brutal sandpaper howl. It'll take some getting used to, but I'm sure many people will enjoy this as much as their previous records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harder than hard","review":"On every album Zao changes band members right? Well this album is no different. It sounds like an As I Lay Dying intro on track 2 on their album. No doubt so many ppl r involved with Zao. Thats y they're the best hardcore christian metal ever. Forget Slayer,Korn and Slipknot, Zao will take those guys to their knees beggin' 4 their mercy. So if u wanna get a hardcore death metal album thats not satanic, get this one,Demon Hunter, or ABR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I have listened to Zao since their first incarnation when they were still hardcore. They have spent many years in the underground, influencing so many other bands, bring their own style of metal to the forefront of the scene. A band that commands this respect, deserves the proper production.I have to say, the material on this album is good, but the production is terrible. This album sounds worse than Save Yourself From Hell. This album could rip the room apart if everything didn't sound like it was buried underneath 6 inches of mud. I can understand the appeal of wanting to be \\"real\\" or \\"raw\\" with their recording, but when you take away the clarity of the instruments, you lose the strength of the songs. I really expected a higher level of achivement from them after The Funeral of God, instead they seem to be walking backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going nowhere fast.","review":"I must say that after Parade Of Chaos I wasn't too excited about Zao anymore. Funeral Of God didn't excite me but it grabbed my interest. The Fear That Keeps Us Here didn't do much more. Although their songwriting is as tight as ever I found myself being unable to tell the difference between songs. Everything seemed jumbled and chaotic, although that can be a good thing at times it wasn't in this case. I have been a long time fan of Zao (going on a decade now) but it seems that after Self-Titled Zao lost something. I still love this band to death (they put on one of the best live shows i've ever seen) but i'm hoping and praying they can rekindle the fire from their earlier days. And I must say this, Where Blood And Fire Bring Rest was and probably always will be Zao's best effort so it will take alot from them to get my jaw dropping again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I guess I'm a bit late","review":"in reviewing this, but I've been listening to a lot of this album lately and figured it was worth reviewing.By far my favourite of Zao's releases, this is a great album on so many levels.The issues tackled by Dan on this record have been addressed before, most of them anyway, but never with the lyrical intensity that he brings.I love every song on this album, except \\"Physician Heal Thyself\\". Normally I'm not too impresed with lyrics, but writing about everything from zombies to the native american situation, Dan has crafted beautiful lyrics.The music is amazing, the vocals are amazing, everything flows well on this album, which is something I don't always find on Zao's records.A great great great album. There's a whole \\"feel\\" to this release, a lot like \\"The Funeral Of God\\", but very different mood/attitude.Brutal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doctoral thesis or yoga?","review":"While there were some interesting observations, it reads more like an academic paper than an exploration of yoga.

In doing that the author put this book far ahead of the \\"straight\\" mysteries.

It was a process all right, if you did get it packed up the hooks on top did not keep the semi trailer closed, thus everything fell out when you tried to drive it.

This is IMPOSSIBLE to fold up and close! Keeps popping open. Nothing can anger a 2yr. old more than a great new toy that they've been anticipating & not being able to play with it because it literally falls apart. And I'm shocked that I purchased this for $35 before Christmas & it's now $59.99! What a waste. Now, I get to compile all the pieces together and ship this pile of plastic back to Amazon.

The launcher is too powerful for the short distances McQueen must go, the various activities do not stay together or lay flat, closing it is difficult. Some time ago, I bought a littleTake Along Fire Station Playsetfor my son and it lasted two years. This is a far better concept toy, many more activities, far more sturdier, easy and intuitive to put together. Even though it looks more complicated, my son could put it together at two. At nearly five, he can't put the Mac Playset together so it works. The fire station toy isn't Lightning McQueen, but my son loved it and played hard with it for a long time before its hinges gave out.

Also on ours, the sound doesn't work. I would just return it, but our son has been asking for this for weeks and finally got it for his 4th birthday. He would be heart broken if we returned it.

Yes, the car is not as durable as one would wish and you can't fit EVERYTHING in the Mack. However, it brings a lot of joy to my son. As long as you read the directions and fit the pieces together, it is no problem. Unfortunately, that does become a struggle once in a while.

It is frustrating for him to put together, and it is frustrating for me as a parent to put away when he is done. You have to cram all the parts into the truck, align the sides perfectly, and turn a fin on the top to lock it. No matter how many times I try, the lock doesn't hold the truck closed.

My son does like playing with it when it's open, but one of the features I was looking forward to was it \\"self-storing\\". That DOES NOT work at all.

It is confusing and actually pretty boring. When we asked my son what he wanted for CHristmas he always said \\" Big Mack truck\\" so someone got it for him and he doesnt even play with it because it falls apart and he gets frustrated.

My husband had bought another (simpler, less expensive) Mack Truck Playset that I was planning to return, so by Day 2 I gave this to my son just to get him away from the bad truck.

It does't close, it keep's popping open. I have spent hours trying to make this work, the toy is a complete failure. I can tell you this, the whole trailer is going in the trash, and will only keep the cab. If I had read the other reviews on this product I would not have purchased it.

I know the rcommended age was for 7+. However neither his mother or father were unable to open and close this truck. It is bulky and cheaply made despite its way to high price of $94. My grandson was frustrated and asked why Santa would make a toy like that. It now sits in his bedroom gathering dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This truck looked like so much fun, but we're really disappointed.

I'm about to throw the whole thing away."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Poor Construction/Quality","review":"Too bad Mattel didn't spend as much money on the design/construction of this toy as they did advertising it to our kids! My 6 year old son kept seeing the commercials for this toy and it was \\"all he wanted!\\" We bought it for him and within ten minutes the toy was broken. We couldn't latch the back parts of Mack's truck. With it unlatched, my son couldn't \\"drive\\" it around the floor. My very upset son got frustrated when I told him I was going to take it back. What a waste of my time and money Mattel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it","review":"This toy was bought for a 5 year old who struggle with it. Putting the town together takes patience, the pieces do not lock properly when you close it so children get frustrated when they are playing with Mac and it pops open.It was a Christmas present that was left behind the 28th so 3 days is not worth the price.Maybe if you have an older child who is extremely careful with toys it will work but I have heard of many other Moms who have the same complaints.If I had the receipt I would not hesitate to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD, FUN product, I had almost NO problems w/ it, but NOT meant for young children!","review":"I couldn't agree more with Jenny & Brat Mom. This toy is GREAT AND FUN IF YOU TAKE CARE OF IT AND ARE NOT ROUGH WITH IT! I do not mean to be harsh or offensive, but I mean, come on, parents - f you see that a toy is marked \\"5+\\" (which this toy CLEARLY is), it would probably be a pretty good idea to take that suggestion and NOT buy it for 3 or 4-year-olds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddening","review":"Of all the toys we have in our house, and we have many, this, by far, is the one I hate the most. I suggested it to a friend who wanted to buy my three- and five-year-old boys a birthday present. I despise it.I haven't read all the reviews, but I agree with the common theme -- it flops apart, won't hold together, is a pain to open and close. I still haven't figured out how to make the little back door stay closed when Mack is put together so he can actually go anywhere without his entire contents falling out.I will say that when it's open and assembled and the little race tracks are in place, it's an okay toy. But the way it's marketed, as a semi that can drive around then open up for play, is completely bogus. My boys do nothing but fight and cry over this one. Thanks a lot, Mattel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - don't buy!","review":"Where to start with this piece of junk? Firstly setting it up is hard. It is fiddly and the instructions are not very clear. More worryingly, once it is set up the pieces don't fit together well and don't work well even when an adult is working it. My 5 year old couldn't make it work. This is a design fault. My 7 year old could make it work with great effort and patience but soon gave up and moved on to some Lego. Even my 11 year old was baffled by the poor mechanics. The scenery pieces don't fit properly and fall off constantly. The final insult is that the pieces are supposed to fit into Mack when he is back to being a truck but despite great effort Mack keeps falling open and doesn't close. Absolutely rubbish and at a rip off price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-researched History of Logistics","review":"This expansive, well-researched work could rank as one of the most inclusive, complete books on the esoteric topic of freight logistics and that field's role in shaping modern civilization. The book's wide scope and historic perspective make the topic come alive, enhanced by its architectural, engineering, military and relief effort case studies. The pace slows when author Issa Baluch discusses the transportation infrastructures of Egypt, India and Dubai, in sections that may be too detailed for most readers. Similarly, some of the case studies go into excessive detail about the actual contents of what was shipped for specific efforts, such as the Berlin airlift. However, despite these minor distractions, people in the transportation industry will find this manuscript revealing. Although it may be long and dry at times, we were intrigued by its historic overview of transportation logistics."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Resource & A Must Read","review":"This book is a incredible resource and is definitely a must read for anyone wanting a deeper knowledge in the logistics field.

I had a something burn out with my first six months, but I think this was due to power loss which did not allow the fan to kick on and cool the bulb down properly. I think this what caused problems with the projector shutting off after about 2 minutes of up time after the power loss. So if you have a power backup for your pc, you may want to use the projector on that same supply or invest a little more money for power backup for the pj. It might be worth it in some cases although, BenQ had me send my projector to New Jersey, since I'm east coast for repairs. I had my pj back in about 2 weeks good as new.

I ordered 1/2 size smaller than normal (in the tobacco color) and they are an ideal fit. The color is much darker than my iMac monitor showed. On the monitor they looked very light brown but in reality they are the color of the brown, but still very nice. The brown must be much darker than it appears too. No arch support, but let's face it, most boots of this type have vey little, if any. Easy to put on and zip up. Plenty of room in the calf (I have muscular ones) so these are great skinny jeans boots. There is a burnished edge around the toe and the heel that I didn't even pay attention to in the picture, but it also adds a nice (worn) look to them.

It also means the fuses can't be replaced easily: you'd have to unsolder them, replace them, then solder the replacements -- not something the ordinary customer can do.

Not philosophical or even deeply theological, instead Zacharias gets to the point quickly: There is only One True God, and Jesus is not only equal to, but one and the same with this Deity. The compare/contrast to other religions' deified leaders was enlightening.Someone mentioned that Zacharias did not explain in depth other religions, and that was dissapointing to them. However, that was not the purpose of this book. It is not an exposition of religious views and how Christianity compares. For that I would suggest reading \\"So What's the Difference?\\" by Fritz Ridenauer.

He cannot differentiate between religion and cultural evolution. His entire passion for christianity stems from the absence of fatherly love in his childhood and he tries to find that love in Jesus as a father figure. Adversity is never the best time to become passionate about religion as it ends up being a solace rather than a belief. More like a cult to belong to. Also Hinduism is NOT a polytheistic religion.

He also presents the information in such a way as to inform the reader of the Middle Eastern religious practices and how they impact not only the non-Christian view of Christ, but Christ's own way of presenting himself in His Word.

While none of these tracks meets that mark, most are highly enjoyable. Highlights are Karsh Kale's 'Spirits In The Material World', 'dZihan & Kamien's 'Rockit', Bombay Dub Orchestra's 'Get Carter Theme' (the most obscure track in this collection, it's from the 1971 British gangster flick starring Michael Caine and DOES sound better than the original - I stand corrected), 'MIDIval Pundits 'Four Sticks' (excellent rendition of a Led Zep tune) and MNO's version of John Lennon's 'Julia', an instrumental with gorgeous vibraphone playing the melody variation.

The Sherlock Holmes -- what, pastiche? parody? -- I think \\"theft\\" is the right description. Of course it sounds like Doyle -- most of the text has been lifted verbatim, and Dexter's additions simply detract from Doyle's great work.

From all the reviews I read, it sounded like a great cd. But in fact, it is not. It lacks intensidy, compresion, and diversity. Only 3/10 songs from this cd are worth listending to; #2, #6, #9. Also, 3 songs are just musical, leaving only 7 songs in total. If it wasn't for his voice, the name band would be meaningless. HE has a great voice but doesnt fully utilizes it in this cd. Maybe in another cd it does greatly but not in this one. Also, there noting great special about the music. It just doesn't jump at you like it doest with NIN. Never the less, his cds are still quite interesting and i will give the band another try with another cd. Maybe pigmata or American Monster.2332"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got Pig?","review":"Some other reviewers were right, I got this album for less than 7 bucks but it was worth much much more. Pig, an overlooked and underrated band that MUST be heard by any fans of KMFDM, NIN, Ministry, Fear Factory etc. Maybe Trent Reznor didn't want to distribute any more of this album because they were making him look bad. Pig is harder, heavier and more original in so many ways. I love KMFDM, but Pig seems to be a darker alterego of them that continues to grow on me. Time for me to stop typing. Words don't do this band justice. You need to hear them. Buy it. Pay more than 7 bucks if you have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting stories","review":"Book 3 in the Shenandoah Sisters series is the most exciting of the 4.

I bought the thing to find out about Sauska, not Starr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickens as feminist?","review":"Not by 21st century definitions, perhaps, but by the standards of his own time, definitely. In this book, he very clearly perceives, and shows to the reader, the wrongness of a father discounting the value of his daughter simply because she is not a son, as well as various other indications of the wrongness of the discriminations visited upon women in his Victorian England, and the innate strength of many of his female characters in dealing with what their life forces them to endure. Even if his characters are largely one-dimensional, and either idealized near-saints, perfect villains, or caricatures, they are still generally interesting, and even if he is more than a touch long-winded at times, his writing is still enjoyable. This is one of my favorites of his writing, perhaps exceeded only by \\"A Christmas Carol\\", and matched, perhaps, by \\"Our Mutual Friend\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why this is not a well known Dickens","review":"There's a reason why this book is not on the list of Dickens greats. It was published a year before David Copperfield, and perhaps Dickens was still learning how to get this right. It was his first popular serial novel, so his English readers liked it. However, it is incredibly repetitive and overwhelmingly sentimental. The main female character, Florence, is an unloved child who nevertheless unwaveringly, for 833 pages, seeks the love of her cold-hearted father. She is too good to be true, and that kills the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic Dickens - hurrah!","review":"A classic Dickens, with the good guys experiencing heard times, but coming through with their just deserts in the end.

Let's just say that there is diffinatly no good acting in this movie (other then the DEA guy who acts like it is a porn they're filming), nor is there good action, humor, diolog, or suspence.

I have all his other movies but pass on this one. Corny acting, bad filming, bad dialogue, bad story line. Just an all around bad movie. And Seagal is looking bad.

Some of the scene backgrounds were so obviously fake. Dialog was really bad. The \\"head\\" af the \\"bad dudes\\" looked like Mimi from Drew Carey without her make up and hair.The thing is, you have to go into Steve's movies knowing what you see is what you get. Over night he is not going to turn into Humphrey Bogart or Richard Burton, any more than JC Van Damme. Once you accept this, their movies are easier to watch.That being said, I would only recommend this to DIE HARD Steven S. fans.

It misses the mark like many films he has made that I wasn't crazy about such as The Foreigner, Ticker, and The Patriot. It's not unusual for a star to make some duds, but what is unusual is that I feel that Seagal turned out ten very fun movies in a row before being involved in some less than stellar movies. I also think that Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds were both a lot of fun and show that in recent years Seagal has delivered some decent entertainment. All actors have films that aren't the best and Out For A Kill is one of Seagal's. He's made a lot of fun movies, but this aint on of em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Jacket Segal","review":"This movie is a \\"Fat Jacket Movie\\"! If you are a Segal fan, you know what I mean. It is very easy to tell if a Segal flick is going to be good. Simply, look at the cover. If Steven is wearing a large jacket, in order to cover a large round \\"santaesque\\" belly, than just put it down and back away.Try to keep your Segal flicks pre-Fire Down Below. These are the true ultraviolent, bone popping, one-lining, former-agent-turned-whatever Flicks.I am a Segal fan...the Segal Fan, but one must recognize the boundries of Segal flick watching.By the by, if you find Fat Jacket Segal movies funny(like I do), this one has some deliciously absurd crap in it.P.S.If I were to meet Steven Segal I would tell him his movies are great.

Don't know, don't care, but don't waste your money of this garbage he is putting out now. This movie was so pathetic I couldn't even finish watching it. I ONCE respected the fact that Seagal had legitimately studied martial arts in Asia and was an authentic martial artist. The martial arts in this movie are a FRAUD, a combination of a fat man moving poorly with camera tricks borrowed from the Matrix. This junk doesn't deserve a single star, it isn't worth the carboard box it comes in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I have always been Steven Seagal fan, couldn't wait to see them all!

I should have followed my own advice. The long coat doesn't hide the garguantuan, old, made-up, lethargic Steven Seagal. The plot was so phoney and there must be something wrong with Seagal's voice because he sounded like a cartoon character. After two movies of long coats, the real-life, out-of-shape Steven Seagal shines forth. The obvious dyed hair (to hide the gray) didn't work. He needs to cut off the locks and create a new character - the martial arts moon has eclipsed. Maybe a hard-boiled city detective who shows the young s***s some tricks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"MISERABLE excuse for a romance, and cold as an adventure","review":"The author's first mistake is to give us characters we can't even like: a murderer-for-hire as a hero???? and a whiney \\"heroine\\" who doesn't even have the guts to do herself in. I can only assume the author was attempting to \\"break new ground\\" but this was NOT the way to do it. This novel is not the least bit entertaining, so don't waste hours out of your precious lifespan reading it. If you like suspense with your romance, or unlikely heroes, read Virginia Kantra instead. For horror, try Laurell K.

Add to that the fact that the assassin is also a werewolf, and you're ready for a rip-roarin' good time! Except that's not really what you get. The story is narrated by Tony, the assassin, and I just didn't like his tone. I found him to be flippant and overly emotional, when I really wanted him to be hard and cool. And if the werewolf stuff isn't enough for you, there's some extra weird metaphysical stuff at the end that really makes no sense at all. I generally enjoy paranormal/urban fantasies, but this was a little too much for me.

I normaly love werewolf novels but this one was a little to far fetched even for me. If you are looking for a good strong heroin and a understanding but masculine hero keep looking this isn't the book for you. If you dont mind the whinning go ahead and read it. I also didn't like that (spoiler alert) the love of the hero couldn't bring her back from deaths door, but her anger over her family could. Or that he would rather let her die then give her a transfusion and make her a werewolf, because they are lesser beings. Bad.

But the characters were completely one dimensional and cliched. Tony is the \\"hitman with a heart of gold\\" who goes against everything that he believes in and holds as truth for a woman that he barely knows. Sue is weak, whiny, and can't do anything for herself. All the characters are black-and-white good-or-evil and there was absolutely no ambiguity in anyone's character.Really, the book is just filled to the brim with cliches that made me really, really sad.

The writers attempt to create a 'Were' society that underlays ours at the same time juggling a very unpleasant hero who is apparently a mafia hitman. I am led to believe the authors were trying to create a male version of Anita Blake. Unfortunately, they miss that which makes Anita appealing, her humanity and struggle to be who she is.Laurell K Hamilton, Sherylin Kenyon and Charlaine Harris do a far better job with more likable characters, more believable plots, and less annoying heroines.I'm afraid I tossed the book with less than 10 pages to go because I simply could not care less what happened to ANYONE in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, short lifespan","review":"I own two Canon cameras that are compatible with this battery, and this Lenmar one has been the worst of all four that I've purchased.After the first 3 months, it wouldn't hold a charge nearly as long as the other 3 brands (including the original OEM battery).

I can get rid of the error by removing and reinserting the battery, but that is not acceptable. Then one battery soon refused to take a charge. It believes it is charged after about 10 minutes in the charger. The company did quickly replace the battery, so that was nice.I'm also concerned that the batteries I received do not look like the one pictured. They do not have the LENMAR name on them anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived dead","review":"The battery will not take a charge. the charger green led comeson instantly like it is fully charged.

About half of those pictures were indoors with the flash turn on.The only reason that I didn't give this battery \\"five stars\\" is that I can't yet speak to the battery longevity as I only had it a few weeks yet.I'm very happy with this battery.

I own the Lenmar equivalent of a Sony camcorder battery, two other different Canon camera equivalents, and now I'm getting the NB-4L and NB-5L as well from Lenmar.I don't have a doubt about Lenmar. The batteries I bought three years ago are still performing flawlessly, and while Canon has caught up to them in capacity (yes, the Lenmar batteries used to have more capacity than the Canon branded ones) they are still high quality and charging with the cameras' OEM chargers without any problems. And they cost a third to half the cost of the Canon and Sony branded equivalents.The Lenmar I got for my S400 Digital Elph actually outlasted the Canon battery, though I used them alternately and the Lenmar had more mAH than the Canon.I've had more quality and warranty issues (though resolved) with Canon than I've had with Lenmar, so for me Lenmar deserves all five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Just beware. The battery looks good, fits my Canon 1100 camera just fine. However, it would not charge in the Canon battery charger. The orange charge light on the charger would go on then go off right away. I wrote the company and they quickly responded. They said the battery should be completely compatible with Canon charger, and if it didn't work battery must be defective. I was impressed by company's response, but returned it and bought a different brand. How often are these defective? Your guess is as good as mine. At least Amazon will take it back if it is defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch Battery Offer","review":"Length:: 1:06 MinsI ordered this Lemnar battery for a back up for my new Canon camera, battery and charger.

He bases this on Beethoven's instructions, presumably?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant","review":"From the compositions themselves to the flawless performance and sound engineering, these discs represent the absolute best of what SACD has to offer. The Prezak quartet injects a bold, lively flair true to the composer yet fresh to my somewhat jaded ears. They even stay true to Beethoven's own musical journey by becoming more adventuresome in the later compositions. The inner voices are particularly well-balanced throughout the dynamic range.

This is a very complex CD, at first you may not like it, but if you listen carefully you will have a lot of fun with this one. The fisrt CD is has grim feel to many of the tracks and maintains a pop music sound that is munmial enough noit to irritate the hardcore electronic music fan.

Let me warn you, if you are a hardcore pop listener, you will seriously not like this CD. Because of \\"Subliminal Sandwich\\", I am a happy person! Their sounds are like ear candy and catchy beats (especially \\"Nuclear Bomb\\" and \\"Asbestos Lead Asbestos\\") and they are always different with each track, which is what makes it so different from the stupid Backstreet Boys. This is the first CD I got by MBM, and I also have \\"Actual Sounds + Voices\\", which is also awesome. I think Meat should become more popular, they deserve to be recognized. I hope they release another album, soon, because they have an anxiously-awaiting customer to get their hands on the first copy...wait, I think they have a new song out called \\"Anon\\" on a dance mix CD, but I'm not sure what it's called, but I'm buying it. Have fun with this CD!Warning: Play twice before listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"But where is the mass appeal?","review":"As my favorite album by MBM I am reluctant to deprive it of a classic rating, but it is just wrong to label a work as such if all but a sliver of the music-loving world hears only hooey. Sad as it is, MBM is as a whole highly incaccessable and therefore can never gain mass approval without \\"selling out\\", a la Prodigy or the like. Can the other reviewers really imagine pop listeners responding well to \\"Asbestos Lead Asbestos,\\" the catchiest and most mainstream MBM gets? It's just not going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime Pop/Rock and Minimalism","review":"The two CDs are really two different albums. The first is a MARVELOUS collection of groovy songs driven by compressed drum loops and melodic bass lines. The second is a set of longer minimalist evolutions. What is striking about Subliminal Sandwich is that it clearly is the result of a song-oriented composition process driven by melody and harmony rather than algorithmic repetition and evolution. To me it is purely a rock album although I think the tendency would be to lump it with electronic dance music. But it is no way constructed like typical electronica (using, say, Orb or Orbital as a prototype)--it bears more resemblance to quasi-improvisational styles like Pete Namlook or, really, the first group to popularize tape loops and found sounds, Pink Floyd.

One could almost gain as much from saying \\"Compartmentalise your objects\\" several times a day.The title implies that it will give you some help understanding how DirextX and C# work together to create a game engine. This is false. There is a lot of uncommented code in this book (half the first chapter of 26 pages is uncommented code). The explanations given are abstract to the point of being worthless to someone who truly needs an introduction, giving only light glances at the example code. It is impossible to get a clear picture of everything involved.There are doubtless those for whom this book is the perfect level of abstract discussion.

Instead, the author assumes a working knowledge of the DX9 object model and at least a basic knowledge of 3D design fundamentals.What the book does offer is a walk-through for building a working game engine, complete with physics models and AI, using managed DirectX 9 libraries.

This book is more difficult to read, and more poorly written, than most of the books I used in engineering school.The thought of using this book for three semesters is excruciating. The authors were clearly more interested in showing off their knowledge, instead of teaching it.Can you tell I hate this book?Everyone in the class is utterly baffled, and some have just stopped coming to class, thinking that they are not smart enough to get music theory. This book has broken the spirit of young musicians. Way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent except for the missing tracks","review":"I have seen Sarah in concert several times and thoroughly enjoyed Harem; however, I am disappointed with the CD only because it excludes the title track. Fans of Sarah often have to wait long periods for any new material and we eagerly anticipate new offerings. Ultimately, this CD is a must have for true fans who are rarely disappointed by Ms. Brightman. As for the comparison to Madonna and Cher, Sarah outsings and outperforms anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPOFF ALERT! RIPOFF ALERT!","review":"Beware of this CD. It is NOT the full concert!!! When I misplaced my DVD of this show, I decided to buy the DVD because I thought it would be as good but NO!!!!!! They left off 3 songs. Yep you heard me, 3 songs! And they were the best sounding on the DVD, which is what makes it even worse. I can't believe they would cut \\"Arabian Nights\\", \\"What A Wonderful World\\", and \\"Harem\\".

She actually made me want to go to Vegas. She has fused so many different genres of music together that it's like hearing all music for the first time. She is the voice and the image I always imagine greeting me as I enter the afterlife. I highly urge you to experience her dvd of this performance as it truly helps you understand why the ancients worshipped the godess. Sarah is the Godess incarnate. She has carried my soul to deeper depths than I have ever dwelled before. She is more than an artist with an album, she is an experience, beautiful and eternal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Brightman with \\"new\\" track Snow on The Sahara...?","review":"Generally I like all songs in this album, \\"La Luna\\", \\"Kama Sutra\\" to name a few. Different, typical live concert. Especially for \\"Snow on The Sahara\\", many think that it is a brand new song from Brightman. It is cover from the original Anggun hit single, taken from her first album \\"Anggun/Snow on The Sahara\\", released in 1998 in the USA and 1997 for outside of the USA.(www.anggun.com or try amazon.com for Anggun)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"Amazing CD!!

Live!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best songs are missing!!!!","review":"Whoever decided to do the editing on this should be fired! \\"Harem,\\" \\"What a Wonderful World,\\" and \\"Arabian Nights\\" were the most memorable songs of the show and they have been omitted for reasons I don't know. It's as if the record company is forcing you to buy the DVD as well just to get those songs live as well.It's such a shame! I can't believe the opening number has actually been cut out; it set the ENTIRE mood for the show and they've actually cut out \\"Harem.\\"Instead, the producers are hoping you'll buy this CD just to get Sarah's version of \\"Snow on the Sahara.\\" In my opinion, skip it. Anggun's original version is much better with her haunting vocals and airy music. Sarah's childlike voice is too infantile for the mood the song is more pop-y, if you know what I mean.After months of waiting for what could have been a great CD, Sarah's team really screwed this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Of A Ripoff Folks!","review":"The sound is great but it is editted material!

In my particular opinion, this is an awesome Heep record. It does not sound quite like their older works, true; yet, still retains the fine style which makes the band so special (and definitely more accomplished than that before, Wonderworld).

However, the plastic that holds the cartridges in place gets loose and one actually snapped at the top. I only had it for about 6 months before I started finding delicate and expensive cartridges shaking around the case. Something better than this is needed but not sure what would work.

The replacement that was sent (after paying for shipping of the remote back to the company) also lasted for one day. When it worked, my 7 year-old son LOVED it, but that just meant he was devastated when it stopped working both times. Now we have two huge pieces of plastic that don't do anything.

It's a snapshot, covering a given time frame. Some observers believe one can get a more objective view if they are removed from a given culture. His foreword was written in Islamabad, thus, he possibily achieved some of the desired objectivity such observers desire.Chapter one starts with advertising, in particular, the well-known advertising campaign of the Marlboro Man (as in cigarettes). Chapter two looks at the ups and downs of celebrites, Bert Bacharach is the focus here. Chapters three and four view gasoline stations and hamburger stands respectively.

I'm not that impressed with the game and even less impressed with the game guide. The game guide is confusing and doesnt give good details.

I agree with the other reviewers, wait until you can get the guide online."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I absolutely adore Harvest Moon and have bought every single game released. Imagine my delight when I learned that, for the first time since Harvest Moon: Back to Nature, there would be a strategy guide. So, of course, I hurried out to buy it.What a let down. Not only does this guide spend a large proportion of its pages describing aspects of the game that are either intuitive or pretty much the same as games that have come before, but in many cases it's just flat out wrong. The map of the village it provides with its nice little numbers pointing out where everything is, that'd be awful useful. Except that it's WRONG! For the most part, the numbers don't match up, not to mention that there are more numbers on the map than desciptions following after. And that's only one example.So my advice is don't waste your money. Wait a couple of months, and then find a fan written strategy guide online. It'll be far more accurate"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck getting it","review":"I ordered this in mid-October for Christmas.

Parts of it are impressive - extravagant set pieces that could match anything that Hollywood was doing at the time. Parts of it drag. It is definitely worth seeing if you love historically interesting films or the UFA product. There is nothing in it even hinting at the vast Nazi machinery backing it (Joseph Goebbels had his hand in most of the production). It is a light, well budgeted, sometimes amusing fantasy. The script has its moments but doesn't sustain interest for the length of the film. Best sections: the dinner party, Venice, the trip to the moon, the early agfacolor color film technique (which was quite good). One of the best WWII UFA films. Comes with a bundel of extras: introduction, restoration examples, drawings, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"OKAY!!!","review":"Yes I love Pau!

However, the positive raving by these other reviewers sadly misses the point in this case. There is not one decent DVD concert of this legendary artists anywhere! The live in Germany DVD is absolutely terrible! Its the worst Barry White perforance I have ever seen, and I have been a fan since his very first release. I collect DVD concerts, and live in Germany should be burned at the stake. How sad that such a wonderful and talented artist who thrilled millions of people for decades should pass away without one single decent video concert for his fans. So, why celebrate a documentary of the man, without the benefit of also having his incredible talent immortalized on a video concert for the world to also celebrate? Without that...its \\"Just a History.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Barry White Lover","review":"I was disappointed in this dvd. I thought it would have more Barry White songs on it. Actually, this dvd is a semi-documentary which is told from Barry White's daughter's perspective -- in other words, a very one-sided story -- it seems as though the whole truth is untold. There's a battle going on with Barry's children vs. his young girlfriend at the end of his life. The story should either be told or left totally out of the video. If you're looking for a dvd of Barry's performances and songs, this is definitely not the dvd to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vest looked previously worn","review":"The color was what i wanted however, the vest was obviously not brand new which the seller did not indicate on the product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This is a terrible review book.

He seems to hold back, which drags the whole movie into a boring state. There are funny scenes, like the man who forces other men to spoon with him and concludes \\"in case you're wondering, I'm not gay.\\" Jason Lee is funnier in films directed by Kevin Smith, but I really expected more since this film was directed by Bruce McCullouch of Kids in the Hall fame. The only good he does is his brief cameo as Lee's unexperienced, negative attorney.The DVD comes with numerous trailers from other [...] movies released by Revolution Films, and some deleted scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only laughed once","review":"I saw this movie and hated it.

This is really bad' This quote can sum the movie up too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stupid movie!","review":"OK, I know Tom Green has a crazy sense of humor, but this film was just stupid! It wasn't even about Harvard! Sure it was about trying to seal money to pay for Harvard, but it was mostly about how two stupid guys can't get anything to work. Should be titled, \\"How Two Stupid Guys Couldn't Steal Harvard\\" or something to that effect. The comedy was relly raw, and the levels which they had to go to to try and get you to laugh were quite low. This film truly left me feeling dumber after watching it. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Green.....","review":"Would have been WAY better film if they had given Tom Green's character more time but still manages to provide a good laugh on the spray painted holdup scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green does it again","review":"I went to see this movie with my friends, and we all walked out laughing. I saw this movie before I ever saw Road Trip, and that was also funny, but this is much better. I love all the charactors (But Jason Lee, Tom Green are the best together). The two main charactors are great friends, but when you put them together, all of their plans go wrong. John (Lee) promised his niece that he would pay for her college when she was little, and forgot all about it. She was accepted to Harvard and now he must find $30,000 somewhere. (direct quote) \\"I had only one option. I had to go to a man who's ideas were sometimes so dumb they were brilliant: I had to go to Duff\\". The plot is not even really important to the comedy, it just makes the entire thing make sense in the end. I don't want to tell you what happens, so I'll just say one thing more: this is the only movie I own that is even funnier every time I watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal Waste of Time","review":"I rate a comedy by how many times it makes me laugh. Stealing Harvard didn't make me laugh at all. I like the other movies with Jason Lee and Tom Green, so I was very disapointed by the lack of humor in this flick. Keep in mind that I'm not very picky, I even enjoyed Freddy Got Fingered. I don't even demand a coherant story plot, I just want to laugh. This movie has absolutely no comedy value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than it looked from the preview","review":"i thouhg it was a pretty good movie. tom green is always weird but a little less weird in this movie. i think it sould be 14.99 becuase its a good not but not great. so if you like tom green or jason lee you should rent this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every second is hilarious!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies ever! I know most people found it really dumb, but I find it hilarious! Just rent it and if you dont like it, so be it, but it is worth buying. Definitley in my opinion. Jason Lee and Tom Green make the perfect team. The movie is about a man who made a promise to his niece years ago that he would pay for all the money for her to go to Harvard if she gets in. The niece has a video tape of him promising. And then he realizes that he has to keep his promise. So he recruits his friend Duff (Tom Green) to help him get the money any way possible while still maintaning a relationship with his Fiance Elaine which he promised her that the 30,000 dollars would be for their new home. And I love every second of the movie. Tom Green makes me laugh every minute of it. Great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!

Mr. Goldsmith gives his private interpretation of the Bible scriptures - The metaphysical/ spiritualist version of the Bible (merging the ideology of the Infinite Way). Some of his \\"new age\\" views are very practical, but requires the neccesity to give deity to the mind (its part of the infinite).Really folks, in reading his ideas, I am beginning to wonder if the man meditated too much - he worships the mind/ consciousness (the Kingdom is in his mind). He believes that the \\"Jesus consciencness\\" is free of disease and bad health (If that is case, why did he die).Again, if this man interpretation was truth in whole, why no record that he raised the dead, cured the blind, or make the cripple walk. In my opinion, the guy went off the deep-end and started worshipping the void in his mind.

From then I have had a great craving to hear more of this sui generis performer. It is finally satisfied by this CD. Here you can get a serious overdose of slide guitar stylings, with fidelity so good you can hear every scraping of the slide, and every picking artifact. For a driving exciting tune, you can't beat Locust Hill Rag, and for metal, listen to The Caissons Go Rolling Along. No one else in the whole world has combined Cherokee culture with Hawaiian music, so you better give a good listen to both versions of \\"Hillbilly Hula.\\" After listening to this, if your wife doesn't immediately threaten to throw you out of the house, you didn't turn it up loud enough.

He isnt like most of the artists nowadays who talk about smokin people in the hood or crying about their girlfriends dumping them.

Evil, yes if being able to think for yourself, rely on yourself, not feeling guility for having human emotions and fighting to keep your own free will in a so called \\"free\\" country is considered as such, guess I am too! Most people miss the point. The band is a criticism of the issues of religious hypocracy and conformity in America. This album is built on the concept of Manson's life experiences and how religious hypocracy formed him into this so-called antichrist.

His guitars are horrible and the drumming isn't very clear or technical. If your looking for real metal, then Manson is definitely not it. I suggest buying Slayer or Pantera if you want powerful heavy metal; at least those bands are innovative and know how to play their instruments.

This CD is above all my very favoorite! Numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12,13,15, and 16 all rule. I recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in Mr. Manson. Smells Like Children definetely leads right into this album. Its full of hate,violence and mayhem! Zimzum did an excellent job of playing guitar on this CD. This CD is about the Worm inagurating into the Anti-Christ and becoming someone everyone (besides the fans like me) HATE. Rev. Manson has put a dent on this pitiful America and he will grow to hate you. He is truly an inspiration and if you are reading this now, BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DARKEST OF IT'S TIME!","review":"This album was the most darkest of it's time by far. It's a great album with great music. The beautiful people is not the only awesome song. My favorite song is Cryptochild because it sounds creepy but awesome.

AWESOME CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood Rocker","review":"Antichrist Superstar is one of the best albems I have ever heard. I think it is his best albem also.

Maybe it's Twiggy's apocalyptic riffs, or Manson's sharp as dagger lyrics and insights, or maybe it's the brutally primal drum patterns....whatever it is, something about this Florida rock group's second full length album strikes a chord in any listener attentive enough to get what it's all about. This is darkness put to music and it's done beautifully. Death metal acts like Emperor and Cradle of Filth do injustice to the title. Singing about vampires and Satan is not dark, it's goofy and tired. Manson has been above such cliched themes from the beginning and he still is. The concept here is complex and expertly crafted. It's interwoven with themes dealing with drugs, sex, self destruction, obsession, religion, and the futility of trying to live a perfect life, and coupled with some of the most original sounding industrial noise of the nineties, it presents art the way art should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark art with style and a purpose","review":"I don't listen to this band very often but this is just one of those classic - totally awesome albums that I can play anytime. Experience it all the way through -don't skip a track. Notice the lyrics -they are a special part of this album. Moody, violent, revolting, political, beautiful. This is powerful -brutally honest expression. It literally makes you feel ill. I love this cd -what a great work of art by Marilyn Manson."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CHILD DEVIANT","review":"I'D WRITE MY OWN REVIEW, ...BUT AMAZON.COM DOES IT BEST.....Marilyn Manson started out as a depraved, marginally talented group of freaks that played a caustic but undeveloped brand of metallic industrial noise. Then Trent Reznor stepped into the studio for seven months with the band, and Manson emerged with the most intense, visceral, mechanical metal album since The Downward Spiral. Antichrist Superstar is a horror-house of grisly atrocities that stains as indelibly as a bathful of warm blood. Brooding rhythms collide with corrosive samples and buzzsaw guitar riffs, while vocalist Marilyn croons irresistible melodies in the voice of a vagrant regurgitating broken light-bulb shards. Essential listening, regardless of how much input Reznor had. --Jon Wiederhorn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Mansonites","review":"It is an ok album but hardly one I would recommend listening to. The lyrics are b.s., the music is decent but only through Trent Reznor's obvious influence and production savvy. In other words the only reason this album even sold at all was either through Trent Reznor's production or Manson's stage antics. Stick with Nine Inch Nails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to see here","review":"I have really high regards for Reznor, being a fan of NIN for a good amount of time, I figured I'd give his protege of some sort, Manson a try, the way I've always felt that he is more of a gimmick than a musician, or the image being more important than the actual value of his music. I gave AS a try, and wasn't really surprised. 'The Beautifle People', his most famous song, is really great and catchy, but when it comes down to it, the remainder of this album is really mediocre and not memorable. It also sounds quite egotistical, even if that may be meant to be taken as ironic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any Manson fan must have this album","review":"The first Manson album i got, and it turned me into a full blown Manson fanatic.

Perhaps the greatest achievement here is that Marilyn and co. can terrorize and genuinely torment their listener into a reclusive but appreciative darkness without seeming insincere or campy. An essential 90's recording... Best Songs: \\"The Beautiful People,\\" \\"Deformography,\\" \\"Man That You Fear\\" Rating: 8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOt for Everyone, but good anyways","review":"When people see Marilyn Manson on TV they see this gothic transexual creep who tries to protray everything but himself. But the truth behind it is, that this is Marilyn Manson. If you look past his image, and just listen to the music, you'll see its great. \\"Beautiful People\\" & \\"Cryptorchid\\" are great songs, but \\"Man that You Fear\\" makes the album well worth it. So people should look past the picutre he portrays, and give the actual music a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Manson album is right here!!!","review":"Amazing! Brilliant! Great!

I listen to Marilyn Manson, and im not a so called \\"Freak\\" or \\"Disturbed\\", I'm pretty normal. By the way you people talk, it sounds like everyone who listens to Marilyn is a complete freak. Calm down, its just music, i like it cause i like the beat, and im not gonna go out and do something crazy after i listen to it, because I can separate reality from a CD. I know some people will listen to this cd, and then go out and do something crazy, but you gotta think that if a cd can make that person do something, then they wouldnt have lasted long before something else pushed him/her over the edge. As for the cd, it was good, i thought \\"The Beautiful People\\" and \\"Tourniquet\\" were real stand outs, this cd isnt for everyone, but i would say its one of Marilyns best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Antichrist at his best","review":"This is the best he has ever done.

The guy is more of a messenger. Antichrist Superstar is a total concept album and should really be viewed for the story it presents rather than its musical value. The whole album is a semi-autobiographical account of how a young boy grows up from being a tormented youngster who grows up to encompass everything he hated and at the same time be everything he ever wanted. Manson is one of those artists who is perfect to be a media-whipping boy and king to thousands of depraved youngsters. I say take this album as a very interesting story set to some pretty interesting musical performances backing it up and THAT'S IT. Don't try to read too far into Manson. He's not nearly everything he claims to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful for what I was doing","review":"I used these cd's to help me prepare for the CLEP french exam.

At many places throughout, you cannot go even a whole page without seeing the word. It's used so much, it just got to be silly. And the story isn't all that great.

It's not often that I start a book and not finish it, and this was one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Tease A Texan","review":"There was no substance to this book.

There was nothing in it to make me care about what happened to the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A six-star book!","review":"This book is spectacularly perfect! It is an amazing story with a beautiful ending! It is surprising, yet not too much so! The poetry was amazing, and the book was just too wonderful! I could read it again and again! It is officially my favorite book, and with my love of my former favorite book, that's quite hard! Gail Carson Levine has done an amazing job again! A book of courage, beauty, and changes, I wish I could jump in and live in it, experience every second, even the bad ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Two Bores of Bamarre","review":"Well, I read *Ella Enchanted* and I loved it very much. I heard about this book from a friend on day and I decided to buy it. To put it lightly, I didn't like it. Meryl was the stereotype princess: Oh, gosh, be a princess what a bore! I want to go be the heroine! And then there was the main character: Oh, I don't want to! I'm even afraid of spiders! -Oh please!- I kept thinking. And then there was that interesting love between the wizard and the main character. It was to put it nicely- bland and stupid, not like the Char and Ella romance. The characters were very forgettable. Borrow it from the libray, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Two Princesses of Bamarre book review","review":"In the book, The Two Princesses of Bamarre, two princess sisters, named Addie and Meryl, live in the castle of Bamarre. Meryl becomes ill with the Gray Death and her father, the king of Bamarre, trys to save her by visiting the elf queen and asking her if she knows the cure, but fails. Meryl's sister, Addie, knows that it is up to her to find the cure to not only save her sister, but all the ill citizens of Bamarre. I enjoyed reading about Princess Addie over coming her fears to save her sister. The plot was not predictable, but at some points, it was a little obvious. Gail C. Levine also as written The Wish wich is as exsiting as The Two Princesses of Bamarre."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one great book!!![.]","review":"This book is so good!!! I loved it!

It teaches people two very important lessons. 1) Things happen and you should try to fix them, even if they seem hard. Lives may depend on you. 2) Find the courage in you. There's courage inside everyone, you just have to find it.I couldn't believe how great this book was. Gail Carson Levine is an amazing writer and she shows it in this book. I couldn't put it down!

This is the best book under the sun by a long shot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The two princesses of Bamarre","review":"After the rave reviews this book got at amazon.com, I bought it and was expecting nothing short of the next JK Rowling. I was dissapointed. I found the characters a bit flat, the two princesses a bit dense, and the lore of the land superficial. The character I related to most was killed (a dragon) for no good reason. The king is the most irritating character I have encounter for a while. Someone should have assasinated him. I struggled to finish it. The book has absolulty no humor in it. Zero. An unnecessary grim depiction of a fantasy land. This books charm completely eluded me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Two Princesses of Bamarre","review":"This book wasn't all that great. Yeah sure, it had adventure, excitement and romance, all the things I love to read about when I pick up a book. But in this book, the adventure part was boring. The 'excitement' wasn't exciting. The romance part wasn't romantic. And really who cares about what Bamarre's hero did? I didn't like it. If Addie had gotten sick and Meryl was the main character, I might have liked it more. But probably not. I especially didn't want Addie to fall in love with or marry Rye. I didn't like him at all. And you can't even tell they're in love until the very end. Whenever I read romance books, I like those little tiny hints that make you totally see that they'll fall for each other. I think Addie needed someone to fall in love with to make it more interesting, and the only person that could be was Rye. This book was BORING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"teenage girl point of view","review":"I was given this book on my 14th birthday by a friend the same age. I absolutely loved Ella Enchanted and had gone on to read The Fairy's Mistake which was good but not nearly as good as Ella Enchanted. The one thing that I do not like about the series books is that they are all in hardback and are therefore pretty expensive! The Two Princesses of Bamarre is a great read and extremely enjoyable. I especially love the romance in it and the adventure. This book keeps you hooked to the the last sentence! I recommend it to all ages, and i know anyone who reads it will love it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Enchanting as Ella!","review":"THE TWO PRINCESSES OF BAMARRE was an extraordinary book. Levine's previous two novels have been enjoyable, but not as gripping as Ella, or this one. It is an intricately woven tale of magic, courage and adventures. The classic tale of the weak finding courage, but with a new insentive and a wonderful adventure ahead of her. This humorous, witty tale brought as much enjoyment to me, as Ella Enchanted. 'Dave in the Night\\" and \\"The Wish\\" were very good, but Ella and \\"The Two Princesses of Bamarre\\" are by far, Levine's two masterpieces. I cannot wait until her next magical tale comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily my favorite book!","review":"This is definately my favorite book. The imaginative story of Meryl and Addie--best friends gives you fears and surprises. You never know what to expect. Especially the ending. This book is worth reading just to find out what happens in the end. It made me sad and wish that it weren't the ending. It taught me fairy tales dont' ALWAYS have the happiest possible ending. Read it and find out for yourselF!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars","review":"I enjoyed the book very much my only disapointment was her sister didn't exactly come back, she had but in a way they weren't sisters anymore which was sorta dramatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"This book was amazing. I can't believe how action- packed and suspenseful it is. I cry and I laugh, smile and frown,so this book is really good. I love medieval books and I'm 11.

Full of romance, action, violence, sadness, everything that makes a book complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"I originally read this book when I was teaching to make sure it was apropriate for my students. I loved it so much that I read it aloud several years in a row. I occasionaly re-read it for my own enjoyment. Though it isn't as deep or as dark as the Lord of the Rings books, I think it is definately a child/youths equivilant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged down by a dead weight of an ending","review":"This wasn't such a bad novel, and I kind of enjoyed it. Not great, but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly. However, the ending really killed it for me. It's too unnecessarily long. Once the major conflict is resolved, the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah. I wish I'd just put the book down after the rain because I would've left with a feeling of at least entertainment. But after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications, only pages of explanations, I just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book. Would've been three stars if it'd just known when to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fantasy","review":"This book was very good. It was about Addie and her sister Meryl. Addie, meek and cowardly, always expected Meryl, strong and brave, to take care of her. That is, until she comes down with the Gray Death. Now Addie must break forth and find the cure to save her beloved sister. Luckily she has the help of the sorcerer Rhys, seven-leauge boots, a magical tablecloth, a cloak, a spyglass, and a sword. But when a dragon takes her not only does her weopons seem useless but it is a true test of her courage.This book was about a coward finding her bravery. It was full of adventure and drama as well as comedy. Now you're wondering why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The ending was very predictable. You know from the start how it's going to end. The begining was slow at the begining and Addie didn't have to face as many obsticals as I thought she would have. If you like suspense in a novel. This one isn't right for you. But is you like fantasy and good conquering evil then I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"Wow!! I thought this was an extremely well written fantasy.

I have read everything by the author, Gail Carson Levine, but this book is PROBABLY my favorite of them all. The main character is a girl named Addie, who is afraid of pretty much everything, including spiders and even her own shadow!! Her sister Meryl on the other hand is brave and strong and loves swords. She dreams of battling dragons and fighting alongside her father in the war. She is Addie's hero, and they remain constantly side-by-side.When Meryl gets sick with a fatal illness, it's up to Addie to find the remedy herself, despite the long and perilous journey (and her own fears) before it's too late for her beloved sister. A favorite of both mine AND my sister's, this book will remain forevermore on my shelf with my other favorite books, MANY of them being by Gail Carson Levine. Two thumbs up!! Well, three if I had an extra one. Enjoy!! ~Rinnie:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but disapointing ending","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book at lot.

You'll have to read it and find out what happens, (i recomend it) but dont get your hopes up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read!","review":"This book was perfect for when I was sick and stuck in bed all day. Levine does her magic again with creating a different world, adventurous and strong female characters, and an adorable romance. No really, romantic interest was dreamy! However, the writing of this book is just not as strong as that of Ella Enchanted - some of it seems too slow or too unrealistic (if that's even possible in the fantasy world) at times. And maybe it's just because I'm older now, but it was often too easy to guess where the story was going. I would suggest this book as an easy, entertaining, and sweet read. Just tell your inner critic to shush until after you finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GREAT STORY LINE","review":"I love this book. I have read it Three times over the years and i still love it. I read it first in 6th grade, and it was an ok read but i dont think i understood the sadness in it really. Then i read it again in 8th grade for this book review in school. I found that i loved it even beter the second time. Then i read it in my sophmore year at school and it is great. The way that the auther combines all these problems together. There is love, adventure, and even a little of humor, its like a little BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.

The pacing is good, and the characters were fun. The relationship between the sisters and between the sisters and their friends was well written. However, the reason Addie falls in love with one of those friends is not very clear or convincing in my opinion.I did like how Addie manages to defeat most of the monsters without suddenly gaining expert swordsmanship skill (without any training)...though that sudden sword-skill does appear at the very, very end.For those who care, there are a few kisses but no sex.Genre Reviews[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Two Princesses Of Bamarre","review":"I think this is the best book in the world!!!

I would have prefered it be on following one pack of wolves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolves BluRay","review":"This film was absolutely terrible. For most of the film what you are watching is in a tiny box in the center of the screen with a background image filling up the rest of the TV. My husband didn't even finish watching. It was boring and not about Wolves hardly at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way off track","review":"I see that this film was well liked by some viewers. I believe that this movie failed on three important levels: TV-style music, the lead actor narrated through the whole darn movie (I expect film to show a story as opposed to a book on tape that tells a story) and overall, it failed to intertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist cliches and trite drivel","review":"This film is a truly inauthentic portrayal of student life. The first 25 minutes (at which point we turned it off) consist of repetitive voice overs, cliches, and gimmicks such as slow motion and time lapse photography. It uses a contrived story device as an excuse to gratuitously depict female nudity in thinly veiled sexism. It is a good example of poorly conceived \\"indie\\" film-making."},{"rating":"1","title":"navel gazing nonsense","review":"I lasted about 20 minutes before I gave up. There's a better movie about someone who works a late night shift at a store and it includes a hotter babe (a young Jennifer Connelly) called \\"Career Opportunities\\" (\\"...the ones that never knock?\\" adds Joe Strummer). It's also funnier.Skip this interminable bore of a flick and go get that one. Trust me. Your life will be better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"Tiny bits of humor, unbelievably boring. The star of the show rambles on and on. The funniest scene is in the first two minutes when his ex rips into him. There are a few bits of immature humor but it just dragged on. Did I say it dragged on and on?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing film","review":"One of the best films I've seen in a long time.It has moments of pure cinematic beauty.Some of the sequences are really remarkable, almost haunting.The music combined with the narration and cinematography is spellbinding at times.I dont mean to overstate this, but I found myself marveling at the genius from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"So that's why artists are so popular","review":"Ben is an art student who no finds himself unable to sleep after his long term girlfriend dumps him. We're not talking about a restless night of sleep or two. Nor or we talking about missing a night or two of sleep. Instead he goes into full on no sleep mode, rather long term. During the hours that he should be sleeping, he finds himself wasting his time pining over his ex. Eventually he realizes this is useless behaviour and while in an all night grocery store, unable to pay for much, he decides he should should be getting cash back for those wasted hours and applies for work there.This is an odd mix of chick flick, teen-college guy movie (though in fairness the nudity in this movie is more tastefully handled than it would usually be handled in one of those \\"typical\\" guy movies), and fantasy. It all works really well together and ends up feeling really real despite how unreal the fantasy aspect should make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time","review":"I just watched this movie yesterday and it is different... unlike commercial movies this movie comes with a different perspective and different way of acting... I mean most of the movie is narrated... and this did grasp my attention while for other viewers it might seem useless and pathetic...The movie will get you in its frequency from the very beginning... I dont want to ruin nor say anything about the story...All i can say is that its worth the watch as it is deep and its one of the few movies that i have seen of which managed to send to you how a person really feels not just acting... and that is what made the narration beautiful... Just freeze the moment and let him tell you how he really feels at this very moment...Its really worth the two hours of your time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cashback","review":"I would not expect more from this movie: it's tragic, amazing, funny, a small chunk of \\"imagination\\", combined with true-life relationships - just a GOOD MOVIE. It's not, of course, a \\"family\\" movie, as it's intended for those ones 18+ or so, but I would recommend it to anyone, who really wants to enjoy, and relax, and think about all these small pieces of \\"humanity\\" around all of us. My strong feeling - should be more movies like this one, it's enough for me those \\"jaw-dropped-junk-yard-cake-into-face\\" movies, just see what a good movie should be. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I have Netflix. I regularly rate movies I have seen to better the suggestions they give me. I watched this because it was recommended to me by Netflix. While the film started off a little slow, it absolutely held my interest. I'm a bit of a weeper; of course I cried at parts. I work at a grocery store, which is why I decided to watch this flick. I think it is relevant to anyone that has (or once had) a customer service or entry-level job. Yes, it's a bit artsy, but no one I have forced to watch this has complained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone... But I loved it","review":"Personally, I loved this movie. I thought it was thoughtful and tastefully done. Yes there is nudity, but with a purpose. I read another review that said some people will love it while others will walk away wondering what it was all about. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So Film","review":"I bought this DVD because of all the rave reviews, but unfortunately I can't give it an equally great review. I thought the original movie short which was also included on the DVD was very good, but the full length movie version of the short seemed labored. Many scenes (such as the soccer game) were added only to increase the length of the short film so it would be a full length movie. On a brighter note, the special effects were very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye Candy As Lure","review":"Ill be honest.. the beautiful girl on the title page is what initially got me interested in the movie. I read the bio and the movie seemed cool enough.Gave up on it about 30-40 mins in, had to shut it down. The movie is really slow but surprisingly well done for an independent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I've seen in a LONG time","review":"Uncertain if it due to the rawness, brutal honesty, closeness to my own personal feelings, the wonderful musical score and arrangement, the cinematography, or the writing but they all are wrapped together nearly perfectly in this truly amazing movie. The only thing that doesn't seem to fit is the soccer field act, but it's a small price to pay to get to see and hear the rest of this masterpiece of a movie.For anyone that is a romantic at heart this is a must see. It will speak to you! If you're not, then it still just a good movie and a should see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artist Studies T & A to Find The Face of Love","review":"Excellent DVD. There is a short version and a full-length version on the DVD. At the far end of the full-length version there is a story to tell and it has a Chick-Flick Happy Ending, which you don't see coming at all with the short version. It is challenging to watch them one after the other, especially with company, but the short version is handy when you want to view the art and the comedy and don't want to play with the remote to avoid more dramatic and inspiring scenarios."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better every time we see it","review":"\\"Cashback\\" is a brilliant movie. It's original, funny and very engaging. The story is great and well paced (with wonderful and unique transition shots). The acting is excellent coupled with amazing and satisfying character development; You can easily believe these are real people that you would like to meet. We just loved the plot and how it played out (with a wonderful surprise twist and satisfying ending). Very re-watchable. We can't say enough good things about this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare look into the psyche of a \\"nice guy\\" who loves women.","review":"Men should own this video because it puts together the concept of being a nice guy while still appreciating the sensuality of women. You don't have to be a cad to appreciate women.Women should own this video because it so clearly shows how a man can love the female form as we are so very intended to without being a pig.Everyone should own this film because of its great story line, and the fact its not just another re-make. Here is an age old idea with a new story to support it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intellectual comedy!","review":"Deep, intellectual and humorous! Really enjoyed watching the movie.

I'm hooked on Michael Cates, and will buy more from him. I also will tell others of his great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haiti - a short introduction","review":"This is a thin booklet providing a nice overview of Haitian culure, politics and history: it contains a little bit of everything, illustrated by photographs. The scope of the book is limited, however, and considering political conflicts and agenda, it has aged a bit since 2002 edition. I like the fact that the booklet invites you to further reading, including online resources. At times, I found the language a bit twisted and information a bit insufficient (which is to be expected). If you feel you're missing some general knowledge on Haiti, this is an excellent book to start with (and easy to take with you anywhere), but make sure you update yourself with the latest political issues, before making a decision to travel there. In the time of writing this review, most Western countries advise their citizens not to travel to Haiti. That being said, I think the front page photo provides a great insight ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Overview of Haiti","review":"This little book is very thorough, accurate, and informative. This book isn't meant for the causual globe-trotting tourist but for someone who really wants to understand Haiti. The book touches on several subjects (history, agriculture, politics, religion) and then links the subjects together in a simple but thorough way that makes sense.It also touches on important but obscure subjects like why the well-intentioned eradication of the poor farmers' \\"Creole Pigs\\" in the 1980s led to much of the rural problems today. Or why 5 Gourdes (Haiti money) is called \\"one dollar\\", which is something that confuses new visitors.This isn't a deep, complex book either. It's easy to read. And it doesn't seem to have any particular political bias.If you want a good book on Haiti, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of Haiti","review":"Don't purchase this book if you're looking for an in-depth travel book, an economic or cultural primer. Do purchase this book if you would like to get a general overview of Haiti, that includes a brief mention of the voodoo religion (spelled voodou in the book). It's a good starter book to learn more about the unspoken half of island of Hispanola. A quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Response to the Right wing Libertarian below.","review":"You should read the book before this by Schwieckart titled Against Capitalism where is destroys any justification for capitalism and rips Mises' comment idea a new one. This book is just a shortened version as he states in the introduction. He criticizes every economic system predating the book. Both socialism and capitalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful version of a classic tale","review":"Polacco's book is a time honored theme, this retelling from the Ukraine. When Luba saves the Wren's life her parents insist she return to ask for a favor. The parents never seem to be satisfied and send Luba back time and time again. In the end the parents are returned to the happy couple they were when they started. This book can be successfully compared with any of the many available versions of the Fisherman and His Wife but also contains elements from The Stonecutter -- another tale available in several versions. Sometimes those with seemingly little power/wealth think other situations would make them a different person or happier. And when they do obtain power their humility is lost. Satisfaction seldom comes when one has not earned that power or wealth. Polacco's wonderously beautiful watercolors brings this theme into the full vision of readers. A delightfully new twist on a classic tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale that illustrates the dangers of greed","review":"I found this book to be beautifully written and illustrated. I love folklore and think this is a wonderful, magical introduction to folklore for any small child. Yay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How very odd","review":"This book is an odd blend of Yoga, American Indian Spirituality, and Eastern Mysticism mixed together with the author's own imaginings about what the Craft is all about. My personal opinion is that this book is more about mutated witchcraft than it is about \\"evolutionary\\" witchcraft.If you're into New Age mix & match materials passed off as witchcraft, then this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical Witchcraft book thank the Gods!","review":"Evolutionary, revolutionary, and certainly not anything you would find in a Llewellyn book. Initiated into the Anderson Feri and Reclaiming traditions priestess T Thorn Coyle is a modern witch and teacher of witchcraft.T Thorn Coyle goes beyond your basic 101 magick book and gives her readers tools they can use to transform and revolutionize their lives.

This is one of those blender \\"traditions\\" - a mix of some of this and some of that. The photos of the tatooed dancer is something you don't see in any other \\"advanced\\" books (you do see it on all high school campuses, reality TV, etc. - so much for originality). Almost everything that is presented in this \\"tome\\" has been around for many years. Read Starhawk's \\"Spiral Dance\\" for a start. The writing is repetitive to the point of being annoying. I was very disappointed because I ordered this based on all the rave reviews.

Watching them live would only reaffirm how technical and caring they were about their songs. However, with this new album, it sounds like producers put chains on their limbs and gave them songbooks. The compexity is pretty much eliminated, save for a single track, IMN. That's a shame because some of my favorite work was from the intricate bass and drum lines in previous albums. The lyrics feel too commercial compared to the depth Chaz reached in prior albums, and that plastic feel really contaminates the whole album. It's a shame to see them go early, since this was one of my absolute favorite bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Hope","review":".......at least for mudvayne, unlike a this other crap ive seen on the cd shelves lately. well back to this cd its my favorite mudvayne cd. good hard and chilled out somewhat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little mainstream there...","review":"The album itself is great, no doubt there, but the problem I have with it - Mudvayne had lost it's distinctive sound with it. I'm sure you've heard \\"Happy?\\" on the radio already, along with that songs \\"Fall Into Sleep\\" and \\"TV Radio\\" will probably soon hit the charts. My other problem with this is the dual disc format. It would be so much better to get a separate CD and DVD, but oh well...I don't know why Mudvayne became more radio-friendly, but that's not a direction I'd want the band to go into...

BUt, the DUALDISC version is worthless. THe DVD side works fine, but the CD side is picky as all heck as to what CD player it will work on.

They seem to be quite content on being the most perplexing and obscure outsider band on the planet. But I guess this is just a progression of their continuing exploration of jazz/folk/world musics. I hardly know Les Paul from Les Claypool (well...), but I suppose the Les Paul/Django Reinhardt comparisons are pretty accurate. It sounds to me like modern gypsy music played on solo acoustic guitar. It's beautiful! Your girlfriend will like it, your plants will like it...hell, your parents probably would too!

Like most vacations, this trip isn't about the destination - it's about life's journey. Fate and mistaken identity, lead our main character through a gauntlet of unpleasant experiences. Key West is a great place to do some soul searching. In this novel, the drama of comedy/tragedy, humility & humiliation are crashed into more than Florida Key, Deer. My only regrets, are that this vacation lasts less than 250 pages & that our beloved author writes only one book per year (perhaps a trip to the midwest, would improve Mr. Shame's work ethic)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mafia Wiseguys Return to Key West for Funny, Fast Read","review":"Shames newest Key West adventure features a new set of characters, but still includes his mandatory Mafia wiseguys and hit-men to get the plot rolling. In a case of mistaken identity, an innocent furniture salesman from New Jersey is the unintended target of some deadly practical jokes intended for his Mafia namesake. The interplay between the wiseguys is funny, despite the seriousness of the situation. As usual, Key West is a major character in the story. Reading a few of the earlier Shames books will give the reader a better understanding of the locale's local color."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must be prepared for silliness","review":"This is not about profound concepts, it's good old fashioned farce.

THE DESPERADOS tells of two friends reunited, one a lawman, the other an outlaw. The lawman attempts to help his friend go straight, and it takes off from there. Probably Ford's best early performance as the somewhat shady young man reformed by love. Trevor is always terrific, but let's face it . . . Buchanan always steals the show. (Williams gives him a run for his money.) Columbia's first color film is wonderful to look at, and the action scenes are fun to watch. It's great to see the good guys take on the baddies.

And don't get me wrong, there are some definite misses on this cd. However, there are great flashes of brilliance that will amaze you. The definite highlight is the title track. Shaq's delivery and the music mesh so well together, you'll start wondering if Shaq is thinking of quiting his day job (basketball)! There are even a few tracks in the beginning that give the album some lift. My suggestion is to give good listen to this cd........

It is a wonderful thing to have the old school sounds available in the market.

(This movie reminded me of the movie \\"The Ring\\" and it seemed like another American remake of the Japanese horror-movie \\"Ringu\\".) While the images are creepy, disturbing and graphic (there are a lot of scenes that depict torture), the storyline is chaotic and illogical. I didn't know whether this movie was trying to be a horror movie, a ghost story, or a serial killer movie. It tried to be everything and turned out to be a complete mess.

Actually, it would not be inaccurate to compare what he has done so far with David Fincher because the two directors have such an awesome, singular style all their own. What is unfortunate is that while Fincher was doing modern classics like Fight Club and Se7en, Malone was doing guilty pleasure B-movies.

FearDotCom is one of those times. It was the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The scenery was dark. The plot was predictable. The acting was horrid and the only thing scary was the fact that a studio backed this mess. If Stephen Dorff keeps going for films like this, people will soon be saying \\" Stephen who? \\". This won't even please a Stephen Dorff fan. If you went to see it in the movies, I feel sorry for you. If you haven't, BEWARE and don't waste your time buying it!

If this movie had half the plot and acting of a movie like \\"Seven\\" where it ran mostly in the dark you might be able to dismiss the lighting issues in this movie(where jail cells are lit with one flourescent tube).

Doom comes by going to the Fear.com website instead of watching a video but the basic plot is the same. Instead of being a reporter the heroine works for the health department. Instead of a video technician her love interest is a cop. In this, a serial killer essentially creates snuff films while internet viewers watch. Now anyone who goes to the site is doomed to die in 48 hours. Why? For exactly the same reason that was given in The Ring. The heroine in Fear.com goes on a trip, visits the ghostly victim's home and finds the body in water, just like in The Ring. The heroine gets a nose bleed just like Rachel does in The Ring. The endings are also essentialy the same.The big difference is that Ring was scary and had atmosphere. Fear.com is just gross and sloppy. It's like comparing cheese flavored cracker spread to a hunk of Cheddar. Save your cash.

Allthough it has many weak points it also has many strong points that more than make up for the slack.

In an age filled with horror movies that contain run of the mill Teen hearthrobs and paperthin plotlines, Fear dot com is received by me with open arms.

If you read the title to the film, you know what they all have in common. The film wasn't put together well. It should have created a mystery the audience wanted to solve and then drop clues along the way. The film attempted to do that in a haphazard fashion, but you really didn't know you were looking for something. The film really needed a star in one of the lead roles, which it didn't have.

Director William Malone throws away such things as character development and sensible storytelling to go for pure visceral thrills and shocks; something that worked in his 1999 remake of House on Haunted Hill, but it doesn't work it all here. The talents of Stephen Dorff and Natasha McElhone are wasted here as neither's character is allowed to develop, thus both actors give lacking performances. The story revolves around an internet site visited by four people, all of which died 48 hours after visiting the site. The screenplay is loaded with plot holes and contrievances, hardly explaining anything of the going's on. Genre stalwarts Udo Kier and Jeffrey \\"Re-Animator\\" Combs are on board in minor roles, while Stephen Rea manages to inject some life into this otherwise dismal horror pic with his maniacal performance. All in all, Fear dot com is worth a look for horror afficiondos, just don't expect much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and Disturbing","review":"Fear Dot Com was quite unsuccessful in its theatrical run. This is bad because it is quite a good movie. A word of warning: The movie is twice as graphic as The Cell which is saying something. All the violence is torture, literally and figuratively.

The story and concept was clearly hijacked from 'The Ring'. I don't know if it was the actors or the directors, but this movie just stunk big time. To top it all off, when you think of the whole concept of the movie and it's astounding resemblence to that of 'The Ring' it only makes you the viewer furious at these cowards who could'nt come up with their own scary story, and had to go and steal somebody elses. Sure they added some of their own things to create some kind of originality, but that only made the movie appear more bootleg and feeble than anything else. I gave this movie a -5 out of 5.

But instead of dying in one week you die in 48 hours. In both the \\"Ring\\" and [...] a person dies of fear and the cause of the 'curse' in a young child. A lot of movies of this ilk attempt to push the idea that there is a similarity between electronic circuitry and the human brain. A fun concept to toy with but hardly mind boggling. Still worth seeing if you like this sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, but not horrible enough for MST3K","review":"I would give this movie a better rating as a comedy than a \\"horror\\" movie. A woman who let her young, albino, frail, hemophiliac daughter play at an abandoned steel mill? That is comedy gold. And sadly, that scene was the highlight of the movie, and it was intended to be serious dialog - not humor.If you want something with a similar plot that might actually be entertaining, get The Ring or even Ringu (Hiroshi Takahashi) if you want the source material. I wouldn't even say FearDotCom is worth a rental.The movie is almost bad enough to receive MST3K treatment.As for the DVD itself, it is a pretty bare bones DVD release. Get away while you still can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a renter","review":"I can't imagine the disappointment of those who saw this in the theaters. The movie leaves you with nothing but unanswered questions. How does this ghost person know your name when you log onto the site? Why do people who log onto the site die within 48 hours? Who started the site and how is it related to the mad doctor guy? The movie has a few chilling moments, but for the most part it's a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS 0 STARS","review":"This movie is so [bad]. First off a somewhat cool idea on the internet being a theme in a horror movie ,but awful execution. This movie is slow paced and downright boring. The movie reminds of One Hour Photo meets Strangeland(yes its that bad)Terrible acting except the woman forensic does ok. Finally this movie has the worst ending in history,and the villian is as dumb as dr. giggles. Furthermore if you think this will shock with gore or anything,it won't its as tame as watching CSI or ER. AVOID THIS DVD,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED(if you don't trust my judgement just look at all the other negative reviews posted)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is so DUMB!","review":"If you're looking for a horror film to revitalize the genre, keep looking.

Half way through it I could care less about it, but with sheer willpower I managed to finish it. A decent promise (for the terror genre, anyway) was simply wasted in a manner seldom witnessed.

I have this on dvd. and love it. a powerful yet twisted horror classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading......","review":"I bought what I thought looked like a great horror movie. Wrong! Fear Dot Com was a huge let down. The only thing good about this movie is Stephen Dorff and some bloody violence. Otherwise, this movie is no where as good as it leads you to believe. People visit a \\"killer\\" of a website and then don't live to talk about it. A mad man has created a live-cam website that determines a person's worst fear and brings that fear to life 48 hours later. A detective ( played by Dorff ) is determined to find the source of the website and shut it down before more people die. It seems this would be a good suspenseful horror film but it is not. It's rather boring and doesn't live up to it's expectations!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible....","review":"\\"Fear dot com\\" has got to be the worst horror movie of all time, No wait, The worst movie of all time in any genre!I usally like all kind of horror movies, But there is nothing about this movie I liked. The best part of \\"fear dot com\\" was when the credits started to roll.It had bad acting, horrible storyline, the lighting was bad. The movie was so dark at times you didn't know what was going on.

Poor acting, lack of terror, and a hackneyed plot merit this stinker a generous 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stupidity hurts my head.","review":"This movie is the worst horror movie I've ever seen, and perhaps the worst movie in general. This is sad, considering I watch mainly horror movies. I really couldn't stand this movie. It jumps around, eludes to a few \\"scary\\" things here and there, and just doesn't make much sense overall. Sure, there are one or two scenes where I thought \\"hmmm, that was a little scary,\\" but other than that, it lost my interest. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have popped w/ the .com bust.","review":"Like some illegitimate child of the Ring, Seven, and Nightmare on Elm Street, this movie might have had a chance if it would have been released prior to Ringu and the Ring. As it stands, it's derivative, unoriginal, and sloppily acted / paced. The gal from Ronin reacts like a statue and displays almost as much acting ability for the most part of the movie; at least she has a nice facial structure and eyes. The nonsensical plot involves a tortured and eventually killed victim of a sadistic doctor reaching out through the electronic medium of the Internet [Samara goes digital?]. She punishes anyone that watches the snuff-cam set up by the doctor. Eventually everyone gets their comeuppance including the Dr. Unfortunately we can't get back the lost time devoted to watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"More giggles than goosebumps.","review":"Silly not sinister. Dimly lit scenes do not a horror film make. Sure there are plenty of grisly images designed to make you squirm, but they never really deliver a knock out punch.

At least now I've discovered my greatest fear...having to watch feardotcom again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter cinematic garbage, not even worth a rental!!","review":"Could this movie be any more of a ripoff of the plot of The Ring? Then again, I could be wrong. I'm not even sure this movie had a plot, anyway. It's just an incoherent pile of garbage that at times is almost painful to watch. There is nothing in this movie but the director's typical perverse sadism, a few impressive visuals, and some of the worst acting this side of Showgirls. Someday director William Malone is going to be arrested for something really nasty, and the world will see what a twisted sicko this guy actually is. Avoid this movie at all costs!

I really had hopes for it having read a positive review from Roger Ebert. It is an butt-numbing film. The plot is BORING. The acting is really pathetic.

Ringu, yes.FearDotCom took its inspiration from Ringu and Kairo, among other, possible.. BETTER.. flicks.This is a rather poor movie. The acting is dry, the plot incomprehensible, and the logic baffling. One of the victims is a woman who is 'afraid of drowning'. How do they know this fear, and why is it that she did not look like she was 'drowning'?At least the visuals are murky and bleak, suitable for the scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept","review":"The basic idea behind this intrigued me which is why I was generous enough to give it 2 stars.

Don't waste your time or money look how cheap the used ones are, its for a reason the movie sucks. You were warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Boring Movie","review":"I was actually thinking of giving this movie one star, but the reason I gave it two stars is because I think the idea of the movie was okay. People dying of their greatest fear 48 hours after entering a web site. But that was the only good thing about this movie. Natascha McElhone's acting was \\"not good\\".Another reason why I gave this movie two stars instead of one is because there are only about two kind-of-scary scenes, but the majority of them are just too boring. I was about halfway done watching the movie when I thought, why am I still watching this? I continued watching it, thinking that the ending would be better, but everything kept on worsening. The ending was confusing, pointless, and not scary at all. When I finished watching this movie, I realized I had just thrown my money away. This is probably the most regretful, shameful, and worthless buy I'd made. So, if you don't want to waste your time watching a bad movie, do not watch this.

The creators of this movie just sloppily threw together a bunch of uneven scenes with no cohesiveness, employed a lousy script and the result is an unimaginative mess of epic proportions with horrendous acting and a total utter joke of a horror movie.

The title is misleading. It has nothing to do with \\"historic travel US.\\" Rather this appears to be an unrelated series of industry sponsored 20 - 30 minute films. Maybe there is some value in looking at homes and industry from the 30's, 40's and 50s but we could not watch any of them all the way through; the gag factor overwhelmed us. The production values were horrible. The sound was often not synchronized and most seemed to be a long advertisement. I felt ripped off.

James Taylor's mellow voice is so smooth and soothing, and this glorious collection of songs fit him very well. There are a few well-known artists that joined in the effort, making this collection very special, namely, Chris Botti on trumpet in \\"Winter Wonderland\\", and Toots Theilemans on harmonica for \\"Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire\\", and of course, most notably, Natalie Cole in \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" ... my personal favorite song on the entire CD. James Taylor's voice with Natalie Cole's voice produce some sort of beautiful magic! I've listened to that song over and over, and it still gives me goosebumps! James Taylor sings with his whole heart and soul. I highly recommend this CD ... you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old...","review":"If you have the original JT Christmas album, realize that there are only a couple new songs on this \\"new\\" one.

I guess after six years I was expecting more new stuff..."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth vocals","review":"This CD was a gift I ordered for myself! And I was not disappointed. I enjoyed Taylor's \\"spin\\" on some of the Christmas classics but my favorite was the duet he did with Natale Cole.

Who could get tired of his voice anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"One of the best Christmas CDs I've purchased in years!JT's voice is perfect for this genre.

I love James' voice and I think the combination of his voice and gentle, reflective holiday songs is perfect for the holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Bland Mid - Whimper","review":"Sorry, folks, I know this will make me unpopular, but this album goes way beyond bland! Sounds as though all involved had a jolly, old, subdued, old time. This includes the wimpiest version of \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" that could ever possibly be recorded. How can you take a tune as magnificent as that and turn it into mush, as they did on this album. If you want to hear a respectable version, one that does the tune justice, listen to the Moody Blues, \\"December\\" from 2003. I like Christmas music as much as anyone, but not if it is just vaguely warm and fuzzy, devoid of all feeling! sorry, James. I am ready for the \\"0 out of 20 found this review helpful\\" header!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This man can do no wrong, in my book!","review":"This is my favorite Christmas music -- just the right touch of light fun and reverence for the power of Love in the world -- sung by the heartbreakingly gentle voice of James Taylor.

Nice picture of James, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorilla in a Santa Hat","review":"This is essentially the same release as the 2004 \\"James Taylor: A Christmas Album,\\" which was sold exclusively through Hallmark Stores and online for a limited time. However, this one includes \\"River\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\\" which may not have been on the Hallmark disc but WAS a bonus track on limited editions of \\"October Road\\" in 2002. The track selection is all record company hocus-pocus. The important thing is that this is James Taylor singin' some Christmas favorites, and if that doesn't put you in a more cheerful holiday spirit you're truly an incurable cold-blooded Grinch. It's one of the best holiday releases I've ever heard by anyone, and I've been around since Christmas was invented, I think. This is a can't-go-wrong purchase. Nice album cover shot, too. Nice scarf, JT. Luv yah."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Taylor in the parlour for Christmas","review":"I bought this album (and a few others) to use for a Chritmas folk show I present on local Community radio, and have to say that James warmth makes it stand out from the rest. In concert, he always makes you feel that you are sharing the night with him in your lounge room, and he somehow has managed to also do that with this album. The songs are all familiar, but the warmth of his presentation, and the great arrangemants, give this CD his special touch.Would thoroughly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"so great","review":"Just what I was hoping for.

Ten of the 14 songs are exactly the same. My son got this for me for Christmas. I was excited at first to have a new Taylor album; then totally disappointed when I played it. How do people get away with marketing an album as new when it isn't? It reminds me of drug companies who tweak a patented drug, and then proclaim that it's something brand new - just to make a buck.

You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"As a long time fan of JT, I was expecting something closer to his style of music.

All that was different from this JT CD and last years is the picture on the front of the CD and ONE song.

I really enjoy listening to the wide range of world music that has celebrated this wondrous religious holiday. And so it is with great pleasure that I recommend to you this warm, and cozy CD from one of our very talented musicians, James Taylor. I think the review by B.

But this cd, waist of money!!!Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"James Taylor's odd renditions of old Christmas favorites was disappointing. I wanted to here his soothing baritone voice bring classic Holiday songs into my home. Instead I got this. The addition of the Beatles Here Comes the Sun doesn't fit well with the other song choices either. I just took most of this record out of my Christmas music mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, faithful renditions of familiar favorites","review":"I generally prefer original recordings of older Christmas favorites, but James Taylor's recordings are unobtrusive and not overly produced, which makes them much more pleasant to listen to than similar \\"Christmas albums\\" by other pop artists. These tracks are also faithful renditions (e.g. original lyrics to \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\") that do justice to the original songs and may even offer a fresh, stripped-down take on some of them.Definitely a must-have for James Taylor fans or anyone looking for a solid collection of classic Christmas songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great holiday album from a guy who has long since established that he can sing anything","review":"James Taylor's renditions of classic holiday tunes are as good as anyone's, and when I heard this not too long ago, I discovered something truly wonderful. His version (with Natalie Cole) of the ever-popular duet standard \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" is quite possibly the first (and hopefully not last) version of this song where the female does not make mention of smoking a cigarette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"If you want to know why James Taylor has had a successful career for forty years listen to this disc. Taylor delivers warm folk and light jazz perfomances of a dozen holiday tunes. This one should please Taylor fans, folkies, and any one who enjoys holiday music. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also has an awesome title!","review":"Bullet for a Bride fits this episode about Little Joe accidently shooting a girl in a buggy in the eye and making her blind.

The pan is totally unsuitable to stir-frying combination dishes, and its shape and size make it unsuitable for other purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic adventure.","review":"Baba Yaga is one of those mythical D&D; characters that has been mentioned in publications almost from day one. The uber powerful crone who cheats death by consuming the souls of others. One of the most powerful beings in the multiverse. This module brings her to life, detailing at great length her evil practices, with one soft spot that makes her almost redeemable. This should be quite the challenge for any gaming group and can be easily placed in any campaign setting. I use Greyhawk, where she was initially conceived, but i can see an easy transition to Forgotten Realms and Eberron in particular. Your players may almost hate you as the glance furtively at their character sheets hoping upon hope that they can get out of this one.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For expert use only","review":"Remember Tomb of Horrors?

The thing that strikes me about the quality of this album is, if a film producer were to put any of these songs on a soundtrack and, say, that movie turned around and became a sleeper hit, I think this band would blow up and some major would buy the rights to destribute the album...and then, who knows, maybe the band would return.PS I once wrote the band a letter telling them I thought their CD was really good and hoped I'd see them in Boston, and they repsonded with a thank you letter, a holiday card, and a complementary 12-inch record and t-shirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit right","review":"Did not fit seemed too heavy as a cover it made me nervous ...I just used a towel over top"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too big!","review":"I bought this for my 16lb beagle & her crate for her 12+ hour trans-pacific flight.

It is a much later effort than the super cartoon of the 80's when the Joes had lost quite a bit of steam. No Snake-Eyes. No Storm Shadow. Just a bunch of Eco-Warrior guys I've never heard of fighting some toxic avenger reject who turns bugs into huge eating machines. Cobra commander makes a short appearance, but that is the only real connection to the old Joe legacy. Not a very good cartoon. And not really G.I.

El hecho de que son canciones de Mecano hace esta produccion una ganadora, pero los nuevos arreglos y la manera en que se realizo cada cancion es de antologia.Aire es la mejor cancion de este material sin duda. La Fuerza del Destino y Cruz de Navajas tambien me parecen muy buenas.

Many of these poems are supposed to be romantic -- instead, they are somewhat troubling. The author seems to think that by invading the privacy of the women close to him, he will be able to make art -- but all he does is expose a strange lack of depth (and the falseness of the gender roles constructed here).Robert Lowell was reprimanded by Elizabeth Bishop when he used his ex-wife's private words and gestures to write one of his books -- Bishop wrote \\"art is not worth it.\\" It's certainly applicable here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemon Fruit Review from NC","review":"We were very pleased with the price and quality of the lemons but not happy that it took about 10 business days to receive (Outer Banks of NC) them.

If you've listened to Mike Dooley's \\"Infinite Possibilities,\\" CD, you will really enjoy this book. If you haven't been exposed to these ideas in another form, the book might be just a little confusing, but still certainly worth your trouble.

I think she likes the queen, but she doesn't make her likeable to me, though I'm already a fan (\\"The Lion in Winter\\" is among my all-time favorite movies).Other annoyances: All the men ride Stallions. Subtle sexism? The hero's principal love interest rides a mare. Too many plot lines are left dangling, probably to make sequels easier to write.So be it.

Penman reduces her and her role to drivel as a result of Penman's clunky writing and total lack of ability to portray the tumult of the time in which Eleanor ruled. The best writing found in this book are the reviews found on the back cover of the book. Ms. Penman, what a marvelous era you write about. Give us more excitment than \\"Justin swore under his breath. But his bluff had been called.\\" Really!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraged by lack of consistent tone","review":"I am an avid fan of Penman's work. The way in which she painted with words on Here Be Dragons and the books following in that vein was breathtaking. I am extremely disappointed in The Queen's Man. The medieval setting is in disparity with the dialogue. The book transitions are disjunct.If you want lovely novels that will immerse you in the medieval period, I whole-heartedly suggest Here Be Dragons, The Reckoning, the Sunne in Splendour, or when Christ And His Saints Slept. The Queen's Man was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining medieval mystery","review":"Having read and watched several of the Brother Cadfael mysteries, I picked up The Queen's Man. I read through it in a couple of days, intrigued by the story and enjoying Sharon Kay Penman's clear, flowing writing style. She includes plenty of historical background without turning it into a history lesson; the characters are engaging and the mystery kept me guessing right up to the end. I would most definitely pick up her other books, and encourage you to give The Queen's Man a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot moves along nicely and is rich in detail.","review":"I am most impressed with Ms. Penman as an author. She has a unique way of capturing the essence of the times which she writes about. The verbage is believable and the details of the way the characters lived makes everything so beliveable. I strongly recommend The Queens Man for fans of English History and/or mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super medieval mystery","review":"Having enjoyed the Ellis Peter's Brother Cadfile mysteries, I was hopeful about \\" The Queen's Man'. I thought it slow to start and the characters hard to know until about a third of the way through. I started it on a camping trip and had to stay up past midnight to finish as the story took so many twists. I found myself comparing this to comtempory novels where no one trusts anyone else, friends and lovers are spied upon, betrayed and life is very cheap.

An overblown and unconvincing setting doesn't compensate for a lack of surprises and superficial plotting and characters, and a medieval setting that rings false. It's a boring mystery and an amateurish novel; most dissapointing from a usually wonderful writer and exhaustive researcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Man's Market Wizards","review":"This book was clearly an attempt to take advantage of the market following success of Market Wizards.

Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Keeper!","review":"Heather and Jennifer Kinley's second album is proof that not all artists are cursed by the \\"sophomore jinx.\\" This duo will give you goose bumps by their beautiful blends of harmony that only siblings can master. The album starts off rocking with their hit, \\"She Ain't the Girl for You,\\" then into the catchy \\"I'm In\\" and never misses a beat throughout the entire album. As a closing song, they deliver a masterful performance from their 1999 single, \\"Somebody's Out There Watching.\\" All of these songs could/should be released to country radio. The cd is just that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Harmony","review":"The Kinleys have one of, if not, the best harmonies of any act out there since the Judds. Not only does this album demonstrate that, but also shows off their song writing skills. The songs are cleverly written, upbeat, and even add an occasional \\"jazz\\" flavor to it. A recipe that has \\"success\\" written all over it. This is the type of cd that you pop into your cd player, and leave it in for awhile. GET THIS ALBUM--It's a piece of art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Girls!","review":"I enjoy the album. It has grown on me as I listen. I love the pop aspect of it. \\"Your Still Here\\" brings back memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"II is for 2 stars","review":"I liked Girl For You and a couple other tracks on this Cd but the rest is just filler. This talented duo should have spent more time on song selection. When you try to be too pop sounding, you lose your country audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing too different","review":"The Kinnleys' follow-up CD doesn't do anything much different from the first disc. It delivers nice easy listening country harmonies that are pleasing to the ear and don't make too much impact. I'd say this CD is even a bit weaker than the first, but not much and this is still a good effort. 4 stars even if on the lighter side of 4. The songs are fun, though not impressive, and there's a tendency to kind of sound alike, which fault the first album didn't have so much. Here are songs to note:She Ain't the Girl for YouThat's Gonna Mess You Up - this song has more energy than most, a good oneWhen the Blues and My Baby Collide - nice to hear women think of the man's mood.Me TooYeah, yeah, yeahHereSomebody's Out There Watching"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta hear it","review":"Claypool's bass creating the space for Henry Rollin's voice on \\"Tendrils\\" alone is worth more than the price of this one."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function W(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-81c0ad6c"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/39.md","filePath":"library/39.md"}'),j={name:"library/39.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
