There are 3 areas that it fails:1. On a practical level the binding is poor quality - within a few days the pages were falling out; and for weighty tome such as this, getting pages out of order makes the book pretty hard going. (And it is a large, heavy book - again not suitable for small children, or for an adult to comfortably share).2. On a design level, the choice of typefaces and general layout is weak.3. Most significantly, however, is the fundamental icon set used to convey the letters/phonetics. It is an odd, inconsistent mix of nouns and verbs, and some of them are confusing. For instance, in session 1... working on 'A' for Alligator - my daughter was convinced it's a crocodile. And it went downhill from there.So I'm pleased it worked for some people, but it's not the miracle book some claim it to be. There are some nice ideas, but poorly implemented."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book advocates pinching a child if they read a word wrong.","review":"I just got this book from amazon today.

This book, however, is a ponderous failure. The depiction of an amazon woman, large and masculine, who has sex with two black men during the civil war, who teaches black children to write and read in the open, who escapes death many times because she is so bold, is a fiction that belongs in the trash not on your bookshelf. Not historical, not to his usual writing. He must now be under the influence of the women's movement to depict a Charleston woman of the Civil War in this manner. A major disappointment - do NOT spend your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance - Not Historical Fiction","review":"Firstly, the cover of this book should have a woman with a ripped bodice clinging languidly to a bare-chested man. The language between the sexes is often racy, and the undertones always sexual, that is when they're not discussing the morality of slavery, which brings me to my second point.It is difficult to believe that brutal mistreatment of slaves was so rampant. Of course they all weren't treated as well as those of the O'Hara's and the Wilkes's, but come on...This book was hard going. I must admit I only read 36 chapters, but one would think that by then a plot would have been established and characters would be developed. But the characters were never more than stiff and unnatural.The only things that kept my momentum were the cheap plot tricks, which were always murders.The book's only redeeming aspect was the interesting facts about Charleston's and South Carolina's history. Without this, it may as well have been written by Danielle Steele..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read on of Jakes best books","review":"I am a fan of John Jakes after I read the Kent family books and Savanah and seeing all the North and South movies so I had to read this book. It was enjoyable from start to the great shocking ending. The book works in so many levels the charactors are great from every generation, the civil war part is great and of corse the history is great. At times the story is like a soap but it's good but then at other times it's to fluffy. The book is full of romance, murder, deception, blackmail to make this book a great book to read over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Very predictable, poorly written, not what I was expecting from Jakes. I gave up before the end of the Revolution - from what another reviewer wrote, I gave up just in time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting history but the man cannot write decent prose","review":"This is an easy way to learn a little about the history of Charleston. But the narrative and the writing are so bad that it makes you wince. It's hard to understand what the role of the editor was, especially when dialogue is called for. Any good editor should have been able to sharpen up this silly unrealistic blather. The narrative is like the Perils of Pauline, with people being thrown under trains, eaten by crocodiles, etc. The reality was bad enough without all this dopey violent melodrama being dragged into it. Hard to understand how anyone can be a \\"fan\\" of such a mediocre writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I really enjoyed this but felt like it was missing something, maybe just not long enough to have filled in some of the gaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"BARELY WORTH READING","review":"There was a time when a John Jakes novel meant adventure, plot, history, sex and excitement. Now a JJ novel is just plodding history. I found most of the story to be underdeveloped and taking a back-seat to sticking in every bit of history that would fit.

JJ was one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"grand city","review":"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYWhether Jakes intended it or not, Charleston becomes the main character throughout this epic.

I love the way it covers the history of a city from the early 1700s to the 1860s. The treatment of the slaves is more clearly defined than most history texts will ever describe. I also much enjoyed the inclusion of the Caribbean nations' relationship to Charleston."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Charleston","review":"Having visited Charleston several times, I was was interested in its history. Several natives of Charleston recommended this book as a glimpse of its past to maybe give me a better understanding of its present. It accomplished that. I was not aware of the involvement during the time of the British, the Revolutionary war, and how that event molded the people and the history of Charleston. The hatred for the North and the pressure from South Carolina to separate from the Union and begin the Civil War was also very evident. Makes you appreciate that Charleston survived, and I better understand the people that have such pride and work so tirelessly to preserve its history. From this book, I can understand that better. I thought the main characters were very real. Hard times make for hard people, and even heroes have flaws. I felt like I had a history lesson along with a very good \\"read\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charleston by John Jakes","review":"I enjoyed reading this John Jakes book.

I have always found them to be incredibly well researched and deep. Charleston does not disappoint. The characters are interesting and well-rounded. I particularly liked Alex, Edward and Edgar. Mr. Jakes incorporates some little known aspects of the American Revolution, and Civil War into this book. I also liked how he occasionally mentions the Mains from \\"North & South\\" in this book.There were times when the battle details went on too long for me, but over all it is a wonderful book--full of insanity, passion, and interesting parallels from the beginning to the end.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a little disappointing","review":"It's written by John Jakes, therefore I can't help but like it immensely.

I have young children and pets in our home; thus I thought Corelle would be a wise choice because of their supposed anti-chip/anti-crack reputation. In fact on three separate instances of Corelle bowls being dropped on the kitchen floor, they bounced then shattered into very, very sharp shards with razor-like edges--much sharper than broken stoneware and china I've seen. Perhaps most disappointing is that my e-mail communication with Corelle's customer service has been completely ignored.

I enjoyed \\"Building a CD Illustration\\" which melds several Fireworks techniques into a single lesson. The results were pretty cool. The chapters on Flash integration, Dreamweaver integration, and automating Fireworks are also very insightful. For those concerned that the companion web site was shut down and the online tutorials are now unavailable, you can find the downloadable chapter files at the URL that is mentioned numerous times throughout the book.

I read mainly Grisham, Sidney Sheldon, Turow and such. I could not have been advised to have read a better book. Although some of his facts were not true about the Catholic religion, one still has to remember it is fiction.

A summary sentence would have sufficed. Seriously, if you have any sort of literary taste, skip this. I kept waiting for the really intriguing parts. They never came. I figured out the whole story about a third of the way through. I don't understand the rave reviews. If you want religion there are better sources and if you want biomedical intrigue this isn't it. The Hot Zone (a great book) and others are so much better and more interesting. Additionally the lack of technical expertise when he was talking about computer stuff certainly made me question his medical research. I wanted to like it, but ultimately it was a big disappointment. Not written for people who think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal tripe","review":"If you consider yourself a reader of serious, well-written, well-structured and meaningful novels then avoid this book like the plaugue. The interesting subject matter could have been handled so much better. Cardboard stereotypical characters, tedious plot, contrived action scenes, this book has them all and then some. The whole rambling investigation contained within is simply padding to reveal the final 'astonishing' conclusion that anyone with only half their brain running will have guessed by page 100. A tepid waste of time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!","review":"I can not believe that this book gets the reviews that it does. It is terrible. I finished reading it for the same reason that I might look at a traffic accident, morbid fascination. I could not believe that someone who made themselves rich with their investigative abilities would forget for much of the book that they possessed a letter that explained everything. Or the investigator that does not notice the warning signs and is beaten to a pulp in his own hotel room. It is terribly frustrating when the reader is constantly a quantum leap ahead of the hero. Also, although the idea is a very good one, the science is all but missing. A part of one chapter late in the book is all that is devoted to the science and you will have guessed what is going on long, long before anyone in the book has a clue. Complete with hokey, easy ending. I could go on and on and on.... Oh well, maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"run away!","review":"What a spectacularly mediocre book. For a plot that dabbles across fields as interesting as international private corporate investigation, papal politics, and genetic manipulation, popping to fro between italy, DC and Switzerland, it nonetheless falls on its face. The Boys from Brazil plot is transparent from the beginning yet tortuously dragged out as our moronic protoganist (and possibly the author as well?) is dumbfounded by any scientific term more complicated than DNA. The descriptions and revelations of spycraft, travel, and gene play are generally superficial; only if you were living under a rock for 30 years would they have the cutting-edge, revealing quality that the plot requires.

He stands there and gawks at him until this guy walks right up to him and beats him up. He was saved my a screaming maid. Later on in the book, he hires a bodyguard FOR HIMSELF! He has no fighting capability at all. And he also had absolutely no personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting and hard to put down book!!","review":"Starts with the Catholic church as a background amidst its Gothic mystery. The chain of kilings and children being burned to the bone. The rationale behind it.

Must have in briefcase if frequent traveler","review":"Would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a non-boilerplate thriller. Just enough intrigue (although a touch implausible), violence, and the main character very likeable. While literary appetite not satisfied, nevertheless enjoyed the fresh style. Author should stick to English in text, as forays into italicized Italian were woefully inept, and foreign characters came out as caricatures.

But the more I read, the more preposterous the story became. The main character is supposed to be a talented detective, but at times he's so dim-witted and slow, I threw the book down in frustration.

From forgetting that he had the one Key piece of evidence, a letter that conviently explained it all, in his pocket for half the book. Tjat, and the fact that the investigator's sneaky aproach to finding out iformation was to spill out the whole story to anyone he meets, and he's shocked when the bad guys are on his tail.as for the writing, it's so-so. i found the him repeating phrases all the time and using the same themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most poorly written book I've ever read and I read 5 a wk .","review":"The default is one star or I'd give it none.

His explanation of the fertility methods was well done and easy to follow. Of course, there were a few far-fetched ideas in the book, but that is what makes it a great book of fiction. I hope it is made into a movie. I smiled when I read an article on Dr. Seed who wants to carry out cloning experiments. Not only is he as ambitious as Dr. Baresi, but we were able to use his book to explain some of Dr. Seeds ideas. The genesis code is not really too far from reality. I enjoyed it immensely. Great writing Mr. Case. This refers to the hardcover edition of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, hard to put down","review":"I am not normally a reader of murder mysteries, but this book was recommended by the staff at the local bookstore as the best \\"unknown\\" book for Christmas. My wife, mother-in-law, father-in-law, and I all loved the book. It was hard to put down. The only negative is that the main character \\"misses\\" some obvious clues. For example, why was a murder victim exhumed and burnt to ashes with thermite, one of the hottest materials known to man? The main character never asks this question. Other than a few minor quibbles like that, this is an excellent book . Think of it as a murder mystery by Michael Crichton. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time for people who know science","review":"This book is a sort of fantasy based on the topics of bioengineering and Catholicism. But it is VERY clear that the author has no real understanding of either subject. The ideas and events that occur in the book are a joke to anyone with any sort of background in biological science. The only reason I read this book to the end was because I believed that the main theory of the book would turn out to be a red herring. But, no. The implications turn out to be the whole point of the book and, essentially, a huge disappointment.Unfortunately, the characters don't do much to redeem the book. The relationships that build between characters seem to be the result of events that are more convenient rather than realistic. And, in the end, none of the characters have any depth. They're simply two-dimensional figures that pose as the standard stereotypes: hero, villain, and damsel in distress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling look at ethical dilemnas of the coming age","review":"I stumbled upon this book and am glad I did! Case examines the potential ethical ramifications of modern scientific investigation. While it's true the reader figures out the mystery before the protaganist does, I was kept on edge wondering how it would all pan out. Quite a good treatment of a difficult and troublesome topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept...","review":"Theoretically, an intriging concept. However, the sex and testosterone outweighed the science by at least 8 to 1. And the scientific research was poor to midling at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this can get published, I've got to start writing.","review":"If this novel was half as good as the raves (from such literary giants as People and Kirkus) suggest, we'd be talking Pulitzer here. However, I wasn't impressed. I found the dialogue tedious, and at times downright stupid. Our hero, who heads an investigation firm picked the most absurd times to decide his investigation would end. And my God, he had a CRUCIAL piece of evidence that he carried in his pocket and neglected to get the damn thing translated from Italian or just plain forgot about it! It was so frustrating. And his inane questions...please. Oh, and the \\"shocking ending\\"? Like I couldn't see that coming. But I'm not going to spoil it for you. I will tell you that there is another novel I've read that has a similar premise and is a far superior read. The only problem is I can't reveal what it is because the concept is actually a spoiler for this novel. Send me an email if you want the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"the whole book is built on one idea, but it is not enough...","review":"This book rests entirely on one idea, with which you are teased from the very beginning. By the middle, it can be pretty much guessed, but you still have a long way to go before the last sentence finally confirms your worst suspicions.The fact that the main character is the head of the most powerful investigative agency on the planet is also a spoiler, because he can too easily get what he needs at every twist and turn.A further aspect that irritated me was the fact that the authors (a couple, writing under one name) made several mistakes about things Italian (Italy is where a good deal of the book takes place), all of which could have been easily researched. I might be too demanding considering that this is meant for pure entertainment, but even when I read non-scholarly books, I expect some attention to detail.I seriously doubt that I will ever pick out a John Case again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intersting idea, shallow presentation.","review":"Half way through the book, I was bored with Joe Lassiter's fleeting for the truth. Some of the events that led to the ending were surreal as important clues just fell into place for Mr. Lassiter. The Medical aspect of the book was short-lived and delivered on a junior high level. I picked up the book for its medical possibilities and I put it down very disappointed.Intriguing idea, that could have been presented in a much more believable mannor. I would be very hesitant to pick up another of Mr. Case's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is John Case?","review":"Well done book by a pseudonym. Who is this guy and he seems to have inside information? The ending is great. Great travel book. I won't waste words.

John Case give us an excellent example."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not as far-fetched as you might think.","review":"\\"The Genesis Code\\" was a random pick...I'd heard nothing about it. I got lucky, ..the book was an excellent read.Case's novel is effective story-telling in the tradition of Ludlum. The characters might be a bit superficial, but the story-telling, and more importantly, the idea behind the plot are top-notch.The book makes you ask yourself \\"What could be so terrible?\\" Instead of being disappointed, Case came up with a premise that would indeed be frightful, and most importantly, is plausible.John Grisham books, while they too may be superficial, are excellent because they are based on good science. This book is good for the same reason. It takes \\"Jurassic Park\\" one step further.I strongly suggest you read it, but give yourself time, because once you start, you won't be able to put it down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot; tiresome characters","review":"I listened to this book on tape (unabridged). The story was interesting though it took FOREVER to unfold and I had to fight the desire to fast-forward.The characters, however, were incredibly tiresome, especially (unfortunately) the \\"hero,\\" Lassiter, who shows a remarkable lack of intuition, intelligence, and conversational savvy for somebody who owns his own detective agency.Not only does Lassiter's stupidity get a number of people killed it almost ends his life -- it's unfortunate that the reader is deprived of that happy ending, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious.","review":"When I pick up a book of suspense, I expect to be able to find interest in all and each line incuded therein. I found myself skipping lines after lines and pages after pages to find out at the end of the chapter what it really happened. So much background and lack of dialogue makes this book too slow for my liking. (it reminds me of the books by Malachi Martin:tedious, boring, fastidious and utterly uninteresing) Why does it takes a full 4 chapters for a priest to travel from Montecastello to Rome to see a cardinal? Why at page 57 Mr Lassiter is still not conducting an investigation? (considering that the book is 435 pages long). It seems that in order to find a line or two of any interest, one must skip pages after pages of background information, a narrative of unrelated facts, and a summary of character development. After all of that, I asked to myself:WHERE IS THE PLOT?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more...","review":"I was not impressed with the book at all. I read reviews where the book was a fast pace read, which I like, but to me it dragged. There were only a couple of places in the book that I was on the edge of my seat; the rest was diatribe, painstaking forays and just kind of rambled along.Although, I did enjoy some of the descriptive narrative of the places around the world where the main character had went.The whole precept was hard to believe and I could never get into to why all of this would happen. But even at that it was predictable and easy to figure out what was happening overall. I ended up feeling like it was a waste of my time reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickey we hardly knew ye...","review":"I have to agree with the previous 2 star review of this cd. I was given this set as a gift from an Allman Brothers fan who assured me that Mr Betts was back on form and the music within was top caliber. Sorry to say, as much as I've admired Dickey's playing in the past, this is a sad state of affairs. I can't believe this was even released.

I wish Dickey would clean up and play like he could before-he certainly has the talent.

While by all means a horse story, No Small Thing has many other layers, and is not at all for hippophiles only - of course, equine enthusiasts will find it special, too. A distinctive peice of equine literature, it covers a theme uncommon to all horse books before it; it's not about winning a show, or rescuing an injured foal. Instead, it covers a much more intense, realistic topic- a trio of sibling's uphill struggle to afford to keep their pony, in the face of severe povery.An interesting mix of characters, occurances, and memories blend together smoothly to create this \\"different\\" kind of a horse story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"With all due respect to the author, this book is a joke.

The previous reviewer is correct, letting the tea steep too long does cause a bitter taste but I find this to be true of most teas, particularly higher quality teas.

It is not strong, but it does contain the same varieties of scented oils that make up the finest incense cones and sticks.This fragrance is spicy-sweet and subtle, without coming off pungent.

The reviewers who liken the scent to that of incense are spot on. It smells of a very itimate, sexy incense, similar to what I think would have been used in fine European parlors almost a century ago. Wearing it I feel I should be reclining on a settee with a long cigarette holder and a cloisonne clock on the mantle. Glamorous 1920s feeling. It is unlike any other fragrance I've ever found on the market - and I'm someone who buys perfumes from all over the world.

Badarse does not equate strong willed. While I will admit that I would certainly not pick a fight with her, her will is easier to snap than a toothpick.Also the characters are pretty bland, they don't stand out well and are easily forgettable.Armstrong is a pretty good writer if you like the way she goes about it(and it much, much higher in quality when compared to a certain S. Meyer), unfortunately she's just not very good with characters, story, and maintaining the suspension of disbelief.This isn't a literary masterpiece, but it's an okay read if you're into guilty pleasures and pure enetertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak copy of tired plot","review":"\\"Moon Called,\\" by Patricia Briggs is not only more or less the same story, it's 100 times better.\\"Bitten,\\" lacks good character development.

This was a highly readable werewolf story and I highly recommend it. So many vampire/werewolf/witch books can be fake and unbelievable with poor dialogue. Here, the 'pack' mentality described within this book is carefully explained through believable examples. Elena is neither the damsel in distress nor the dangerous, leather-clad sexual icon - she's just very real. Also, there's a lot of interesting action in this book, which is a welcome departure from the stale/redundant plot lines too common in books today.I couldn't put it down. I fell asleep reading it last night in bed and had to finish the last 20 pages it at work this morning, hiding the novel from the view of my co-workers by sticking it inside my day planner. I can't wait for the next two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I disliked this book intensely. Finished it only because it was a gift. Way too much like a lesser Harlequin romance, with about as much depth and character. (Not even on par with, say, Laura Kinsale.)(35 werewolves with one female spells doom for any species' reproductive future, pretty much, by the way.)There was just... too much sap for me. Elena whines, is bossed around, angsts about a bit, and then has a bunch of sex, and I can't see why I should care. I don't like and am unable to identify with the heroine -- she's the ultimate paradox, a weak werewolf.The book isn't bad or offensive or anything -- the characters who weren't Elena were at least somewhat engaging, and the prose isn't terrible either -- it just felt bland. Like a waste of time.It hasn't encouraged me to pick up anything else by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series","review":"I love this series, the first two books really start it out with a bang, This couples story is my favorite.

Why are they doing that? What is she whining about THIS time?There is little explaination of why the bad guys are bad (other than they are mutts) and how the pack (with all of 5 members) controls every other werewolf in the world. Most puzzling of all is the fact that for some mysterious reason Elena is the only female werewolf...ever. The entire story is full of contridictions and unexplainable plot devices. And an INCREDIBLE amount of whining on the part of Elena.In the end lame plot, nothing new, ok writing, buy a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word....BORING!","review":"I bought this book mainly because I love the Anita Blake books and thought this would be a good series to start reading. Wow was I ever wrong. The book took me forever to get through. I found it tedious and very boring. It was very difficult to actually like and empathize with the main character Elena. Just read the other one star reviews already written and posted about Bitten. They say it all and I agree with every one of them. Do not waste your money buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"**SPOLIER** Wow, this book is sooo long. I think it may be because it dragged on forever! There was no point to this book! It went in circles over and over again! And Elena is such a sl*t!. I can't help it. How could she do that to both Philips and Clay. And serious? How could Clay even still want her? She so annoying! The whole book was pointless. I don't understand why she went back to her home town JUST to go back back home... And why home?? Why would she want to take the evil back home where it can find Phillips, too? And why would they think that the evil won't follow her back there? Wouldn't it be the first place they look for her?

So, I really enjoyed this new start to an urban fantasy series. Elena is a werewolf, and an intriguing character. This may not make the lists of the best literary novels of the 21st century, but it certainly is a lot of fun to read. It's not on the grim side, or the cutesy side, but is solidly entertaining and definitely exciting. The romance borders on the silly side, but I am curious to see where the next book in the series goes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book!","review":"This book is a page turner from the start. Elena is not your everyday herione of a book. she has a lot of issues and deals with things as they come. Truly a refreshing charactor. Elena was bitten by her fiance who is a werewolf. She has never forgiven him for it, and finds herself the only female werewolf to survive. She decides that she is going to go to the city and try to have a normal life, such as it is. She gets engaged to a nice \\"normal\\" man, and is living her life, when she is called back to the \\"pack\\" to deal with some renegade werewolves, or \\"mutts\\". When she gets there, she has to deal with her ex, the pack that she belongs too, and some \\"mutts\\" that have managed to organize themselves enough to create havoc.

Well the answer is, because I dream of finding that elusive book. The book that speaks to me on many levels, that is full of fierce loyalty, love, laughter and self-discovery. I find all those things and more in Kelley Armstrong's Bitten.Armstrong develops Elena Michaels into a torn character, one who thinks they have their path set, planned, perfect. However, her loyalty and subconscious love will drive her to see a much different destiny. This book describes Elena's mind, body and soul with a detail not seen by other authors. But it is not just Elena that will captivate you, but also Clayton, in a word, a renegade. Masculine and passionate and loyal to a fault.So please, take the time and read this book, it will change you!

In that, she is innovative and skillful. Unfortunately, she has a very hard time of fitting it into a believable, hermetic plot. There is no real pace, the rules and motivations are all jumbled and change from scene to scene. If you want a sappy werewolf love story with gratuitous sex then read it by all means. If you're interested in a good, pacy story, well...

Orphaned at an early age, she was shuffled from one abusive foster home to another. All Elena ever wanted was a bit of normalcy, and she thinks she has it with her boyfriend Phillip...except Elena Michaels is a werewolf; the only only female werewolf in the world, bitten by her ex-finance while in his werewolf form.In her debut novel, Kelley Armstrong provides a fresh twist on the werewolf theme. Amstrong handles Elena's inner conflicts and vulnerabilities well in a totally believable tale.With its deft blend of wit, humor and sensuality, BITTEN is an engaging read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me? I thought it was horrible?","review":"This book was so boring and akwardly written, I quit about three chapters in. For one thing, the prologue was written not only in first person, but in first person PRESENT, which is very offputting. The main story itself is told in first person, and not well. The main character comes across as completely self-centered and whining. I had no interest in her or her problems. I felt no connection with the story at all and finally gave up. Perhaps die-hard werewolf fans will like it, but I couldn't stand toturing myself any more than absolutely neccesary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"The canadian editoral reads, \\"she agonizes over ordinary girl stuff ..\\" Yes. Well, she agonizes over everything. Except cheating on her boyfriend. She just forgets about that. When she's not agonizing over something she's arguing, being stubborn, knows better than everybody or having a panic attack. I could not like this charater. I tried. I even skipped over the sex scenes. I liked the premise but I could not sympathize, empathize or respect the protagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Read, Difficult Heroine","review":"A disappointing and hard read. The author's attempt to portray the heroine as a strong woman only came across as an unlikable self righteous, bratty bitch. It was a fairly straightforward simple plot, no twists, turns or surprises, you knew who the bad guys were and that was about it. Various characters show up and are killed before you even have a chance to care. Others were fairly one note and very bland by the time their turn comes around you still don't care. I had to force myself to finish and it couldn't happen soon enough, lots of pages wasted on uninteresting boring information that leads nowhere most times. The ending picked up a bit but overall, left much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Adventure","review":"This book was quite amazing and I am very glad that I had bought it. It has an amazing tale, and since I am a werewolf/vampire addict, I couldnt help but read it once again after I had finished.

I saw all the five stars and thought, \\"Okay, what the heck.\\" Gawd, I love it when people review because it really sends me in the right direction! This book is the best book the author ever wrote. It is super engaging and unpredictable. The characters are far from perfect (except maybe in their looks) but even with the boyfriend, Clay, it was a bit enticing. There is a lot of tension between the characters and not just in the predictable ways.

Half mystery novel, half romance novel. Predictable. The dialogue was a bit sketchy sometimes, mostly because it was used to explain details that either didn't need blatant explanations, or it included things that would have been better said within the story. I think what saved it was the premise and interesting werewolves.There were a lot of sex and \\"changing\\" scenes. I almost quit halfway through after about the third time the main characters changed, werewolf flirted/rough-housed, ran in the woods, tore meat apart, and sometimes had sex.

But rather than having to read the whole book you can sum it up thusly: werewolves like to run. A lot. I mean a whole lot. They like to eat a lot. And sloppily. And drink water. They like to howl. (So far this sounds like my dog.) There is only one female werewolf so while she and her mate (who everyone can see from the beginning she is passionate about and is really quite bored with the milqtoast human she has cursory involvement with.) have sex, I'm not sure what the others do...except maybe fight over her. So, there you have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, leaves you craving for more!","review":"I learned about Kelly Armstrong's book series after reading an article in the newspaper, I immediately went out and bought bitten and could NOT put it down, Kelly's savy and realistic approach to writing the main heroine's story is a true page turner.. you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull, thinly veiled \\"Mary-Sue\\" romp","review":"I seem to be in the minority, but I did not enjoy this book at all. The main character is, of course, the \\"only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf\\" but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness. I felt the plot got swallowed up by the author's need to self-insert and 'play' in her world, and the only reason I finished this book was that I was on a plane and had nothing else to do. The plot fishtails several times, and isn't all that interesting to start with. In short, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general, and will likely skip her books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I'ed\\" to death...","review":"I could only read five pages before the writting style annoyed me. It seemed like every other sentance was started with I. I scanned through the rest of the book hoping that it was just the tone for the prologue. I didn't find a difference. The story plot seemed like it had potential and if presented a different way I might have loved it. I used an excessive amount of \\"I\\"s in this review so you might be able to appreciate my point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable......","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I feel like I wasted two days of my life that I will never get back. I found the book long-winded with pages upon pages of useless words filling the book. Thank goodness I got this from the library because if not, I would be bored as well as pissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgetable","review":"Life hasn't turned out the way Elena planed. In this fast paced novel by Kelley Armstrong, Elena believed she just wanted a simple, normal life. As we all know, nothing is ever that simple. Her live-in boyfriend and his family are giving her the normal life she craves, but they don't know she is a werewolf. Then an urgent call sends Elena hurrying back to the pack she has tried to seperate herself from and the love of her life.The danger, action and romance will draw you quickly into this preternatural reality. Bitten will keep you reading through the night. Buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not into porn.","review":"I hoped for a good story. This book began to offer that and then around page 100 was a \\"sex scene\\". I trashed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book!","review":"i enjoyed this book a lot. It is not a horror book or really too suspenseful. It is an easy read with a good plot (a mix of romance and drama). I have to say that i enjoyed the characters in this book but i think that the second book, Stolen, is much more enjoyable! Read this book and then get the next one, they are both worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...","review":"This book is Fan-freaking-tastic! Highly recommended for fans of Paranormal Romance or Urban Fantasy. Kelley Armstrong really knows how to capture a reader and write a great adult book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been 'Bitten'","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was a real hoot to read. Hopefully it will do for werewolves what Anne Rice's books did for vampires. All the characters are inviting to read ,nd the action never stops. Half way through I started looking into getting more books by the same author only to realize this was her first novel. On that level the debut is doubly impressive. I've recommended it to friends and family and am not adding my .02 cents here. It's a good strong read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful heroine","review":"I didn't like this book at all. The heroine is so unlikeable and makes such horrible choices that it is nearly impossible to root for her. Good characters are eseential for me to enjoy a book..I have to care about what happens to at least one person in order to want to continue reading. I found Elena to be a very selfish, timid and childish girl and she never grows up or stands up for herself. The main male character in the book is someone who changed someone into a werewolf by force, risking their life in a fit of obsession and who continues to control her throughout the book..I could get behind a heroine who rejected that,and since this heroine seems to like it, I couldn't like her at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Hated This Book","review":"I never actually got more than 80 pages through this book on the multiple times I tried to read. It almost made me give up on Kelley Armstrong as a writer (which would have been a real shame, since she's now one of my favorites) but I just hated Elena. I did not care about her and I found her obnoxious and annoying. I much prefer Armstrong's other protagonist and I have never finished a single book in which Elena was the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Genre Fiction","review":"It's not often that you find a book that is both genre fiction and literature, but I think Kelley Armstrong's \\"Bitten\\" comes close. It has the 'can't put it down' quality of a well plotted out piece of genre fiction and fleshed out characters. I have to admit I'm a bit of a speed reader, but I picked it up this afternoon and finished it five hours later. I just couldn't put it down.After surviving a tragic childhood, is betrayed by the one person she thought she could trust and turned into a werewolf without her consent. ... It's not that she neccisarily hates being a werewolf, it's just that after having such a messed up childhood, she can't stand having her choice taken from her without her consent.It's a story about love, sex, murder, and becoming comfortable with self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I bought and read this book \\"Bitten\\". I was so impressed by all the previous reviews that I bought \\"Bitten\\", \\"Stolen\\", and \\"Dime Store Magic\\" all at the same time. I don't have much to say favorable about \\"Bitten\\". I was so unimpressed and bored by it that I read all of it except the last twenty pages. By that time I was so disgusted that I didn't care how the book ended. I have subsequently thrown all three books into the trash, the latter two books were new and unread. Sorry, but I found it unimaginative, verbose, redundant, and yes boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good. Can't wait for another!","review":"Definitely worth reading. I liked the strong main characters and the interaction between them. It made me want to be a werewolf just so I could live with the pack. It's a modern werewolf story that I think Laurel Hamilton (Anita Blake) fans will enjoy. Lot's of fun, but too short. I polished it off in less than 48 hours over Thanksgiving. Please write more Ms. Armstrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, unlikable people do stupid things.","review":"This book is one of the most infuriating books I've ever finished. Firstly, the characters are flat and unlikable. Secondly, they're dumb. We are told repeatedly that some of them are smart, but they do INSIPIDLY stupid things. For example, they know that someone nearby is trying to kill them, yet they all go to bed at the same time. Brilliant. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it has saved me from reading anything else by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsympathetic character","review":"I've enjoyed many of Kelley Armstrongs books, but I was very disappointed in this one. Elena the only female werewolf in existence, has almost no redeeming qualities. Her character is betrayed in the worst way imaginable, her whole future \\"stolen\\" from her. But she loves the guy anyway. She says \`NO' at every opportunity to the guy, but then immediately drops her pants.She lives with Philip, a not well drawn character. Her whole life with him is a lie. Then when she betrays him in almost every way, she says, \\"well, he would never of excepted me anyway\\". I don't mind flaws in a character, but here, your rooting for the other guy.Her writing style is good, but I could not find this character believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"I was hoping this book would be a gem, but it was mediocre. Too much blah blah blah and sex, not enough wolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting series!","review":"It's hard for a book to keep me entertained. Probably because so many of them sound alike or are so predictable. However, Bitten is an excellent book. The character Elena is the girl next door that can kick butt and has a sense of humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very neurotic heroine","review":"I've enjoyed the book, its quirky and interesting, however, I sure hope that Elena gets over the neuroses that seems to consistently plague her throughout the book over the next books because it can get somewhat annoying in the long run. I'll read the other books though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change of pace","review":"This is very brightly written book that treats us to a slightly less stereotypical look at the wearwolf world. While the main character can get anoying at times (while she whines her way through her angst), she grows up nicely in this book. I really enjoy how Armstrong looked at and used real wolf behavior in her telling of this story; it really added a new dimension to the usually stale werewolf genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I got more than half way through the book before I realized that there was nothing to the story or characters. It's fast paced and sort of interesting because of the subject matter but I found it a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about melody and heart","review":"Kristen Strom is perhaps one of the Bay Area's most melodic instrumentalists. Her debut CD, \\"Intention\\" brings forth depth and a feeling of knowing, that can only come from someone who totally plays from their heart. Her duet with husband/guitarist Scott Sorkin on \\"BlackBird\\" rivals any rendition I've ever heard. Smooth, sweet and soulful are some of the words I would use to describe her tone on the tenor and soprano sax. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. You'll love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A fictionalized Pamela Smart story","review":"Why doesn't this author write a book of her own? Does she have any imagination? Any idiot could take the Pam Smart story and change the names and a few things about the characters. It's a shameless copy of the real story, and Pam Smart should be suing this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointed...","review":"I agree with one of the earlier reviewers headlines, that was something like \\"just ok, not great.\\" I've been working w/ Server 2003 for a while now, and from my work experience, I knew certain things in the book were kind of being glossed over that really needed more coverage. I would read each chapter, read the summaries, take all the practice questions, and be left with this nagging feeling that the book was not really preparing me completely for what I'd face on the exam. Unfortunately, I was right, and I just missed passing the exam. This book isn't terrible, but just be sure you use some additional resources and that you have some good work experience also."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother","review":"Poor labs, skips vital information and not that well written.

I like sybex but this one looks like it might have been rushed. I dont particularly care for the sybex CD's also. The questions were to easy for the actual Microsoft exams. Plus the chapter about optimizing Server 2003 left out some noticable details in how to optimize the page file.

The recordings were made in a reverberant hall, but not at very much cost to the orchestral detail. The slow movements are especially beautiful. Thereare tons of recordings of these symphonies, but this one and the Antonio Pappanorecordings with his Italian orchestra have a freshness which set them apart from the legions of \\"good\\" recordings of these works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilted","review":"Listening to this CD is like walking into a great Russian restaurant and ordering the best meal on the menu.

For a $23 DVD you would think it would at least come in a plastic case, instead it came in a cheap cardboard sleeve. The actual workout wasn't bad. I am not in great shape by any means. I play tennis a couple times a week and go on a treadmill or bike a couple times a week. I actually did not have difficulty keeping up with the video. The hardest part was learning the moves to keep up. It made me sweat which was good. There is a lot of jumping around so I wouldn't do this if you have knee problems. There is one woman who does the low impact version on stage, but her version looks too easy. You may as well not do this video if you can't do the full version.

So I don't know how they can be charging 23.99 for the product. If you are just trying to get a feel for the Turbo Fire workout, you better be in somewhat descent shape. Don't expect to put this in your DVD player and hit the ground running, because you won't. You will probably winded after 10 minutes.

In my opinion they've improved slightly on this album. Production is great and the songs just keep going. Right when you think these guys should be about to keel over from rocking, the drums pick up and they go into an even better part. The album seems to float seamlessly from track to track, all the while demanding your attention. This is not an album that you can simply pop in and let it fade to background music. This is total math rock saturation at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Son of Whitman and Williams","review":"The touchstones for the poetry of Thomas Jones seem to be Walt Whitman and William Carlos Williams, both of whom developed voices that were quintessentially American. As is the case with the work of these masters, the U.S. experience forms the core of Jones' writing. Whether he is reflecting on his own boyhood (\\"Birthplace\\"), his immigrant grandparents (\\"Words from the Local Shaman\\"), his desires (\\"Lost Traveler\\"), or his sojourn with friends to Whitman's house in Camden, NJ (\\"Good Grey Poet\\"), Jones is an American Everyman. While this role can open itself up to an overbearing sentimentality, Jones remains resolutely stoic. His poems are the work of an honest, committed writer for whom poetry is not merely a literary discipline, but an apparatus for living. \\"Answer to My Mother,\\" in particular, is a real gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlikely love","review":"This is beautifully written and very perceptive, a story of an unlikely love that grows over the years.

This book exemplifies what the man is made of. One can't help but infer from this collection of quotations that Bush and his wranglers are motivated not only by ignorance, but by money and hypocrisy as well.

It speaks a bittersweet and universal lanquage that I believe would equally stir the hearts of readers who cannot relate to the author's past. My only complaint about Autry is the dearth of other poetic or literary works by his hand. The world needs more fruits of his talent. Autry has the potential to join the exhilarating parade of Southern writers in the league of Harper Lee and Eudora Welty. Enough of business and leadership advice, James!

The sex scenes seem rather superfluous, as well.This isn't a bad book, but it shouldn't be ranked as high as some of the classics of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and very visual storytelling","review":"Even without the Norse mythos tie-in, the Northworld Trilogy is an enjoyable read in its own right. David Drake paints an unusual 'mini-verse' involving multiple worlds / planes of existence, with the ability for his gods to travel between them. The creation of the lightning battle armor is very inventive, and the reader can easily imagine the fight scenes as if in a movie. Character development is always interesting in a David Drake novel, and he gives the full treatment to his lead character here.Enjoyable, creative, and fun to read.

For example, in Exodus, there is no mention of Moses' receiving the ten commandments from God. It is laid out nicely, and I think would help children learn the books of the Bible in order.

Jackson's goal was to be a composer, but somehow the musical experiences that molded his musically formative years steered him into writing and performing. A book about Jackson's career starting in 1978 could span an entire second full-length memoir -- this book is quite substantial. Of note: Jackson wrote the book without the aid of a ghostwriter, which makes the words his own. And although he's no John Grisham (thankfully), the book is quite readable and very intelligent.

The repetition is helpful for pronunciation, but the same sentences are repeated over and over in every exercise ... so you walk away knowing how to say three sentences in varying forms, with little useful vocabulary.In addition, the recording quality is quite low, with other conversations often audible in the background of the dialogue and a constant hiss.While perhaps a passable foundation for someone with time to spend, it is certainly not the best course to prepare you to travel in France. At the least, it would need to be combined with a course that teaches some minimal vocabulary useful for travel situations. I just returned from several days in Paris, and found myself essentially dependent upon sign language, even after completing 10 of the 13 CDs in the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit Tactical","review":"Although it says that it fits a tactical full size 45, it does not because of the raised front sight to see over a suppressor when attached. I had to cut about a 3in. long gap for the USP Tactical 45 to fit. After that the Tactical 45 will fit it, and the holster does have a very good construction. If I do buy another HK I would just buy a blackhawk holster for a full size USP 45. All and all after the modification that I made it works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be tricked into buying this.

The authors explain the book can be used as a reference in addition to test prep. I am an IT Professional with over five years experience. I have a shelf of reference books, I was looking for a test prep book.I have to say I am not impressed by this book, and if I had been able to find it at the bookstore to look at it before buying, I would not have picked it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The whole reason for ordering this product was to get the Muck toy, for my son's birthday.

Sampling houses from a broad range of architectural styles that are set in a wide variety of environments Marc Vassallo pulls out the elements that make each a \\"Barefoot Home\\". It's an attitude and the thought that your house should be a sanctuary from the \\"big box sameness\\" that has crept into so many aspects of our lives today.If you are looking for houses that are casually elegant, quirky, fun, and full of life this book is for you. If you are looking for ideas to help design a house, or ways to make your existing home more sanctuary than simply shelter, this books is full of ideas. As someone who is on the process of thinking through the design of a house I can tell you this is a great resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Designed for wilder, more remote locations","review":"This book is beautiful, the writing lyric and inviting.But in looking for ideas for building our coastal home, I found that the windows and outdoor living areas were meant for homes in secluded or tree-sheltered locations, not on a city lot as our will be.I highly recommend this book for those with more remote building sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heated Frisco Game","review":"The Ill Mannered Posse comes back 4 the 9-6 season with a heater! The album is loaded with ill rhymes from Cougnut 'n C Fresh. Musically, the album ranges from laid back G-Funk to hard core gangster. The track \\"Shinin' Star\\" is the top joint; it has a nice relaxin' beat and rhythm. It brings to mind, a gorgeous sunny Cali day ridin with the top down hittin switches. \\"The Bay Way\\" is a fun bouncy track spittin game about the yay. \\"The Last Breath\\" is a G-Funk classic with a melodic but somber beat reminiscing on a homie that died due to violence, and how revenge is carried out. \\"Wild Ass West\\" is also dope, with a menacing bass, and a eerie keyboard synth. Make sure to peep this album; it's full of west coastin' game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bay Area Classic, get it!","review":"just get it you will not be dissapointed.

This book is not exactly that, although it definitely gives a lot of great insight. The best thing about this book is that it takes you through all the emotions you feel as a new screenwriter, all at the exact stages when you'd feel them. So many times I've wished I could call up Lawrence Kasdan or some other great mentor/screenwriter and see what he'd have to say, but Richard Krevolin does this for us! It's a really helpful book and he seems like a great guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Anyone Who Can Read...","review":"Who knew? I had to order a copy of this book after impulsively picking it up at the library. It was the word \\"soul\\" that grabbed my attention. I had to see if this was real or just a catchy title, soul starved writer that I am. Boy am I brilliant to have found this! I'm amazing! When I finished the last word, bawling like a baby, I felt like I had just stepped out of a theater in that total transformation ecstacy. But best of all, I was a mere few feet from my computer in my own little abode. All my stuff is transformed too! Wow.

It was like reading a text book. Based on the other review on this site, I tried to push on, but just couldn't spend the time reading something that I wasn't enjoying. The map at the beginning of the text didn't even include the places being mentioned in the history described in these first 40 pages.

And This dvd has been in Brazil, UK and Australia since 2004. Finally US TLC fans can have their videos on dvd. The reason why this dvd does not get a whole 5 stars is that it is missing a few essential videos such as T-Boz's \\"My Getaway\\" and \\"Touch Myself\\", \\"Hands up\\", \\"Damaged', \\"Freedom\\" {Both R & B and Rap version videos} (Theme from Panther which they participated in), Lisa's \\"Block Party\\", and their holiday song \\"Sleigh ride\\".

In the past we have ordered 2 books on separate occasions to give as gifts. One was sent in a thin envelope and damaged in the mail.

If the books don't match what your showing on the website don't make them available."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple yet eloquent","review":"I just finished this book and I have to say that I am amazed at the angry negative reviews I've read on this page. Folks, if crystals, horoscopes, tarot cards and contemplating one's navel are now considered (as was suggested in one review) modern, cutting edge psychology, then our society is in deep doo-doo. We should be furious that this mumbo jumbo has infiltrated the once respectable field of psychology, but the priest who wrote this book shows absolutely no anger towards the new age movement with which he experimented for a while. It seems clear to me that as he grew spiritually, he simply tired of the shallow, simplistic, ego-centric silliness of the new age - just as a boy becoming a young man tires of playing with the toys of his childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched","review":"Poorly researched is the best way to describe this afront to the field of behavioral and Jungian psychology.

Maggie Q delivers a good performance, but she is no Mai. Ray Park is supposed to be Rugal and the Rugal i know never skateboarded. I give the movie credit in the creation of a virtual world tournament and the attempt at a story line. deviation from the source is not a good thing. No video game based movie that deviates from the source is great. The reason for the success of Mortal Kombat and Tekken is that they stay mostly true to their source. KOF is a tournament not a showcase for ok acting. If you a fan of King of Fighters do not take this movie seriously. If you are a fan of Maggie Q please watch Preist or Nakita before juding her fighting and acting potential. If you are looking to kill two hours while not playing the game then this is ok. Better than watching grass grow and on par with Street Fighter the movie.

They keep melting and shattering! And yes, I'm using the correct bulb... and trying not to use it very often! The company is very good about sending new ones, but really????

And the sheet metal used to fabricate it wasnt completely tight and when the unit is on, the metal flaps back and forth making ALOT of noise. I think its 40% louder because of it!

(That's why I bought it without doing any research -- or even looking through it very carefully!)However, virtually all of the information in the book can be found faster and more completely documented by using the Mac Help menu on your Tiger equipped Mac. And the book doesn't even tell you how to install new software or make a copy of a CD or DVD.In summary, this book might be helpful to a person who has never used a computer--any computer--before, but it is of no value at all to anyone else.

This book chronicles the narrator's quest to write the story of this pilgrimage.\\"Journey\\" is a very \\"writerly\\" text; it's largely about the challenge of representing life experience as a written document. The book also deals with writing as both catharsis and as a burden, and with the larger issue of finding meaning in one's life. The book has touches of fantasy and offers intriguing glimpses at the inner workings of a secret society.Hesse's prose, as translated by Rosner, has an elegant simplicity and subtle power.

He initially writes with hesitation, uncertain that the League still exists, unwilling to break its code of silence, and confused by the incompleteness of his own memory. As his writing stalls, he recognizes the similarity of his problem with that of a survivor of the World War - how to describe experiences outside the experience of the normal reader. He then seeks out an apparent deserter (Leo) from the quest.Your appreciation for this novel would be enhanced if you (as opposed to myself) were a strong believer in a long esoteric tradition. Without such a belief, you will still find yourself intrigued by Hesse's grasp of human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"Another beautiful book from Hermann Hesse, the experience of travelling, feeling and believing in what is out there, and accepting it with all its differences.The experience with Leo made it a great, unpredictable journey, and when he disappeared one day, everyone around him was affected and it resulted in the breakdown of what is called the \\"League\\".\\"Words do not express thoughts very well; everything immediately becomes a little different, a little distorted, a little foolish. And yet it also pleases me and seems right that what is of value and wisdom to one man seems nonsense to another\\".It is all about experiencing it all and allowing ourselves to do that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same theme as Demian But with less force.","review":"An excellent book, but the same idea is put forth in Hesse's \\"Demian\\" with much greater force."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read but not Hesse's Best","review":"This is a good short read about self-awareness, hope, Art, and the consequences of self-willed despair. It's also a neat 'road' tale and a nostalgic look at mystical fellowship. I, too, came to it from Wolfe's Electric_Koolaid_Acid _Test! Interestingly, though, I've run across the same theme repeated in the experience of a lot of seekers after Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and fascinating book","review":"This book is being studied in a group at my church where we are comparing it to Christian belief and the faith journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey to the East by Hermann Hesse","review":"I have become interested in Eastern philosophy and wanted to read what Hesse's thoughts were on it.

After about 10 recharges, the battery stops charging. It alsoget hot and started smoking.

Plus it comes down to maybe your hip bone or even a bit higher.2.Just not worth paying 13 bucks for.In the end its better to go to an actually army navy surplus store and buy shirts there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"Overall, not bad. It does have a minor stability issue. The shuttle seems to \\"tumble\\" a little when hit (similar to the tumble you get when you hit the shuttle with the racket frame). It doesn't seem to affect it's trajectory, but you can definitely see it. Not too big of issue, but can make short serving and net play a bit unpredictable.The shuttles sure last tho. I used 1 shuttle for 5 set yesterday and at the end, it is still playable. Enough that I shoved it back into the tube for next time. In fact, the \\"tumbling\\" issue seemed to disappear after the shuttle is worn.I will have to see how the other 2 tubes (I got 3) fare before I decide to get more or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good -","review":"I am an intermediate club player in Los Angeles, this birdie last less than 1 game, if play softly it may last up to 1 game.

Sorry, but I would not buy this brand again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"These birds are not very durable. OK for beginners but if you give them a hard whack, a feather or two fall off or get bent and that affects the flight path, making them pretty much unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!!","review":"I was very disappointed with the quality of this shuttlecock.

My friends always want this shuttle when they are playing badminton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for professional guys, not that strong for learner","review":"I notice when I play with the professional guys, because they can hit at the head of the shuttlecock, then we can play quite long time; however, when I play with the learners, they hit on the feather often, and this shuttlecock is not resistant to this kind of hit strong enough. However, I think it could be catalog into \\"good\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Good read for fans of Amelia Earhart.

After a couple of hours he was wandering around as usual, seeming to be not bothered by the spray (while I was holding my nose and avoiding the area). Ick.

Do not under any circumstances use this product in your house. It will keep your cats away, sure, but it will keep you away too.

I will be going back to using the very effective, smell-free (though slightly more expensive) Feliway."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Stuff is SCARY!","review":"When I received this product and read the label on the back, I knew I would never use it. The statement \\"Hazard to Humans and Domestic Animals\\" (their words) was enough to frighten me off. I simply want to keep my cats from clawing the furniture. I looked up the active ingridients on the EPA site, and while they were listed as the lowest level of toxicity, the fact that they were at all toxic was enough to insure I would not use this product.

While the film has some serious flaws, it does have creepy atmosphere and a few good scares. The reason for my low rating it that I felt this story was too long and it has an unfulfilling ending although it stays with you, I wasn't satisfied with the ending. It leaves way too much to ones interpretation.The cast is OK, but you care little for most of these people and there are a lot of things that don't make much sense. It is still something that horror fans should at least take a look at as it does deliver some pretty good chills...something seriously missing from horror films today."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Director","review":"Incredible bad movie, the Last Winter should clearly be the last movie that Larry Fessenden directs.

A hundred and one minutes I will never get back and that makes me very sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for all horror audiences, but definitely worth seeing","review":"From Wendigo director Larry Fessenden, The Last Winter is definitely not for all horror audiences to be sure, considering its deliberate pacing and environmental tone, but for what it's worth, the film is something to behold. Ron \\"Hellboy\\" Perlman, James LeGros, Connie Britton, and Kevin Corrigan among others star as members of a drilling operation in the Arctic, and soon enough, strange and ultra-creepy things start to happen, and that's just the beginning. What The Last Winter lacks in plot it more than makes up for in atmosphere. Fessenden has managed to weave an ultra-gloomy atmosphere and enough creepy moments to keep you glued to the screen during its entire running time. The cast as a whole does pretty well, and the film's message gives the viewer enough food for thought as well. All in all, The Last Winter is definitely not meant for all horror tastes, but it is worthy of being given a shot in the very least regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely stupid movie !","review":"Save your time and money, do something else than buying or even rent this movie.

And be sure to forget the fact that oil is one of the most efficient fuels on Earth (none was used in the filming of this movie). Don't waste your time.....this movie spends too much effort trying to convince you we are all evil for using oil-created electricity to watch this movie in the first place.

I waited for 2/3 of the movie to finish just to get even a \\"Boo\\". It's apparent the movie is using the usual liberal-Hollywood-loony-leftist hype that man and the evil oil companies are killing mother earth with Global warming. Unleashing the prehistoric wrath of an ancient mother earth protecting/killing ghost. Barf. A waste of electricity folks.

I'm torn between the horrible acting (Ron Pearlman...he must have needed the paycheck but he just phoned this one in), the quasi-scientific babble, or the rediculous ghostly manifestations of the Earth spirit.I'm not going to politicize the film like some others, although the elements of global warming alarmists and anti-drilling activists are easily deciphered. These things were used as a backdrop, not a statement. Ultimately this was intended to be a horror movie, but it fell completely flat.For a genuinely great horror film about people isolated in a frozen wasteland confronting an ancient evil, watch The Thing.

Sure there are some lessons to be learned, but overall this IS a horror film. A smart horror film at that.The Cinematography and score is very unsettling and the acting job from Ron Perlman is a bunch of fun. Personally it is a huge step from \\"Wendigo\\" an even passed by \\"Habit\\". A lil bit of Carpenter's The Thing with a dash of Supernatural thrown in.

But, THIS cd actually had the original artists' names there, but none of the songs were the same as the originals.....I have no use for FAKE music.

Before I saw this album, I've never heard of Aly and AJ, and wasn't sure what to expect. Wow! I was blown away by them. They have their own version of Christmas songs, and it's such a nice touch. Now usually, when it comes to Christmas Carols, I don't like it when singers put their own twist on them, but this is the exception. They do an awesome job. Also when it comes to Christmas CD's there's one or two songs I don't like, but I love all the songs on the CD. If I had to pick a favorite, it's Little Drummer Boy. I'm really looking forward to having Christmas parties this year, and having this on in the background.If you want a CD that will enhance your Holiday season, then this is a must have for you!

I does have more rockin' songs than slow, love-type songs. My favorite song on the album is \\"Not Romeo Not Juliet.\\" The songs work together really well and there is a lot of variety. For instance, one song's intro reminds me of the intro to \\"Heaven,\\" and another song's music sounds kind of like the current trendy pop-country sound going on.

I think it's because his band is still a trio w/ only guitar, bass, and drums. Gone are the slick keyboard melodies and extra dimensions from other instruments he used in the past (violin, flute, etc). I wish he would bring back the keyboard, but the songs are now simpler, even if the meanings are deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid effort","review":"What sets this album apart from his others is its notable absence of an attempted hook: the cheesy \\"The Only Thing that Looks Good on Me is You\\" leaps to mind. Nearly all of the songs are solid, and very listenable. No cheese, and maturity as a songwriter and performer is evident everywhere. Everywhere, however, is only 37 minutes...a little disappointing since his last pure studio album was 6 years ago.I've been a fan for 23 years and know his work well. This can sit beside Reckless, Waking Up the Neighbors, Cuts Like a Kife, and On A Day Like Today as one of his stronger works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is one great album. All the songs are so great that I can't even pick my fave.The songs sound a lot like Bryan Adams' older stuff. But it's still all new.His voice sounds raspier than on his last record from 7 years ago. I think it sounds even better than before.The lyircs on this CD seem to have a lot of thought in them.Total must for every Bryan Adams and every Rock music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet","review":"I recently bought Room Serive by Bryan Adams.

The plot is silly, but this is not a major problem, as plots were never Thompson's strong suit. Unfortunately, Thompson's strengths are not present here. The writing is consistently stilted, the characters are thin and sereotyped, the scene in which the doctor \\"cures\\" a twisted,sexually repressed woman by raping her is repulsive, and the doctor's motivations are never satisfactorily explained. The most peculiar aspect of the book is that the doctor seems to have no idea of how to help his patients stop drinking. It's not much wonder that Thompson was never able to quit drinking himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Alcoholics","review":"Jim Thompson enjoyed a drink too much. He readily admitted this and his book The Alcoholics is his novel featuring his experiences in institutions where people dry out.The novel is very short (122 pages) and a quick read. It is not very enjoyable as the characterisation is limited and there are too many people one would want fleshed out more but the limited novel length prevents this.There are some adult themes in the book as well as coarse language that was not common in Thompson's works normally.I think that Thompson's main strength was the ability to create a storyline where the reader's imagination worked overtime on the horror of what he was writing about. This novel had a fair bit of that but as other reviewers have stated, was just missing that essential \\"something\\" that made it a quality read."},{"rating":"1","title":"the master misfires badly !","review":"While Jim Thompson is one of my favorite authors, even I must admit...The Alcoholics is absolute garbage! The characters have the depth of a thimble. The plot is so thin that it threatens not to exist. The writing is atrocious. It seems like Thompson wrote this over a rough weekend, or even worse...a dull one. The story gets insultingly stupid frequently. In all fairness, it should be pointed out that Thompson had ten books(that's not a misprint!) in 1953-1954. Included in that awesome number were the classics Bad Boy, A Hell Of A Woman, The Nothing Man & The Killer Inside Me had just come out the previous year(1952). So I guess you could say Thompson had a dud coming. Yeah, well...this is that dud. Any prolific writer is going to have his share of trash in the vaults."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting as a product of its time","review":"Jim Thompson's The Alcoholics was first published in 1953. The paperback copy I checked out is a Canadian edition from 1993. This guy is a crime writer (well, he was, he apparently died in 1977) with a supposedly (according to the New York Review of Books) literary bent.I found it interesting enough to read through to the end, but it seemed quite contrived and simplistic to me. I would imagine that's probably just a result of its being a product of its time, though. In any case, if real people were like the good and bad characters in the book, the world would probably be a much nicer place than it is, but perhaps not as interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, functions great","review":"Fits perfectly on your desk all squared-off.

There is very little research to back any of the assertions that are made in this book. Yes, the book does make some valid points, but stop trying to break the world into strictly masculine and feminine.

Granted, they won't teach you everything but not a lot of products can. The tapes simulate situations mainly for traveling to French-speak destinations for business or vacationing. So these tapes are great for if you are planning a trip. It doesn't touch grammar but even if they did have a book or something it porably wouldn't be as effective as some other methods for learning the actual grammar.

If you want an e-mail, web, or SQL server, those are there, too. Worth the investment, even without the FC4 distribution on the included DVD.No, I'm not a shill for Mr. Negus or Wiley Publishing -- just think the book is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for Linux newbie or end user not admin","review":"Was looking for a book geared for RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 system admins looking for info on configuring RAID with mdadm, lvm2, and ended up with a book more geared for a desktop user more interested in games and novelties than serious system administration.

Every time you open the program you have to listen to the same introductory English instructions, which quickly become annoying. The links for the online portion of the lessons seemed to be inactive. The best thing about the software is that it includes interactive exercises, in which you have simulated conversations with screen characters. Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of those exercises. I returned to package to the vendor, Nothing But Software. They were very helpful, and they gave me a prompt refund. In general, I'm sure that there are better software packages in a similar price range, for people like me who don't want to pay $500 for Rosetta Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention All Strippers!!","review":"The author admits he was once a stripper, so he really knows where to find hot men & photograph them to their best possible advantage.

Most images are in black & white, and there are some very beautiful color shots.Mike has been a photographer of male nudes for the past 16 years in the UK and Australia.

I am a resident of one such overly-commercial town, Sedona, AZ, and am delighted to see that the author has NOT included that town, and therefore, not sold-out to its national efforts to be included in all lists of \\"Art Towns\\".

As another reviewer said, the book is extremely dry. However, I'd have to disagree about being full of information. The book may have some information in between a bunch of fluff. I am not a criminology major but this book set the field back in my opinion for a few decades. A clear bias exists in every other page as the text torments and preaches to readers.

It was a season finale and not a series finale, you can definitely tell that they weren't aware the show wasn't going to be back for a 5th season. There is nothing I hate more than a network that lets down all the fans of a show by not finishing the story, I find it very disrespectful to the viewers.

The corporate geniuses in charge of Screwing their customers, have decided in their wisdom not to recognize cc on blue raye players. So I guess it's the good old pc again.

There is very little on the instruments themselves. In fact, you are not given much of an opportunity to even hear what they sound like.

Meaning, it hovers over the ground and when my 2 year old stepped on it to climb up on the potty she nearly took a header backwards when the entire stool tipped.Furthermore it slides all over the floor, having no traction pads on the bottom. An easy fix, I suppose, but just added to my ire.What a waste of time and money. I'm returning it for the white plastic Bjorn stool - sturdy, non-slip, and a quality company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy workmanship","review":"A nice little stool for kids, however, after only one day of use, I had to reinforce all the glued and stapled joints with screws!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This step up stool has helped my daughter become more independent!

It's a wonderful book filled with great illustrations. It is being used in conjuction with a program presented by the Education Committee of our local quilt guild."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern-Day Myth-Making","review":"As pretty as the pictures are, the story that children 4-8 are being told in this book has as much truth as Washington chopping down a cherry tree or Betsy Ross making the nation's first flag. Unfortunately the author presents the story as fact and not the fiction that it is. Virtually all quilt and textile historians and historians of the Underground Railroad (both white and black people) have found absolutely no evidence to corruborate the 1990's fabrication of a quilt code being used to guide slaves to freedom. It is a shame that folks anxious to make a few dollars off of this attractive but false story are teaching it to our children to the exclusion of true tales of heroic 19th century African Americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of the disputed secret quilt code","review":"This wonderfully illustrated book attempts to tell the story of a little girl and her father and their quest to find freedom from slavery. What is most disturbing is that the book's content focuses on the \\"secret quilt code\\" which scholars and historians have been disputing ever since the book Hidden in Plain View was published in 1999.Even though we realize that the use of quilts with secret messages is an appealing theme, researchers have found no evidence that quilts or quilt blocks were used in any way to guide slaves to freedom. Thus, this book shares incorrect historical information with an unsuspecting audience. This does a great disservice to African-American people everywhere especially when there are more worthy topics that could be covered which celebrate their strength, ingenuity, and courage in the face of adversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"perpetuating a myth","review":"How sad that the myth of quilts being used as maps to help slaves gain their freedom, continues to be perpetuated!

But anyway I try to buy a fan, but the manufacture does not sell the fans and they do not know who does. I said forget all this so I went to CompUSA and bought me a new PNY GeForce 4 TI4200 64Mb I put it in and started it up and install the new driver and click on my game and it started with no problems and I thank now I don't get as may crashes as I did with 3D Prophet 4000 so in a nut shell don't buy this product because if the fan stops working so will your video card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally after a VERY long wait","review":"This set was well worth the wait. I never liked the earlier video release, the copy protection kept it from playing smoothly on my TV set, and I only bought one of them (also the DVDs are a better buy for the money). This set is a lot of fun and if you are interested is well worth looking into. I am looking forward to the second set and I hope they find a way to release the Japanese Versions that were never made into American Versions. I would also be interested in those. If you haven't seen them, the original Astroboy comics are also worth looking into. The 1963 series does not do a bad job of catching the look and feel of the comics. I loved this as a kid and it still holds up pretty well. The voices are a little cutesy but it adds to the charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"It's about time that these were issued. It seems a tremendous effort went into producing this set, combining the English audio elements to the best visual elements and resynchronizing them, rather than merely taking the video that may have accompanied the English audio copies. THIS is why the Japanese versions can't be included, as one reviewer here wishes. They have different editing and running times. Personally, I'd much rather have these versions that I grew up with....let's leave the Japanese versions for another day and another set.My only complaint is that the processing of the audio seems to have sucked some of the life out of the sound......it has all the sonic earmarks of over application of digital noise reduction. Too bad, it makes for a muted quality, and sucks some of the life out of the viewing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The anime that started it all....","review":"The 1963-1964 Astro Boy that made anime.

In the future there will be a second box set of the 60's version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best anime ever","review":"The orginal manga, anime ever made by Dr. Tezuka who I feel is more of a genius than Walt Disney ever was.

It's priced as one, but it's not at all a complete edition, something on this scale and at this price should include all the original japanese language soundtrack with english subtitles.A real let down.Sadly even if you remember it in english as a child, you don't get that because the studio destroyed the original copies. So it's not so good for nostalgia, and not good for japanese animation buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leo Dan","review":"there was more mariachi songs than I would preffer but the music does encapsulate the era and his talent. very well made and produced disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"After reading Genshiken...","review":"To be fair, I've only read this volume and the Comic Party spinoff books, but, after watching the first episode of the anime, I looked forward to reading this series. However, the idiosyncratic otaku characters of Genshiken make the formulaic characters of Comic Party just that much more obvious and hollow. If you've enjoyed the previous manga volumes, I'm sure this last book will be just as much of a pleasure. But if your manga dollars are limited, I'd suggest the slightly higher-priced Genshiken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is faulty","review":"Don't get me wrong, I like the show. However, one of the disks has a fault on it. During the first five minutes of one of the episodes the sound cuts out entirely.

Even though it is only one faulty episode on one of the disks the episode in question is my favorite which makes the entire purchase very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book would be better but for many errors","review":"Contains much info on sports nicknames, but the many errors are maddening, especially since a lot of them could have been eliminated by anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of sports. Examples--book states that \\"Orioles\\" was first applied to a pro baseball team in 1833; several NFL teams are placed in the wrong division/conference; the Indiana Pacers are alleged to have taken their name from the ABA team; they actually WERE that ABA team. I could go on--one entry mentions the 7th game of the World Series, that series went 4 games. Many ommissions--in the list of origins of team names, it is not stated how, for example, the Devil Rays and Marlins got their names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other books are better","review":"This book is okay, but if you want to read about nicknames read Terry Pruyne's book about Sports Nicknames.

When Bruce started feeling frisky, he commenced a campaign of terror, rolling rocks down the hill, shattering logs, flattening brush and leaving no place for the rabbits and quail to hide.As always, Peet's pictures are delightfully evocative as the badass bear wreaks havoc indiscriminately. Bunnies and birdies scatter from the path of his boulderish bowling balls.The message of this tale is in the end how hubris will not prevail. Eventually Bruce blunders, and finds himself at the receiving end of same kind of torment that he had previously dished out.But ultimately there's a happy and redemptive ending. Readers, both children and their parents alike, come a way with a new sense of perspective even as they\`re having a lot of fun.Not Peet's best, but very good just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE Bill Peet","review":"Everything Bill Peet does is terrific.

I used mine only several times with care. One day one of the latches broke, then I started inspecting the rest of the latches. Turns out that many of them also have shown cracking indications already. This tripod is now useless, except may be I still can use it on its lowest height. I am very disapointed with this tripod. I will not recommend any Manfrotto tripods with similar leg locking mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight, but cheap tripod","review":"Manfrotto (usually) is a leader in tripods -- this tripod, however, does not meet with the typical Manfrotto standards. After one photo shoot trip, one of the leg clamps broke off, which now prevents me from locking the leg in the fully extended position. Two other clamps are cracked (cheap plastic) and will quickly fall victim to the same fate if I were to use this tripod again.My attempts to get mine repaired or replaced from the manufacturer have not been successful. My tripod lasted for one photo shoot.

This item has been great for that - it is very well built and collapses to a very small and easily concealed size.However, as others have stated, it is not the most sturdy tripod I have ever used, and it has difficulty staying still with even a small hd-video camera attached. As its length is less than some, it can be difficult to get high-up effect shots without actually pulling the top foot of the tripod off the ground to follow the shot. This works quite well once you get the hang of it.Beautiful construction, gets the job done, perfect for travel. Highly recommended for international travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, Steady, Hard to Pan","review":"This tripod is great for small digital cameras or even fair sized SLR digitals like the Canon Rebel. I can carry it around because it is light, where the heavy pods end up staying at home.However, it is not great for video use, and if you want a tripod to use for video you should consider a model with a head really designed for video.Problems with using it for video:1.lack of smooth / fluid type head -- it is hard to pan smoothly.2.the small handle, which has the lock in it, is hard to hold once you mount a camera.3.the handle lock requires a bit of force to release (or lock), causing the camera to shake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet tripod for SMALL P&S cameras.","review":"This tripod is awesome for small point and shoot cameras. I made the mistake of not researching the weight limit and my Nikon D80 with the battery grip just about fell over. 3.5lbs isn't a lot of weight but when you attach it to this tripod it becomes very sketchy. Don't risk your $1500 DSLR on a $60 tripod, spend the money and get one that is sturdy enough to hold the weight.

Koch introduces the reader to poetry as an art form that can be accessible if one does not make it too hard; he makes poetry less intimidating, more comfortable. He tries to explain how we can understand it without feeling stupid. Then, he groups poems by poet so that the reader can get to know each poet's style. Finally, each section is followed by an exercise directing the reader to write in a given poet's style. I have found the exercises thought provoking; they have broadened my own writing. My only criticism is that most of the great poets represented are men. The same could certainly be done and very successfully with more women poets, especially the confessional poets such as Plath. Overall, a great book for teachers, for writers, and for those who would like to know more about poetry but who need some convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"right. so it's not debbie... something. it's about slide guitar","review":"and that's a good thing.

I have since seen this standard droped but this one is an absolute disaster. I wish I could have my money back because this is not worth paying a penny for. There were 2 or 3 songs in there that are manageable, I 'll say who ever compiled the videos has bad taste. This is the 1st WOW DVD that I know of and one would expect it to be an absolute hit rather it is the opposite. It feels like the whole compilation was made in a haste without considering the different audience that it attract. Most of the songs are rock like artist, surely 2 would be Ok but not to the tune of 5 or 6. Unless the copies on sale can be withdrawn and another one (WOW Hits 2002) produced with new songs (which I know will not happen), I 'll not say thank you if you gave WOW Hits 2002 to me as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP-OFF PHOTOCOPIED \\"EDITION\\" (print-on-demand)!

It seems as though the author gathered elsewhere a few short threads of fact, took them home and twisted them into personal pretzel shapes of mild soft porn. Definitely, a little learning is a dangerous thing and the archaic postulation of \\"penis envy\\" made me hoot. The narcissic adults were as unconvincing as paper dolls. Some of the material involving children actually seemed uncomfortably like the author's indulgence in private fantasy you hope he doesn't take beyond the printed page.

Dude, it's our culture that's depressing, this book has the guts to look at the hideous reality of Gen Ecch and laugh in its face. It takes on TV (Melrose and 90210, in particular), literature (you'll never think seriously about Douglas Coupland again) and \\"alternative\\" music with a razor sharp wit and enough condescension to make anyone feel a little more smug about themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great book","review":"This should be mandatory reading for anyone who participates in the economy.

SVAT replaced them under warranty without a problem, but when I asked what would cause the cameras to fail, they didn't have an answer. My suspicion was a problem with the DVR. Well, 2 months out of warranty, the DVR would no longer send a video signal to either a TV or a computer through the network jack. It showed it was recording, and the computer screen controls would display, just no video. Now mind you, this DVR was on a dresser in my bedroom, and all the cameras and DVR were plugged into a surge protector. Not an environmentally hostile environment. SVAT basically told me I was SOL.

The first camera failed after about 90 days, losing it's color capability. Annoying but tolerable. Now within six months a second camera has failed completely - awaiting a response from SVAT.

Unfortunately, the Dutchman who remastered and/or remixed these songs never heard of American Rock 'n Roll and is unaware of how attuned we are to the music. Though I don't doubt that these are the original artists, the production quality of this album is so poor that the songs sound like inept covers of great tunes. DO NOT buy this album. Don't even accept it as a gift. Amazon would do well to do a little QC on the products that they distribute. P.S.

Born To Be Wild 97 by Steppenwolf? Why is it on here? Why not the original? There are a few that are the same as the US airplay versions, but most are crap. My CD1 gets an err after the 6th track.

The uncondescending tone of Dr. Balter's book makes one wish that folks who call themselves medical professionals were as decent as he. Know that \\"professional counsel\\" should make you feel better, and offer helpful solutions to medical and behavioral issues. You'll walk away with a sense of peace knowing that you can safely decide who to seek guidance from. Balter's friendly opinions are a barometer on what kind of professionals to steer towards, and away from. Fixing a problem shouldn't be a big deal. Know that professionals view a child's problem as a \\"family\\" problem; you can't fix a child without fixing the entire family organism as a whole. If you say \\"fix my child\\" but don't want to involve yourself, they'll view you as in denial. And maybe you are; just be aware of this, and look in the mirror.

It needs to be thicker overall, I think.- The rubber cap covering the screw is nice but it was really hard to lift it off. I had to use the screwdriver blade of my Swiss Army knife. The camera did screw on with no problem.- Then, finally, the strap buckle wouldn't keep the strap in a loop, but kept coming undone.I shouldn't have expected such a low-priced product to perform well.

I put mounted everyday camera on it and carried it everywhere. it was short enough to slide under my legs in the front of my truck and it was sturdy enough to jack the jaw of anyone who wanted to try something funny. A buddy of mine bought one locally to use on his vacation and paid about ten dollars more just to get it on time.Why didn't I loan him mine well the only problem I had with it was, it was too easy for some jerk to walk off with.

Because this is not a round tube, it is oval, the small section is not stable at all, it wobbles a lot with a heavy camera and glass on it.

The parts broke when I simply tried to tighten the sections the way it is designed to be used. I did not even force the clips.I have used many tripods in the past and had this type of problem on two of the cheaper models. I had anticipated that the Manfrotto brand would be a higher quality than the tripods that had broken in the past.

The rim is wide enough for them to balance on if they want. I'd give this product five stars if it weren't for the rounded corners that make it a bit hard to get to with the scoop.

She therefore offers not only her professional wisdom and expertise, but speaks from her heart.Every thought or feeling, every phase of recovery and reintegration, is covered here, all in an easy to understand and non-threatening manner.

Readers looking for a deeper, more experimentally researched, and stream-lined sythesis may do well to read Boyer's \\"Religion Explained\\" first. Boyer's work addresses areas that other reviewers find lacking in Dennett's book regarding understanding world religions and performing actual experiments.What Dennett does well is introduce the more skeptical reader to the idea that religion can be explored as a (purely) socially transmitted phenomenon. I find that Dennett generally takes great pains to balance and evaluate the pros and cons of \\"belief\\", while being honest about his own atheistic leanings up front.For those new to the (evolutionary) psychology of religion, I give this book 4 stars. For those already familiar with work similar to Boyer's, I'd give it 3 stars since Dennett is so strongly indebted to earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"endless meanders....","review":"This book was a big disappointment. As a fully persuaded atheist, the title of the book intrigued me but the substance just wasn't there. It begins with about a hundred pages of rambling where he ponders out loud endlessly about whether he should actually get to the point and then when he does he pretty much just re-states what is already well known and obvious to most reflective people in his own tedious, circumlocutious way and offers us precious little insight or interesting discussion. I think the rave reviews from readers here just reflects how desperate we secularists are for a voice to dispell religious delusions even where it falls far short of the mark of good work. This book desperately needed an infusion of substance, a good team of editors and some substantial re-writes. I have heard Dennett lecture before and been well impressed.

He missed the point early on - however, that religion serves the need of the human beast to simply overcome his fear of death.

Read it, and see if you can see the patterns emerge."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Narrow View","review":"This book starts with the premise that a religion must have an \\"agent\\" between the human and sublime to be considered for this inquiry. By beginning this way, it is aimed mostly at those revealed religions with which we are all broadly familiar. But it misses considering the more subtle spiritual ways of life that appear in human activity through the ages - and never addresses the roots of religion that can be found in looking at the entomology of the word, which by many accounts is derived from the Latin \\"ligare\\": to bind (with the suffix re - to bind again). The book then goes on in a nearly endless explanation of itself, enough for me to put it down halfway through. If you want something critical of institutional religion's negative influences, read Christopher Hitchens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I enjoyed this book. It's more philosophical than scientific. I usually prefer the more scientific approach but nevertheless a good read. Daniel C. Dennett makes a good case that believers have their place in our current society, even though they're under a spell of religion that might drive their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of thinking-Little Science","review":"It's a good read but the author begins the book by saying that a thorough scientific investigation into religion should be undertaken. The book disapoints in that regard. It is really an intellectual inquiry into \\"why religion?\\" The author is a philosopher and writes like a philosopher. He presents his theories and does an excellent job defending them with logical arguments- but that is not science.He is also a bit condescending to people of faith when he calls non-believers like himself \\"brights\\". So are people of faith \\"dulls\\"? This is unnecessary and alienates the very people he is trying to reach.Books by Pascal Boyer, Matt Ridley, Steven Pinker, and other scientists are more illuminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Braking\\" the Spell","review":"I usually don't just read a book; I devour it, and one of this size usually requires a second highlighter and more blank pages than usually allotted at the back for my own index of quotable quotes. Alas, nothing memorable emerged from this exercise in self-indulgent wit. I'm completely sympathetic with the author's view of natural religion, but if I found this a burdensome, dreary read, I doubt any religious devotee would waste their precious time considering his argument. I have read previous work by Dennett that I thoroughly enjoyed. He must have been under his own spell when he wrote this monologue. If you are contemplating this one, put on the brakes and save your money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"approaching a forbidden subject","review":"Dennett encourages us to scrutinize religious behaviors with the same critical skills we apply to other human behaviors. Patiently and politely, he builds the case that moral behavior is not dependent on theology and a belief in a supernatural God. Atheists may exhibit the same range of moral behaviors as religious believers.As to immoral behaviors, those who claim to interpret the will of God should not be exempt from scrutiny or from legal consequences. Chapter 10 is an especially good statement of Dennett's case."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells funny","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old, and she's happy with it.

If you need a \\"bed time\\" book that should put you to sleep it 5 minutes, this may be a right book for you.Otherwise, do yourself a favor, stick to GoF and Allan Holub's books.

I just don't feel the author is doing a good job. There is not enough explanation on the different design patterns. The author gives a quick overview and then gives you an example. There is nothing wrong with that. But it's very light. Each pattern is not explained enough. No benefits/drawbacks. No counter examples. Nothing really that will make the pattern \\"stick.\\" I just can't learn anything from this book.If you're looking for a GoF book in Java, I would check out Design Patterns in Java or Design Patterns Explained.

Most people have the reason to dislike it because they think it was a weak follow up to Group Sex. I disagree. True, the songs are not as short and fast as group sex, but the sound quality and the song writting has improved greatly over that album. This album is by no means \\"boring\\" or \\"uninspired\\" as other reviewers said. The songs on here are faster than most punk bands of the time. Every song on here is an amazing punk rock classic.All in all this album is completely under rated and one of the Circle Jerks best albums. The best songs on here are \\"Moral Majority\\", \\"Question Authority\\" \\"wild in the Streets\\" and \\"Letter Bomb\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best Circle Jerks Album","review":"This is the second best Circle Jerks album. If you're just getting into the Circle Jerks by Group Sex first. Then by their other albums, this one is better than Golden Shower of hits. The songs are decently fast and some are pretty catchy. Wild In The Streets is probably the best Circle Jerks song, although I Wanna Destroy you with Debbie Gibson is up there. The lyrics to the song are typical Circle Jerks lyrics, the album is longer than Group Sex so it deserves credit just for that. Definitely worth picking this album up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cricle Jerks follow-up to Group Sex.","review":"Wild in the Streets was a follow up disc to the highly influential Group Sex. The songs are a bit longer and are a little more in depth but they still hit hard. Most bands when they release a follow-up it's either a.) a repeat or b.) something completly different an an utter failure. This one falls more towards a.) but more complex, well thought out and produced. Wild in the Streets end with a fitting track (a cover of Put a Little Love in your Heart). CD comes with a booklet filled with lyrics and photos. Some releases have Group Sex and Wild in the Streets crammed on one disc.Highly recommmended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original version might get another star or two.","review":"Of the first three Circle Jerks albums (which are the only ones I 'take seriously' for lack of a better phrase) this is the weakest. I liked it a lot when it came out and I still do... I just think Group Sex and Golden Shower are stronger records, with better songs and better production.The real reason for my low rating is that this the remixed version of the album. It was remixed sometime in the late 80s or so, and the original mix has been unavailable ever since. The sad thing is, I don't think the remix is an improvement at all. The original version may have been muddier, but... well, it's probably just my own personal bias, but I think it was meant to sound that way. I really dislike this mix, it almost sounds like it was recorded live in a club. If you really want to hear this album, I suggest you find the original 1982 vinyl version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Sophmore Effort","review":"More than one person referred to this as a second outing for the band, did everybody miss wild in the streets and golden shower of hits?This is a 1985 record that came at a time when like one reviewer said it was time to continue growing.This is a good record, not great but there is some really funny stuff on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"better buy Group Sex","review":"This album is really boring, after a great classic album like \\"Group Sex\\" this band turns some slow (I mean, compared with the first!) and for being honest...this cd is boring, except a couple of tracks but it isn't enough, they lose the energy of the first and I don't wanna hear next works. they did one classic and that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring in the Streets","review":"What a weak follow up to one of hardcore's best debut's ever. \\"Group Sex\\" is so good, but the Circle Jerks could never duplicate the magic on that disc. This one starts off pretty good with title track and it also ends with two good songs. The only problem is that they are all cover songs. Sandwiched between them is mostly dull, uninspired rock. I really wanted to like this disc because it features the band's orignal line-up, which is my favorite, but I just can't. This used to be available on one CD with \\"Group Sex\\", but now they've been separated, so buy \\"Group Sex\\" and skip everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dissapointing followup to the great \\"Group Sex\\"","review":"On this album, the tunes are longer, more drawn out, and more dull than they were on the undisputed punk classic \\"Group Sex\\". Now that is a five star album, but I guess the Jerks weren't up to the task of creating an equally great next album. They certainly didn't. The songs don't have the humorously offensive yet angry lyrics of the previous album, or the speed and flow. \\"Question Authoriy\\" and \\"Moral Majority\\" are good songs however. It's an okay album, but not a punk classic by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet Boys - Video Hits, Chapter One","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Backstreet Boys and their awesome music. However, some of the early videos look really bad compared to their later videos. It is also a chance to see them grown up from boys into men and how they their style changes over time. The later videos, larger then life, shape of my heart and many of the latter ones are great whilst some of the earlier ones look a bit the same and the music is the only difference like they were not quite sure what to do with the music and not quite sure what to do with the band in these videos.

It gives you a chance to see just how much the boys have changed over the years from their early videos to their most recent. Only one thing prevents me from giving the DVD 5 stars, and that is that despite there being 16 songs on the CD, there are only 12 videos on the DVD. Very early songs such as 'We've Got It Goin' On' and 'Get Down (You're The One For Me)', are not on there and neither is the video for the latest single Drowning, despite what it says in the editorial review! (Did anybody actually review this or just read the back of the CD?!)Despite this however, my personal favourite videos of Everybody (Backstreets Back), The Call and Larger Than Life are on there meaning I can watch and drool over the boys whenever I want!All in all, a good DVD and one I definitely recommend to any BSB fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 years of hits!","review":"In 1997,Brian Littrell,Howard Dorough,Alexander J.

I think the only people that will even consider buying it are people like me that love everything Backstreet. I've always loved Backstreet videos, and I finally have all of the hits in one place, and I don't have to watch hours of MTV to get them!

I find this to be very ridiculous. And also that the video for \\"Drowning\\" isn't on there. It's on the \\"Greatest Hits\\" cd so why not be on the DVD as well?This DVD is a real disappointment. Only get it if you don't have high expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This DVD is a great compilation of the hit songs and their music videos the Backstreet Boys have produced over their first three albums: Backstreet Boys, Millennium, and Black & Blue. You can watch a progression of their music and style in this video alone.The only reason why I give this DVD a 4-star rating instead of five is because of the fact that the region 1 disk here only has the American/ Canadian hits. Hits like We've Got It Goin' On or Get Down (You're the One For Me) aren't present. Another disappointment would be the lack of the new song on The Hits CD - Drowning. The music video for Drowning isn't on this DVD, so if you wanted to buy this DVD for that purpose, you should look elsewhere for it. The DVD is amazing, though, and included my favourite video: The Call.

Also the seen where Neville Brand is watching his wife on the wall with his projector showing images of here nude in diffrent attire is really hacked up. It was cut and edited so fast you might as well have left it out of the DVD version all togather. even the rape scences have been edited. I shoued know I have the uncut version on VHS tape and made a copy of it on DVD incase the tape becomes destroyed for my self. lets find out when they are going to put out the uncut version instead.

Murray has created a new genre, alternating non-fiction nature writing with gutsy, O. Henry-surprising short stories. A lesser writer might founder with this format, but Murray brings home the goods.From a touching elegy for his mother (\\"Sandpainting\\") to hard-ball, edgy murder and action (\\"The World Behind the Sun\\"), the author writes with a deft, sure hand and leaves no false notes.Tying the work together is the place, the sun-splashed, crimson walls of the Four Corners region, Hillerman country, Abbey country - and, now, Murray country. You can't fail to want to grab your sleeping bag, lace up your boots, and head out for a hike to the Red Rock wilderness after reading this book. And after reading the title story, a gut-wrencher with a surprise ending, you'll also remember to bring along a gallon or two of water.This book is great stuff.

I expected the book to help me get my somewhat rusty mental processes back up to speed. Instead, I was massivly frustrated by their muddy explainations of practice test answers and total lack of help in choosing the correct answer. Explaining that answer \\"E\\" is correct, but not why A, B, C, and D are not and what tricks lurk in them is NOT helpful! Buy the Princeton Review's or Kaplan's LSAT book if you need logic problem help, not this dud.

Nothing has changed, they are still great looking boots that feel great and become absolutely personal after a short break-in period. Their durability comes from no excuses quality materials without shortcuts, the way things used to be done by most U.S. companies. I'm glad to see there are still enough people around that know the difference between value and price to keep Frye making boots. You'll put many. many pairs of lesser quality boots into landfills before these Frye boots are worn out. Using statistical averages, I'll likely be in the ground before these boots! I will urge anyone that likes wearing boots but hasn't known the pure comfort and pleasure of having a quality pair of boots break in just for them to get themselves a pair. It might just change the way you think about many things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent boot and Excellent service!!!","review":"Frye is top notch. This is my second Frye boot. The first one i have is a black harness, and so far, 15 years later, its still holding up! The most you'll have to do is resole them every once in a while. So, its a great investment. Most shoes / boots, do not last that long. I got the Tan Vintage and it is one of a kind. A buddy has the same pair and the look and pattern is different, so each boot has it's own old look. I have an 11.5/12 foot, and it fits perfect into a 10.5 boot. So just order a at least size or 1.5 smaller than normal. The boot is darker on the base and slightly lighter up top.

In my case I guess that would be a men's 10.5 or 11 in triple E width!Also- their definition of \\"vintage tan\\" was more like a \\"distressed mud\\" color, not even close to the picture color.

The vintage, distressed leather is really nice, and gives the boot a great look. I get a lot of complements on them. This particular model is made in Arkansas, USA. With a Goodyear welt, etc, it promises to be a good boot to wear around.If you're looking for a \\"real\\" motorcycle boot - that is to use while riding your motorcycle regularly - I suggest Chippewa or - if you have the money - Wesco - because the Vibram sole provides better grip. Frye boots these days are best for looking good and wearing around town or to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice quality product","review":"I now have 5 pairs of Frye boots and shoes.

This approach not only shows us that we are all human, well except for Frank in a manner of speaking, but also shows that the unorthodox approach might be the best approach. Page shows this time and time again with his character development as well as his writing style.For his first novel Page has really opened some doors in literature.

I have been waiting so long for the Dead Dog story arc, that now I'm no longer interested, but it's not because the delay of the DVD.

I'm a cop show fan, so I was intrigued, and when the chance came for me to pick this set up, I grabbed it. Let me tell you, the show creaks in certain spots, but it still retains the power and urgency despite the time that has passed since it aired.This is probably Ray Sharkey's best work (what a great actor, such a shame he passed so soon). Ken Wahl gives a great, haunted performance, and veteran Johnathon Banks, is as reliable as ever.This is a remarkable show that will stay with you long after the final credits roll.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Episodes","review":"I was wondering about the missing episodes myself I looked it up online and is shows that there was a whole arc or bunch of episodes that they missed from season 2 that have to deal with Isac and Dead Dog records I don't know why they didn't release those. Mine also slows down and is choppy on a Righful Place. And I agree great show just bad disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality control","review":"Thinking I had a bad disc due to the third episode on disc 1 shuddering along, I exchanged it for another...same problem. So it looks like everyone has the same badly recorded disc. Looks like a recall is in order here for this sub-standard product. What an injustice for such a great show.No wonder people are downloading copies of everything off the 'net for free. If this is what you get for your hard earned cash then I have no sympathy for the recording industry crybabies.For those who are wondering about the missing arc, I read somewhere that the \\"Dead Dog Records\\" arc was postponed due to licensing issues with the music in the episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa","review":"Episode 3 of CD 1 is horribly mastered, like a 12-for-24 frame transfer rate.

It easily doubled the impact of an already riveting scene. I'm assuming it's a legal thing, but what a very large loss. I'd almost buy another set if they put it back in.The rest of the DVD set is wonderful. I hope they do the other seasons. But this was the best one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it be the original cut broadcast on tv","review":"When originaly released on DVD the Sonny close was changed and two songs were removed from the broadcast. Will it be the same on this new release. I know it's hard to pass up a good deal like this, but I remember seeing it when it aired on broadcast tv, and the songs fit perfectly with Sonny and Vinnie. Will be very disappointing for those great songs to be deleted from this set again. Does anyone know if they are the original, unedited versions ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i thought","review":"this is a cookbook, and not a reference book, which was what i was looking for. it has many recipes in which i never heard of, mostly foreign.

A google search of his name turned up this book so I ordered it.

My line branched off fairly early from the one the book covers but it was an enjoyable read nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"This workout is just plain WEIRD.","review":"I am at a loss really to describe this workout. It stinks. This is a very easy workout for starter's so definitly NOT for an intermediate/advanced exerciser.Kathy Smith has tried to be 'cool and hip' by making this workout just plain weird. She is working out but she is super imposed onto various backgrounds and this gets to be very annoying because the backgrounds change frequently. It really is hard to describe but it seriously gave me a headache from the constant lights flashing. Oh, and there are two segments where she even has light flashing like a strobe light effect and you're left wondering, why???To sum it up, if the Hollister stores ever sold a teen workout, this would be it only they'd need to ramp up the volume 20 fold.I'm telling you this is the weirdest thing I've seen come from a noted workout instructor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was enjoying this workout and working up a good sweat and then....too bad they had to start swatting flies. That move completely ruined the workout for me. I could get past the flashing lights, cowboy hats and people being superimposed, but at 41 I can not swat flies during my workout. I normally love Kathy's workouts and am sorry to have to give this a bad rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power walk DVD","review":"Great DVD, had me sweating after 5 minutes.

I work out almost every day and use a different excercise video from Kathy and many other fitness people, so I have a large collection. I bought this one in a $2 bucket at Ocean State Job Lot, watched it this morning and was shocked at how badly it was produced. The screen/scene changes and flashes, zooming in and out quickly, makes the people on the screen look out of proportion, and is extremely annoying to watch. After using it once, I have no interest in using it again. The workout itself was pretty bad as well. She must have been having a bad day, as her comments are dumb, and everything about it is just poor quality. No wonder it was on clearance at the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Can't Do Lunges ....","review":"I started walking last year to get back into shape. I started with Leslie Sansone, and I still love her, but after starting with 1 mile and being up to 4 miles, I am getting bored. I tried many other dvds, Biggest Loser, etc. but they ALL incorporate squats and lunges. I'm still heavy and I have a painful Achilles Tendon and must be careful with my knees and tendons and I can't do 15 minutes of squats and lunges. This workout gets my heart rate up and incorporates good core moves. It is a little weird with the pulsating and superimposing Kathy's image, and the safari clothes, but I like it. If you're ready to pump up your walking a bit, and don't want to hurt your knees, try this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Distractions","review":"Kathy is chattier and sillier than the young adults in this workout. Not only that, but I found the changing backgrounds and the unsynchronized movements between Kathy and the other exercisers too distracting. After a while, I just did my own thing and stopped trying to follow them. The 10-minute ab workout at the end has the fewest distractions. (I didn't bother with the stretching segment.) I wish I hadn't purchased this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn!","review":"Kathy Smith is way too old to be hanging out, and acting like, the youngsters that are working out behind her. I agree with a previous reviewer that it is too cheesy. C'mon Kathy, get real! The shrieking and yeehaws are just too much. I couldn't even get into the DVD because of the corny distractions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing, Especially if You are a Kathy Smith Fan","review":"I've used Kathy Smith's videos (step aerobic, weights, dance) for over 20 years, so I was excited to get this one. What a huge disappointment! The set is absolutely ridiculous, with fake scenery in the background. UGH! Worse still, the moves are dull, dull, dull. As much as I am annoyed by Leslie Sansone, I have to say that her walking videos are much better than this one. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Walk Fun","review":"I was hesitant to try this workout because of some of the negative reviews here. However, I still bought the DVD because I enjoy at-home walks. I thought the matrix clock would be confusing but it actually wasn't. I actually enjoyed walking following the matrix clock. There is an arrow pointer that pops up on the TV (for a few seconds) and shows exactly which area to walk on (where is 2 o'clock or where is 10 o'clock etc.) I pretty much got the hang out it in a few minutes. What I like about this walk is that you just don't do forward walks or backward walks or sideward walks. There are walks that you do on a certain angle and that helps tone the thighs. I didn't give this the full 5 stars because Kathy is kinda cheesy and hyper in in some instances and she says some kinda strange things like power walk and imagine that you want to get that chocolate ice cream after your walk or do a bump walk like you want to say \\"hey there\\" to your boyfriend. Weird stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"power walking...","review":"THis video was too hard to keep up with guide. It is not your ordinary \\"walking\\" video. It is too hard for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain silly","review":"This workout is just dumb. The cuing is awful and the set is worse. The only reason I bought it was because it was cheap, but it is seriously so ridiculous that I couldn't even finish it once. If you want a great walking workout look for Leslie Sansone dvd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Kathy","review":"This exercise program is somewhat disjointed and hard to follow. Scene changes from Kathy to group and back. Blue-screen background; changes are distracting, and costuming is ridiculous. Some of the moves are a bit hard on the knees. I count on Kathy Smith's workouts to have a standard of quality in production as well as workout effectiveness. This one was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much walking in this walking DVD","review":"This is the worst walking DVD I have ever bought. The background is annoying, and the music is lame. There isn't much walking either. To much strange foot work, and flapping the arms.(or swatting flies as they call it in the workout) Don't waist your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"kathy smith does it again","review":"This is a really great exercise dvd. I never tire of this workout, which can be easily modified to whatever level you feel like.

Enormous amounts of space are wasted on useless stock photos of french teenagers holding hands, sitting in classrooms, and riding on trains. Instead of just saying \\"montagne -- mountain\\" ... they have to go and draw a picture of a mountain as if I didn't know what a mountain looked like.In better textbooks, most of the pictures will be replaced with INFORMATION which will make you a better reader/writer/speaker of the French language. Over 50% of the space in this book is dedicated to pictures instead of the French language. Most of those pictures are uninformative and unnecessary.This is a terrible book written for unmotivated middle schoolers who are forced to take a foreign language ... do not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent booster perfect for my son","review":"After reading many reviews on different booster seats that had removable backs, I decided on this one. The padding around the seat is very comfortable, and my son loves the pillow and the cup holders that come with it.

You will not hear John Wayne's voice on this one, close but no cigar. I have another copy of Sagebrush Trail and the original soundtrack is there, so why on this DVD, the decision was made to re-record I have no clue.All-in-all for the price, the DVD is passable.

A very enjoyable [independent] Western, unlike a similar film recently released, \\"Legend of Hell's Gate\\". Lenore Andriel did a great job with the writing and producing, especially with it being her first Western ever. She also delivered a pretty solid performance as Dr. Sarah. Michael Biehn and James Russo delivered equally solid performances in their respective roles, and let's not forget Michael Spears! I really only saw the film for Michael and Eddie Spears and Zahn McClarnon (wasn't disappointed, let me assure you!), but I came out of the movie really enjoying it and liking it. the MPAA did rate the film as \\"R\\", but in reality, the violence is less than that of \\"Hell on Wheels\\" or other modern Westerns.

I was hoping to relive some of those old times with this, but I cannot for the life of me get this disc to install the full version of the game. The installer seems to run, but then I get endless error messages saying \\"This program must be run under Microsoft Windows\\", something about divide by zero or overflow, 16 bit subsystem is out of resources, regardless of what I use for compatibility settings, even after restarts, in DOSBox, in the command prompt, with DOS EXE settings manually configured, on and on.

Absolutely perfect grooves for cool friends and a warm summer day. A happy surprise, and my favorite new CD this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the year's best releases","review":"Hepcat are one of the best ska bands out there. They play 60's style reggae that makes you want to move. Amazing instrumentals are put in between songs with some great singing by all three of Hepcat's vocalists. If you only buy one album this should definitely be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Hepcat continues to amaze me! One of the only bands out there that succesfully blends jazz, reggae, and old school ska. This band is well underated, and 5 stars is not nearly enough to say exactly how I feel about this particular recording. It's feel-good music, and something that everyone can agree on. The perfect blend of music for that pub you're pouring a beer in. You can't help but want to know the lyrics. Not only are they professional and put together with true feeling, but the voice Alex uses is perfect for the music. I think this music is perfect for anybody who wants a big change. Anyone who needs a change. For those who are open, and close minded. Guaranteed to sit in your CD player for weeks on end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleak & Stylish","review":"This is probably one of my favorite Mexican series to date. It is sleak and stylish. The cinamatography is excellent. The actors are attractive and do a great job. The characters are well developed and the action sequences are pretty exciting. I love the sets and the panoramas of Mexico City.The series is intended for a more adult audience as there is quite a bit of violence, some substance abuse and scantily clad women abound.This dvd collection is in Spanish and there are no English subtitles available!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disspapointing","review":"This one seemed to have a lot of potential. Using the Wiimote to control the sword seems like a good idea..until you play the game. All that swishing plus the missed swishes really ads up to a frustrating experience. I had this one for about a week before it went on eBay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good game","review":"This game is not good. First there is really no story or anything. You just jump from one fight to another. Also the controls for it are terrible. Do not buy this game. It is terrible. I rented the game because I had heard it wasn't good. It isn't. It sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good but short game","review":"I am a kid and I bought this game as my first game for the wii, being as I am a pirates of the caribbean fan. The game itself is fun, with the swordplay being really cool, but the game is way too short. It has around 8 levels, each one taking 15-30 minuets. You can also do Challenge mode and dueling, but the story is really short. I beat the game in 2 and a half hours. Also, only half the game is at worlds end, the other half is deadman's chest.Overall I was disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loved it!","review":"My wife is a huge fan of the entire \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" franchise, so we rented this game from the local Blockbuster and she fell in love. We ended up purchasing the game from Amazon.Gameplay is exciting, it's neat being able to wave the Wiimote like a sword and interacting with the various characters. The story line follows the movie fairly closely, and the \\"mini games\\" like Pirate Dice only add to the enjoyment! After you've played it a few times it may seem like the gameplay is a little short, but you have to remember this game does follow the movie plot. Some of the sword fights are quite long, and become progressively more difficult towards the end of the game. Overall, we thought it's a pretty good game for the Wii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Yet Kind of Confusing","review":"This game is full of action and I like that very much. However, I think it has maybe a little too much action. You have to fight something or someone every single 5 seconds. Aside from that, the graphics are great and I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested.Have fun gamers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Match Selection dissapointing","review":"I was very dissappointed to read the match selection for the DVD.Not only are one on one classics like Flair vs Luger, Magnum TA, Koloff, Vader and Savage are missing but they have taken 5 of the opponents from the first Flair set and put in matches against them on this set.The Flair vs Steamboat 94 is not their best confrontation, as the CHi Town Rumble from 89 and their mid atlantic battles are considered superior. Same can be said of Flair vs Piper as their MSG match was not their best match.Opponents from the first set take 50% of the matches (including Mr. Backstage Politics HHH). The one true gem is the match against Kerry Von Erich.The 6 man tag is the only match I have never seen (or do not remember) but having Magnum on the DVD can only be a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is all we get?","review":"looking through the other reviews on this, please tell me I am missing something. With a man that had such a great career with many great matches those are the only matches we get?if this was his first dvd I may have given it two stars but most of the backstory of flair can be found on the 1st DVD in some fashion.Such a great career and these are the matches WWE wants him remembered for, sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever the man, forever a fan, but not of this dvd","review":"I've been a fan of the Nature Boy for quite some time. This dvd came out to a lot of hype, but didn't live up to it. It seems as though they just put a lot of the information in it that was told in the first Ric Flair dvd that was released, with the exception of his retirement. The song that they put to the story line was good, but it is grossly over used in the dvd. It looks like it was rushed, which the WWE is becoming famous for, and poorly put together. The matches they included are average at best, and definately not the definative collection. Had I known what this dvd was like before I bought it, I wouldn't have wasted my money. I watched it once and haven't looked at it since."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Documetary Of Ric Flair","review":"This was a very well made dvd to me. A great story of Ric Flair's career. This dvd was not intended to give us a bunch of matches it is basically a tribute to the career of Ric Flair. This dvd does have some good matches however as said it is not many. They have the ultimate Ric flair dvd that has tons of matches on it this is not that dvd I would call this dvd more of a companion to the Ultimate Ric Flair dvd. If you want the story of Flair's career to go along with the other dvd set I defintely reccomend this dvd. I did not buy this dvd for matches I bought because of the documentary of Ric Flair. If you want to buy a dvd with lots of matches then you want the Ultimate Ric flair. To me you would be missing out by not picking up this dvd as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap bootleg","review":"This isn't a review on the movie itself, but on this version being sold on Amazon.I'm extremely disappointed in the product. The DVD is not a DVD at all but a DVD-R with a paper sticker on it as the label. The insert in the case is just printed on plain paper.Bad quality, and most likely a bootleg that somehow got past Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"IN TANK\\" CLEANERS DO NOT WORK!!!!!!!","review":"I'm still amazed that so many people fall for these \\"in tank\\" cleaners.

The reason they tell you to overfill your tank is because of the increased heat that the engine builds up when using this crap.I have (in the past) used many different brands of these cleaners in several different cars.

I own all of the US mixes plus a few Japanese ones. When a new one comes out I normally stay up and unlock it all. DDREx was an exception. I took it home and plugged in my pad, turned on my PS2 and found that they made a new game engine (DDREx originally came to Japan)... no big deal, must be to better suit the I-cam, I think. So I go to options to find that that is changed as well... and they also took out an option that turns off all buttons except the arrow keys for pad play. A feature that is on all mixes except this one and is necessary when you are playing a song with 16th notes at 260 bpm. Needless to say this made the game just a pretty shinny disc to me. Good for beginners, but I would suggest going to DDRMax 2, better songs, better engine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game ever","review":"I love Dance Dance Revolution series.In my opinion, Extreme is the best version next to 5th mix.I used the home version to train for competitive DDR with friends in the arcade. It helped me get in better shape, lose weight, make new friends.The downside is the timing of the arrows is a bigger window then that of the arcade, so while it can help you it is not comparable to the big machines. However, if you can't make it to the arcade, or have the money to spend for hours then I highly suggest extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I Say About DDR Extreme and my experiences with a little comparing.","review":"The game is similar to my DDRs at my PS2. Since my 1st time playing DDR extreme, it was at Power Station at Rockwell. Once, I tried 2(two) pads at the same time! I couldn't believe myself that I did that. It's format is good same as DDRMax. I'm also an expert player. I tried heavy on the song \\"Butterfly\\" by Smile DK and I suceeded the stage. I also tried some other songs but one DDR Extreme song. Of course, everybody knows how to dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative Messages","review":"This compilation of voices presents such different views than those we have been used to hearing from our American media mainstream sources. I loved the personal stories interspersed in many of the contributions. One of my favorite chapters was \\"Going Deeper: The Spiritual Dimension.\\" Dawna Markova, Sogyal Rinpoche, Thomas Moore and others closed the gap between politics and the spiritual path.

The first few steps are extremely comprehensive and seemingly plausible. However, each successive step get's more and more vague, and Mr. Savage's writing style does get irritating at times.It does address important issues, however, and offers innovative ideas, making this a book worthy of checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Just the right balance of inspiring metaphors and technical jargon. Written to have something for everyone. It isn't often that you see space and green advocacy combined into a seamless vision. Savage pulls off this integration of ideals and makes it sing. A must read for anyone who wants to reach the frontier without destroying the cradle of life in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"The book is layed out in a fashion that makes it easy to understand for all ages. The ideas are sound and have been showing up on television programs as of late. I think the ideas are worth looking into and could prove to be a life saver for us all. I highly recommend this book to forward thinkers and those tired of the same ol' same ol'. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An organized starting proposal and basis for progress","review":"This book is an organized starting proposal for getting enthusiasts focused on improving our chances for colonizing space. If you use search engines and look up \\"Millenial Project\\", you will find that the book has indeed inspired many people to try to refine the ideas and work at testing aspects of the plan and working to implement aspects that are implementable.Yes, the plan in the book has some flaws, but they have been documented and being worked upon or around.It is a compelling yet flawed vision, but is a good starting point for action."},{"rating":"1","title":"a naive world view. sloppy science, but still interesting","review":"His followers should not take his science seriously.

The author seems to have some inexplicable fascination with Norse mythology, as virtually every one of the 8 steps in the book is named after some aspect of Norse mythology, further distracting from any little substance the book may have to offer. Additionally, according to the author's bio on the jacket flap, the extent of his qualifications seems to be the fact that he holds a college-level English degree ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading product information","review":"This sounded fabulous from various reviews, but what was not explained was that various supplemental material was created with a specifically creationist bent.

If you use Python's interactive mode you don't even have to write many programs using this book, as much of the book can just be done via exploration at the interactive prompt.I recommend this book for several types of users. It does make a great first introduction to programming, even covering OOP concepts. It also is a great introduction to the Python language for those with a little programming experience in another language.You won't find much about all the modules available to Python, but that is not the intent of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Of The Enviornment","review":"The music is invigorating, but it is a shame everybody in this culture was conditioned to see that they were born smart or stupid instead of learning the truth that the brain functions because of an evolutionary history, environmental history, and the current situation, the brain behaves according to the contingencies of reinforcement. Those in power were made ignorant and perpetuate this disease to the masses like Bad Religion who were reinforced to ignore the evidence that cultural conditioning shaped their behavioral repertoire, AND reinforce the ignorance by saying they are born smarter then the fools and another cultural tool is made. It is sad, that this conditioned ignorance always keeps the system in place and ignorance is perpetuated ad infinitum, but life is what it is and the music on this LP is cathartic."},{"rating":"2","title":"More CLASSIC BAD RELIGION","review":"If you like old-school BAD RELIGION, you'll love SUFFER.Just look at that damn album cover.

Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suffer the best BR album","review":"In my opinion Suffer is the best Bad Religion album simply because it is the most consistent. With a lot of their albums it's usually where 1 or 2 of the tracks are good and the rest are laughably bad but this album has no flaws in my mind. My favorite tracks are 1,2,3,6,10,11 and 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"The masses of humanity will always have to suffer","review":"if they keep listening to that mainstream stuff.This album is definitely one of BR best albums. The songs are very upfront and agressive in your face punk rock songs. My favourite track off this album is 'What Can You Do.' Gregs vocal style on that song is insane, especially on the second verse. All the songs are very well crafted and are fast, hence the album is quite short but still the quality over quantity approach is present and that makes this an album any fan of punk rock should have.Ive noticed that with a few of BR albums in my opinion that is that they will kick things off with a few super fast songs and then slow it down a bit pace wise before picking it up again and then slowing it down for the ending songs.You'll see what i mean with this one from track 9...it gets really awesome and the last 5 songs are extremely good.Basically if you dont have this one then go and get it now...also props to the cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good punk album","review":"I'm not too huge into punk, but I picked this up and found that it was very good. Usually, I find myself bored to death hearing the same thing over and over again for 30 minutes, but Bad religion cover a huge range of topics, and are oddly diverse for a punk band.

Epitaph was a P.O. Box. Nobody ever heard of NOFX, Pennywise, Rancid, the Offspring or Green Day. If it wasn't for this album, all those imitator bands would have never get big.

Very loud, very aggresive, and also very short. I like the fast pace. The only weak points on this album are the last 2 songs, everything else is perfect.

Go out and get this cd now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on people!!!!","review":"Well, since \\"do what you want\\" was the first song on punk-o-rama, it was pretty much the first punk song I ever heard, and let me tell you, it changed my life. This whole album is like that. Free from the dated sound often present on the next several releases, this is just, wow. It's hard to explain. There's just something about this record. Any fan of any music could get into BR, and this is about the best place to start. Let it also be said buying this is a good way to save a lot of money on pennywise albums, since about every song they've ever written is on this. Low blow, maybe, but nevertheless, this is one of the most important albums of the modern punk movement, and anyone who hasn't heard it is missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the mind and the ears","review":"\\"Suffer\\" is constantly referred to as their best work. I will agree that it is a masterpeice, a must for any fan, but I will also admit that I don't find it to be their best work. It is, however, a thought provoking, intelligent musical experience with catchy hooks and more than enough \\"sing-along\\" parts to complete anyone's mood. As far as recording quality goes, it could have been better, but it is still some of the most influencial, intelligent punk rock ever written, hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Got Better","review":"For my money, BR never topped this album. As the \\"reunion\\" album, it was the first to feature Mr. Brett and Greg Hetson (with Jay back on bass, too) and the lyrics are intelligent before Greg really got pretentious, and the music is furious. This is hard core with an intellectual edge, and the best BR album of the lot. Probably my favorite punk album of all time.

The Buteyko methid without doubt the best help for asthmatics. It works by correcting breathing and reducing hyperventilation. I am always dissapointed as a once chronic asthmatic to read asthma books offering the same stuff. The only thing that ever helped me was the Buteyko method.

And that's saying something, because I love Gang's All Here.The Dropkicks were the first punk band (other than Green Day's Dookie albumn) that I ever heard, and they are the reason I love punk rock today. Every song on this disc is high energy, and you can sing along with them all too. It even has meaningful lyrics, something you won't get from every punk group.Do yourself a favor and ignore all the \\"NOFX 4 ever!\\" reviews; these guys deserve to be in your collection, and if you only buy one Dropkick CD, make it Do or Die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely incredible !!","review":"This is the best album I've heard since the self titled Operation Ivy album.\\"Do or Die\\" , this is an album full of deep felt anthems of every day life for the hard working honost blue collar workers in the world.

By the time \\"Barroom Hero\\" came marching in, I was ready to down my Guinness, throw the glass at my buddy, and charge though the pub smashing stuff and raising hell! And the best track, for those with Irish tastes, has got to be the long overdue punk treatment of \\"Finnegan's Wake\\". As a fan of true, old school punk, and an eternal slave to the Irish drinking song, I have found Heaven!

After he left he was replaced by Al Barr, and the band sounded different and seemed to take a different direction with a more celtic/irish sound to their songs. If you like this CD, be sure to check out the new punk band Street Dogs. The original singer, Mike Mccolgan, is now back and is the lead singer of the Street Dogs. They have their first CD release, Savin Hill, coming up soon, so be sure to check them out if you like Do or Die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best damn album around","review":"This is the best CD ever made. the bottom line is you gotta buy it. It starts of with an awesome bagpipe song and gets better and better. If you've never heard of this band before. Go and buy this CD anyway. It will blow you away. It mixes the irish folk music, with the punk music, with the rock music, with the hardcore music. Its just simply amazing. I cant stop listening to it. There are 16 songs on the CD and not one is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Cd","review":"I purchased this cd based upon the reviews in Amazon.com and was deeply disappointed. I am a fan of both punk and music which involves the fusion of Irish music with hard edged rock(ie Black 47, The Pogues). Based upon the reviews, this CD seemed like a good gamble. Unfortunately, there is very little trace of Irish music on this CD. The only exception is the first track, which is quite good. However, the rest of the disc is dismal. It is a blessing that the lyrics cannot be understood because upon reading them they turn out to be not much more compelling than a series of inarticulate grunts. If you are looking for a creative fusion of Irish music and punk, do not buy this album. If you are looking for a numbing exercise in aural monotony, then this might just be what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAWWWFULLL!!!!","review":"I am so angry that I bought this book.

For a newcomer like Corinne Bailey Rae, she has been one of those few because her songs seem organic. Her debut single Like A Star, the first single from her self-titled debut record deliver that notion quite nicely. It is a very soft and mellow song that is simply down to Earth. I like this song a whole lot because it shine quite brightly when a lot of overexposed acts like Beyonce', or Kelly Clarkson seemed to lose momentum.

Finally an episode was on with Steve and she was sucked in. I let her pick out a DVD at the store with a gift certificate she got for her birthday and this is what we ended up with. She LOVES the first episode from Blue's Room, but really does not like the others with Joe. I gave it four stars because it is one of her favorite videos even if she'll only watch the first episode. I also like that it doesn't annoy me as much as other videos do."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Blue's Clues, that's for sure!","review":"We got this movie for our toddler, who really likes the Blue's Clues cartoon that is on TV even though she's seen it only a handful of times. This movie is different from Blue's Clues. It's like Blue developed a serious case of ADD (no disrespect intended)! It's really fast paced, kind of chaotic, really jumps around, and the characters are kind of whiny and crazy. It's not bad, just a really far cry from the quality show we've seen and expected. I'm not discouraging it, but you can watch the episodes that are on the dvd on the blues clues web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this DVD. The one I have there are 6 episodes on it and the first one is Blue's Room. It brings life to the character Blue. My daughter will only watch Blue's Clues and nothing else. I bought this to have more episodes for her to watch other than the ones on my DVR and she loves it. She dances to all the songs and sings along. She is only 19 months and she has learned so much from watching Blue. She knows a few colors epecially the color Blue and knows the begining of the alphabet. She would watch this DVD all day if I would let her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue's Clues, with a LIVE Blue","review":"This DVD has three Blue's Clues episodes, and one Blue's Room episode. Blue's Clues is clever, entertaining, intelligent and funny. Blue's Room is...not.All of the things in Blue's Room have incredibly annoying voices, including Blue. And how come Blue can suddenly speak? I mean, she can't talk in front of Joe or Steve, but...she can whine at everyone else when those guys aren't around? This make NO sense to me.The Blue's Clues episodes are great; just skip the Blue's Room episode, and you're all set to learn about the alphabet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my 2 and 3 yrs old kids watched it over and over","review":"Helloim french , my husband is american when we were in states (for holidays)i was attracted by the title and the trailer on her other dvd..we tried it and big success. they watch over and over and my daughter started (3) to write letters or sign them with her body... amazed thank blues clues.so i bought 2 more dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good News","review":"My son didn't like that they didn't play blues clues in the movie like the other blues clues shows.

The author's understanding of his subject makes Frederick come to life. One can understand the forces that created the man, his strengths and weaknesses.Asprey also provides a clear view of Europe in Frederick's times. The constant conflicts between its nations is difficult to understand from the perspective of the modern reader. In our times Europe has been at peace for more than 50 years (despite the conflagration in the Balkans) yet in Frederick's time the great nations could not stop warring with each other.Most fascinating in this book, however, is the suspense filled descriptions of Frederick's major battles and the masterful way the king manuevered through the 7 year war. This was very exciting reading. It also provided insights as to how an inferior force can prevail against what appeared to be overwhelming odds."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf is this","review":"I am a LARGE fan of the aurther ledgons and this is NOTHING like my understanding of the story.

Dont, it doesnt cover org.havi.ui or org.havi.ui.event.The book states the ui APIs are under review and dont need commenting on,the same could be said for 1.0 APIs yet they are mentioned. The other things is you need the HAVi SDK to run any of the code examples. You appear to have to buy these as extra.

This HAVi/Firewire connectivity was to eliminate the sea of analog audio and video cables typically used in analog home entertainment systems. Unfortunately, Mitsubishi only produced one HAVi component, a Digital VHS (HS HD2000U) player. I don't know if Mitsubishi or any of the other HAVi members ever sold any other HAVi components in the United States. For HAVi to be successful it needed audio/video recievers, DVD, DVR, satalites, cable boxes, and game consoles. The Mitubishi WS-55511 without digital HAVi components is left using traditional analog inputs from the same old analog home entertainment system. In short, no digital input for the MPEG decoder in the WS-55511 to decipher. What a bust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"school text","review":"bought it because it was on my list of required reading.

His step-brother, AP photographer Mark Fielding decides to help mend his bro's heart while teaching her a lesson by wooing, bedding, proposing, then dumping her at the altar. Sounds like a simple enough plan; but Mark doesn't count on falling for the woman who he plans to deceive.Criswell's ode to Julia Roberts is a funny and romantic story. Readers familiar with Criswell's work will find Mama Morelli a little too similar to her other Italian mother - Mama Russo from the Baltimore books, but ths one is a gem of a story and the plot is executed well. It is followed up by \\"Suddenly Single\\" featuring her sister Lisa."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Comedy Line Debuts","review":"Francesca Morelli has an overbearing mother and a growing list of ditched-at-the-alter grooms.

It's far from a perfect match to the real Rescue Pack, but young children should easily recognize it and work it into playtime. All-in-all a good choice if it's for a cheap price. It open on the top with a small piece of velcro, and has an awkward zipper on the side. I'm not sure what the reason for the zipper was, as it just makes it easier for anything to spill out if left open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for any diego fan!","review":"Bought this for my 2 yr old nephew and he loves it! perfect size for a toddler and helps them pretend play as wel"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old likes to RESCUE!","review":"As with all of our Diego toys/items- my 2 year old finds creative ways to make our stuffed animals in some sort of danger and fills the rescue pack w/ items to help them...sometimes another animal is tucked into the rescue pack to pull the other out of danger!

It has a small plastic carry handle on top. It also comes with a stethascope that doesn't even work. The kit comes with a 3 or 4 inch plastic jaguar and a small dog food bowl to feed him with, that's about the size of a silver dollar.To round out the kit , you get a plastic xray and an animal info card.

The movie was quite pleasant, but as with all movies, it was the score that made the difference. The music written by William Goldstein was at times bitter sweet, as well as hauntingly beautiful. I say \\"hauntingly\\" because that is the premise of the film. A woman dies and is brought back to life by her beloved sister, and the unknowing revived woman haunts all those who believed she was dead. The music is the sweetest music written for a movie, and once you see the movie, you'll be singing the theme as I have for the past 13 years.

Very entertaining. The relationship between wrath and beth seems to start up basically outta no where! Its like the first time she sees him she spreads her legs, and that typically would seem far fetched but since i read alot of vampire romance typically the vamps are attracted to the mate through pure animal intstincts. They smell a certain way or taste a certain way and thats what drives them to want the person or love them so desperately. Anyhow, i just loved Beth and Wrath together. I also loved the brotherhood... This is a good read :) Im definately gonna read the rest of the series. It has the steamy sex --the undieing love---the suspense and violence--- definately entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I just finished reading Dark Lover. I really enjoyed this book. I read some of the other reviews and I have to disagree with those who try to compare it to Twilight. It is completely different. Twilight was really written for teenage girls in junior high or high school. This book is defiantly more for the adult reader. Don't get me wrong I liked Twilight but I would even compare the to books. I am really excited to start the second book. I would recommend that the reader take the book for what it is and not try to compare it to other vampire novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"BDB Dark Lover Rocks","review":"As the first book in the series- JR Ward introduces all the characters but explains the story of Wrath- the blind King finding his true love, Beth. The book goes into how the BDB started - explaining the Lessers and the backgrounds of the vampires.I loved this book- and would love to take Wrath home with me.I would give this 5 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than others of the same genre..I am going to keep up with the series.","review":"I thought this book was awesome. It was a good spin on the romance/vampire genre. I liked her take on the vampire lore. I liked the idea of the \\"Transition\\". Great conflict between the characters. I definitely enjoyed it better than the Anita Blake series.The \\"lessers\\" were a bit of a let down. Impotent, babypowdersmelling, evil guys just isn't as menacing to me as I think she wanted them to be.The only other thing I had trouble with...and believe me it was just my problem...the hero was described in a way that made me think of Macho-Man Randy Savage (Of the old WWF and Snap into a Slim Jim commericials) I had to force myself to envision somebody else...anybody else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow..","review":"bad..just bad...I agree with the other one-star reviews so I'm not going to waste my time with writing the exact same thing"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Ok, I was bored one day and decided to try and find an author with a series that I have not read yet. I read all the reviews for this book and thought great. I run down to the store and buy it. MY God what a disappointment! I can't believe I paid for this thing. If I borrowed it from the Library I would be ok, but it like when you just paid to see a movie at the Cinema and come out of there thinking I wasted 10 bucks to see that. That is how I felt. I love action in my books, I love when things are going on, this book did not have it. It has a great story line and you keep reading thinking to yourself this is going to get better, it has got to. Nope, it doesn't. Again I would not pay for this book by any means but if you are an avid reader like myself it is worth going to the Library and picking up. ONLY if you are going to the library to pick other things up too. Please don't waste your time with a special trip to the Library for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really silly","review":"Sorry, but anyone who names a protagonist \\"Tohrment\\" needs a credibility transplant ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it in the burn pile","review":"I don't see what the draw is to this series. I felt the chacters whined through the whole book. The strong males turned out to be the weakest warriors I've come acrossed - and they're supposed to be feared by all. And what was with the evil baby powder smelling guys - Mr. M, Mr. X, Mr. O - Geez! Not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew!! I need a breeze...","review":"I came upon this series by accident, and I have been very suprised at how much I am enjoying it. The characters are unique and the story is believable. She doesn't shy from violence and strong language, thank God, and the romance parts are very nice. Ahem. I'm not a big romance reader, but even so I like them very much. A great read, especially if your looking for something completely different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Lover","review":"This book, while starting out confusing, instantly pulls me in. By the end of the first chapter, I was hooked. I could NOT put this book down, and I ended up finishing within the day.A group of vampires, the Black Dagger Brotherhood, are out to protect their race. One of the brotherhood, Darius, dies, and his last request for his brother Wrath is to help his daughter through her transition.Wrath doesn't want to do it, but that's before he gets pulled in by desire so powerful, he doesn't know what to do with his emotions anymore.This book was thrilling and spicy, and recommended for paranormal romance readers everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good start","review":"When I heard the buzz about this book from another online board, I was a bit skeptical at first. I gave it a try anyway and I'm glad that I did. I've read other vampire novels before and some of them didn't work for me. Fortunately this one did just fine for me. The story itself was good but I think it's the characters that made the book. Ms. Ward did a good job in characters building. My only complain is the names, oh God.. the names..!! What's up with that?? As deeply as I was engrossed throughout the book, I still cringed everytime I read the names. Nevertheless, I still look forward to reading more about Ms. Ward's band of brotherhood, especially Zsadist's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Kate: A voracious reader","review":"I read at least 3-4 novels a week and many of these are in the paranormal romance genre. I have to say that I am excited about this new series and am looking forward to the next installment from this author. These hot new bad boys sparked my interest as the author has drawn them so clearly and made them so endearing. This new alternate reality is fast paced and action packed. Ms. Ward has painted such a delightful new world and I a looking forward to a deeper understanding of these new characters.I found the vivid characterizations and the action scenes reminiscent of Laurel K. Hamilton, Kim Harrison and Sherrilyn Kenyon. Fans of these paranormal authors should really enjoy this new series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Time And $","review":"I don't understand how anyone could like this book. I am stuck with the box set and can't even give them away. It is filled with characters with rediculous names and it doesn't help that they have terrible personalities. I can't swoon over a group of dudes dressed in leather and long hair. All I could picture by their description where a band of Megadeath roadies. Actually, I think I just insulted the roadies...This book was about lust and nothing more. No real relationships, no chemistry. (Isn't that supposed to be important for a paranormal romance?) I wasn't the least bit impressed and hope that I might have saved at least one person the the unfortunate experience of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Close To Kenyon","review":"Well, after hearing everyone \\"glom\\" about this book and all the 5 star reviews, I had to give it a shot... What a mistake! This book was poorly done. Too much plot, not enough characterization, purple prose galore, and the descriptives such as \\"looked like he was smuggling paint rollers under his skin\\" to refer to six-pack abs.. YIKES! And if these men of the Brotherhood were to be taken seriously, putting them behind the wheel of an Escalade and listening to Rap music wasn't the way... that just made them look like Vampire Gangsta' Wannabe's.I gave the book away and if an acquiantenance of mine hadn't taken it, the book would have been the newest dog toy. The storyline was very cliche and in my opinion didn't measure up. Not even close to Sherrilyn Kenyon's level."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Seems I'm in the Minority....","review":"I always start my reviews off the same -- I don't write many reviews, but I felt the need with this book. I'm not really sure what the appeal of this book is to the general public. There is no real character development, the story just seems silly and the dialogue is painful. I am most upset by the dialogue - it is pedestrian and juvenile. The members of the Brotherhood are supposed to be hundreds of years old, seasoned and mature. You wouldn't know it by their vocabulary -- \\"hey baby\\", \\"right on brother\\". Give me Matthew Clairmont from A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness any day of the week.I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and that is what this is, just my opinion. It feels like Ms. Ward phoned this one in. But Dark Lover has earned a lot of good reviews, so as my title says, I am in the minority.That said, I will not be reading anything further by this author, as I could barely finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING! You will be ADDICTED!!!!!","review":"I recommend this book to everyone I talk to! I absolutely love it. My husband would get mad because I was constantly reading. I think I've read dark lover (and every other book in the series) at least 3 times! The brothers will make you laugh, cry, scream at your phone, make you fall in love with them and keep you begging for more XOXO They are also very sexually explicit, I've never read 50 shades of grey but I can guarantee It's 50 times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!","review":"I was browsing the web looking for something else when I came across the name black dagger brotherhood... read some reviews...and decided to give the first one a try!

Boy what a disappointment.The story is your basic big bad guy (who is the blind king vampire) meets girl (half human half vampire), girl afraid of big bad guy, girl and big bad guy have sex, sex and more sex, they fall in love and get married and of course someone kidnaps the girl.But the worse part of this book is the writing - it is simply awful and juvenile - they were so many cheeky cheesy lines by eyes were rolling in my head .. \\"his throat was raw, and it felt like he'd French kiss a blow torch\\", \\"let's hang\\" to list a couple. To top everything off the narrator Jim Frangione was not much better. Thankfully the 2 audio books did not cost me much because I will have to be desperate to listen to book 2flag"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"Yes. Another vampire series. It's written relatively well. Curious to know about Omega. A little formulaic but still a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the brothers","review":"I just can't get enough! Due to this series I have learned that paranormal romance is my guilty pleasure! Having read and reread the Twilight series and loving it, I always felt like something was missing (hello...sex) Well thank JR Ward, thank you for writing a series really building a whole world like Stephanie Meyer did but including the one detail that was missing for anyone over 18, steamy sex scenes. You rock, Ward!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I tired this book after reading some really good reviews on goodreads.

Usually when the writer switches action in the middle of a chapter, its a little irritating. This book is the exception, changing scenes and weaving the subplots together seamlessly. And if i missed something all I had to do was go back a page(easier than a soap opera,even with TiVo). I really recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So drawn in by the good reviews...but I couldn't even finish it.","review":"I do have to say that I am a lover of paranormal romance, so I'm always on the lookout for a good series. This one had such good reviews, it seemed like a no-brainer.The beginning began so rough, I felt like I almost had to take notes to understand what was going on. I kept thinking, \\"this is going to get better...this has got to get better, just keep reading.\\" In the end, the grammar and the informal language (and the stupid names) bothered me so much, that I just couldn't muscle through it anymore. The \\"Brotherhood Vampires\\" are supposed to be older vampires, hundreds of years old--but their vocabulary is so bad and imformal, you never get that impression. The sex scenes are weird, without much ramp up.Anyway, I'm really upset that I spend money and time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This book hooked me into the series and I couldn't get enough. I didn't know if I would really get into a vampire book but these bring you into a world that is filled with real world heartache and the love stories are easy to root for. JR Ward doesn't let her characters have their happy ending and never have any other issues. I appreciated the continuation through the other books. Great reads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read these books!","review":"All of these books are brilliantly written! You will completely lose yourself in this world and will fall in love with all the characters. Great mix of danger, love, sex, humor and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!!","review":"I loved this book. I can read it over and over again. I wish I had picked up the series sooner!! The characters are funny, witty, charming and most of all HOT :-) I can't wait until next year's book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"This book came under my radar while I was blog visiting and saw that it has numerous good reviews for it. It piqued my interest and hence I got my hands on this! I must admit it was an interesting vampire read. It's kind of sad that Beth never got to meet her father. She's lucky she has Wrath to protect her else she wouldn't have made it through everything. I like it that the author has included a list of glossary for the terms used in the book so I'm not confused when I read Dark Lover. In addition, when a book has so many characters, it can be difficult to read about each and everyone of them and be able to relate/connect to them. However, I don't have this problem with Dark Lover. Each characters is unique and I really enjoyed how the author put them all together. I'll definitely continue with the series! I want to find out even more about the other characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BDB Brothers that ROCK","review":"I have been a reader of sci-fi and paranormal for years, these characters are the most relatable and they make you wish they were real."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my first vampire experience","review":"Reluctance was my first emotion when several people suggested I read the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. I don't like blood, gore, or vampires. I was a little worried this book would be about the occult (it's not). So, I was surprisingly delighted and pleasantly entertained by this book. The story is well done and it sets up the background for the remainder of the series. The characters of Wrath and Beth are well developed. They have an immediate connection that is both sweet and lustful. Wrath is a very honorable vampire and you can tell he will be an excellent leader. This book is difficult to put down once you begin reading it, so allow yourself a week-end to enjoy it. I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Reading a Complete Idiot's Coolest Ever Idea!","review":"Jeez. I don't get the good reviews on this one. I'd like to see those reviewer's ideas of bad books! I am a voracious reader. I've NOT been able to finish maybe 3 books in my entire life. This is one of them. I gave up half way through. There is no finesse to the writing and there is zero dimension to the characters. It is so cheesy that I quit because I was afraid my husband was going to read a line or two over my shoulder and laugh at me. Ward even gives the make and model of the 'bad a**' car and tells what Rap (?) songs (including album and singer) the vampires are listening to. So so very bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"huge dissapointment and horrible writing","review":"this was seriously one of the worst books i have ever read. i thought this was going to be a really good book considering all the great reviews. what a dissapointment! it was like reading the script of a really bad soap opera. there was little or no character development. the dialogue between characters was almost embarrasing and so forced. this book had so many 5 star reviews that i must assume the writer had all her facebook friends give reviews. utter dissapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tohrment-ed Reader","review":"Man I was diappointed by this book. After all the glowing reviews, I thought for sure I'd found a winner. Wrong. It was entertaining at times, but a terrible let down as a whole. I was shocked by the continued use of abreviations (SOB, SOL, WTF?!) used throughout the book, as well as the gansta lifestyle for VAMPIRES! It was silly. Especially after recently finishing an AMAZING Young Adult vampire book (Twilight by Stephenie Meyer) that left me begging for more vampire/romance reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile, contrived soap-opera","review":"To echo the shockingly few accurate reviews of this book found here, from which I constructed the title above - this book is almost ludicrously bad. Over-the-top macho crap that pays lip service to \\"girl power\\" while essentially delivering a Cinderellaesque sophmoric schoolgirl fantasy with fangs. The characters are one-dimensional, and the frat-boy male bonding stereotypical and caricatured. Written without intelligence, depth, imagination or soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Thorment\\"...is what this book does to me","review":"I so hoped this book would somehow catch my attention...I keep picking it up trying, but it just doesn't. How is it possible? It has great reviews and I am not that picky. I enjoy romance with or without paranormal story lines and in spite of some of them dragging out a bit much, a whiny hero/heroine or even bad writing, I had no trouble getting into i.e. the Twilight Series, Fifty Shades or K.M. Moning's Fever series, all of which have worse reviews than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty pleasure","review":"Honestly, I didn't think I was going to like this book. After a string of unimpressive vampire romance novels, I was losing hope. This book was such a pleasant surprise. I'll admit that I laughed out loud at the descriptions of the brothers in chapter one. They are all such stereotypical alpha males that it's downright humorous. Likewise, the females are stereotypically perfect women. However, I couldn't put the book down and when I was close to the end, rather than order the sequels from Amazon and wait for shipping, I drove to Barnes and Nobel and bought them so I could get started on Lover Eternal right away. That was a clear indication (at least to me) of how much I enjoyed the book.I really liked the different personalities of the brothers and while this novel played up (exaggerated) male and female gender roles, I found myself nonetheless getting sucked in and having a great time reading it. It's steamy, romantic and full of action. Definitely a fun and consuming read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was very sad after reading 1/2 of this book (i could not even finish it). Based on the almost 5 star rating i was excited to start reading it....but was quickly let down. The book is was what I would like to call \\"the hot mess express\\". I was all over the place, involving you in one scene and then quickly changing into another that had no relevance to the one before. By the time I was able to figure out what the scene was about the reading once again changed in the same pattern as before. The transition/flow of the book was awful. The scenes in the book were also a let down and not well thought out. I am truly saddened by the fact that i wasted ~7 dollars and hours of my time and i would like a credit please..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starcrossed Reviews","review":"A previous coworker of mine accidentally happened upon the Black Dagger Brotherhood series and became obsessed with it. She gave me the books and told me that I must read them.I started Dark Lover expecting to fall into it instantly. That was no the case, however. At first I didn't really like it. I literally had to push myself through it. After a few chapters though, I got sucked into the story and didn't want to put it down. I finished the book in a day and a half, reading through commercials while my favorite tv shows were on and basically confining myself to the couch.The only thing I really didn't like was the numbed or POV's (point of views) the story had. how many times it switched back and forth. It was important to the storyline though so I suffered through it and I really can't wait to see where the story goes from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Lover","review":"Wonderful book that is so well written, you will CERTAINLY want to read all the other books! I didn' t want to put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight for adults...and not in a good way","review":"I bought the book because a co-worker suggested it, she said it was full of hot, steamy, sexy vampires. I've been an avid fan of vampire stories my entire life, so I've read quite a few of them. This book made me think it could be \\"Twilight\\" for adults (...and my opinion of Twilight is that it sucks)...all the craptastic dialogue, descriptions, and....the female smelled good and that's what made the \\"hot\\" male vampire fall in love with her. Lame. It's got the obligatory cop character, who is by far more interesting than any of the vampires that sound like idiot thugs. I just couldn't put my finger on why I wasn't getting into the story, it's because it reminded me of Twilight, except with sex...and not even hot sex, it was boring. Just plain boring. The dialogue is the worse I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could barely finish it, let alone read any sequel!","review":"This book was recommended by a friend who has a similar taste in books. At first, I thought I must be reading the wrong book. It is not well written, the characters are shallow, the romance is cheesy and doesn't make any sense. The male lead's personality is all over the place. I found myself skipping sections just to get it over with. In no way was I drawn in to read any of the sequels. Honestly, I've read better fan fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for a quiet afternoon","review":"A walk on the wild side contained within the covers of this book .... I found it a literary treat for one of those quiet afternoons I have from time to time. I get to escape to an alternate world that co-exists with the everyday one I live in.The Brothers, especially Wrath the incredible blind king of their species, are a fascinatingly erotic group of individuals that appeal to the fantasies most of us privately (and some us not so privately)harbor within us. Beautifully crafted detail by the author paints a world so easily indulged in.A must read for those of us who enjoy a wonderfully earthy paranormal romance novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"This book was great, I read it in one sitting and immediately purchased the sequel.

While this is true, I do not like to read books that focus on every possible way to have an event/conversation lead to sex. And I especially don't need a blow by blow description of what's going on in the heat of the moment.Yes, I like finding ones \\"soulmate\\", but I have read books that focus on the building the relationship, or even first look love, but don't have them constantly exploring what will make their own personal kama sutra.Obviously, I am not the majority, based on reviews already given....but this is not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I started reading this book expecting it to be amazing, according to the reviews, it was supposed to be. I started to read it and just couldn't get into it. The way the men talk completely threw me off. It doesn't sound like what people talk like- it sounds like what uncool people wish they could sound like if they were cool. I just couldn't get past it. I don't understand it though- so many good reviews! I have a serious question for other readers. If I could have gotten past the speech would it have been pretty good? Does it get better after the first few chapters? To be honest after the first little portion of the book I just deleted it off my Kindle(which I never delete books off my Kindle, it was that bad!!). Seriously it was terrible for me. Maybe I should have given it another chance(maybe read more), but once again, it sounded so.. just ugh. Oh well, wish I could have liked it the way others did- I love a good series! Unfortunately, this wasn't it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, I wonder if I read the same book","review":"I was so excited to read this book, thinking I had found a new series to follow. I have to wonder about all the positive reviews here, are they real? For starters, the leading man, is described as large man with tree trunk thighs, yuck, wearing leather pants. I could'nt stop picturing Gene Simmons. Not my idea of a sexy guy. And the names for the guys in the brotherhood. Sooo stupid. Save your money, this book is silly and not romantic in any form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story, different author","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Hot Vampires, a secret underworld, what's not to like about that? But, I found myself annoyed with the heroine, she jumps into bed with the vamp faster than you can say, \\"Brad Pitt is the hottest.\\"So typical. Now onto the Brotherhood, they spend all their time being moody, mysterious and seething with lust and rage, hello? But they have vowed to protect humanity (especially sexy chicks). That is a little too much disinterested benevolence for me. I couldn't finish the book and gave it to a friend who loved it, so it must be a personal preference.I was hoping for an adult version of Twilight or something along the lines of kresley cole. I will keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! My friends steered me wrong","review":"My friends have ranted and raved about this book, and the series and maybe that is where I think the problem lies. Always when someone recommends a book or product I get jazzed up thinking that unicorns, rainbows and a leprechaun is going to magically show up and my life will be filled with riches and total happiness. Sometimes that does happen but unfortunately not this time. I thought there would be more fighting action but it turned out more like an adult \\"Twilight\\" which was another disappointing book. I read two of those books and realized that the kids magazine \\"Highlights\\" was much more entertaining. Anyway, if you like A LOT of romance, very few fight scenes, and a lot of sex that makes the Harlequin Romance novels blush than this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Lover:A Novel of the Black Dagger Brotherhood","review":"I enjoyed this book and the entire series.

So I just started the next book, and I just ordered the rest of the books in this series. I love reading a series, because you get to keep up with all the other characters you love. Oh, and this book...Wrath is just a sex god, I love the possessiveness that he shows, I really think that is part of the vampire romance, ready to kill for their women. But the main woman, Beth, she is a strong willed woman also. I recommend this book, it provides suspense, animal lust, and a hellava story line.

I agree with some of the negatives posted by previous reviewers, but the positives outweigh and surpass them (in my opinion). The plot was intriguing and fast-paced, and the tension between the hero and heroine was sustained. I didn't want to put it down (the laundry had to wait for this one!). The sizzle was higher than I was used to in other books, but not over the top (I enjoyed the burn <smile>).

Getting past the slang was my only issue, however it makes since that the characters would speak in this manner. The story line is wonderful and the characters are unforgetable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Sexy Set Up","review":"Dark Lover keeps readers turning pages well into the night with its steamy love scenes. Ward does an excellent job writing romance scenes without being too cheesy, however one fault I found with her writing was relying on cliches to establish character identity. Specifically, the dialect of the brotherhood too often reminded me of texting tweens and overly macho, high-school football players. With the star female role of Beth, Ward often used supporting characters to tell the audience had magnificent she is, rather than creating a space for Beth to prove her worth to the audience.JR Ward managed to take her first book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series and introduce an abundant amount of characters, each with their own history. Her character establishment was her biggest achievement in Book 1 and ensures that Book 2 will be read equally fast due to the readers end interest in many of the minor characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it until Book 3!","review":"This series is absolutely amazing! But as I tell everyone I recommend the series to... at least read through book 3. Book 1 and 2 and good, but book 3 goes to a whole new level and that is where the addiction begins. So far all my friends have said that they are glad I told them that or they wouldn't have continued. Now they are addicted too!Ward does a brilliant job of setting up a new vampiric world different from the other series out there. She does a great job of keeping the series fresh by having multiple plot lines in each book (along with the plot line that threads the series together and the main plot of each individual book) that may carry over through several books before conclusion. The different points of view in each book is refreshing. Ward isn't afraid to veer off the traditional PNR road either with a two male love interest sub-story line and some very dark sexual undertones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Lover","review":"Most wonderful read. I bought this book on a dare and almost couldn't put it down. My husband, who had a stroke two years ago, asked me to read it to him. It was the first time he has held interest in those two years.

I am not a huge fan of romance novels because..(A). They generally have a story line that a 12 year old could have created with rauncy sex scenes of an over sexed teenager. But this book blew my mind away. Yes the sex is great, but the story line is awesome! At first this book had me worried because the sex started off so early, but I decided to give it a chance and I was not disappointed! I purchased the first book in fear that it would just be some rauncy book, but after enjoying the book so much I went out and brought the box set. I may have an extra copy of Dark Lover books, but I figure its a gift that keeps on giving. Who wants it? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Based on all of the positive reviews for this book, I really expected to love it. I was amazed to find out that the hero and heroine only took up about 1/4 of the pages. It's completely annoying. It seemed kinda jumpy and random to me. BTW, how many povs are really necessary? Come on! I have no desire to read about how the villain feels or what he's thinking. I'm extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!","review":"Man, what a letdown! Even though the story is mildly entertaining, the characters are absolutely disappointing. What the heck is up with the names - Rhage, Wrath, etc. - zero points for originality! And to make a physically imposing vampire nearly blind is absolutely ludicrous. There are far better books in vampire fiction today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More cheese than fettucini alfredo.","review":"Yikes. Towards the end of the book I actually laughed out loud a couple of times. If you skip whole chapters, it improves the overall reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ive ever read","review":"I bought the kindle edition of this book. I have half the mind to buy a paperback copy of this book and mark up almost every page of this book with editors notes and send it back to the publishers and say \\"Hey, I think you missed something!\\" It's not that this book is filled with bad grammar, it's bad content. There's unrealistic dialogue, information vomit all over and Ward doesn't even try to blend it into the story, there's bad word choices everywhere, Wards writer voice comes through the characters constantly, meaning, she makes characters describe things the way a writer would, not an actual person in that situation. It's horrible, I can't stand it. What a waste of money. I recommend borrowing from the library if you insist on reading this and if you have any background in writing or want to write, she will only piss you off with her lack of skill or teach you how to write poorly. I can't even figure out how her book got published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackdagger series","review":"If you can get past the hellen, doggen, shellan and all the other people types in the book, this is a gripping and very good story! All those types were unnecessary given the base story is excellent! I've just finished the first book and 3 to go...I look forward to the continuing saga..really good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are hot - my introduction to the Brotherhood","review":"I was reluctant to try this book/series when I saw the mention of 'vampires' not something I would normally read. Thankfully I took a punt and was far from disappointed. I found this to be a riveting read that kept me engaged from beginning to end. The character building was wonderfully done and I couldn't stop thinking about the brothers long after finishing the book. These guys are hot and the sexual content is rather explicide but tastefully done. Thankfully there are many more books in the series as I am now officially a BDB addict."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I love paranormal books. I read at least 5 books a week. Because I read so much I am always looking for new authors. I thought it was a great idea to use customer reviews to find new books. This book was almost a 5 star with a lot of reviews, but I was soooo wrong with this book. It should be filed under waste of time. It was written in such a terrible way. No character development, you were thrown into their lives with out even a partial back round. I also realize that every author will tweak vampires in their own way, but come on, they literally were like muscled humans, with no immortal power. Almost dying from a gun shot wound? I really feel dumber, having read this book. If you guys want an excellent author, I suggest Kresley Cole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please....","review":"I've tried several times to read these books because it is a genre I usually enjoy but the writing is sophomoric, the characters card-board cut outs and if that isn't enough to turn one off, the character names are absolutely laughable! Based on other reviews and even some recommendations from friends, I hoped I was missing something. This is the last time I'll try. J.R. Ward is no Charlaine Harris, no L. J. Smith and certainly no Ann Rice. Don't waste your money or your time! I would have given it negative stars if that had been an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Really, really bad. As others have said before me, the book was basically a complete failure in all aspects of writing. The plot was almost nonexistent. The \\"romance\\" of the book was based upon an extremely unlikely love-at-first-sight experience followed by smut. The characters were cheesy stereotypes, right down to their names (Wrath, Torhment, Zsadist...) The scenes that could have actually been interesting were breezed over. The writing itself was very poor as well. Author gave convenient happy endings for all good guys. It was awful. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"my newest book addiction","review":"if you are in to true blood or an adult twilight reader, you must give this series a go! i am thoroughly hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Lover","review":"I have read the whole series.

The perfect balance of adventure, romance and steamy action!Wrath is a great character, super hot tortured vamp!! Oh and I can not wait for the rest of the Brotherhood to meet their matches!!Beth is no simpering female she is a heroine worthy of a hunk like Wrath! I loved the whole dynamic.The book is written from several different narratives. It gives a fuller picture of the whole story. It also sets up at least one future romance very nicely!A truly engaging story with strong characters. Very well written and a pleasure to read. The perfect touches of humor to lighten the mood!Cover Art - Nice but not nearly as engaging as the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its love","review":"im going to start by saying i have read the hole collcetion so far and its the best i have ever read everything about it is amazing and the charactors are so well writen i think everyone who loves to read should read this and fall in love coz it is homestly the best and so so great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"These books are a lot of fun. I'm on Book 3 after starting the first one probably only a week ago - they're fairly long too, I think I'm just a little addicted. (I have a number of books on my reading list and I think they're all going to have to wait until I plow through this series!) These books aren't fine literature and do not try to be - they're just perfect being what they are. The characters are likable and as real as they can be given the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"This is the first paranormal romance I've read in *years* that doesn't suffer from poor writing, weak plotting or a lack of editing. Yes, the story is one that we've seen many twists on before (tortured hero falls in love with heroine despite both of their best intentions) but I have to say, this is GOOD and God knows I'm picky.I had minor nitpicks with the plot, but I liked the characters, dialogue and overall style and quality so much that it didn't really matter. I went through this in one sitting and can hardly wait until March for the next installment. The top authors in this genre (Christine Feehan, Sherilyn Kenyon etc) need to start punching up their work - J.R. Ward's work is definitely a contender for the top of the besteller lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steamy vampire novel... A MUST READ!","review":"I just finished reading this book in only four sitting. I could hardly put it down... It's that good! If you enjoy reading steamy, erotic vampire novels with a great storyline, then this book is a MUST READ! As you read, it fills you with every imaginable emotion. A strong bond between the brothers gives you a sense of family and commitment and their protection of anyone they accept into that family is more than powerful. The action makes your heart beat faster and your mind race with excitement and the erotic scenes...um ... let's just say, makes you tingle in all the right places, lol. Bravo, Mrs. Ward! I can't wait to catch up on the rest of the series.Pick up a copy today and enjoy.Sincerely,Michelle LundyErotic Horror AuthorChristmas Coffin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain terrible","review":"I expected to love this book based on the large number of positive reviews it has received. After going through the torture of reading it, I can't believe it received so many because this book is just plain terrible. The plot is terrible and so is the writing. There isn't any real romance. This book is a porn novel. I like reading books that involve characters getting intimate, but not books where that is the only plot (if that can even be called a plot). One dumb line in the book is when the main male character tells the main female character that \\"she tastes like peaches\\". I usually give a series a second chance by reading the second book (then stop if that one is bad, too), but I will not torture myself again. I also will not read anything else written by this author. She is on my permanent DO NOT READ list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Vampire Romance and Action","review":"I loved this one! If you are a fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunters or Christine Feehan's Carpathians, you will like The Black Dagger Brotherhood. This first book is Wrath's story and will apparently be followed by the stories of the other five (very sexy, very hip) vamps of The Brotherhood. It's got action, adventure, humor and a very hot love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I actually read Lover Eternal (the second in the series first) and wasn't sure if I should bother reading this one, since I already knew how everything would turn out. I'm glad I changed my mind. This series has got to be the best I have read in a very long time. The action, romance, adventure, and complexity is wonderful. Ward creates a well-rounded and interesting set of characters that are unique to each other and will draw the reader into the story as though they are experiencing it first hand. I'm already planning a trip to the bookstore in the morning to buy the third in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!","review":"This is the first in her series of six and I have read all of them - the author's writing is so intense and detailed you feel as if you are truly a part of the character's lives. And the author gets better with each character she writes about. I strongly encourage everyone to give this book and chance and continue with the others in the series. You will agree with me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put The Book Down..Great Novel","review":"I thought I would not find another series like Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunters but I was so wrong! I fell in love with Wraith. Strong lead character with a sensitive side that all women would love to have in a man! Good action, great romance, could not put it down and now looking forward to the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked on The Black Dagger Brotherhood","review":"I picked up the 3rd book, Lover Awakened, at the grocery store while just looking for \\"anything\\" to read. I couldn't put this book down. Even though it was third in the series, it was so phenomenal I got the other two, read them in order, and them came back and read the third.

The characters names are hysterical and the plot is cliched and predictable; brooding rapist and serial killer meets beautiful girl and falls in love. It got chucked in the bin after two chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - Great Start to an Amazing Series","review":"JR Ward doesn't mess around in getting you interested right off the bat in this first book of the series. Wrath, the King of Vampires, is an instant attraction through the development of his character in exciting fight scenes and background while Beth his love interest is given a softer touch that any woman can relate to. Great introduction to the other characters involved in the \\"Black Dagger Brotherhood\\". You get little teasers along the way to let you know that JR Ward still has a long way to go in this series and you'll love every minute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I'M READING THIS BOOK, I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT ALL OVER AGAIN. I WILL RECOMMEND THIS SERIES TO ALL MY FRIENDS. AWESOME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Corny","review":"While searching for a vampire series that would grip me like the Sookie Stackhouse series or Twilight I stubbled across 'Dark Lover'. This book received so many 4-5 star reviews I was sure I couldn't go wrong. I loved the idea of a vampire king forced to help a girl during the change from human to vampire and then (of course) falling in love. Problem is that this book is so poorly written. It is so cheesy and corny at times I found myself rolling my eyes in discust. Especially so when the male vampires are talking to each other! So cheesy it's painful to read!Another problem is the author made the vampires too easy to kill. One of the things I love about vampires is that they can live forever. Not these vampires! These vampires can die from gun shot wounds to the stomach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly unoriginal","review":"I really found this unoriginal the characters seemed very one-dimensional -the villain ,the wounded hero healed by the \\"love of a good woman\\", it all seemed so cliched. The whole plot seemed like a rip off of L.Hamilton amd Sherrilynn Kenyon's stuff"},{"rating":"1","title":"wonderful cover, too bad the story sucked","review":"If I could I would give a negative 5 stars for this book. It was very contrived and stiff. The premise was not well thought out and I thought the villans were wimpy. I also did not like the way the author borrowed plotlines and paraphrased names from successful paranormal author such as Christine Feehan and Sherrilyn Kenyon. This book was a very poor first attempt at a paranormal romance and needs a serious rewrite or better yet burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Lover","review":"When I received this book It was missing 20 pages... book started on page 21! I done ordering books from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received item","review":"I was very disappointed with the company I ordered this book from. I ordered it Feb.3 and had to hound the company before they notified me they no longer had a copy of the book to send me. Then I had to hound them again to get my money back, which I just got back on the 5th of March. I think they really still owe me the book as well as my money. They could have at least been professional enough to tell me the book was out of stock and volunterily send my money back. No star at all from me.I really wanted to read that book I have read all but that one of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least Favorite of the Bunch","review":"I started with book 3 and I'm glad I did because I have to say that this book is my least favorite of them all. Wrath and Beth are my least favorite couple as well. I like Beth's character, its Wrath character I can't stand so much. If I had read this book first I probably would have not read any further into the series. This book was really weird for, it came off choppy. I think it sets up the books that follow it very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different kind of hero","review":"I started the series after finishing Sherrilyn Kenyon and being at a loss for more paranormal romance. I actually liked the book. I did particularly like the hero, who was more human with his flaws and not the oh so powerful untouchable master of the universe. So what he is handicapped...I also like JR Wards writing style that does include a lot of chivalry from the main characters who are otherwise quite savage.I wasn't crazy about Beth - perfect model figure while eating Twinkies and Chinese take out?I couldn't get into the whole Mr. X story and I found it more cruel than the Dark Hunter books - I may have skipped a couple of pages there and didn't find it made it difficult to follow the story nevertheless. But the attraction between the main characters was well developed, the bed scenes were tasty and I think a worthy start to the series. I am looking forward to the other books - especially for Rhage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Lover","review":"This book is so good!

I ran out of books to read so i finally picked this one up and i couldnt put it down. ward does wonders with your imagination!

Very disappointed. The story idea would have been excellent but the writing is disappointing. Gimmicky, cheesy, trying-too-hard to develope \\"cool\\" characters...I had to stop reading after 30% of the book. Really bummed because I was hoping this would be a great series to read. Not sure how this book gets such high ratings...must be the story line - definitely not the writing.

The oddity of a major character dying right at the beginning and the lead being three-quarters blind made for an interesting twist on the typical romance story. The sexual tension between the two main characters was titillating and satisfied quite quickly. I look forward to reading other stories in the series and would like to follow up the story of the ex-police officer.By the way, if anyone can tell me how I can re-read the book on my 'kindle touch' I would be grateful. When I try to go back I just get the last page of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new series!!","review":"I won't go into detail about this book, since so many other have already, but would like to say that it was an EXCELLENT book and am looking forward to the next one in the series, \\"Eternal Lover\\" coming out in March 2006. There is romance in it, but also so much more. JR Ward has created a wonderful new world for vampires!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.....","review":"I really cannot believe this book got one single positive review. I will freely admit that I am \\"picky\\" about books. My number one requirement is that a book be written in a way that grabs me, keeps me interested, the words themselves blend into the background of the story.....this book reads like a badly contrived attempt to write. The way the main characters names were spelled was (dare I say?) contrived and juvenile. Character development seemed (sorry, people) contrived. This is not the first book I've deleted from my Kindle, but it is one of the very few that I simply could not force myself to finish. This series was recommended as a \\"stop gap\\" for readers who were waiting for another volume in their favorite vampires series, and all I can say is \\"uh, NO.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Very bad writing,cliched romance book,grown men talk like teenage girls(\\"I outie\\")If you're in the mood for a trashy romance book then this is the perfect read but if you are a sci/fi fantasy book reader skip this sophomoric nauseating drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved every minute of it","review":"This book reads easily, fast and will make you crave for more.

At first I could (kind of) get past the names, but I wanted to laugh every time I read them. I couldn't handle the dudespeak or forced camaraderie either.

I barely finished this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average novel, unrealistic romance.","review":"I'm quite surprised this book has gotten so many 5-star reviews.I thought the story flowed well, the read was fast and easy, so perfect romance novel material in that sense.But god dang the romance part of it was INCREDIBLY unrealistic. I don't know about you, but I'm quite tired of romance novels where every single creature with two legs is a) incredibly flawlessly attractive and b) experiences lust beyond measure at first sight.Vampires aren't real, I get that. But what I don't get is how such an unrealistic progression of feelings can appeal to such a wide audience.I guess I can sort of understand why this book appeals to so many people, but I really wish readers would set higher standards for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"Dark Lover was a good book. it was a little slow for me, but it picked up as you continued to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get past the first five pages...","review":"and keep going. If you like Anita Blake (see Laurell K. Hamilton) and you want your vampires a little more modern than Christine Feehan's dreaminess, this book is for you. I found the conversation catching and the suspense enough to keep me reading. A word of warning, the sex is pretty rampant and the descriptions are well...vivid to say the least. While I was not offended, body parts are not described as 'aching members' in this novel. I am not an avid reader of vamp books but I fully intend to get the next one in the series. (and Note To Author: If you can get a romance together for 'Z' we'll be waiting breathlessly) That said, I think anyone who like a good suspense novel will like this. It's a page turner and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read!","review":"I really liked this book.

I took a chance and ordered this book upon the recommendation of some friends. It might be a slow starter, but by the third chapter I was devouring the plotlines, the romance, and the characters. Ward is a master at crafting a paranormal romance, and though this book might not have the speed of the novels that follow it she does a great job of setting up the books that are coming. Wrath and Beth weren't as steamy as most probably think that they should be, but their love story was more down to earth than most of the other romance that I read. If you love vampires then you'll love, love, LOVE JR Ward!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eager for next installment!","review":"I hated for this book to end. Loved all of the guys (and their gals) in the brotherhood. There is something about their loyalty, fierceness, sense of humor and tenderness that makes me want to meet them all. The story was well written with just enough info given about each side character to make me want to know more. Sincerely hope there is a story for each one. Fans of Kenyon and Feehan will love this series. Wish I could give it 6 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This Book","review":"Needing a new book to read, I picked this one up in the grocery store last week. Thought I'd take a chance on another vampire romance. I loved this book. It is well written and I can see how the author is setting up events for the sequels. I get so tired of some of the vampire romance books out there, with the main characters being ridiculously jealous or perfect, or whatever. I found the book to be \\"believable\\" (as far as vampire romance books go), and this made it an enjoyable read. I am actually re-reading it to catch anything I missed the first time, and am enjoying it more the second time. Looking forward to the next book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"I loved this book! I had high hopes because this series came highly recommended and so far it is delivering. I was a bit leery at first because it takes time to get into, but once you get the gist of the story, it is wonderful.I love Beth. She is an amazing heroine. She is badass and beautiful. It is refreshing to see a woman represented in that way instead of being man crazy. I love all of the Brothers. They are all amazing and I can't wait to read their stories. Wrath is wonderful. He is hardcore and sexy.It is so wonderful to see the love develop between him and Beth. I think that this story shows the typical male feelings towards commitment and how the right woman can change a man. I didn't really care for the lesser storyline. It was slow and I thought it could have been done so much better.Overall, I think that this book is great. I am so excited to start the next one in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I recently purchased the box set for this series and wish I had done more reviewing before buying the entire set!

I love Keri Arthur and Laurell Hamilton. This book didn't do it for me. All the weird made up words just didnt make sense. The book opens up with a glossery and then just starts.

I really wanted to like it but just don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!","review":"I cant say enough about how much i enjoyed this book so i'm simply going to say this book is a fabulous MUST READ!!!!!! I started reading her books in the wrong order because i was jus giving it a try but after having read Rhage's story, Lover Eternal, i fell in love with her books and quickly got all of them. Dark Lover is the first book in the series and was as fabulous as all the rest. Although Lover Awakened is still my favorite in the series, this book more than lived up to the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something difference in Romance","review":"I'll give you that its not your classic romance novel, and that's what I liked about it. It also was clearly written by someone who's living in the now, not many romance books make reference to music by 50 Cent. Its a book for modern women who like a little edge with their romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tied for My #1 Favorite Read of 2007 with Lover Eternal ...","review":"#2 in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series! I read 250 books a year.Easily one of the most thrilling, sexy, action-packed reads in my reading history. Dark Lover rocked my world! Five stars - the maximum -- isn't nearly enough for Dark Lover. I'm giving it 20 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrath and Beth","review":"I purchased this book based on Amazon recommendations. I am going to admit the first time I pick this book up I only read the first 2 chapters. The book just did not grab my immediate attention - so I went on to the other series I had purchased. I finished that series and I picked the book up again and read on. However, once I got in the story and was introduced to the brotherhood - I was hooked. The books are not based solely on sex, but the sex scenes are explicit. I am currently reading the most recent book in the series, Lover Avenged. This is still one of my favorites to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLANT AMAZING EROTIC THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE ABOUT VAMPIRES!!!","review":"I was so impressed by this writter I could have given this book 10 STARS!! Thank You J R ward for giving us a book about VAMPIRES AT THEIR PUREST LEVEL. WRATH THE WARRIOR KING IS BRUTAL, DANGEROUS, THRILLING, ROMANTIC EROTIC KILLING MACHINE. THIS IS HOW VAMPIRES SHOULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT. NO FRILLS HERE JUST THE REAL DEAL!!!! BETH THE HALF HUMAN HALF VAMPIRE MATE IS HIS EQUAL IN EVERYWAY, SHE TOTALLY CAN KEEP UP WITH HIM, A GREAT EROTIC LOVE STORY FULL OF DANGER. This book is very well written. The characters are very well developed. One of the reasons I like about the way J R Ward writes is she is not repetitive and she does not make you wait to get to the REAL NITTY GRITTY. READERS BEWARE THIS IS A PAGE TURNER , SO MAKE TIME FOR IT!!! BRAVO MS WARD THANKS FOR BRINGING REAL VAMPIRES BACK THEY WAY THEY SHOULD BE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old and Tired","review":"This book was mediocre at best. It is like many books out there that promise a surprise and does not deliver. The real let down in this series is that the main character keeps shifting, and follows the same familiar plot-line over and over. A vampire (or werewolf or other) falling for a human while all the other fellow warriors eventually fall for those they should not fall in love with (further down the series). Each hard-hearted man is somehow overcome with lust, jealousy, and love to finally allow a woman into their lives. It is a tired story line and there is nothing new here. The men are hot but without depth. The women also are only a hot female body. It is boring and this book was a let down. Skip the book so you are not disappointed like I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't finish this book!","review":"I'm not a romance literature fan. I used to be, but after over 4yrs of not having read a romance novel, I decided to give this a go. It's too cheesy to finish: the dated references, the continuous leather pants wardrobe, the even cheesier names (Rhage, Phury, Thorment, Wrath). Lol. The initial encounter when she flings herself at the man could've passed for a drug induced haze, had she not sobered-up and still been willing. Now, a woman who was almost raped 24hrs ago, is cool getting down with a stranger she thought was going to kill her two seconds ago! A man who is in her locked apartment. She's cool with it. I'm sorry, is lust this strong after attempted rape? Do recent victims give an intruder a free pass to break-and-enter them, since the intruder proved so efficient at breaking-and-entering their homes? At this point, I'm done. It's all I can do to not laugh myself into respiratory distress."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING SERIES!","review":"If you're a fan of fantasy romance, and bad boys in particular, this series is a Must Read. I picked this for my book club when it was my turn to choose our book and everyone was giggling about our \\"Dark Lover\\" for weeks. The husbands enjoyed it also, because not only is it well written and engaging, but the sex scenes are hot & they made everyone feel a little frisky, if you catch my drift. My only complaint about this book was that, when I first picked it up, the language when the vampires spoke to each other seemed a bit too, I don't know, gangbangery? But I quickly overcame that as I got into the story & now it seems a natural choice for the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"So glad someone posted a quote from this series on a FB page. I totally enjoyed the characters and writing....now I've got a Lot of catching up to do reading the rest of the series! Looking forward to learning more about these vamps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and Dark","review":"Dark Lover was the first of the series that I read.

They're just kids singing old church songs that I grew up singing but rarely hear in contemporary services anymore. I was really looking for more of a black gospel sound. I have to skip over many of them because it irritates me to listen to them. I may just pair down the few songs I can tolerate and end up making a \\"best of\\" mix CD to get my money's worth our of this collection since my 2 year old does like to listen to it in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"and Dylan is technically a poor singer... so?","review":"...I don't get the feeling it was SUPPOSED to be a tight band. Saying this album is poorly produced IMHO is like saying Bob Dylan can't sing. By some standards both may be valid opinions, but if you understand that it doesn't matter that (in conventional terms) Dylan is a poor singer, then you might relate to the laid back \\"live jam\\" feel of this album. Not every track is memorable, but enough of them (by the way, I also heard \\"Jenny\\" and \\"Laughed at Him\\" in rotation on progressive FM radio of the early 70s) are to make it worth it. Hey, at least this is a CD nowadays, so if you don't like some of the tracks, you can probably program your CD player to skip them. For those who never heard them, I might describe the sound as in the realm of Mark/Almond but looser, except \\"Sweet Francesca\\" which sounds awfully like a Rolling Stones jam outtake. Nice melodies on the stronger tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Falling Star","review":"You don't have to live in Nashville to enjoy this book. I absolutely loved this book! The part where the plane landed and the storm took place had my heart racing. This was a wonderful written book. Retta and Denison were meant to be together. I fell in love with the characters the moment I started turning the pages. Again another book that Ms Brown has written that will stir the strings in your heart. Ms Brown is an excellent writer. Ten stars plus and two thumbs up on this book. Read it.

Haven't they ever heard of ROCK?This was just a terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disapointment.","review":"If I could give this book zero or negative stars I would. Shanji is a perfect example of a good idea that is horribly mangled resulting in a bad book. While the characters have mildly intesting cultural and psychic charateristics, they are neither explaned or even use to thier capsity. The end \\"battle\\" is a sad staged anti-climax and the book ends with more problems than it started with! While this may be a try for a sequel, the reader simply does not care enough about the characters to plunk down another $4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical study of history","review":"Richard Evans' book analyzes history as a discipline and tackles subjects as objectivity, causation, history vs science, sources and discourses. I was assigned this book for a graduate course on historiography. Evans presents his thesis and supports his arguments well. In Defense of History is a good companion to David Fischer's Historians' Fallacies, Davidson and Lytle's After the Fact and Mark Gilderhus' History and Historians."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Write History.....","review":"Richard Evans attacks a controversial topic on the world of history today -- how to write history. There are many schools of theory in the historical profession which can affect the way historians view historical sources. Evans particulary narrows his viewpoint to those historians known as \\"post-modernists.\\" He does this beccause post-modernists are perhaps some of the most controversial historians, not to mention the very theory itself, in the profession today. He also ponders what place post-modernists do have in the historical profession.Evans explores how some historians have gotten into trouble with how liberally they took their sources -- concentrating on one scholarly work about the Holocaust.This book is sure to continue the debate that continues to this day. It is thought provoking and will lead to more debate, to be sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"New ways to think about coincidences","review":"After reading another book that was essentially a collection of coincidences and being inspired to start a coincidence journal of my own, I picked up Bell's book to try to figure out what it all means.This is in many ways a scholarly book. Bell defines different types of coincidences and weaves in elements of Jung's theories, quantum mechanics and eastern religious thought to provide a framework for how to interpret these events. He gives interesting examples of coincidences and, unlike other books on coincidence I've read, \\"translates\\" them--looking beyond the \\"oh, isn't that interesting\\" to get to the possible message and meaning.His theory that coincidences are similar to dreams and can be interpreted as such changed my whole perception of coincidences. That alone was worth the price of the book.Overall, a very interesting and illuminating book that may change the way you look at the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"Ross presents his Just Right universe as an amazing coincidence, but relationships among his listed parameters are not considered. His probability description of their existence together as infinitesimally small doesn't allow for increased chance of occurrence from cause and effect. For example, a \\"just right\\" level of tectonic plate activity contributes to and increases the odds of a \\"just right\\" level of soil mineralization. Physical world aspects are not separate. Probability calculation is tricky. Ross' idea misleads, but his book is thought provoking and provides some useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"A god or the god?","review":"I browsed through several chapters of the book, it bascially states by probability argument that the chance we exist today by random variation is really slim without an intelligent designer. However, the author in his first chapters set out to prove that the designer is not just a god, but the god of the Bible, and the god of the Christian faith, and the Bible is as flawless as any physical laws we know now. In the later chapters, he fails to address the accuracy of the Bible by providing concrete experiemtal evidence or refute most of the inacurrate claims in the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ross again misleads and misrepresents science.","review":"If one could be sued for slandering science and logic Ross would be a primetarget. It is a toss-up, or throw-up, which fraud is worse, that of Ross or thatof Gish and Morris. Lederman, Einstein, Fermi, Hawking, Dennett, and Darwin must belaughing or crying over this misrepresentation and lame attempt at self-justificationand zealous misuse of paper and print. I suggest that Ross do some realreseach (his degree suggests he knows how). He may learn a little from some secondarysources about the issue by reading Dennett's \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" or any of Dawkinsbooks on the subject. He should also take a few basic logic courses, he seems to havemissed or failed those subjects in his educational pursuits."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This is a very powerful book, I highly recommend it to everyone especially atheist or people who have very little faith in their God. This book is not only informative but also very interesting and readers will surely enjoy this book. Anyone can read this book even layperson because the author has made it sure that everyone can understand what is written in this book. I suggest you buy this book, you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as it Gets","review":"As far as science-based Christian apologetics go, this is as good as it gets. This is the sort of book that Galileo or Copernicus could have easily written a forward for. In fact faculty from Texas A&M;, University of Chicago, and Caltech have done just that. Now I am still naive when it comes to exegetical discussions but not so much when it comes to scientific ones. So let me just say that if Ross's exegesis is as good as his science, then one would be hard pressed to find much fault with this book or with any of Ross's other work.I've yet to read the 3rd edition, but I look forward to doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its One of the Best","review":"I own many Ranma 1/2 DVDs and in my opinion, this is one of the best. The Scribbled Panda episode was really funny. The other two episodes were just okay. If you prefer to watch Ranma because of its strange, plotless comedy then I think that this is a good DVD to own. If you like watching Ranma 1/2 for action, I suggest you watch another anime (Dragonball GT, Dragonball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho, Rurouni Kenshin), Gung Fu movies, or American made action movies.By the Way - The Manga is alot more funny than the anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the Worst Ranma DVD in 6 seasons","review":"I am a big Ranma fan but I have to say that these 3 episodes must be the worst I have ever seen.The curse of the scribbled panda is about Ranma having to go on a date with a cartoon panda character that escaped from a scroll in order to return it and 2 monsters back to the scroll. Please... how bad a plot can you get.The legend of the lucky panda is just so completely out of character in a different time and place that it could have been written by a substitute script writer that didn't know anything about Ranma.Mystery of the marauding octopus similarly is set in a different place and seems so completely out of place in the series.This is probably only a DVD for diehard Ranma collectors who want a conmplete set. Others should look at the other DVDs in the series which are mcuch better."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this cd?","review":"I'm guessing that this cd is Shuffle by Okui Masami, since that is the only single I know that's been imported from Japan.

All I wanted to do at first was make a good beef stew (my own trials were OK, but nothing I'd share with anyone). Well, in The Joy Of Cooking, the task was comparable to building a nuclear power plant from scratch. Fortunately, I got this book for Christmas that year (2 months later) and have since made all sorts of dishes I wouldn't dare to try with the recipes from that \\"other\\" book. Beef strognoff - fewer than 10 ingredients. Mac and cheese - 6 ingredients. Cheesecake - 4 ingredients. And they all taste great! I'd give this book 10 stars if it were possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, informative, book with TONS of recipes","review":"This is another wonderful book by the Storeys. There is a collection of great recipes for every occasion, as well as information about how to make your own cleansers, a few nice crafts, even some info about canning, storage, and pickling.

A definite winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basics and More","review":"This worthy cookbook, along with the usual chapters on soups, salads, entrees and sweets, offers sections on kitchen know-how, tools and staples, as well as seasonal and holiday suggestions. Carryouts are here, including picnics, potlucks and bake sales; so too are kitchen arts, encompassing making yogurt, cheese, jams, pickles and curing meats.

It is well illustrated and covers the situation objectively. The author manages to balance good writing with dry statistics. The Osprey Campaign Series format of 96 pages is put to good use with every major detail explained without having to skimp on certain areas or draw out others.

It was also quite possibly the best show of the Nineties. Despite this, Profit only lasted for four episodes, all aired in April 1996. I am not sure why Profit was cancelled, but it could be that it was just too starkly original, too edgy, just too dark. Jim Profit was both the protagonist and the villain of Profit. Played by Adrian Pasdar, he was as evil as they come (J. R. Ewing was an amateur compared to him...). Profit worked for a large, international company and was willing to do literally anything to rise through its ranks. Created by David Greenwalt (who later worked on Angel) and John McNamara (who had previously written episodes of Brisco County Jr.), Profit worked very well as a dark satire of corporate America. It is little wonder to me that it has maintained a cult following to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I liked this series and was happy to find that the DVDs had been released at an affordable price. It has all the episodes and a featurette that explains a lot of what went on behind the scenes. The video and audio quality is good. My only problem with it was that it did not have subtitles. I would prefer if it did so you can make out some of the things that would ordinarily be inaudible. A booklet is included which makes for a nice bonus. This series would probably have been a hit should it not have been discontinued."},{"rating":"2","title":"PROFIT - THE COMPLETE SERIES - GREAT SHOW","review":"This is a dark, unusual show about a man ready to do everything in order to succeed in the corporate world. I heard it wasn't much of a success when it was first broadcasted, it is however an amazing show, pretty intense and sometimes uncomfortable, because of the main character sense of moral. I think that this series was ahead of its time and that today it would be a great success. Definitely worth watching it. The actors are unbelievably good."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad that I found this TV series","review":"I had never heard of this TV series before it came up on Amazon as a recommended item. I read the plot summary and the reviews that were written about it and decided that I would take a chance and buy the DVD. I'm so glad that I did because this apparently short-lived TV series is so entertaining. The plot is consistently unpredictable and suspenseful. The acting by all of the characters is great. I really don't know why this series is not on TV. If you like shows that are centered around career oriented people trying to get ahead at any cost, then you will enjoy this TV series. There is plenty of back-stabbing and co-worker manipulation to keep you glued to the screen until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy to find this","review":"I watched every episode of this show when it was on Fox in the late 90's, and I was extremely upset when I tuned in one night to find it pulled from the air. This show was definitely ahead of its time. It was very edgy and over-the-top. Even now when I watch the episodes I'm shocked at what I see.Regarding the discs, the picture quality is very good except for the pilot episode. That one looked like the 1,000th copy on the world's worst quality DVD. Other than that, I'm very pleased and would recommend this to everyone interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"time for an update series?","review":"Both the episodes and the commentaries can be enjoyed with repeated viewings.The voice-over commentaries are correct when they repeatedly observe this show would have been a hit if it had waited until a rash of unconventionl cable series hit their stride.

It could only be Profit, the short-lived series featuring Adrian Pasdar in the title role of Jim Profit, who grew up living in a big cardboard box with scraps of food and nothing but the TV for companionship.Somehow, he survives to become a well-groomed, computer-savvy, corporate-ladder-climbing fellow who will stop at nothing to gain ground in the Gracen and Gracen company, playing the CEOs against each other, forcing his secretary to help with the dirty work, and outsmarting two agents who are trying to finger him as the criminal mastermind.Add to this the goofy theme song, with is mostly synth mixed with some guy howling \\"YeeoWWWW!\\", and you will be in goofball TV heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary story about unsympathiic charaters.","review":"Bleah!

From the opening moments until the final shocking image two hours later, Profit had an amazing pilot. The show was too bizarre for its time, but now its time has come! Now we can see the COMPLETE series, including the 4 shows that Fox never showed in its original run. While the show is a five star show, I've got to give this collection 4 stars for minor flaws. The shows are not divided into chapters. If you want to see the ending of the pilot again, you've got to fast forward through the show by, well, fast forwarding like a video tape. Also, there are no subtitles or foreign languages offered.

Perhaps they haven't seen good shows to compaire?The show moves very slow and there is not much that keep my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Interesting Read","review":"This is a good book for anyone who enjoys transportation, logistics, or geography. As the author travels around the world visiting exotic ports on a giant container ship, I could almost feel myself there with him. His writing style is descriptive and captivating, and he interlaces general information about ocean container shipping, stories about crew members, and references to historical shipping literature with narrative about the journey itself.The author does have a left-leaning political view but most of the prose is not political in nature, and the author generally provides both sides of political issues.The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is the author's constant digressions into seafaring literature by Conrad and Melville. They were a little too long and may not be relevant to modern readers who no longer remember their high school reading assignments!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as it might have been","review":"You would think that this book is primarily about the modern industry of container shipping on the high seas, and there is some content along those lines. Unfortunately, the voyage coincides with 9/11 and the author, a former magazine editor, repeatedly abandons his primary topic in favor of pointless self-absorbed mewling about the twin towers tragedy, whose dated references ruin the book. What we end up with is magazine-quality travel writing, and spoiled travel writing at that. Be advised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I am a former employee of P&O Nedlloyd; the company that owned the ship this book was named for. I've been looking forward to reading this book hoping to relive some of the glory of my tenure with an outstanding ship line. Imagine my surprise when after less than a chapter into it I realised that the author simply used the experience and subject materiel as a platform from which to spew his liberal diatribe. He hijacked what could have otherwise been a very interesting book and fascinating subject matter with his own political agenda. Mr. Pollack, couldn't you have left your politics landside long enough to write the book you told P&O Nedlloyd you wanted to write?

Donaldson is absolutely amazing in how he describe his characters, such as my favorite, Vain. This gift spreads to an unknown realm, such that we know what it might be like to see the health, and inner beauty of other living things. The Chronicles have helped me to look at life a little differently, to appreciate beauty. Donaldson is an amazing writer. It is a shame that no more books will extend this story, as I believe it can. The only negative being that it is difficult reading.

Reilly's sensibilities are all wrong; her recipes are sickeningly sweet and her directions are not nearly specific enough. Beware of the Armenian coffee cake and the lemon bars because they will send you into a sugar overload. And her vanilla pudding uses too much cornstarch and it is thick and yucky.

The main character doesn't grow or develop (we're *told* that he's changed, but he doesn't act any different), and he's whiney. He throws in sex scenes to plaster over plot holes/lack of plot development. Tehani is far more interesting than Hunter, but she's relegated to Sex Interest. And the ending...very disappointing.I wanted to red ink the whole thing and send it back to him. I wouldn't read it twice. This is a slapdash piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and boring","review":"I had forgotten what I didn't like about Lee's Rama books until I began reading this. The Rama books were all full of underdeveloped, oversexed characters.This book was heavily laced with gratuitous sex and nothing but gratuitous sex... There was no plot, there were no characters. I read about 100 pages, put the book down and picked up the Orson Scott Card book I had waiting.When I finally got the nerve to finish the book I found even more gratuitous sex and even less plot. I did manage to finish the book... well, I think I finished it. I'm wondering if there may have been missing pages at the end or maybe one or twelve missing chapters. There was no climax to the book (well, so to speak) and the ending just... well... ended.Unless the author is planning a sequel to answer all the questions left at the end of this book (like \\"what was the plot?\\") don't waste your time. You'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The God of Process in the Process World of Cyberspace","review":"Jennifer Cobb explores a sense of encounter with the Divine in relation to cyberspace, which she concludes is essentially a world of processes -- and hence a perfect medium for finding the God of Process Theology.The book has some superb reflections upon the nature of realities that can be found in a cyber dimension of the lives we live. This, in fact, is the great strength of this book. If the reader has a strong appreciation for Process thought, this is a book that will be of interest. Those who come to it with more of a traditional Incarnational theology (rooted in Christianity) may find some of her optimism about disembodied minds to be a bit disturbing -- a disembodied ANYTHING is a problem for Incarnational thinkers. Cobb heightens some of the problems inherent in Process thought and adds to them.With all of the book's strengths and weaknesses, on balance I feel the book is very good and well worth the read. In fact, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Anime Classic!","review":"Whether your a long time otaku or just catching on to the craze, this series is a must have.

It is obvious why the series was almost cancelled in Japan, as the writers didn't really feel how to get the series together adapting Takahashi's series, as with most writers trying to work a series out when it starts. They slaughtered the characters of Ranma and Akane in this one, as it seems Ranma's always making a rude comment and Akane's hitting Ranma every ten seconds. It's also obvious that the dub actors are really trying to get the feel of the original characters, just check out Ranma's voice in the English version(he sounds awful!) compared to the Japanese version. I think it would be best to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could do better than this","review":"I guess you could chalk this up to being spoiled by far more superior anime.

They're not unfinished, it's just that these characters are great fun, and longer stories would have enabled me to spend more time with them. The great thing about MaryJanice Davidson's books (besides her wonderful humor and terrific writing) is that even relatively minor characters show up again and again, so even though I would have liked to spend more time with the people (wolves? vamps?) in these 4 stories, I am confident we shall meet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD AND LOVING IT, NOT QUITE....","review":"THIS WAS NOT THE MARY JANICE DAVIDSON I WAS EXPECTING....I DIDN'T KNOW THESE FIRST 3 STORIES WERE \\"E\\" RELEASED AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM.

Davidson has incorporated some of her story themes and melded them into one world - combining vampires with the werewolves. I enjoyed most of them and I read all of them, but I have to admit distaste for MONSTER LOVE. I won't give away the story, but I found it disturbing and somewhat insulting, which I have never encountered with her work before now. On the flip side, I heartily agree with her non-conformist view of what is attractive about women's bodies and their self-images in SANTA CLAWS. My favorite, however, is A FIEND IN NEED, which brings us all back into the world of Betsy, Queen of the Vampires. Despite my negative experience, I eagerly await more of her work - the positive far outweighs the negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fast, Raunchy Romp with Redundancies","review":"This collection of 4 short stories combines the Wyndham Werewolves of Deriks Bane with a fairy and a variety of vampires, including Betsy Taylor from the Undead series. The stories are of the boy meets girl variety. The girl isn't too sure about the boy, but finds lust and love with him. In fact, each of the stories has some pretty raunchy sex scenes. I agree with other reviewers that the stories are the same. The characters are nicely integrated from one story to the next. It's interesting to have the minor characters from the author's books fleshed out, but more plot varation would have made the stories better. For a quick read before bed time, this book is fast and fun, but lost a star for the redudancies in the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooo!","review":"This anthology is horrible! All the stories were so boring, and very unreadable. Did she really write this? I have no complaints about the Queen Betsy series so this is weird. The other book dead over heels was really good this one simply sucks. And the Fiend in need story with Garett and Antonia was horrible to didn't make any sense. Skip this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MaryJanice Davidson always a fun read.","review":"Great bunch of short stories. The author always puts a fun spin on these supernatural characters. I love her Betsy novels and as parts of the stories were missing, bought this book as it has a short story that fills in the gaps. But all the stories were very enjoyable and a laugh. recommend it to anyone that likes Betsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE the Undead series, so this was disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the \\"Undead and...\\" series starting with \\"Undead and Unwed\\" by MJD. I bought this book to read poolside on vacation was looking forward to it so much. So disappointed. Not only did I discover, as other reviewers, that this was basically the same short story told 4 times, but the sex stuff...blech. The sex in this book was not passionate or loving, it was graphic and brutal. I skipped over several paragraphs because reading about a woman enjoying being forced to have her \\"C\\" (yes that's the word) attacked - just didn't do it for me. It was somewhat offensive. I know many of the characters were supposed to be monsters - vampire, werewolves. etc, but these were females being raped - then falling in love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn is porn is porn. . . .","review":"If, indeed, the true definition of porn is no plot and copious sex, then this book is pure porn. It sucked (you should excuse the pun). It seems even the editors had their fill (you should excuse yet another pun): by the end novella there were mistakes galore (to instead of too, stature rather than statue, heroine initially introduced as brunette but four chapters later is described as a willowy blonde). I wouldn't blame an editor for walking away from this garbage.Trashy mouthed (wo)men and/or rape in captivity (or under any other circumstances) are not entertaining. I can't help but wonder what kind of money she made from this waste of time/effort/publishing. It would be nice if she would donate it to a women's shelter. I shudder to think this woman and her husband also write children's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"Other reviewers have given the story outlines so I won't waste time repeating them.Suffice it to say, thank goodness I borrowed this from the library rather than spending actual money on it. I have enjoyed Davidson's \\"Betsy\\" books over the years but these stories come no where near the level of those books. Perhaps if each of the stories were longer and more developed - and eliminated a lot of the gratuitous sex - I might have enjoyed them better. As it is, I was not disappointed when I finished the book, only surprised that I had actually finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Read!","review":"This book was a fast, easy, and highly entertaining read.

The stories all follow a similar theme: boy meets girl, boy is instantly attracted to girl, boy has mind-blowing sex with girl, and girl decides that based on that, they're perfect for each other. If you're looking for tons of gratuitous sex, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a little more in the way of plot, you may want to look elsewhere.One story that disturbed me was \\"Monster Love,\\" in which the hero kidnaps and rapes his lady love. Eeeewwww! How is this supposed to be romantic? Maybe it's just me, but a story with a woman falling in love with her rapist is just plain repulsive.The only bright spot is the last story which features George the Fiend from the Undead series. I did enjoy learning a little bit about George's background. It would have been a bit more enjoyable if George's love interest was a little more appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry MJD fans","review":"I can say it NO better than Kathleen did. MJD has fallen into the \\"romance\\" writer trap of ignoring her talent in lieu of just writing explicit over the top porn scenes.

And sex. Lots of hot, steamy sex.There were parts I was uncomfortable with - namely the non-con which turned into dub-con in the second story, and seeing George, the feral vampire called a Fiend, fall in love was kind of strange, but cute. So, 4.5 stars. If I hadn't been squicked by the non/dub-con, I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"You got to buy this book.","review":"It's a great read and hilarious, its definitely not for the prudish.

After listening to the first few CDs, I realized that I had wasted over $75.00 on nothing more than one heck of a boring course on countless pronunciation drills--one cd after another. After the fourth CD, I did not want to pursue this nonesense any further. I wanted to get a reimbursement right then and there, if only it wasn't too late. I'll know better next time to read these reviews first.I learned French at home, minored in Spanish in college and taught myself Portuguese. So, I consider myself a serious student of the romance languages. And after taking a basic course in Italian, which was truly a lot of fun, I figured I was rest ready to do the rest on my own. But contrary to the hyped blurb, this Barrons course was truly a flop. Save your dollars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a best begginer's course you can buy.","review":"The most fundamental aspect of verbal communication is pronouncing the words correctly. This sounds like it should go without saying, but it doesn't. Try walking around less touristed areas of Italy incorrectly pronouncing your phrasebook Italian. You might as well be talking Chinese. Believe me I have been there. This course is a bit tedious at times and it is hard. But guess what? So is learning a foreign language as an adult. This course is the best I have ever used and I have used alot. It teaches the begginer what he or she absolutely has to know to learn to really communicate verbally in Italian.You will not finish this course speaking like a native, but it gives you the foundation you must have to improve your Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes an expensive divider for your Gerbil cage!","review":"This course is complete nonsense. You spend hours repeating syllables without any context to meaning, and learning about pronunciation. It's impossible to learn anything about Italian, much less have any fun. I'm angry I was tricked by their \\"you'll master grammer, pronunciation, vocabulary\\" blurb on the back of the package. There's no way to develop mastery with this boring, repetetive, overly structured system. It pauses every 30 seconds to say \\"information unit 576\\" or some such nonsense. If their were a law against poorly conceived programs being sold for high prices, Barron's would be in jail.

It only focuses mainly on Italian pronunciation, which besides Spanish and Esperanto, is the easiest language to pronounce. Almost the whole book is dedicated to perfecting your Italian pronunciation to no help. The book has too many symbols for pronouncing every word just as a native would when real pronunciation is natural and flows in to place. Some books do a better job with pronunciation on two pages rather than hundreds. Grammar is poorly shown and explained and rather based on memorizing sentences. If you want to learn a Italian, which is a fairly simple language, buy living language books or hugo. ... If you can visit Italy and immerse yourself in Italian studies.

In any event Season 7 of JAG is the classic JAG when all the characters were still likeable. This is a show that can be watched by every member of the family without any embarassment. Some episodes get preachy at times, but I love the fact that there was never any over-the-top violence, just real-life exaggerated stories about the military and lawyers doing things they would never do in real life. But that's entertainment. I don't think I could stomach a lawyer reality show. That would be boring to tears.

Sorry, I've never been much of a fan and never could get into any of her books and never understood why this author was so highly reviewed.Anna and the King of Dragons was my favorite.

Almost every track on this CD is brilliantly crafted pop, with great vocals, brilliant production and the trademark KARNAK weirdness. I think I hear Prokofiev in one tune, polka/bossa in another. If you need more baroque harpsichord in your dance music, now you know where to turn. KARNAK RULE - basta. BTW - the first CD rules too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!!","review":"A cluttered, hyperactive world beat album, mixing rock, salsa, funk, ska, and less-definable Brazilian elements.

Thankfully, I got what I wished for -- and then some! The folks behind this kid-sized book have captured Grover's whimsical nature in both the text and the illustration. He huffs and puffs and contorts his furry old body into letter after letter, using props from the ordinairy to the unusual to make his starting-letter points clear. Grover is drawn as the fuzzy creature he is (with none of the smoothed out edges that some illustrators give him), and his heart is as big as his body is flexible. I give this book the highest grade possible: \\"G\\" for (what else?) Grover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Lenox","review":"Because Lenox is a name brand with a solid reputation for excellence, I did not hesitate to purchase this product online. I was not disappointed in the mug I received. Not only did I receive it in just a short amount of time, but it was exactly as pictured in the blurb. I chose it as a gift, but it was so festive and pretty that I decided to have one for myself as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquently Interesting","review":"I purchased this book looking for a \\"light read\\" while on business travel.

As a reformed ballerina come corporate lawyer, I recommend this work to any aficionado of the ballet world."},{"rating":"1","title":"... next?","review":"Maybe part of my problem is I didn't realize this book was highly fictionalized when I bought it, but I didn't care for it.

I think this is unfair to the dancers, in that people may remeber the fiction and not the truth. I did not want to read the entire book, as I did not want to confuse these stories with the wonderful autobiographies I have read by many of the dancers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I didn't quite understand when this was supposed to have taken place. For a woman in her 20's to be having an affair with a concentration camp survivor, he would have had to have been even older than her father if this was set in the last 30 years. The male character was married and had young children, so it was hard to get an idea of how old he was. I liked the character of Harriet but wasn't sure what her childhood relationship to her neighbors had to do with anything that happened later. Anne's character was annoying and I wasn't surprised at her demise in spite of her having reached out to others for help. The mirror and photography motifs throughout were interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAYBE THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ","review":"This could well be the worst book I have ever read. It is boring from beginning to end. It features the most neurotic and unlikeable characters I've come across in years. It is badly written. The author tries to sound important all way long, actually being utterly redundant. This book doesn't contain a single clear sentence. Everything has to be said at least twice, since the author doesn't trust her own words. Further, Ms. Weber likes to bring up \\"relevant\\" issues: Auschwitz, relationships, child abuse. The result is waste of time and money. Face it: This one is nothing but a pompous mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely Writing But Flawed Overall","review":"I agree that Katharine Weber is a talented writer, however the book as a whole was uneven and by the end, uninspired. The photography imagery was overused often failed to conjure the picture [pitcher] or mood Weber seemed to be reaching for. The journal portion of the book was stunning; the third-person traditional narratives less so. In an attempt to create a novel as told through snapshots, Weber left me feeling unengaged and disinterested. Although I loved her word play and Harriet's voice in the beginning, I felt the novel ran out of steam and became much more pedestrian by its conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE JOKE OF THE DECADE","review":"This, dear friends, is the most amazing book of the year 1995 ... and for probably another 95 years to come. It is kind of a Plan Nine From Outer Space\\" with characters out of the mental hospital, a writing style that opens new, until now undiscovered dimensions in banality, and lots of other goodies: dialogue so utterly trite that it will make you wanna weep, self-important blah blah directly from the literary trashcan, imbecile wordplay - a laughable pastiche of talentless word processing, a novel without any idea, any meaning or topic. This author doesn't waste time with thoughts, themes, plot, insights. Every page is a new evidence for her procedure: Why should she?Miss Weber teaches writing at Yale. This is not only a grand mystery, but the joke of another 95 years to come. Let's all become scholars of Miss Weber, and let's create a new literature for a new, thought-free planet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good produst","review":"Another good product.

If you like Kenny Rogers, you won't be sorry if you buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must for Kenny Rogers Fans!","review":"Whether you are a die-hard Kenny Rogers fan (like me) or a casual fan, you will enjoy this DVD. We have a home theater, and I was thrilled with the superb sound quality and crisp picture quality of this DVD. Having seen Kenny in concert many times, I really enjoyed the spontaniety of this concert as Kenny fielded caller requests, and told short, interesting anecdotes about each song before singing it. There are also a couple of great duets with Linda Davis. In addition, those 'in-the-know' can even catch some glimpses of Kenny's wife, Wanda, and her twin sister in the audience. My only criticism is that I would have loved to have some DVD bonus options, like behind-the-scenes, etc., but none are provided.The filming angles and closeness make you feel just like you are there...not like some in-concert videos that are far away or grainy. Like I said, if you are a Kenny Rogers fan, this DVD is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sweet tales of the Jewish Tom Thumb in a natural environment","review":"How do you get a tiny New Yorker into nature? You strand him on an island after a ride on the wind in his father's hat! K'tonton beautifully meets all his challenges and his Jewish obligations in this tale of a boy on his own... part Treasure Island, part Swiss Family Robinson, all sweet and fun.

Very cute just too small."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diamond in the not-so-rough","review":"Fats Navarro was one of those musicians who exploded onto the jazz scene, set it on fire while he was here, and then sadly died way too young. This album is taken from radio broadcasts in the Fall of 1948 and, as such, the sound quality is not what many people are used to. That said, the Fresh Sounds folks did a nice job remastering these tracks, and I consider the sound quality to be very good for the era and source. Now, what's really important here is we're talking about Fats Navarro with Tadd Dameron (one of the best bebop composer/arrangers) and Kenny Clarke live at the Royal Roost, with a good supporting cast. Fats rips off huge, articulate runs at breath-taking speed and makes it sound so easy. His playing is as good as anything I have in my Fats collection. Absolutely essential for any Fats Navarro fan or any early bebop fan, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Islamic history","review":"Viewed from 2009, this book published in 1958 is stale-dated; definitely passed its prime. The author wrote the book as a generic \`background' book regarding Islam; it has no citations, no footnotes nor endnotes, with barely a bibliography. Although it frequently quoted from the Koran, no ayat citations were provided. If you are even casually familiar with Islam, you will learn nothing new within this book. The author opined that Islam would eventually somehow reform itself and allow Muslims to awake from the intellectual stupor that Islam has been encapsulated in since the 1500s. The author opined that eventually Islam would arose itself out of its lethargy and join in the \`One World' enthusiasm that was so prevalent amongst the 'intelligencia' during the 1950s. After reading the book, I junked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ivory Joe","review":"Some of my most fondly remembered songs are here and some that I am not familiar with.

I too have been diagnosed with MS. I'm happy that Mr. Lander can find humor in his condition, however I find nothing he had to say not in the least bit funny.MS is a terrible diease that affects the Central Nervous System and there's nothing funny about that. Even the title of the book is seriously upsetting(How Squiggy caught Multiple Sclerosis and Didn't Tell Nobody). You can't catch MS, and to put that in print is misleading.I take my MS, the treatment for it, and all the symptoms very seriously.

It should be noted that the cloak is made of very cheap felt, but for the $13 I paid, it was totally worth it for the photo opp since I would never have bothered to make something like this myself.

I was also told that the 8.0 version supposedly does work, however it was not available. Their advice was to return the product.

As a beginner in French, I thought that I would be able to learn more than I was able to from this program. In the first 2 weeks, I went through the program, listened to the tape in my car, and attempted to go through the workbook. What I found to be lacking was the fact that it focuses on vocabulary words and phrases before teaching the grammar and logic to the language. For those of you who want an actual understanding of French past a few vocab words, I suggest you look somewhere else. The tape was also hard to understand, even at the very beginning. The speakers talked too fast, so it made it hard for me to repeat after them since I was trying to figure out what they'd said exactly. Overall, it is a nice presentation, but I'd hoped to gain an overall understanding of the language, not just how to say, \\"I'm fine, thank you.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not run","review":"Installed and reinstalled programs in an attempt to get it run.

That fixed the problem instantly, and I thought we were back in business.

The design is excellent. Installation went smoothly. However, within 24 hours we needed to reset the pairing in order to receive or make calls. After multiple resets, a phone call was made to the VTech customer support team. They were pleasant but brought bad news. In the customer service team member's script was a statement that the product offered through Amazon was most likely old and needed to be replaced. Further, he recommended that we return our phones to VTech, not Amazon. As a result, we packed up the product and shipped it back to VTech (at our expense) for a complete replacement.So ... the verdict is still out. Did we receive an old phone?

The only way I can use this phone is if someone calls me and I talk to them on the speakerphone from the base, but I can't even call people!

Maybe it's my wireless network intefering with it? But it's supposed to be on a different frequency. Hmmm.

Then because I'd learned to be suspicious of this phone, I called in from a different number and golly gee, what a surprise, the recording function doesn't work. In fact, the phone couldn't get beyond the first two words of my message before failing. It didn't even get as far as the beep to even think about recording.Why this is such a whiz bang phone is beyond me.

I'm trying to eat \\"raw food\\" and the quart size is perfect for a nice large meal-size salad (you need LARGE salads if you're living on them!) and the two-quart size is great for making a big salad in. The only down side to Corelle is, if you happen to knock or drop or hit them in exactly the right way, they can shatter into myriad tiny shards, each extremely sharp.

I reluctantly decided to give the workout a rest and see it the pain diminished. After not doing this workout for a couple of months (but doing others instead) the pain in both areas has diminished considerably. I do not think throwing those weights around, especially over your head, is good for much of anything.

All in all, I am thrilled with this workout as it is a thorough workout, timesaver, and moves very quickly. I do not like to change routines, but this one is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I ordered this because I used to do her workouts in years past. This was one of her worst workouts. I felt she gave very few reps before you were on to the next exercise... Not her best work in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Kathy!","review":"I have always liked Kathy's exercise videos but this one is so disappointing. The reason is that she does not follow the beat of the music.Most of the fun of these types of videos is following the beat. It makes it a lot easier to get through a major workout. But on this one it's like they added some music after the video was made so the music is out of sync with the exercises. It's very distracting for me. I think the exercises are good, but nobody is following the music so it's no fun.Come on Kathy stay with the beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Kathy recommends heavy weights, but the movements are too aerobic to be safe with heavy weights, and using light weights would not sculpt enough. I'm really suprised that this is called \\"Ultimate Sculpt,\\" I think the name is misleading. It's mostly calisthenics with one section of challenging floor ab work and one \\"advanced\\" section that was just squats and lunges. Not challenging enough for intermediate exercisers. Didn't even sweat with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"FEEL GREAT WORKOUT","review":"I decided to start doing home exercise dvds since I can't get to the gym anymore. I begin with my elliptical for 30-45 minutes and then do an exercise dvd 3-4 times per week. I LOVE this Matrix Method by Kathy Smith. It's the first one I've purchased from her (based on Amazon reviews), and it seemed to fit what I was looking for. PRO's: it's not boring, it's easy to follow along with, Kathy's instructions help me do everything properly, she motivates you and more. Especially, I like the sequence of her exercises and how they work every part of the body, including your back. The stretching in the last segment is fabulous! CON's: Would like more Ab training (although I didn't do the 12 minute Bonus workout yet, which might have some on there)Definitely try this workout if you want to get a quick complete workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"I owe a couple of Kathy Smith's Dvds and I like this one the most because it combines legs & arms at the same time.

It is true but once you listen up all the songs from this CD it becomes clear that Blue Stingrays' music is stronger than most of the pictures you'll ever see. Magic sound by magic musicians.

Cowboy Bebop is probably the best anime out there. So what's the problem? The \\"Perfect Sessions\\" is Taiwanese bootleg.

You click on \\"Character Intros\\" and it plays \\"Interview with Sunrise Stuff\\" etc. All the interviews are in Japanese without any subtitles.In my package there was also a black paint spot on the play side of the second DVD.On the other hand the price is right and there is no region code protection.

The snazzy bebop music, attitude, and overall air of the show is ... dazzling or ... uh ... appealing i guess. I saw no flaws in the plot or anything like that. If you have seen Outlaw star, Trigun, or any animes like that i suggest that you buy the box set or just one disc to preview. I enjoyed it alot, and im sure that you will 2.If you are skeptical, check the numbers.

Start with BeBop","review":"This copy was a pretty good duplication. The origional is far too expensive for any normal person to afford or find for that matter, it's a cult classic. I saw the empty box selling for $120 the other day. The characters are a mismatched crew of bounty hunters trying to make a living in a not too distant future when humanity has moved out to the plants and taken most of our vices and bad habits with us. Thankfully, we've taken some of our humanity, caring and love for our fellow human kind as well. The stories seem a bit childish on the surface, but if you watch closely, you'll see a mirror of our modern society just below the surface of every episode.

The only sacrifice is that they squeez all the episodes on to 3 discs. OK, I can live with that. What they dont tell you is the sound and picture are very poor quality. I've rented the normal six disc set and was blown away by the incredible video transfer and awsom sound. On The Perfect Sessions (Limited Edition Complete Series Boxed Set) the video looks like it was transfered from VHS(mucho video artifacts and fuzzy picture) and the sound is Pro-Logic(only the menu is in Dolby Digital not the program).

The Perfect Sessions was a limited edition set that came in a very nice box, each of which was numbered by the manufacturer. I found this out the hard way after I ordered it and got a bootleg.

I don't remember that last time I watched it. At most other times, it was perfectly fine. The audio was great, the packaging slick and minimalistic.

In fact, so far it has the best music of any anime show I've yet seen. So very diverse and fun. Yet, Cowboy Bebop barely has anything I haven't seen elsewhere and it's themes are far less thought-provoking than those of Trigun, which I believe to be unique from everything else in any genre.It can't be denied, however, that this is a fabulous boxset, one of the best ever. I have almost as big a blast looking at it as I do watching the series. Top notch production. The show is full of fun characters (most notably Ed) and a variety that's hard to find elsewhere. The way they handled the ending was quite masterful, yet all in all a sad affair. To be truthful, you can't have a better viewing experience than watching Cowboy Bebop AND Trigun together. Spike and Vash, friends forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Cowboy Bebop...","review":"But I hate bootlegs. The three disk sets are bootlegs of inferior quality, and theyre still being advertised as \\"Limited Edition Boxed Sets\\".The DVD is muddled by compression artifacts and terrible pixelation. This is something you would not see to such effect on a professional or official DVD. This results in a viewing experience that could easily be found online, using a file sharing program. These generous sellers are giving you the chance to pay for it.Do yourself a favor, and make sure that your \\"Limited Edition Box Set\\" has six disks in it plus a soundtrack. Better yet, buy sessions 1-6 individually, if youre not terribly interested in collectability. It will cost a little less than the collectable sets, and you can rest assured in knowing that you'll receive a high quality, official DVD of this great show, and that the money will be going back to the people who worked so hard to create it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the, if not the, best anime series ever!","review":"Cowboy Bebop is easily the best anime series I have ever seen, with Evangelion and Lain taking close seconds and thirds. Bebop is already a classic, and it's popularity is likely to contiune to grow. It contains extremely high production values, including a first rate musical score which on it's own could be considered very moving. What it lacks in depth at times it more than makes up with fast paced action, humour, and just overall coolness. If you are considering ordering this box set I'd do so soon, because I do not believe it will last long.

Sure if you compare it to the original the first gets the upper hand but there's something about it that I througherly enjoy. It has a good soundtrack, interesting and at times moody scenery, Mickey oozes sensuality and sex appeal. But what I find I think that makes the film work is because of the casting of the always gorgeous, talented, interesting, charming, playful-Angie Everhart.

However I was dissapointed in the movie. The first one w/ Kim Bassinger was okay, it seemed like there was more of a story to that one. With the sequel though it wasn't good at all. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but the acting was deffinitely not good, and the dialouge was bad, and so was the setting for where they shot the movie. I think they shouldn't have waited so long to make a sequel to nine and a half weeks, or they should have used new actors. My advice to anyone thinking about seeing this movie, rent it first. But then it's still not worth the $3.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The first 5 minutes of this movie hold the theme that continues throughout. Stupidity.

Even by the standards of fairy tale I found this not believable.A \\"world within a world within a world\\" fantasy (the top example of which is Little Big by John Crowley)."},{"rating":"2","title":"PCE student review","review":"I think you should buy the Chronicles of Narnia the Last Battle by C.S Lewis. It's an ape and donkey that find a lion skin. Then donkey put it on and every one thinks he's Aslan a lion. Aslan is the king of Narnia, but you have to read the book to see what else happens. The Last Battle is a adventure book that has complicated words, it's good for all ages. The theme is good vs. evil. My favorite scene is in the middle book when there's the battle that leads to the end. I like this book because it's an adventure and doesn't have a main character. My favorite character is Aslan because he is powerful and magical. That's why I think you should buy The Last Battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Average Ending","review":"Lewis should of spoke more about Tash in the other books instead of just introducing him in the very last book of the series. The last few chapters were the best of the book the rest was OK. This book was not as good as the other books but is still was a pretty good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, from what I have read.","review":"I have tried to read this book many times but I have never finished it. It's not that it was boring, I just couldn't finish it. I have heard that the last few chapters, which I have not read, are the best chapters of the book, and also that this is the best book in the series. I am going to keep trying to read it, and from what I have read, I would reommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ending","review":"This book, The Last Battle, was the best in the series of the books. I say this because it had adventure (a lot of it) and if you haven't read this book but you have read the others, I say read it once you get to. One part, a battle, it really scared me. Another part where someone leaves the group, I felt bad the he/she did so. If you are wondering, yes, Aslan will be there and at the last part, it made me all smiles. I would recommend this to anyone at all ages, boy, girl, men, women, anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chronicles of Narnia","review":"Another great story in this wonderful land of Narnia, C.S. Lewis is one of the all time great writers that takes his readers with him into the world of his imagination and beliefs. This book is the finale and it helps the reader understand Narnia better than all the previous stories, loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"bittersweet ending","review":"This story happens about 200 years after the Silver Chair (200 years Narnian time) and harkens the end of Narnia, a world which lasted two and a half millennia (in Narnia time, as only about 50 years passed in the real world during this time) and the title of this book is rather appropriate. Fans of the series will be sad to see it end, but this is a rather good book, with the reappearance of many old and much-loved characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The concluding story of the Narnia fantasy chronicles","review":"The concluding story of the Narnia fantasy chronicles receives a powerful audio narration by Star Trek actor/star Patrick Stewart, whose smooth British voice perfectly captures the drama revolving around a missing great Lion, the heart of Narnia's magic, and children's efforts to find him. Add the perils of a king who now must fight the last struggle without Aslan's magic and you have a gripping saga indeed. Familiarity with the prior books is essential to a full appreciation of this concluding drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End or the Beginning","review":"How do you conclude one of the most vivid and imaginative stories of all time? Very carefully. The adventure comes and goes but the real story starts when Aslan comes to unwind his creation. The end is as great as the beginning; from calling down the stars to each person giving an account for their life.When all is done, Narnia is revealed as it truly is. And, it is even greater than before."},{"rating":"2","title":"the last chapter","review":"The first book in the Narnian Chronicles I ever read (age 11) was the last in the series, 'The Last Battle'. It has always been my favourite.'The Last Battle' is not just the last story in the series, but is the story of the end of Narnia, as well as the ending (and the beginning) of other things. In it Lewis references dualism (ie Tash), false prophets (Shift the ape)and other apocalyptic themes, and takes a swipe at atheism (the dwarfs who cannot see Aslan).It is a very satisfying and bittersweet ending to the best ever children's fantasy series."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)","review":"This book was one of the worst books I've read it needs to be tossed in a pit with the Shadowmancer and Eragon. In this book they said basically nothing about PETER the most important character. The battles where so mediocre that I fell asleep in the middle of them. I realized when I woke up I was at the end of the book. C.S Lewis could have done such a better job. This is a terrible read I urge you to avoid reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christians be aware! This book seriously contradicts with the Bible","review":"In this book, author C. S. Lewis gives dubious teachings that totally contradict with the Bible. Being wiser in this regard, I couldn't recommend this book to any Christians, neither children nor adults.The book, made by this so-called Christian preacher, claims that Aslan (there are clear references to Jesus throughout the Chronicles) and \\"Tars\\" (some other \\"god\\") are the same.Here's the translation of that claim (chapter 15, my translation from the Finnish version): \\"My child, all that you've made to serve Tars, I take it as your service to me\\". So it clearly states that believing in any other god is the same as believing in Jesus Christ and His Father. So Lewis totally opposes to the message of the Bible and the Gospels.What's more, this claim is intentionally in the book: my friend has told me about \\"the pastor\\" Lewis's teachings that are in line with this uncomprehensible distortion of the Word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Keeps you Guessing","review":"This book is great and has a great plot. When this book starts out' you think you know how it's going to end. Then suddenly, there is a twist in the plot and everything changes. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Battle","review":"i love Puzzle! Puzzle is really sweet but easily misled.; Jill is cool. i like Jill, but sometimes shes very foolish,though most of the time shes not. Jill is good with a bow.; Eustace is okay, and good with a sword but sometimes kind of whinny.; Jewel is really nice but to eager to dig people's guts out.; The king,though very loyal and pretty nice he has the same trouble as Jewel.; Shift is a vile evil creature who was very mean to Puzzle and all of Narnia.; LOVED the book.........this is my school report. i did love the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duhhhh C.S.

It was suspenseful in a way. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through it.

I recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely superb","review":"Again, a most glorious read. Each time that I read this story, I begin to understand what it is really about. This is told in a very beautiful way and with deeper meaning. I would highly recommend this book to any one who enjoys a deeper story!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst book in the series","review":"I re-read this along with the rest of the series after having read them several times as a kid. They're definitely for kids, but still fun to read as an adult especially being able to remember reading them as a kid.This is by far the worst book in the series. It starts out well enough, with a pretty good story and some pretty good characters, including the new king, and some good animals. But by the end, it degenerates into a lot of feel good religous nonesense that just doesn't live up to the rest of the series. Having said that, it's still a must read to close out the series, but thankfully it's pretty short.If you're reading this series for the first time, be sure to read it in the correct order (starting with The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe) instead of the stupid order they are currently marketed in, as they will be much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Can A Book Be This Good?","review":"The Last Battle is sure packed with adventure and imaginaition. C.S. Lewis has done a very good job with his series. A donkey named Puzzle and an ape named Shift try to pull of a dangerous trick. They pretend Puzzle is Aslan, though Puzzle is wearing lion skin that was found in the water. The Calormenes are in on the trick, and they make all the animals become slaves. As King Tirian is knocked out and tied to a tree, two kids named Jill and Euastace rescue King Tirian. Poggin the Dwarf, Jill the Archer, Euastace the Swordman, King Tirian the King, and Jewel the Unicorn battle for their lives. At the end, there is a new world in the stable... where Tash lives"},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroyed everything worthy in the series in one stroke","review":"This book retroactively ruins all the other books in the series. It makes all the previous adventures and struggles pointless and reveals the grand fate of all the brave characters to be meaningless.There are so many things wrong with the plot, characterization, antagonists, and resolution... It is like this book was written by a different author, one who had already turned his back on the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the earlier six books,","review":"but couldn't really stand this one. The reason might be that I am not Christian, so a lot of the doom and gloom stuff simply did not resonate with me as much as it might with people who understood where C.S. Lewis was coming from.The first time I read this books (all seven in one sitting), I literally could not believe what I was reading in \\"The Last Battle\\". All the wonder and glory in the previous six books, decimated in a couple of hundred pages.Oh, well. To each their own..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Battle is a great book","review":"I really like the Chronicles of Narnia.I've read five. So far, my favorite book was The Last Battle. When I started reading it, I didn't think it was very exciting. But when I finished reading it, I thought it was one of the best books I've read. I think it was great, exciting, and sometimes humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Fun","review":"Until reading this collection, I was no fan of the prosepoem; now, since having spent many delicious times with this volume, I can no-longer say that. Mullen's works in Sleeping With The Dictionary are frequently fabulously playful, often have wonderful aural effects, and can be an hybrid of the laugh-out-loud funny and point-blank seriousness.\\"K was burn at the bend of the ear in the mouth of remember\\": K was born at the end of the year in the month of December\\"--Marvelous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best There Is","review":"I was privileged to read this book in manuscript form. In this commentary, Collins follows up on his intriguing insights developed briefly in his previous book, Science and Faith: Friends of Foes?

Highly recommended for the practicing engineer or student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of \\"Farscape\\"'s best episodes EVER!","review":"After a good half season, things really take off in this collection of episodes from the show's fourth season. The first episode, \\"Unrealized Reality\\", starts it all off with our hero John Crichton getting taught about the true danger involved with his knowledge of wormholes, along with a rather shocking conclusion. One great kick of this episode (especially for the hard-core fans)is the cast's appearances as different crew members throughout the episode. The next two episodes, \\"Kansas\\" and \\"Terra Firma\\" are as good, if not among the show's very best. Even the \\"ship in a bottle\\" episode \\"Twice Shy\\" is pretty good. For a show that was about to be cancelled, you wouldn't be able to say it was on account of quality. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best episode in Sci-Fi IMO","review":"I really liked this particular set because of its episodes. It's the kind of thing we always want to see, like Janeway's Voyager getting home. There's not much in the way of special features, but there's a nice half-hour interview with Lani (Crais) and deleted scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"good episodes","review":"these episodes are well worth the watch, especially if you've been watching since the beginning, since it brings a sense of conclusion to a part of the aborted 4th season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting, great sound, excellent value","review":"I've had these headphones for 6 years. They're indestructable and still sound great. Because all the pieces are modular, if one part breaks, you can make a minor replacement instead of investing in a whole new set of phones. Once I had to replace the cable for about $2.99.These are also great if you are going to be wearing the headphones for many hours. The padding is soft, light and adjusts easily. My ears (inner and outer) don't get ear fatigue.The open sound keeps the audio flowing naturally. If you pump up the jams really high, a little sound will leak out. But usually there's a balance between the sound outside the phones and inside that it doesn't matter.I bet they'll last 6 more years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Music but not that great for gaming...","review":"The headphones are really good for music but when I connected it to Tv with my Xbox the sound quality was not that great compared to other gaming headsets.So its great for music lovers not for gaming.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some distortion, overly bright and uncomfortable headphones","review":"There immediately was present a audio distortion/vibration in the ear speaker discernable in the lower to lo-midrange frequencies that was not in the music itself as eastablished when comparing the same CD on other headphones.The ear cushions are way too small unless one has very small ears. Sound transmits off the outside of the headpones at sufficient volumes so as to disturb other people that are within your listening proximity. Lastly, typical Chinese manufacturing quality (poor) and all plastic. Even at a discounted price these are headphones that are not worth keeping. Personally, I returned them back to Amazon and have great gratitude for Amazon's generous returns policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"EH 350 - Excellent sound for the price","review":"This is the second set of EH 350 style headphones I have bought from Sennheiser and I am just as happy with this model as my first.Pro:The sound quality is excellent for those not looking for big bass, the build quality is quite good, and I love the pull out connectors for the headphones. No ripping apart your headset when you accidentally stand up with your foot on the cord! Comfort is quite reasonable as well, though I don't like using these for more than 4 hours at a stretch.Con:No, this isn't a super-fancy set of headphones, so don't expect the world. The open-air design means that people around you will hear what you are listening too if it is even slightly loud, but the flip side is you can hear some of what is going on around you as well (so this might be an advantage as well).If you are looking for excellent headphones to listen to quality low-bass music, radio, or games without needing audo-isolation, you could do a lot worse than the EH 350."},{"rating":"2","title":"all-round decent light headphones","review":"Being the top model of the EH series, the 350 are a light semi-circumaural open headphones, at a right price for the sound. As they lay on the ears, they may seem to press a bit at first, but they lay firmly on the head and ears don't heat up very much, pads are comfortable and it is lightweight.The sound is well spaced and gives good detail, with a wide range. Highs are clear and bass is present too. They offer a good sound for modern, jazz, and rock music. For classical they sound a little dry for mid frequencies and limited for the 'warm' reproduction of an orchestra, for example.They have a low impedance of 32 ohm and can be driven by portable players, radios, with good sound aswell as with PC-outs or evenamplifiers. I like their natural sound for jazz and pop rock and I use to reduce the highs and bass to fully appreciate a flat response because they are always present in these headphones! Recommended and right for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed ...","review":"Expectations were high and deal was good and then the package arrived and I did not see the quality that I had see associated with this product by others.

What \\"ill omen\\" being refered to is quite obvious, once beginning to listen to the CD. There are six tracks, all of which are hardly any music at all. It is more like someone talking into a microphone which is as close to their mouth as possible, without actually being inside of it. The lyrics are indiscernable, indecipherable, and would be completely unknown if they didn't include them in the booklet. Bird Of Ill Omen chose their name accordingly, as their music is an ill omen of what is to be coming constantly from this band. This debut CD is definately a downer, and maybe just because it is a debut. Maybe with the release of their latest CD, a new concept of singing and the ability to understand the lyrics will be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Army of Sociopaths","review":"Please refer to William Gilmore Simms book: The Sack and Siege of Columbia, SC to read about the carnage this officer and his men inflicted upon the innocent civilian population in their March to the Sea.

The second major negative is that this book is little more than a set of graphs on one page followed by a brief one or two paragraph discussion. My criticism here is that there is too little discussion about when to use these graphs or common design flaws when they are used. Business users should be warned that most of the graphs covered in this book were created using the S+ programming language and software and many are not applicable to typical business graphing needs.

I tried to listen to it over and but it just wasn't good enough for me. I tured it up a few times after school and I began to like it. My favorite song is green corn. Without El Hefe NOFX is a totally diffrent band. El hefe makes the band come alive, I would reccomend this album or the longest line to start off your collection. And your library will expand from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOFX has yet to make anything that matches Ribbed","review":"Ribbed just never gets old and everything about it is freakin awesome. Every song rocks and the first three songs Green Corn, Moron Bros, and Shower Days jump out the speakers like a sonic assault straight to your head. Forget the first three songs, the whole cd will blow your mind this thing is good from start to finish, and Yes its even better than Punk In Drublic. This is definately different than their newer stuff and Ribbed is a little more serious, but they still have that same sense of humor that you can always expect. Anyway this is just an amazing classic and if you like NOFX and don't have this.....WELL WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MORON!? GO BUY IT NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lubricated finest punk rock","review":"Just in case you're a NOFX fan...buy this album,is one of their greatest..let's begin withGreen Corn.......awesome fast song,MOron Bros. Classic NOfx tune,Together on the Sand......jazzy funny song......well I'm too lazy to go through every song......I'll give five stars to every song except for brain constipation....that would be 4 and the flu......that deserve three stars.....this is the first album that caught punk rocka's attention in 1990...cuz their' previous albums....were kinda good but most people didn't like 'em........so this is the beginning of this mythic idolizing punk band.........I don't want you around pseudo puck rockers......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ribbed","review":"This is a very underrated NOFX album many people think that NOFX's early work is too hardcore and fat Mike's voice is crap, well not on this record. This really was their breakthrough album and in my view one of their best. The songs are very well thought through and put together and also this is their last album withough El Hefe and with their old guitarist Steve, anyway the best songs on here are showerdays, nowhere and gonoheresyphilis(I most definetly spelt that wrong!). All I can say is buy it you most certainly wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Band, Bad Album","review":"Plagued by ill-founded lyrics and a bad sound, Nofx, a great band comes up with an unusually bad album.

Used it 4x from Sunday to the next Saturday and the blade just broke off the handle completely. The instructions for assembly were lousy - hard to read illustrations that didn't tell you if you were right or wrong. I'm sure poor assembly contributed to this rake's short life in my hands.

I'm sure it will last the remainder of this record breaking (for me) season and beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 10 min","review":"After 10 min it broke.I went to return it to the local store, and the lady there even told me \\"did it break here?\\", which was a hard rubber connector to the head, and I said yes. Easiest return ever. They said they had so many break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow rake","review":"This product is relatively easy to assemble. It works well but the poles are a bit too flexible. This makes it harder to handle and more labor intensive than it would be with more rigid poles. In all fairnees it is safer than getting on a snowy roof to remove the snow and it is far cheaper than paying someone else to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"The product was hard to put together. There is a square nut that goes into the base of the handle to hold the bolt which was very hard to get lined up properly. Also, the assembly directions were practically non-existent, and I ended up with two extra pieces that I had no idea what to do with. It was nearly impossible to get all the bolts tightened properly because of the way that the thing is assembled. Predictably, we lost pieces by the end of the first use.I wouldn't buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement Parts","review":"This has been a good tool, until my teenage grandson over worked it.

This book is unique because it is the first that contains all the caprichos (captions), their spanish translations into English, and the original introduction. The original set of these, if I'm correct were destroyed by the Inquisition as a way to censor is his critique of the corrupt church.

Its okay, the riffs are decent and some of the ska-ish and reggae stuff is cool. Its just not melodic at all, very different from the really good stuff (punk in drublic, heavy petting zoo, Ribbed, So Long...). The lyrics are interesting, sometimes funny. The anti-vegetarian lyrics are ironic, cause Fat Mike is now a vegan. I guess he was just ... off at vegetarianism when he wrote \\"Shut up already\\" and \\"vegetarian mumbo-jumbo,\\" but then realized at some point that vegetarianism is the right thing to do (ahhh, screw it, GO VEGAN!!!!). Anyway, its decent, a must have for a die-hard NOFX fan, but nowhere near as good as any other of their albums (except for Maximum Rock-n-Roll... uhhhh)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the die hards, folks","review":"This is an early NOFX release, their first actual album to be released (to clear the confusion from below). All the songs on the unofficial \\"Maximum Rocknroll\\" were recorded before this, but this is the first full length NOFX put out. And, as the band would gladly tell you, it's pretty bad. This is NOFX at an early stage, before they took their music into the insanely great directions they have since. It's a very metal-sounding album and a bit amatuerish, but still a great listen for its humorous lyrics and obvious punk rock disregard for standards. Any NOFX fan will find it amusing, but don't get it for great music. You'll be disappointed. It was the first NOFX record I ever heard, but I wasn't a true fan of what they do until I heard White Trash. Anyway, don't bother with this until you have full absorbed Punk In Drublic (of course), Ribbed, The Decline, White Trash, and Heavy Petting Zoo. And Pump Up The Valuum is great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk rock the way it should be played","review":"This stuff is how punk rock should sound. Not too melodic, not whiny, not pathetic and not preachy (at least in a serious way, I mean look at The Meatmen). Liberal Animation boasts everything that was missing in some other rock albums I've heard in my life. It's raw, in your face, and it takes no prisoners. Everything after this is garbage. I like Shut Up Already, Freedumb, Sloppy English, Beer Bong and Vegetarian Mumbo Jumbo, those tracks are the best. All the lyrics have a dopey edge to them, and they can pull off sounding drunk and stupid without sounding repetitive. The metallic riffs really cut to ya. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a letdown","review":"I'm a big NOFX fan, but this album is a far yell from being great like some of their other stuff e.g. Punk in Drublic, Two Whites . . . . Mediocre stuff from one of the greatest punk bands that really doesn't suck, no matter what they say. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"making punk lose it's meaning for over 10 years!","review":"this band made it possible for jocks who picked on you in 9th grade for dressing weird to carry their skate board around (they NEVER actually use them, it's just a fashion accessory), go to hot topic, and claim to be punk. hillarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good album, but quite different than their other releases","review":"if you grown to like nofx from their later releases like punk in drublic, or white trash, two heebs and a been, then chances are you won't find this appealing. this album was from their earlier sessions where there was more of a metal/grind/hardcore influence to their sound. they still have their humor and satire in their lyrics, which makes for some amusing listening experiences. so, if you like nofx for their lyrics and their do it yourself attitude, regardless of how they sound, by all means buy this album. if you like more of a pop punk, softer melodic sound, then buy their later releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"raw, fast, funny, punk","review":"Thats how punk should be... and NOFX did it in a great way. NOFX's second album is lyrically hilarious because the issues aren't dealing with politics. Mike's voice is definately not for everyone and this is way before it got great but if you are a true punk fan you should really enjoy this. The best songs are Shut Up Already, Here Comes The Neighborhood, A200 Club (hilarious song about having crabs), Mr. Jones, Vegetarion Mumbo Jumbo and the weird I Live In A Cake. It does have its weak points like towards the end it kind of sucks and the songs Freedumb and Sloppy English just aren't that good. I'd reccommend this if you have/like S&M Airlines or Ribbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst NOFX Album","review":"I really hated this CD, none of the songs on it are any good.

I guess this would be for \\"die hard fans\\" only..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was NOFX before they learned to sing or play guitar","review":"I think that \\"Liberal Animation\\" was more of an album attempt than an album. You should only buy this album if you are really harcore punk rocker. It doesn't sound nearly as good as \\"Punk in Drublic\\" or \\"Ribbed\\". It's really a dissapointment, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not one for you new fans...","review":"I've been a hardcore NOFX fan since like 1994, and I know that makes me relatively new, but to all the kids out there looking to add NOFX to their collection, this is not the one to start with. This being their first album, it kinda sux compared to their others. I bought it after having listened to and loved punk in drublic, heavy petting zoo, and white trash... My advice is to pick up one of those discs first. This one struggles because it is pre-jefe, and fat mike can't quite sing yet. The vocals aren't harmonious like the later albums, but it is is a decent punk album. only later when I look back, do I see its importance. Avoid this one, unless you're totally hardcore, then you might kinda like it. Start it off with Punk in Drublic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"this was one of nofx's first albums and it is not very good. it's kind of [bad] actually. i never thought i would say this about a nofx album but it is very harsh on the ears.mike hadn't developed the skill of singing on this album and some of it is bordering on thrash. there are still some excellent riffs lurking around but the drums have to much reverb on them. it is high speed stuff but there is little melody or phrase structure.this album was before the masterful musician el hefe joined the band so there is no trumpet, no whiny guitars and generally no variation. this was the old style nofx before mike and co. discovered there new sound with high pitched backing vocals accompanied by the odd scream.this is one for the nofx purist only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"I read this book for my children's literature class.

This is because, I think, Dr.Grove puts a great importance on process technology and I never read this book again and again without finding something new and important in the chapter 1,2,3 on the solid state technology.This book is worth while buying and , I recommend that semiconductor-bound students should study this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This was a great book which expanded my knowledge of the T.V. production and industry.

The rocking guitars continue until the verse/chorus, when the words become intelligible. The lyrics are basic emo lyrics and the softer, melodic guitar sounds great. As the cd progresses, the band generally keeps up with their heavy guitar and lyrics, with the breaks for melodic singing. On a few tracks, such as Infinity Road and One Season Too Late, the band adopts a Spanish sounding guitar. All in all, the cd is a great rocking album, with the exception of One Season Too Late, which is their attempt at acoustic softer style. Frankly, they fail.

It makes you want to draw out all the Pok��mons and make you go Pictionary Pok��mon, or just belch out all the Pok��mon is alphabetical order. It is kind of more Japanese and true to the form of making it more for children than the ones on TV, where Ash looks like a beef up version of Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was a teen and with a mouse for a pet. If you could bear in mind, imagine it. Also, it makes Pikachu so much more cuter than Ash, which was what I like to see. Though, in the book, it seemed to cool the idea that Pok��mon could be animals we have on our planet, but more of the imaginary animals we come up with. So, it is a little fluffy. And more twisted that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish you can put a billion stars.","review":"A friend gave me this book for my birthday.

However, was I ever surprised! It was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter piled high and properly melted it was on a par with ambrosia. I just could not believe how good it was and is. Since the first loaf, I have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread. It is REALLY good! Perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine! Highly recommended!!! GENERAL INFO: The package makes a 1.5 pound loaf.

In this book, Dr. Shapiro describes how to communicate with children from infancy to the teen years. He also teaches you how to use emotional literacy games to help and communicate with children. The games, activities, and techniques are geared to be age-appropriate for infants, school-aged children, pre-teens, and teens. This book is perfect for parents or teachers who want to communicate better with their children or to help their children to improve their social skills. I am very impressed with Dr. Shapiro's work. I plan to purchase his Emotional Literacy storybooks for my classroom library."},{"rating":"2","title":"good \\"how to\\" book","review":"The author discusses the importance of emotional intelligence in social interaction. Emotions are conveyed primarily through body language, facial expressions, voice tone, etc. This book explains and provides examples for adults to communicate with children (from infant to teenager) through methods pertinent to understanding and displaying emotions. The author proposes 4 ways to communicate better: playing, story-telling, art activities, and use of body language/voice. Good book overall. Needs to fix some typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"The nail in the coffin","review":"After BR started to add a little variety (Against The Grain - their best, IMHO) to the onslaught (Suffer, No Control), they put out this tepid album which begins a succesion of boring, formulaic punk albums with decent lyrics.

I heard a lot of good things about BR and I picked this CD up at random. Music should be interesting listening, but this album just seemed to contain several version of the same 2 or 3 songs. I listened to it a couple of times and then sold it. I just didn't care about the way they were trying to meld the music and lyrics together. Maybe I should've tried another BR album first, who knows. I'd rather spend money on classic punk rock like the Damned or the Clash or newer power pop masters like China Drum..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Bad Religion album I ever bought.","review":"I can't really even remember what it sounded like. I just remember thinking, \\"This sounds like they're trying pretty hard to sound different than they ususally do.\\" I like it when bands change and grow and evolve, but that wasn't the impression this album gave me. It seemed forced and contrived. Once in a while I'll hear a new BR song on the radio, and have no regrets that I'm no longer listening to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the generator","review":"What can be said about this CD that already hasn't been said? This is one of the greatest albums in (almost) recent punk history. From beginning to end, Bad Religion kicks serious ass on this album. I love every song more than the next and less than the one before it. As always, their lyrics are very political and directed at a treacherous government (ours), religious views (Christians), and trying to understand the meaning of life and answers to why we're here. Sounds like everything out today and everything before it, but Bad Religion makes it sound extremely f*cking awesome. Greg Graffin is one of the best vocalists out today as well as when this album was launched and his lyrics are very inspiring and motivating. This album should not be passed up by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a rock, Like a planet...","review":"Just like most BR cd's, Generator is full of classic songs such as Generator and Only Entertainment. This album is not as complete as The Gray Race, Recipe for Hate, Against the Grain, or The Process of Belief, but it is still worth every penny. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Entertainment","review":"Bad Religion did a great job with this album. People say there is always ups and downs-well this album was written without downs. The entire album is great. Delivering a strong political message,Generator is definatly on my top five favorite Bad Religion albums. If you like Generator then you'll probaly like the album \\"No Substance\\". In my oppinion,you havn't actually HEARD BAd Religion untill you have all the albums. There all different because the band improves with writing skills and music. Look for there new CD feburary 2002,\\"The Process of Belief\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"great experimental album","review":"definately their darkest album ever released on epitaph records. the song generator is amazing. i also love \\"tomorrow\\" and \\"heaven is falling.\\" atomic garden is good, but overrated. this is the album where you can start to see a huge changeup from the previous. not only did they gain bobby as drummer, but the album is less and less of the straight forward punk agression found on suffer, no control and against the grain. the lyrics also take a stance on war and human condition instead of the whole scientific and anti-religion ways of the previous albums. this was defiantely to the gulf war of the early 90's as empire strikes first is to taking a stand on today's invasions of iraq.many people consider this the top bad religion album. i think its really good, but for me it is one of the middle ground ones. i may put it equal with stranger than fiction if im in a \\"generator\\" mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly, Truly Amazing","review":"This is Bad Religion's darkest, bleakest and best album. Oh yes, people will tell you Suffer this, and against the Grain that, and in truth those are both excellent albums, but Generator is just better. Highlights include the title track, the sheer brilliance of Heaven is Falling, the blistering Fertile Crescent, and the sneering, cynical pop song \\"Only Entertainment\\" which, along with Heaven is Falling, is my favourite track on the album. This band, along with the mighty Social Distortion, revolutionized American punk, and so you owe it to yourself to sit down and check this, their best album, out."},{"rating":"2","title":"the 1st down by law record...","review":"is one of the best records you can buy.smalley sounds great and the songs are very strong.great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the show was cancelled...","review":"Parallel Time, is the longest, most boring phase of DS. Now I understand why people raved about \\"The Leviathans\\". That was the end of quality. I love the show & have seen 800 episodes, but in truth the 1st year with Barnabas is the best. While this show excelled on witches, warlocks, ghosts & vampires, it really stank on Frankenstein, bride of Frankenstein, the wolfman, and in this phase, Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde. Jonathan Frid is often MIA in these episodes (understandably), & Angelique seems to be reprising her role from years earlier, without conviction. Selby/Quentin may have had roguish charm when he was introduced as a quasi-bad guy, but at this point he seems to be on Prozac & Valium. I'll watch the series 'til the end, but when I return to see DS again I'll stick to the first 7 collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"three thumbs up","review":"this is by far one of the greatest bad religion albums to date if you own it and enjoy it be sure to buy suffer and no control"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the classics","review":"This is Bad Religion in their prime.

Against The Grain is a well made CD by Bad Religion. My favorite track on the CD is Faith Alone, but I think all of the songs are pretty decent. The group is definitely old, but you wouldn't know because their music never gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Religion at their finest!","review":"This cd is simply amazing. Of course, if you don't like Bad Religion's style, you probably won't like ths cd. The tracks are a tad short, as is the case with most of these cds, but, the cd is a great one overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to bad but got great","review":"This is a good BR album but it isnt as good as no control. I only dislike one song on No control but this album has quite a few bad ones. Blenderhead and the positve aspect of negative thinking being two of them.

But the more I listened to it, the more the spirit ministered to me. I've had this CD for about 2 1/2 years and there are songs that still bring me to tears such as \\"We don't have to cry\\", \\"I can't stop thinkin' about you,\\" and my favorite, number 3,\\"I will be there\\". I also read an interview of the group refering to \\"Brothers\\". I believe all or most members in the group play instruments and wanted to do something different and new. Most people are used to Take 6 singing without instruments because they don't need them. I personally prefer acappella over their instrumental songs, but I still like the \\"Brothers\\" CD. It's all in one's taste. There are many songs on this CD that have ministered to me, thank God. The harmony is still there too! I didn't even know that \\"Do Right\\" is mostly acappella until one day I realized that was not a bass instrument, but the bass singer. That's another songs that can bring me to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...............?","review":"What can I say? It did not work. I have been and always will be a fan of Take 6 and of freedom of expression. But my motto is \\"If it ain't broke, don't try and fix it\\". This album was attempting to make a stronger mark on the charts. But what happend instead was total humiliation. The vocal harmonies, that set these 6 young men apart, were lost in the mediocre musical orchestrations. I was very disapointed when I listened to the album; I felt betrayed. Not even Brian McKnight, Claude's brother, could retrieve this lost cause. If you are a fan, this album will be one of those you say \\"What were You Thinking\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious Attempt at commercialization","review":"This was an obvious attempt to try hitting the pop charts.

The CD is very noisy. There's a lot of surface noise on this CD and it overshadows the bass. Although the original vinyl disc may have been of audiophile quality this remastering isn't. There is no original art work, just adds for other Essential Media products. There are no track times, credits, liner notes or total playing time.

Francie had a hard time, yet she somehow always ended up on the bright side of things. She lived in the Newcastle area -- a place that well earned its rough & tumble reputation -- and she out-maneuvered or out-smarted everybody that took her on. Despite her need to fight to survive, somehow she remained a person who you'd probably like to have known. She did not go looking for trouble; she just stood up for herself when she had to. I am glad this biography was written, and I wish it would become better known."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pirates made!","review":"Wonderful pirate play fueled by imagination! The size is just right for a play pirate ship, as well as for small hands. The colors are bright (without being garish-cheap looking), and the attention to detail is nicely done. Accidentally left outside in rain, mud and hot sun, this figure, as well as the other Papo Pirate Figures, have cleaned up to resume play looking like new! And they never have a problem standing! The only problem I had with this gift box is figuring out exactly what pirates were included. It's hard to tell with the package being at an angle.

As a big fan of the show I was hoping to get a whole new perspective on the charactors and the show. Since the show does practically no development of the charactors' personal life I was desperate to read about them. Unfortunately there was very little here. Any future books would be so much more interesting if this was included.What the book did expose were the various thoughts of the charactors as they reacted to different situations. The instance when the suspect is caught by Serena staring at her legs and how she uses it later in the book is a perfect example.Here's to more Law & Order books but with more exploration of the lives of Greene, McCoy and Southerlyn.

This book is a rejection of simplistic idealism and romanticism. Nietzsche comes into his own with this book, which is his first major philosophical work. The writing is not quite so strident as in his later texts, so this book will appeal to those who appreciate Nietzsche but sometimes wish for a toned down version of Zarathustra or The Anti-Christ. The book contains opinions an almost every subject under the Sun. If you never read this book, you will be shocked, amazed, and intrigued at Nietzsche's opinions on marriage, education, socialism, nationalism, public affairs, and the Church. This book will make you think, reevaluate received wisdom, and will, probably, make you want to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, but...","review":"This is a very useful reference work on Book IX of Martial's Epigrams; however, please note that THIS IS A TWO-PART work; when I ordered it I only received one of the parts, commentary on only part of Book IX.

He was such an important person for Christian rock music. If you don't belive it - you must listen to rockin' tracks like \\"The Rock That Doesn't Roll\\" and \\"I've Searched All Around\\". Although this is the least good of The Trilogy - it has many memorable moments, such as \\"Six Sixty Six\\", \\"U.F.O.\\", \\"I Am a Servant\\", and \\"If God Is My Father\\". Also the new version of the classic \\"Why Don't You Look Into Jesus\\" is great. Unfortunately, many of the songs are too short - I mean the songs like \\"Diamonds\\" and \\"Hymn To The Last Generation\\" - they seem to end before they really start. But still - Larry's lyrics are touching and his voice was brilliant in these albums - the albums still rule the Christian rock music.Stars: The Rock That Doesn't Roll, Six Sixty Six, U.F.O."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to classical music","review":"This CD uses very funny conversations between Elmo, Big Bird and the Birdapest symphony orchestra to introduce famous classical tunes. My 3 year old loves the conversations; my 7 year old can now hum all these classical tunes and know which composer wrote them. The conversations ask the kids to imagine certain things according to the tunes, so they can appreciate the music a whole lot more. My 7 year old actually asks for classical radio stations in the car! I think it's a masterpiece, to introduce classical music in a fun and interactive way to kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun music for classical interests","review":"We have enjoyed this music. Good for introducing classical music to preschool ages. Fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for your collection!","review":"I also wish the pieces could have been longer, but I do like the way they talk about classes of instruments (like brass and percussion), and play excerpts of pieces that feature those intstruments. They also make sure to mention the composer before his piece is played. Elmo and Big Bird also find out how different classical pieces can make us think of different scenes, describe something like a bumblebee, make us feel a certain way (like Brahms' Lullaby), or get our feet moving. The music is fun and exciting, and is a wonderful way to introduce classical music if it hasn't been a part of your collection. Hey, it's great even if you DO play a lot of classical music in your house! We find it really exciting BECAUSE our daughters have heard this music before. (And mommy and daddy like it, too!)

There are only two sub-par songs on \\"Recipe\\", and one mediocre one.The weak ones, \\"Man With A Mission\\" and \\"Don't Pray on Me\\" are skippable, and the mediocre one, \\"Kerosene\\", is listenable, to a degree. The rest of the songs are incredible. \\"American Jesus\\", \\"Recipe for Hate\\", \\" Modern Day Catastrophists,\\" and \\"Skyscraper\\" are the best, but there a bunch of other awesome ones. Pick this CD up; it is cheap, and definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read This","review":"After reading all of the other reviews posted, I,m going going to have to disagree with pretty much all of them. This albumn lacks emotion. Sure there are a few good tracks lick Recipe for Hate and American Jesus, but the rest of the albumn sounds like cuts they recorded just to fill up space. I can't listen to it. Yeah the lyrics are politically concious but aren't all BR's albumns? My suggestion is to pick up Against the Grain."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is it with you people?","review":"American Jesus is a great song, but...compared to Generator or Skyscraper (Bad Religion's crowning musical achievement) it is PALE.

Recipe for Hate is BR at the height of thier game, equal parts thought provoking diatribes, political rants and earth shaking punk rock music, this is what these fellas do best! If you are into Bad Religion you are into this CD, you just don't know it yet. Best tracks: Kerosene, Skyscraper, and American Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic and Relevant","review":"I am not much into punk. But, if there ever was an institution in punk, it would be Bad Religion. Their music is incredibly powerful and melodic, but not \\"poppy\\" melodic a'la Green Day. Their melodies are more ominous, a bit dark. The lyrics are obviously very important for them, too. Their music, being punk, is not virtuoso music, and that is just the point. Simple, like a punch in the face, and the effect is exhilarating. I have this one cd of them only, although I've heard others. But, like I said, I am not heavily into punk. I love the Sex Pistols,The Ramones, Fugazi, Descendants, Pennywise, Black Flag, and a bit of Green Day, but that's about it. Bad Religion is an institution in punk, because they've been very consistent and they've been around a long time, and always true to their vision. Punk was never dead. Just ask Bad Religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but close","review":"This isn't the best Bad Religion album, but it's pretty close. All the songs are good, but some just aren't that memorable and sound a little repetitive to me after a while. There's a lot of good songs here though; my favorites are \\"Recipe for Hate\\", \\"Kerosene\\", \\"American Jesus\\", \\"Watch it Die\\", and \\"Don't Pray on me.\\"This is a good album if you are a Bad Religion fan, and a pretty decent introduction to the band. However, I recommend Generator, Stranger than Fiction, and 80-85 over this. Still pretty darn good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I would say this is my favorite BR album as a whole but I can't. It has some of my favorite songs on it (American Jesus, Looking In, My Poor Friend Me, etc) but I dont listen to the entire album so it as a whole isnt their best. I don't like Keroscene at all, and that's the only BR song I dont enjoy. But still, even with a few songs I skip, the cd is great. I listen to it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"BR's most mature album","review":"Recipe represented the peak of Bad Religion's experimentation with the formula laid out on Suffer before the lapse into formulaic songwriting on Stranger than Fiction. It's the most melodic of their peak-era records, and holds up as their most complete album. It would have been interesting to see where BR would be musically today had they further pursued some of the ideas on this album-- to some extent, 2010's Dissent of Man echoed Recipe's broadened musical palette, but not to the same extent or with the same confidence. Not their last good album, but certainly their last essential album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for us","review":"My husband has terribly oily skin and we were using Neutrogena oil face wash (which worked amazingly well!) but they stopped selling it, so we tried this.

I don't think you can ever just rely on one thing, let alone a cleanser, to keep oily skin under control, though. (At least from my personal experience) But the cleanser does a good job and it's not expensive like some other things.

I figured I'd stick with it though for a few weeks to really give it a fair shot. Unfortunately, no change. I know everyones skin is different, but for me this product was awful.

I've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth. I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the boxone of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch. a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but brownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good healthy dessert but needs work","review":"These brownies are good, but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off.

She also doesn't focus much on memorization, but understanding. The sample questions are very good and the answers give you a very good understanding.After successfully passing mock exams, I tried the mock exam included on the CD with the KIM Heldman book. The questions were very lengthy and difficult to read (worse than the real PMP exam) and I didn't manage to get a good score on this mock exam - which was really bad for my confidence close to the exam.

I agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is somewhat bitter and compared to (at least what I remember of) real muffins with sugar, gluten, eggs, butter, and that other good stuff they are quite fine.I do not eat gluten, derivatives of sugar cane, eggs, soy, dairy, corn . . . I could go on but you get the idea. In order to use this mix I had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me. Aside from the fact that I don't have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch, the best thing about these muffins is the texture. Texture is a challenge absent gluten, sugar, and eggs, and I found this to be very much like how I remember muffins. The bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly so.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty","review":"If I could, I would give it zero stars.

After we see the lives of Alan, Lauren, and Sam (even baby Grace) start to unravel because of Michael McClelland's antics, the book becomes more than a page turner. This is especially true once the pieces begin to fall into place and the finely-spun web Stephen White puts together in this story is revealed.I highly recommend Dry Ice to anyone who likes Stephen White and to anyone who likes a well-written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry Ice","review":"I did enjoy this latest Alan Gregory novel, but as others have mentioned, it to was hard for me to sympathize with his character on this go round. This was not Whites best novel, and it had a few dry areas, but overall he provides an entertaining story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen White Does it again!","review":"An Alan Gregory novel with a twist-this time he brings back a villain. Dr. White writes such rich character development that you cant help but care about each and every character. You are finally treated to a view of Alan's past that shows his human side; a side Alan would like kept secret. You are in for another rollercoaster of a ride as once again Dr. White takes you to some of the most beautiful locations in Colorado. Enjoy the ride! A must read! I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Alan Gregory's mind...","review":"I'm a fan of Stephen White's novels and thought it was time for an update on all the characters we know in Dr. Gregory's life! This makes us think about the power of secrets and as always, I couldn't put the book down but read with discretion to make the book last longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well done!","review":"I loved it. A bit confusing with all of the names but well done. Stephen White is not kind to the reader, I appreciate this. He kills off beloved characters, not just the homeless and unconnected. He gives the reader a chance to grieve along with his characters.Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & Highly Unbelievable","review":"This book was a waste of my time & money. Characters kept being introduced at random throughtout the read. They were there only to explain the unexplainable and boring plot. I was really turned off by this book. A high school sophmore could have penned something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?","review":"I am a fan of stephen white but I got lost in the middle of the story and never found my way back. Someone please tell me what this book was about."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back","review":"This is Stephen White/Alan Gregory at their very best. When Stephen White writes about his core group--all of whom are in this clever thriller--he can not be beaten! I have not enjoyed the books about other characters so much, and was thrilled that Alan Gregory and the other Colorado residents are dealt with here in detail. The characters evolve and we a myriad of complex dimensions. Never a dull moment. Every character is a real human, and each one is threatened. You will feel threatened yourself before the book is done. What secrets are you hiding? :) DRY ICE, from beginning to end, is perfect. Well, I actually did not like the Prologue, but I'm not a fan of prologues. Don't let that stop you. Book is perfect! The title is explained, and you will never look at dry ice the same again. THE REAL master of the psychological thriller IS Stephen White!!! I hope he won't stay away from his core group for long again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry Ice","review":"I've read all the books in this series and this is the second book that is really not good. The premise of the book is good but out of 500 pages about 250 are about the angst of Alan Gregory...move on...get a life. I used to enjoy these but no more. I'm hoping that with The Siego and Sam Purdy we get back to a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love all of Stephen White's stories, while they all differ you get the same excitement. Great read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I've enjoyed every one of Stephen White's thrillers and found DRY ICE to be one of his best! Knowing the book would reprise the Michael McClelland character from White's first book (PRIVILEGED INFORMATION), I read it again and found it just as entertaining and suspenseful as the first time I read it. Now, with DRY ICE, I thought there wouldn't be any surprises, but I was wrong. Just when I thought I had it figured out, a new plot twist came along, adding intrigue. After so many years, I feel as if the main characters are part of my family, evolving as they face new challenges. I look forward to what the future holds in store for Dr. Alan Gregory, et al."},{"rating":"1","title":"He needs a couch!","review":"What happened to the doc.

Kill ME was wondeful its downhill from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for the Classroom","review":"I am a classroom teacher. I read this book in a course as part of my Masters in Education program. It has a lot of practical advice for busy classroom teachers.

Good investment- definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"TEACHERS!!","review":"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE CONCEPT OF \\"THE INCLUSIVECLASSROOM\\"!! IT IS QUITE HELPFUL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the X-Files fanatic","review":"A thoroughly well researched book. I found a few of the nit-picks a bit too trivial for my liking, but on the whole I found this book to be well worth the reading time.One inaccuracy I did find was when the author mentioned that a computer can't turn itself on when the phone rings (this happened to Scully in \\"Ghost In The Machine\\"). I guess he's never heard of a PC with wake-on-ring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It!","review":"While I don't like to trash another musician's work, I must say in all honesty that this CD is neither worth the $16 or the two to three week wait. In hindsight, I wished I had heeded the warnings of \\"raw analog recordings\\" and \\"never before released tracks,\\" Generally, those are code words for noisy, inconsistent and otherwise poor sound quality not otherwise suitable for release. In some instances, the quality of this CD is lower than some bootlegs. This CD fits the rule that if the songs are good enough to be released they would have been, long ago. The crowd's chatter and idle conversation during the performance are very audible and distracting. Moreover, the sound quality varies from track to track due in part to the fact that the CD picks up songs recorded at different times and in different places. Jim Bott, apparently needing a buck, lists his telephone number on the back as 1-800-BUY-MY-CD. I gave him $16. Don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the timid","review":"It is a great book for doing the most simple ofGUI tasks and for a reference once you have been usingTkinter for an extended period of time. The book leaves outkey definitions when they are most needed, isn't organizedwell and generally falls short when you really start gettinginterested. Don't get this book if you are trying translateother GUI skills to Tkinter. It is good for learning theabsolute basics and as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of info, poorly presented!","review":"I find that the author is out of touch with how to present material. He's already tackling a 'calculator' application by page 22. Quite a jump! He should have consulted with someone more experienced in material presentation for someone learning and/or trying to tie concepts together.By starting with basics in the early going, it would have made understanding a little easier in the more complex examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Book for all, Terrible for beginners","review":"This book starts off with classes, with no set introduction for them. Even though I am very proficient in C++ and Java, this book is very confusing and disorganized compared to others. However, it does include a good deal of information about Tkinter widgets. Since this is the only book available, it will have to suffice. Check, out the example from the website, phone.py, which is not even a program, but an email! How rediculous is that? Grayson claims to be some great programmer but can't even edit his own emails and examples!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the beginner","review":"As a complete novice GUI programmer (but with some Python experience) I found this book to be essentially useless. The beginning examples use classes for which there is no explanation, and it only gets worse. The book does not proceed in any organized manner. After hours of floundering, I have decided to abandon Tkinter programming until a better book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written book, badly written examples","review":"This is the only book on the subject. Thus, if you want to make Tkinter interfaces, you have to buy it. The book is unfortunatly, awful. It is disorganised, it glosses over important points, the code examples are poor (either there isn't enough of them to actually run, or they are so long as to be silly.), and many things just aren't explained. Mr. Grayson, unfortunatly wants to spend more time quoting Monty Python, then teaching Tkinter in any sort of step by step manner. (a side note, after flipping pages for hours in a vain attempt to find information in this book, Monty Python quotes are not very funny anymore.) While Python is easier than Java, Java Swing with a good IDE (like JBulilder or Forte) is easier than Python Tkinter. This book sets Python's future and usefulness back a few steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Both seasons came, and both are great quality! :) Though it did take a little longer to get here than it should have...but still--no problems whatsoever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Packaging for a Great Series","review":"The packaging of this series is fantastic. I have only opened season 1, but I assume season 2 is much the same. The packaging is comprised of an outer paper sleeve, inner transparent plastic case, booklet and discs. The booklet details a summary of each episode with pictures to reference. I must say the plastic dividers that hold all of the discs in place are very well designed to hold everything in place. There should be no scratches on the discs, provided you handle them delicately. This is a quality set that will provide hours of entertainment. You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch For ALL","review":"I fell in love with this show by accident, I would watch it when I got off work, while I waited for my husband to come home, I instantly became an addict and bought seasons 1-2, and have gotten my husband and step-mom just as addicted! This show appeals to all audiances and is just so fun to watch and relate to! A MUST HAVE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable!","review":"There hasn't been a good quality V.C. Andrews book since she died, WOW! Imagine that! But, who'd expect a dead woman to come with an original storyline? I don't really know why I keep reading them. Why doesn't Mr. Ghostwriter, write his OWN books under his OWN name. Let the poor woman die."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"This was the first book I'd ever read by VC Andrews and I don't care if it IS a ghost writer, I still like the books. I could definetly identify with Olivia, but I also think that she was too cold. I was embarrased for her in certain parts, and been frightened of her, too. She is such a three dimensional character, and I want to know more about her and her family. I've ordered the rest of the Logan family series, just to see what happened before and what will happen in the future! Definetly a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrill!","review":"This novel is all about sweet Olivia and how she ended up a Madam of her Cape Cod house. Ooh she got what she wanted!!! That's what a REAL diva does!!!This is by far the most shocking yet satisfying book of the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Big Disappointment","review":"Okay, I waited, like a whole year for this book to come out. I thought that once it came out, you would find out everything, all the secrets Melody was looking for, all the good stuff. So I bought it and for what? Some cold, impractical witch who won't sleep with her own husband, hell they have seperate bedrooms and she keeps it locked all the time, but wants to sleep with some guy whom she had a chance to be wiht but blew it. The least they could have done was describe Hallie, Kenneth, Jacob, and Chester's childhood. The only thing that would make up for the Logan series would be having a book about Hallie, or even Chester. Hey they need a book narrated from a guy, not jsut a girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"For die hard fans only","review":"I started reading V.C. Andrews books with the Flowers in the Attic series. I continue to read the new novels that come out, even though they are not as good as the ones Virginia wrote herself. I liked \\"Olivia\\"- it entertained me. Besides Olivia, the characters weren't very developed. Olivia was cold, it was hard to feel anything for her after reading the previous books in the series. If you are a V.C. Andrews fan, I would recommend reading this book because it is the closest you can get to the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old V.C. Andrew's is back!","review":"This book was more of the V.C. Andrews I remember. I have been a fan of V.C. Andrews for almost 20 years and have collected each of her books. After reading her last series I was considering not buying another one of her novels. \\"Olivia\\" has changed my mind and I will still consider myself a fan if the writers keep up with this caliber of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't in the same class as other VC Andrews books","review":"The most recent novel in the logan sega was a real bore. In the past. this series has been full of the smutt that is VC Andrews. I found you last novel to be directed towards a preteen audience rather than a tashy adult novel. I hope if she continues this series the next book will have more of the gushy smut that we love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olivia not justified","review":"Usually these books in the series try to justify the so called 'bad' person in previous stories. Most of the time I end up understanding the 'evil' characters bitterness. But not in this case. Olivia was bitter and cold in the beginning. And she stayed that way from begining to end. I give her no reason for doing the wicked things in her later life. What a WITCH! I would've rather have seen a book about Haille."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOS - SAME OLD STORY. ANOTHER TIRED OLIVIA","review":"Olivia is a bitter woman, fiercely jealous of her younger sister, who is favored. The sister is flighty, infantile and has no common sense. Olivia overcompensates by becoming a starched martinet with a lump of coal for a heart and iodine for blood. Like the Dollanganger brood, the Logan clan also has their cross to bear named Olivia. Questionable paternity, bitterness between sisters and the same old tired fare that readers have come to expect from V.C. Andrews. This is just more of the same tired formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too late in coming and not exciting when it got here.","review":"It is already hard enough to wait through four novels before you get to find out what happened in the very begining but to have to wait through a whole other series is pathetic. I completely forgot about the Logan series and it wasn't until I was already reading the book that I realized that this one was a follow up. It was really hard to enjoy because as time goes on and you've read more series containing more characters you forget all of the details you need to know to understand what is going on in this book. You can imagine the surprise when after thinking that this was a new series that it turned out to be end of an old series. I wouldn't recommend releasing a new series then releasing an end to an old one. Like most people who have read the new ghost written VC Andrews novels I think they all have the same basic plot with different character names and wording. Please try something different or let Ms. Andrews rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"How very NOT V. C. Andrews","review":"Well, I think with this book, I will take V. C. Andrews off my books-to-buy list. I don't even know if I'll bother picking up another one, but if I do, it will be just to skim it (I've barely read any of the last few anyway).This is NOT V. C. Andrews. Olivia Logan did not have such a horrible life; not the best, but not as bad as past Andrew's characters. Anything of interest (such as the the still born baby) only got a few pages of text. Where did the horror go? Remember children locked away in an attic or a family torn apart when a father sold his children? Now those are horrible lives which no one would want to live. That's what V. C. Andrews used to be, right up until this series and the Orphans series. I only hope that the people involved in producing these *V. C. Andrews* books will let her rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"There are a lot of things that bothered me about this book, the biggest thing being the author not keeping within the correct time period. When was this supposed to have taken place? Surely Olivia wouldn't have been watching television on a regular basis, being two generations ahead of Melody. And on page 322 (paperback), Belinda mentions possibly getting an abortion. What? Abortion wasn't even legal back then! Ever hear of Roe Vs Wade, which took place in the early 1970s? I found it hard to sympathize with Olivia. At times, she was pretty mean. I actually felt sorry for Samuel, at times, I even felt sorry for Belinda. Just what was the author trying to accomplish here? A book about Haille would definitely have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I started reading VC Andrews books when I was in high school. I was totally facinated with the style of writing that she used in her books, but the series that have come out after the Casteel series seem to be stuck in one pattern and are too predictable. If you look at the plots between the Heaven series, My Sweet Audrina, and the Flowers in the Attic Series, They are completely different, and the last book in the series always answered all the question you had plus a few you didn't think of! The ghostwriter needs to get some new ideas or stop writing all together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish V.C. Andrews was still alive!","review":"The author that took over for V.C. Andrews has totally lost the V.C. Andrews style and technique as far as her writing went. I found Olivia boring and hard to stay with. For the most part, I thought the series was too broken up, with the telling of Melody, Laura, and now Olivia... I hope the new author sees this and gets w/ the program! As far as the Runaway seriesand the new Misty book - get a life whats w/ the 149 page books? Plus you get to read the Prolog to the next book, which after your finished w/ that, you've about read half of the next book!!! I have read everything V.C.

Thank you for listening - Sandi"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all","review":"I have read every single book that VC Andrews has written, but I don't think that I am going to be reading anymore of her work.

I liked the format of everything written in the first person-i.e. each of the four characters writes a narrative. The plot ended up being a little thin and the ending was a let down.My biggest objection was the multiple uses of the word \\"sucks\\" and at least one \\"freaking\\" (as a substitute for the \\"F\\" word). Maybe it's acceptable for teens to use these words on a regular basis but I didn't feel it was appropriate for a 9 year old. I discontinued this book with my kids after 2 chapters for this reason. Call me old fashioned but I just thought other parents might like to know the content.As other reviewers have mentioned, the treatment of the war was a little much for this age as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"CGE Student Review","review":"The title of my favorite book is, The Homework Machine by Dan Gutman. He also wrote Mrs. Patty is Batty, and The Get Rich Quick Club. The lesson of this book is to yell out to the people that cheating never does the work for you so don't cheat on anything. The book is fictional.I guess the author likes making the books fascinating because he makes it sound like a real life story of a couple of kids. In the story the friends are Breton, Judy, Sam, Kelsey, Cops, and all the moms.The book is about kids that keep getting in trouble at there foster home and the first day of school comes. If you like fascinating and sneaky books then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"Dan Gutman writes a story about something every kid dreams of (a homework machine) and makes it into an astonishingly excellent book!

They start to become friends and call themselves the \\"D Squad\\"; that results in Brenton telling his darkest secret: the homework machine.

This dvd is seriously like 30 minutes of crude sex jokes and like 20 minutes of stupid banter i.e. Dane's interviews. It was way too short and, surprisingly, not very funny. I was actually glad that we weren't able to see him live after watching this because it would have been a huge waste of money. I'm not trying to be a hater I usually really enjoy his work.

The singers have the dopiest voices around (after the cast of JoJo's Circus) and they sing the mostsaccharin sweet lyrics! Who in the right mind would want to listen to this all day? Only an idiot. This album is more stupidthan the TV show and it has oh-so stupid lyrics.

The show LazyTown is actually a show worth watching for my age (10), for unlike most preschool shows, it is somewhatmature for older viewers (like me), but the songs I cannot stand! The lyrics to each song are about something stupid or thelyrics wouldn't go together well in a good song such as \\"work together, friends forever.\\" Plus, the voices of each character could wake up the dead and they are just plain nasally, like JoJo from the Playhouse Disney. And what's with \\"Bing Bang\\" going off in every episode? I mean, the episodes are not about dancing, and the song is. And that's supposed to be an end theme? The most nasally voice of them all is the girl playing Stephanie. Also, I don't know why the show is called LazyTown,cause (1) that's a stupid name and (2) no one's lazy there, also.

The more ballet classes I take, the more I realize how well this book distills the important aspects of ballet. Sketches and photos showing correct (and incorrect) body positioning are appropriately used. When I started ballet, I picked up a handful of books, and I always reached for this one when I had 10 minutes to learn a new tidbit. The brief history of ballet in the final chapter is added bonus. If you're an adult beginner, start with this book and the David Howard videos, plus a good teacher once or twice a week. You won't be auditioning for the American Ballet Theatre, but you'll become a proficient dancer pretty quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wild Wild West Complete Series","review":"I liked the fun packaging, and the entire series in one handy box.

Ever single disc has scratches ranging from minute to \\"I wonder if this will actually play in my dvd player?\\" I can't believe the morons who came up with the design...I'm sure they aren't into collecting movies or they would have never conceived such a cheap idea. They aren't even in protective sleeves. They sit in small compartment which covers about 2/3 of the discs leaving the tops to carelessly scrape against one another.I thought about returning them but figure I could end up with a set in worse condition. I generally burn all of my movies to discs and play them while leaving the originals on my dvd shelf. I just hope there isn't one or two discs that are completely damaged and cannot be copied.Great series (4 stars in my opinion) and looking forward to watching it again, but the packaging is absolutely horrendous."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll end up returning the product. . . .","review":"Enjoyed the Wild Wild West on t.v. so when it came out I wanted to purchase this set for my boyfriend; however the DVDs were just stacked on top of each other and they arrived all scratched.

The 20+ discs are packaged in 2 card stock containers that look like little saddle bags but only have thick paper seperation half way up the discs so the entire top half of all the discs make contact with each other and loose spacing makes any movement friction mare the other disc. It may look good to some but expect most discs to be scratched, many will have skips and in our case they were all dirty and sticky.This seller has known of these problems but keeps selling this set as \\"New\\", this box set should be pulled from stock and returned to the studios or sold as \\"Acceptable\\" condition with a full disclaimer of all the known problems.

There is something for everybody and it all meshes together seamlessly. The show was very creative and clever. Robert Conrad and Ross Martin do their best work here as Jim West and Artemus Gordon, two secret agents traveling by train in the wild, wild, west. The show was still running strong when it was cancelled in its fourth season for excessive violence (actually it was pretty mild by today's standards so don't let that stop you from buying this collection). Because of its premature cancellation, it never had the chance to deteriorate which makes all the episodes worth watching. The two reunion movies that followed this series are more about the humor but they are still worth watching as Conrad and Martin pick up right where they left off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fair to loyal season purchasers","review":"I totally agree with Howie in the above review. On its own the complete series set would rate 5 stars but as a present owner of all four season sets, I find it unfair that I am expected to repurchase the whole set again just to get the two additional reunion movies. It would be great if Paramount would make these movies available to present season set owners with proof of purchase from the current set cases or at the very least allow us to purchase them, preferably at a budget price. You know most loyal Wild Wild West fans like myself have already purchased most if not all four seasons already and would have jumped at the chance to purchase the complete set had it been available from the begining.To anyone who has not yet purchased the individual season sets, The complete series is a fantastic set and with the two reunion movies,cool looking case and a great price from Amazon, its a deal that cant be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loyal Fans Get Shaft","review":"I bought each season as it came out on the day it was released. My reward for that? Getting the shaft by not being able to purchase the reunion movies separately. You always hear from the studios - \\"if sales are good on these releases then we'll come out with the next season, etc.\\" Well -loyal fans showed there was a demand and now we're expected to re-buy everything with the carrot of the two reunion movies. Sorry but I'm not getting ripped off that way. Listen up studios - don't bite the hand that feeds you or we'll simply stop buying your product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dissatified customer","review":"An excellent series, but I'm extremely annoyed that after supporting the studio by buying the individual season sets as they came out I'm going to have to buy the complete series set if I want to get the two post-series movies. As other reviewers have pointed out, the studios keep saying that they depend on sales of season sets to determine if there's interest in a show, but then they turn around and give loyal customers the shaft. You can be sure that I'm going to think twice about buying season sets in the future if this is how I'm going to be treated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another rape of my wallet","review":"Buy the seasons when they come out to ensure Paramount will keep producing the DVD's and then get screwed over when they release the whole series plus reunion movies.

Jim fights with clumsy henchmen. Jim gets away. Artemus fools bad guys with disguise. Jim gets girl. Jim drops girl. They ride off on train laughing.

I had to return my set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Packing from Manufacturer","review":"I'm in agreement with the others about the packaging of this item. I was so excited to add this to my collection and I bought it new from another vendor for about $43 and thought it was a steal.

After reading the same issue in other reviews, I just accepted that I couldn't own this in my collection because the replacement would probably be the same. I returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the series, hate the packaging","review":"Like many others, I really loved this series and wanted the complete set including the movies. The problem is that the packaging is so bad you risk ending up with discs so badly scratched they won't play. I should have paid attention to the reviews. I've had to return twice after attempting to play the discs. At least eight discs in each set received wouldn't even load in three different DVD players. As much as I want this set I have to pass on purchasing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series! Horrible Packaging!!!","review":"If you're a fan of 60s action/adventure series then this series is a must! Conrad and Martin are perfect together as West and Gordon. It's great that the complete series is finally available but, if you can afford it, purchase the seasons individually. The packaging for this complete series set is the worst I've ever seen! The discs aren't even on a spindle or in seperate slots, they are lumped loosely together and can get scratched as they rub up against each other. Whoever designed this packaging should be fired!The series gets 5 stars, the pacakging gets \\"0\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild West James Bond","review":"I loved this show as a kid, it reran right after school and was always a great way to relax. The show is a kind of James Bond in the Wild West. Lots of gadgets and lost of hot women. Each episode was well rounded but any episode with Lovless in it was a must watch. Some of the best parts of the show were the moments with West and Gordon you could tell that the actors really like each other and it made those sceens all the better. In this box set you get not only all the eps of the show but the 2 movies they did. Don't worry the Will Smith verison is not in it. A great but because its hard to find season 2 in stores anymore.

SHAME","review":"Why didn't they offer the complete series from the beginning? If they really want to do the right thing they should either let the people trade in the individual sets for the complete series or at least send the extra materials to those of us that bought the four seasons.

Both of us have said so often that we wished we could watch Wild, Wild West that I started looking for it online. And found it at amazon.com, of course.I think we were both even more pleased than we anticipated when we watched the first episode together. It's a series with a little bit of everything... romance, comedy, mystery, science, history and fiction. James West may not be Superman, but together with his indispensible companion, Artemus Gordon, he has saved the US from imminent doom more times than I can count. And entertained us delightfully every step of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUCKY PACKAGING, GREAT CONTENT","review":"I read about 30 reviews before plunking down my $70 plus $10 for overnight shipping. The packaging is designed by some sharpy marketeer who doesn't understand the market at all. We who loved this show want to preserve it. So, when you get the box, beware of the piss poor way they stacked the 27 dvds. Go out and buy 27 clear plastic cases to properly protect what you've just paid for and then stash the box in a closet because as clever as it seems to be it is destructive to the discs. I love the show and am glad this material is available...but, I agree with other reviewers who think the packaging is attempted cleverness and fails mightily. Long Live Jim West and Arty Gordon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SCRATCHED!","review":"Received scratched disks thanks to the horrible packaging.

I was a bit sceptical, but once I got into the CD, I quickly realized that Satrianisms are only the rock side of the \\"fusion\\" formula - lots of effects. There is the jazzy side of the formula, however, with lots of JUICY, melodic soloing, modal harmonies, changing atmospheres and meters, heavy B3 organ and moog-type soloing. There are some humorous spoken clips thrown in, like: \\"ah, f**k it man, let's go bowling\\" or \\"oh I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?\\". The chops of these guys are amazing - they can easily compare with other contemporary fusion units like Tribal Tech and Chick Corea Elektrik Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Quality Chair for Shorter people","review":"The quality of the chair is excellent! It's solid and nicely finished. The assembly was simple and quick. Six screws attach the top to the bottom and thats it! They even include the wrench.For me this chair is ideal. I'm only 5'4\\" and have short legs. This chair is fairly low to the ground. The seat is about 15 inches from the floor (I think a standard chair is 18 inches.) My feet touch the ground which I'm very pleased about. The chair seat is wide and roomy and, for me, it reaches to about 3/4 of the length of my thigh...a couple inches above my knee. An extra inch or so on the depth would be good but I'm not unhappy the way it is.I would highly recommend this chair for shorter people. Those of us vertically challenged love finding chairs that our feet don't dangle from. People with longer legs will probably not be happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carolina Cottage Hudson Rocker","review":"Over this is a great product, easy to put together. My wife love to use it when she needs to feed our baby. However, I would have to say that the way this product came packaged is one of the worst I've seen. The box was heavily damaged and the product had paint scrapes, deep scratches as a result of POOR packaging. It looked used because of these scratches. I did not want to go through the hassel of calling them up to return the unit which would have damaged it more because the original box was already unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screaming death over North Africa and the med.","review":"This is an excellent book.

I was suspecting that it wouldn't be all that great when I saw that the studio that originally produced this show, 20th Century Fox, was the same video company releasing it. Well, the first season looks horrible. The source material is all 16mm dupe prints, some parts of which are out of focus, scratched and dirty. In all cases the image is soft and, well, like 16mm. Compared to what Fox is releasing of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, produced the same year (1964) and at the same studio as BOONE, this release is nothing short of a disgrace. We should be given pristine 35mm source material, and we're not. I suspect Fox wouldn't release the original camera negs from it's vaults without a substantial fee.

Despite the common setting, don't expect another Angela's Ashes or anything like it; Curtin in no way attempts to imitate Limerick's most famous son and certainly doesn't have to.

The principal theme, though, is that all of these extended families are of mixed blood, politically unified by matrimonial alliances stretching from Norway to Yugoslavia -- but that such ties did not prevent continuing national feuds.

The production is competent, I've payed more $ for worse, and I found Tanya to be quite sexy and worth the view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book written","review":"Perhaps I should ask why it was published and how come some of those folks on the back cover mislead us with undue praise. Did they read the bool or just endorse it as a favor? There should be more integity in the reviewers who are often paid by the book company or do some one a favor in exchange for a good review of their work, but this leads us to mustrust them and regret spending money on books that waste our time.This is so here in a book about one man's journal during a summer sabbatical while he prepares to teach a one day workshop on Merton's poetry. It adds nothing to the glut of Merton books and sheds no new light on Merton himself. What it does do is show us how the author is enamored with Merton, whose poetry was after all not that good, and who would not appreciate such hero worship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. The characters are fantastic and the story moves along at a very intense pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Masterpiece","review":"This is a best novel I ever saw. The author has terrific ability to grasp the basic facts and a grand strategy panorama. You mind and sentiment will resolve into the book inconciously, however, it's a good feeling. I really admire the author Herman Wouk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was sad to see this end.","review":"I read the sequel first, and was so enthralled I read Winds when I was done. They were a wonderful part of my life for three months of pleasure reading. A very good story that is exceptionally historically accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enthralling History Lesson","review":"Never a fan of war epics, and a pacifist to boot, I found myself thrust into the book after a friend coerced me to read it. After a couple hundred chapters of standard introductions and sluggish war rumblings from afar, the saga started to pick up. Two main characters are tossed in a simple Jewish countrytown in Poland as the Nazis attack unsparingly. Woulk waters down the blatant social commentary and WWII strategem with a winding plot that places protagonists in a lavish party of Goering's (Hitler's right-hand man), with a guestlist including Hitler himself, at the cockpit of a British fighter plane soaring across Berlin, and the private office of FDR, as he seeks for guidance. The subtle, romantic fumblings of lovers even squirm their way into the plot to complete a deliciously factual fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Attack on Bearl Barbor??????????","review":"Extremely insulting that no one ever proof reads books after conversion to kindle format. While the kindle edition appears to have undergone some clean up after so many negative reviews for a chapter to have \\"Bearl Barbor\\" as the title is beyond belief. There are many other conversion errors with improper character recognition but I did not track those. A few problems with hyphenation also remain where the printed edition used hyphenation as a means to word/line wrap but the after conversion to kindle the hyphen is no longer appropriate since the line wrap occurs at a different point in the line. There are a few graphics from the printed version also scanned into the kindle edition and therefore of poor quality. Can only imagine how bad War and Remembrance kindle edition must be since that title has been unavailable for many months while awaiting correction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality issues with Kindle edition","review":"\\"The Winds of War\\" and \\"War and Remembrance\\" are two of my favorite books and other critics have given them good reviews for the hardback and paperback editions. I do have to express my disgust with the quality of the Kindle editions. In \\"The Winds of War\\" there were several typos, one of which was in over sized type that fairly screamed from the page. In \\"War and Remembrance\\" there are so many popping up that it is extremely distracting. One typo can be humorous, two can be a nuisance, but when they crop up nearly every other page, it becomes quite annoying and distracting. I believe the publishers should make the proper corrections and make corrected ones available for a second download. So far this has been my only encounter with typos in Kindle editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating from page one!","review":"Better than the sequal, War and Remembrance.

He personalizes that period by following a family as they deal with the everchanging landscape of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is full of typos","review":"The book is excellent. See the other reviews for details. However, the conversion to Kindle format has riddled the manuscript with typographical errors, misspellings, missing words, and omitted spaces.

Even though many years have passed since I finished it, I frequently think of the characters, and the horror and heroism of World War II. This book puts you there like no non-fiction book can.(I was so moved when I finished, I wrote Mr. Wouk, to tell him what an impact the book had on me. He wrote me back, with thanks, and told me how few readers ever write him with feedback. So be sure to send him a note when you're finished.) READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"A suffocating read","review":"I thought this was a horrible book. Pug is an absolute bore and so infuriating becasue he is perfectly perfect in every way.

What a marvelous work! I've read enough military history to know that this is accurate stuff, but far more than that it's insightful and well integrated into a whole, complex, riviting pattern.

It is a great book. I own the hard cover and thoroughly enjoyed reading it in print.However, ordering the Kindle edition of the text from Amazon was a tremendous disappointment. [...]Don't buy this book for your Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringly educational","review":"I started this book with an open mind becasue I had heard it was a good book. However, after several hundred pages I was STILL waiting for something EXCITING to happen. Although it's educational and is accurate about the events of WWII, I found it unbearably boring and fell asleep everytime I read it for over 10 min. The only reason I read it was because it was assigned to me for a book report. I love to read, but this book was too long and strung out. I skipped 400 pages and still got A's on two book reports. My instructors (who both read the book) thought I read the whole thing because I gave accurate book reports without the knowledge of what happened in the middle of the book. That goes to show how eventful it is. The only reason it scored two stars with me was because it is educational and a war buff might enjoy it, but if you like \\"people\\" stories, don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good entertainment, as long as it's not taken to seriously.","review":"This book, as well as it's sequel, are good for light, entertaining reading. Definately hard to put down.But it's many examples of ridiculousness border on the absurd, with the main one being expected to believe a person of the status and rank of the main character would have the experiences he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Idea!!","review":"This book and CD set are the perfect combination for those who are new to the world of opera and not fluent in foreign language. Better than just a synopsis, the libretto in English lets you read every word so you won't miss the humor or pathos. As a homeschooling mom, I really appreciated this set as a teaching tool.

Basicaly, Ijust play this game for creating missions. (E.G. Klingon Ship vs. Romulan Ships). I do not actually play the game levels. I think it is stupid that you cannot play Spock, Bones, or any of the other characters. You have to play a stupid Cadet, much like other Star Trek Games (E.G. Bridge Commander, Elite Force I and II).

Like the author, I am in the middle of a \\"down\\" period in my life and the reminder of the classic ways out of the dark days and nights come at a good time for me. You must learn to love yourself first, ergo the good food and pretty undies to remind yourself that life can be good. You must quiet yourself down enough to pray and then you can again start to love others.I read all the complaints about the book being too much about I amd me. Well, it's darn near impossible to think otherwise when you are in that much pain. It's like being a toddler again. She went through stages and grew up. That seems to be the point of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Friend Between Soft Covers","review":"My mom sent me this book last Christmas. I couldn't put it down.I loved the food, the exotic scenery, and every one of the author's (often hilarious) adventures. The style is friendly and easy to read. It is romantic without being mushy and adventurous without pretension or bravado.When I finished, I felt as though I had made a new friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Comments on Eat, Pray, Love","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was well written, entertaining and funny. I think the author could have provided the reader with a little more information about the reason for her divorce (since it is the main reason she proceeds on this journey)-she mainly talks about sitting in the bathroom crying, but we don't know why she thinks so poorly of her husband or why she decides to leave him.It is a great travel adventure and makes you want to travel to Italy, Indonesia and India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destructive work of Selfishness","review":"Just what women need; a book to encourage their self-absorption in the guise of \\"spirituality.\\" What a crock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky Author without Graciousness","review":"Elizabeth Gilbert, I don't mean to be critical about your life experiences. You've gone through a lot. But, you're a pretty darn lucky woman to have had the chance to travel the world on a pre-release book grant while other citizens of the world have had to deal with the demons of their minds in their local community without any support from employers, family, or friends.I enjoyed reading about your story, until I realized that you couldn't seem to clearly describe the silver lining in your worldly experiences for the rest of us who cannot escape to the delicacies of Italy, the deities India, and the desolate beaches in Indonesia to heal.I've cautiously recommended your book to friends, but I can't quite understand what all the hype is about. Perhaps I shouldn't have set my expectations so high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a BREAK!","review":"OH PLEASE! I really wanted to read this book. I really wanted to like this book. I read it. I certainly did not like it. OK, Gilbert fully admits that she was paid to go on this 'journey' of spiritualism, and to write about it. And I bought into it as she ate her full in Italy. (Glad she admitted that she gained weight) OK, she went to India and prayed- at an exclusive Ashram. well.... maybe I still buy it, but not so much. But REALLY, while in Indonesia she meets her gorgeous latin lover??!? Come ON! What are the odds?

I believe some books grab you at a time when you need a pick-me-up and perhaps that is why I was moved to finally read this novel I had heard so many mixed reviews about.I'd like to start off by saying it takes guts to bear your soul in a book like this and am surprised so many dislike it, but to each his/her own. I found the soul-bearing nature of Gilbert's writing to be moving and refreshing.I really enjoyed the details of travel, especially in Italy, and felt the toughness of the routine in India and then reflective on the Indonesia experience. I can't wait to read her next novel, Committed, which seems to continue from where Eat, Pray, Love has left off."},{"rating":"2","title":"eat, pray, love by Elizabeth Gilbert","review":"This book will help get you out of the funk of a break-up. If you have ever felt like you needed out and went for it, but then felt crazy- this is the book for you. It is funny at times but also very insightful throughout most of the book.

This is a book all about discovering self identity and self concept which makes me want to gag given, a woman of her age should already be there. It just is not entertaining written in the voice she uses which fails to invite her readers into the who what why when and how of how she arrived at the point of no where at this late stage in life. This would have allowed readers to connect and identify with her. I understand this is a memoir of her journey but she could have written it with a common thread to tie it together to make it more cohesive for her readers. In my opinion, it rambles aimlessly and I don't think I will be able to finish reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah had it wrong...","review":"I hated this book SO much, and had such a personal/emotional reaction of disgust with the main character - that I cannot let it go! I won't rehash other reviewers, but essentially this woman needed to get over herself and and simply live her life! It was difficult to watch this modern quest for enlightenment that was so contrived and in no way achieved. Her aim at one point is to simply 'let go' and yet she seems to do the opposite. I put it down about 3/4 a way through in total boredom and disgust. Don't listen to Oprah, this book sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...

I couldn't sympathize or empathize with the author, the writing was adolescent at best, and the story was new-age drivel. If this woman had really ever once had to struggle to \\"make it\\" or worked with disadvantaged people here in the States, I would have a bit easier time buying her bit of self discovery. But instead she was selfish, ignorant, childish, and naive. Who new that discovering the gift of giving of oneself would lead a path to enlightenment??? Just about anyone else who has come down from their high class society to see how the rest of us live. What baloney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A genuine page ripper.","review":"Because my reading group chose to read this book, I made every effort to finish it, but right around Indonesia, I just couldn't pick it up one more time. I gave the book away, relieved to be free of this drivel, but hoping that I had not cast a curse on the generous soul who took it off my hands. Throughout the two-thirds of the book I managed to get through, the word \\"insipid\\" just kept popping up in my mind, like so many soap bubbles on summer's day. It was bad enough that Ms. Gilbert was paid 200,000 dollars to make the journey on which the book is based, but worse yet, that the result of her narcissistic meanderings was considered suitable for publication, afterward. Much like the book, A Million Little Pieces, Eat, Pray, Love, is mostly an unverifiable account of a woman's journey to enlightenment, a journey where she is--surprise, surprise--the hero, page-after-page. I think we all wish we could get Ms. Gilbert's gig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Paper It is Printed On","review":"It's just terrible.

Once one review was published showing the book in a positive light, everybody jumped on the bandwagon so that the book would become so popular that YOU would feel stupid for not reading it.

I understand that the intention was for the author to chronicle her life on her spiritual journey, but she writes in wincing detail her crying jags in the bathroom, how she couldn't understand her husband's anger when she left him for another man and why he couldn't make things easy for her by agreeing to a \\"friendly\\" divorce....And it goes on from there. Instead of getting insight in another person's quest for spiritual identify, it was all clouded with the \\"me, me, me\\" theme and distracted this reader from the intention of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed. Author is too caught up in herself","review":"I had heard a lot about this book and decided to get it. It was a waste of my time and money. This is a classic example of commercialism and marketing. The author was too self-involved and her narratives made me lose interest pretty quick. The book was a good attempt and overall has a good message, but it's better to save your money and find your own peace with life rather than listening to someone that's just trying to sell books by sharing their drivel with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"This book did not ring true for me at all. If the author was in the middle of such a horrible breakdown how did she muster up the energy to go to a publisher and get a book deal and then set out for a year of traveling?

Maybe I missed something but, I DO NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Airy-Fairy for Me","review":"I was hoping this would be a rich journey of a woman finding herself in the larger context of the world vs the rather narrow confines of \\"woman's role\\" in America. I couldn't read far into the book before giving up. The author seems prone to emotional excess which even she can't explain. Clingy with her new love after her divorce, she whipsaws between ecstatic closeness and what amounts to clinical depression on an almost day-to-day basis. Some chemical problem she was born with that causes her misery? In her place, I would just have had fun for as long as it lasted. Then moved on to the next phase--and perhaps man--in her life. This strikes me as a woman who isn't very grounded, but seeks outside support of various stripes in the hope she will finally feel okay. Sadly, I quickly just didn't care whether she felt okay or not. I'm sure she is talented enough in putting sentences together, but I didn't feel the book had any substance. Many apparently loved the book--no idea why."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the hype?","review":"I think that this is the most annoying, self-absorbed book I have ever, EVER read. Let's see, a very wealthy woman goes through a nasty divorce but has enough money to take 1-1/2 yrs to find herself. No bills to worry about, no children, no job to keep her down. Just herself. And she is so distraught that she decides to explore food, then prayer, then love. This book could be renamed EAT, PRAY, PUKE. I will give her this: she had the dough to get this best PR firm and do a massive, masterful promotion and media hype, even Oprah. Because of that, she sold a million books. so what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Love and Search....for a different book","review":"This was a terribly written, whiney account of a woman's pathetic attempt to find someplace, anyplace where she could feed her ego. It was easily one of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time!","review":"Everyone seemed to rant about the movie. I tried sitting through it but found it too tortuous to bear past the 15-minute mark so I decided to read the book. I am now left more upset at the time I wasted. Gilbert turned out to be a self-absorbed extremely privileged middle-age woman who in search for everything couldn't seem to get past her enormous ego. A complete waste of time, this is when a zero star should be available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I wasn't captured by this book at all. I felt like the main character was complaining and wallowing in despair and found it pathetic and annoying. Although it is nice to travel through Italy, India and Indonesia, I didn't make it past Italy. This is a good book for someone who is not in a good place romantically. I began to read it while I was planning a wedding so perhaps that is why I didn't like it due to the content and my state of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God Woman, Get OVER it.....","review":"So, you tell me you have to go to 3 countries, find God, meditate, etc. to get over a husband and a lover? Good Lord. How little one must think of themself if the \\"pity-party\\" lasts for that very long. In the course of the book, she tries to tell women to see their inner worth - that we are not solely dependant on a man for happiness. And, where does she end up? Right back in the fray - right back where she started from. On the other hand, there were a few good lines in the book. A few good insights. A few good quotes - such as: \\"Give us this day our Daily Gripe.\\" She used this to describe how annoyingly negative people are. On this - and a few other points, I totally agree. However, as far as Liz and men are concerned - I think she needs a man sort of as a crutch. Walking strong, proud and free ain't such a bad thing, Liz. It's just not as hard as you make it....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Went between loving and hating this book","review":"Oh how I loved the Italian setting and wanted to be right by Liz's side, I could practically taste the food and see the sights... But oh how I wish I had never taken the trip to India and endured Liz's self absorbed and draining monologues. Bali was the happy medium between the two and offered some romance to an otherwise dreary life experience. Bali didn't get me back to the highlights of Italy so in the end, I was left disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"agony","review":"I hated this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was agony to sit through!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I had gone to see it alone I would have left. Don't torture yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"After hearing a little bit about the book, I was so excited to read it. I was expecting a book that would tell the story of a strong-willed woman who was a survivor and was able to learn valuable lessons from her past hardships. Instead, I found it to be the story of a whiny, priviledged woman who created her own problems and expected everyone to feel sorry for her. I certianly understand the impact depression can have on a person, but I don't think this was the case with her.It was torture trying to get through it and I finally had to just put it down because I could not connect with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"I liked this book so much that I ordered the sequal, \\"Committed\\" from Amazon. Elizabeth Gilbert writes a very candid story about her personal life and her search for happiness.

Took a little longer to arrive than I expected, however, but that's online ordering for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissist-Lit","review":"Ms. Gilbert wallows in the excruciating detail of her \\"journey\\" of self-improvement, as she evolves from self-indulgent neuroses to neurotic self-indulgence. Along the tedious way, she makes a few interesting observations on her context, but insufficient to justify the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK","review":"I gave it to my mom and told her to get through the first few chapters as fast as possible. Then you will be able to embark on a journey of your life-time. This seriously changed my outlook on life to a more positive way of dealing with truth, the unknown, God and meditation. I am a Christian and found this book to be very profound and enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Cover on a Vegas Sidewalk Has More Depth","review":"\\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" would make a great children's book if it was \\"dumbed-down\\" just a wee bit. Everyone the author encounters is helpful and wise. Wisdom is so easily obtained.The book's attraction is it's breezy, humorous prose.I assume what also makes it attractive is the author's affirmation that epiphanies are relatively painless, easy to come by, and can be \\"all about me\\". That would make the book right at home in many of today's yoga studios, meditations centers, mega-churches, and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"would you like some cheese with that wine??","review":"Gave this book one star...it actually deserves -10!!! what a boring boring stupid book.....I felt no connection to the author at all...I actually wished she would end up in a lunatic asylum....it's just ranting and raving of a spoilt brat...don't waste your money on it.....go get a bottle of wine instead or watch painjt dry...much more fun!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"over hyped, uninteresting book","review":"I really tried to like this book and literally gave up half way through. Although the author is a decent *writer*, her insights were like reading the thoughts of a college student. Maybe it was because I read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" immediately after reading \\"Three Cups of Tea\\", but I couldn't suppress my irritation over someone who had a great life, some problems, and presented her story as if it was an epic journey. I guess you either identify with the author and love the book, or find her whiny and self-absorbed and dislike the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritual! Please!","review":"This is pap. Because it is a selection by one member of our book group I felt forced to read beyond 40 pages which is my upper limit for quiting a book. The writer is self-serving, whiney, superficial and has the nerve to call this, in effect, a spiritual search. You don't need to travel to find compassion which she seems to be in short shrift of, to see the world as a complex place which she seems to miss since she is always and only looking through her eyes, and to be celebate for a year which she seems to think is lusting with eyes, taste, and imagination but not in actual fact which makes her more spiritual. Run from this self-serving monologue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Through It","review":"No matter how hard I tried, I could not get through this book. I finally threw it away after getting halfway. I hate that I wasted the money. I purchased it because there was so much hype surrounding it. I did feel better, however, when I discovered how many people I knew who had also tossed the book after only partially reading it. How so many women can say it is their \\"bible\\" is completely beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author/main character is firmly rooted in UNreality!","review":"I am trying desperately to find something positive to say about this book. The author reminds me of a former in-law??? No, that's not positive. It contains enough hot air to float 10,000 hot air balloons? No, that's inaccurate--it has more capability than that. It's a valuable spiritual guide? OMG, NO! It's too pretentious. Don't waste your $$ and time on this book--even if some airheads made a movie from it! After all, plenty of movies have been ill-conceived ventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'Real' story.","review":"This book confuses many males and empowers many woman to be themselves.We cannot all be stereo types, even though sometimes the community we live in makes it clear that is what we are supposed to want.This story is real to me in so many ways, but you have to read it with an open mind to get it...If you start thinking 'how selfish of her...or 'what a drama queen' during the first pages then this book is not for you and your mind is not open.If you want to feel good about loving yourself for who you are and not for what you are supposed to be then you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"What a load of narcissistic, self-indulgent, whiney tripe! The only reason I finished this piece of crap was because I was incouraged to do so by a coworker who loved the book. All I can is, what a whiner! Your marriage ended? Poor you; it happens all the time. Your relationship with your boyfriend ended? See previous sentence. With absolutely no responsibilities whatsoever, you were able to just pack up and indulge your pathetically crippled emotions in a year of doing whatever the hell you want - stuff your boring face in Italy, sit on your ass in India and fart around in Bali. Wow, aren't you a role model for women everywhere - NOT. Deal with the death of a spouse, being a single parent, watch a parent die a slow death from Alzheimer's and get back to us, will ya?Deleted this piece of garbage from the Kindle the second I finished reading it. Simply terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the ME generation was finished","review":"Well, judging from how well this book is doing, I guess not.Couldn't finish it, self discovery taken to heights that I'm not interested in at all.ME, ME: Me? me...

I love traveling to Italy, Indonesia and India with Elizabeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"I was very surprised by all of the negative reviews, but to each their own. I could go on and on about what I liked about this book and the reasons for which I would highly recommend it to each and everyone I know however, I'm afraid it would just fall on deaf ears. I think Gilbert put together a wonderful piece. I can see myself in a lot of her experiences. Further, she was blessed with an extraordinary opportunity to travel and \\"find herself\\" and it's an interesting peek inside her incredible journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great transformative book","review":"If you feel like your life is stagnant and that you're just repeating the same cycles of bad decisions over and over, then you need to read this book. I'm not saying you should do as the author and go out to eat, pray and love your way to a breakthrough. But it is great to read about someone who you can relate to and how she finally found herself. The eating part is absolutely salivating and made me wish I too could hop on a plane and eat my way through a country for a few months. The praying part was also inspiring and made me look at meditation in a completely different way. And who doesn't love a good love story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A not so interesting journey of self-discovery","review":"When I finally picked up this book, it was like the Emporer had no clothes. I love nonfiction but found it unbearably dull, I could not read it straight through, had to skim, skipping around trying in vain to find the part that made so many people (including Ophrah, right?) \\"love\\" it and the reason it was a best-seller. Ugh. In a sentence: \\"Narcisstic, self-absorbed person who goes on a self-indulgent journey of self-discovery paid for by her publisher.\\" This book reminded me of a line Miss Manners that she suggested to a gentle reader to use to dis-encourage people from conversing with her: \\"Oh, I've been on a wonderful journey of self-discovery, do let me tell you ALL about it!\\"Relationships are my hobby, yet I could not get into it and can't understand why so many people loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"This is THE most boring book I have ever read. I tried to finish it but couldn't quite make it. The story of an insane unfulfilled woman who finds no pleasure in her marriage, divorces and drops her live in New York to travel for a year to find herself in Rome, India and Indonesia. The books goes on all the way about her depression after her divorce and basically has nothing to say. I give out my copy if you are interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing!","review":"I heard great things about this book and thought it sounded interesting so I was looking forward to reading it. I was interested to hear the author's journey into enlightenment and self discovery. It is intersting to me how people overcome pain and hardships. However it took me over 2 years to finally finish the book. Why? I found it annoying and obnoxious; I would put it down out of annoyance, and then decide to try again later. I found the main character to be obnoxiously self absorbed, self centered and full of self importance. I understand she felt she was going through a difficult time and this is her journey, but really could she be more of a whiner? If you want to read about enlightenment and self discovery through hardships and pain then try reading something else, perhpas Anne Frank or something by Viktor Frankle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow diary of a spoiled little rich girl","review":"I am so upset with myself for spending money and padding this woman's royalty check. What a disappointing book. She had no respect whatsoever for her marriage vows and left her husband just because she changed her mind. Then she is so \\"stressed\\" with her privileged life that she has travel around the world and \\"find herself.\\" Give me a break. She is shallow, self-absorbed, immature, and spoiled. Not to mention incredibly conceited to think that she has any \\"spiritual insight\\" to give after her little spa vacation get-away. Don't waste your money. Watch a rerun of Sex and the City - any episode of that show will provide the basic outline for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite drivel - a waste of money and time","review":"I don't normally write reviews but this book drove me to it. I forced my way about half way through the book before realizing it wasn't going to get any better. The character is a weak, self-absorbed person waiting for the whole world to make her life better. She apparently never learned to be responsible for her own happiness and to try and do it without harming others in the process. I deeply regret spending money to buy this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat whine s$&@!","review":"The eating part seemed real to me. The rest seemed fabricated for a book deal. There are better ways to use a midlife crisis. Julia Roberts starring in the movie doesn't make this worthy of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a terrible book. The movie and book are boring and self satisfying. I felt that both were an extreme waste of my time. I hope that this helps some other people not waste theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Very superficial.

It's going straight in the \\"donations\\" bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat,Pray,Love","review":"I am so dissapointed in this book. I normally like chick books. In fact, I'm pro-chick flics and pro-chick books, so I was surprised to find out that this books wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I haven't finished the book yet, and I don't know that I can finish it. If it gets any worse, I'm going to have to pull the plug on it. I was told that her time spent in Italy is fun, and that India is a little boring. Well, I'm still listening to her time in Italy and if India is even more boring, I know I'm going to pull the plug. Also, the narrator leaves a lot to be desired. Her reading is very dull. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. I haven't watched the movie, but it has to be better than the book. Normally I like the book better than the movie. This may be the first case where I like the movie the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but weak story!","review":"The author certainly writes well, but the story she tells is about her, and her, and her... |Not very interesting!After the first part, my interest was gone to know what was going to happen in the second and third part.Rather disappointing book and probably an even more disappointing film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sisterhood","review":"From the very beginning of this book I knew it would be one that I would want all of my women friends to read. It spoke of the journey most of us have made; maybe not in such an extravagant way; but our quest for those spiritual lessons that this author so lovingly and honestly shares. It inspired me, touched my heart and soul and reminded me that life is a journey. It awakened and renewed my quest for those pleasures in life that the title addresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK - HOPE THE MOVIE IS AS GOOD","review":"The book follows one woman's journey to leave her past behind and grow into her present and future.

I highly recommend this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wah wah","review":"I can't imagine what this woman would do if she ever had something truly bad happen to her. A divorce? A failed affair? Oh, please. I concur with the reviewers who object to her whiny self-absorption.

I was very excited to read this book. I remainded excited for about two chapters. The author came across as very whiny and shallow. Although she attempted to add humor to her story, she was unsuccessful. It appeared as though she was desperately trying to show how funny and hip and worldy she was. She was unsuccessful in her attempts to prove she was any of the above. I absolutely hated this book and would not reccomend it to anyone.

If I saw this woman on the steet, I'd run like crazy the other way!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Priviledged Eat, Pray, Love","review":"This book implies that it takes a great deal of money to find God and love. Ms. Gilbert's self deprecating humor is slickly described with pop references and descriptors and doesn't feel authentic -- more like the rehearsings of one who knows there is a paycheck and has never scratched and hungered. One wonders if Ms. Gilbert is capable of truly feeling deeply or can only pretend to feel deeply. Quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Induglent","review":"Pretty much self indulgent blather. Upset that the ratings were so high that I bought it! No one wants to hear that much about HER except HER. I tried to get what I could out of it but there was almost nothing I wasn't already aware of, being touch with myself in the least already. It got the second star for a few parts I was able to get into a little bit, I was desperate to feel like I paid for SOMETHING.Audiobook note: I think the audio was recorded in such a way that she's talking very softly or something, it's maddening. I needed to switch to music periodically for reprieve."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish the book","review":"I guess I'm not technically qualified to write a review, since I read maybe 1/5 of the book, but I couldn't finish it: The author struck me as myself at the age of maybe 15, utterly self-absorbed, doing ridiculous things to and with people, and failing to read big red warning flags in relationships. I guess I also found her spiritual journey extremely boring since I became an atheist awhile ago. Anyway, I like chick lit as much as the next girl, but this book is too boring to be chick lit, and not in the major league as far as a book with depth and trying to figure out life's dilemmas. It is whiny and ridiculous, a roller coaster of mental illness that is repetitive after only the first 30-50 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"While the book is well written and sometimes amusing, it has an overall air of arrogance and self-indulgence. It covers a lifestyle no one should want to copy. After a while, the whole thing becomes sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"popular reading taste","review":"It's difficult to imagine that this book is a bestseller. After about 50 pages I was bored with her ramblings and unimportant self-focus. Geez. This is what sells in the US these days? I guess it tells us something about our consciousness and level of sophistication around literature. (This book is NOT literature.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't read it","review":"I too would not give it any stars. I couldn't finish it and have passed it to several friends, all of whom either couldn't get in to it or just plain didn't like it. I'm still trying to figure out who likes it and why it is such a big deal. The only person I have come across who actually liked it was a woman in the book store who thought it was the greatest book she ever read. My comment is, she must not read much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy this?","review":"I wonder why I bought this book. I have not been able to get past a few chapters. How did it become a best seller? The author seems to justify her mistakes by trying to come up with good reasons. There are a lot of people in the world who are less fortunate than the author and have had more honest lives. Wish I had donated the money to charity instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I think it is so sad that so many women read and got inspiration from this book. What is happening to the minds of our women? It's like people will just grab at anything!! I had a very hard time finishing the book, but did and was so mad at the time I wasted doing so. I guess this woman is typical of the thinking of the weak, lost and ignorant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"This book not only keeps you entertained throughout but is very thought provoking as well. She writes with a quick wit and sense of humor that, although the subject matter is sometimes rather deep and serious, you can't help but chuckle all the way through it. It leaves you thinking about what you've read long after you've closed the book for that day. I found myself thinking, \\"I'll just finish this chapter and then go do ............\\" whatever, but before I knew it, I'd be in the middle of the next chapter and completely forgot to close the book and go \\"do whatever\\"!

Elizabeth Gilbert includes vivid details about the cultures of Italy, India and Bali that help her readers see the places and understand how they help her transformation from despondency to joy. I highly recommend Eat, Pray, Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this story!","review":"I enjoyed this book so much and got a lot from it for myself! It was an interesting read for 98% of the book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is there is a section where Elizabeth goes into quite a lot of detail on what she learned in India about the process of meditating and all that is involved and our inner selves that it got a little too much for me to comprehend without any knowledge of this process at all. But, that did not detract from her overall experience and I was so intrigued by this book that I bought her next book and am reading it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely boring and selfish","review":"i couldn't get even halfway through this. this woman is so completely selfish, i'm embarrassed for her. don't bother buying this...or even reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"yak, yak, yakkitty yak.... blah blah","review":"Oh God, based on the popularity of this book and recccommendations from female friedns, I sat down to read this book....I gave up after the first 35 pages this summer.

I kept waiting for this idiotic author to discover that if she wasn't so into herself, perhaps her life would be better, but it never happened. I did enjoy the Italy section (as the food sounds great), but honestly if I met this woman while she was traveling I would have smacked her upside the head. Her time and money would have been better spent on charity work then this driveling 'look how much i've improved myself' egocentric excuse of a book. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype!!","review":"I too was seduced by the great reviews...and now I can only issue a warning...DON'T BUY THIS!

I'd give zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me..","review":"Everyone loved this book, and while I live my life to eat, pray and love.. She wasn't on the same page with me. She gives up on her marriage in the first chapter. Then she sleeps with a series of men. Who has money to travel to three countries, and have such a distaste for everything. I wanted to reach into the book and ring her neck. I find humor in everything, but this book just made me feel depressed. But, I should have known better.. I'm not in the Oprah book cult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, if anything else.","review":"My sister gave me the book after she read it because she said she was \\"touched by it.\\" Well, having suffered from a 3-year episode of depression myself, I can certainly sympathize with the author -- depression is indeed horrible. However, I didn't have the luxury of dropping everything in my life, to go and travel and write about my experience. I had to just \\"buck up\\" and accept that I was no exception; EVERYONE has issues and must learn to deal with them as part of life. Now, I have to admit that I didn't hate the book, in fact I enjoyed most of it, but mostly because of the other (much more interesting) people that Liz meets in her travels -- like Richard from Texas -- I LOVED this character.

I also sent it to my daughter in England. I am due to retire after 25 years working at a school and looking for ideas to start my new life.I found the book very interesting, but not as revalational as I expected. I was waiting until the end for the true meaning of life, but felt rather let down as it was more like a love story with a lovely happy ending. The book merely said what I already knew that happiness comes from within and you have to work at living.My daughter also enjoyed the book and passed it on to a friend.Well worth a read as a nice book, but not very inspiring.Janet Edwards"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I think this book makes a good read for anyone trying to understand spirituality. I especially liked the portion about her stay in the Ashram. I have been trying meditation for sometime now and can relate back to her experience of having constant background thoughts.

If you wander through my library you will notice that this is not my usually type of book. It is also not easy to classify this work. It is a travel/journey reflection...a reflection not only on the external world of travel but the internal world of the heart and soul. Elizabeth Gilbert does outstanding job in interweaving both journeys through these realms and taking us to a larger meaning that embodies both realms. She creates wonderful metaphors and contrasts in illuminating her own growth and awareness through this exotic global trip. Her writing is very engaging on many levels. I found it be humorous, ironic, inspiring and very touching. I recommend this book to anyone looking for guiding principles to add to their life...anyone wanting to change or evolve their life...and anyone of a romantic heart, wondering soul and an optimistic mind. This is worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a self-absorbed woman!","review":"This book is so awful. This woman needs some serious psychological help. I got so tired of reading a memoir of a person that was so incredibly self-absorbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easy happy read.","review":"This book is great. It's a quick read. I really loved Italy (eat) and Indonesia (love). India (pray)I could have done without. I skipped some pages there, the writer tends to get stuck on an idea or a revelation or whatever in that section that is kind of boring. But Italy and Indonesia are lovely and colorful and warm. I would recommend this book to any of my girlfriends."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"I started to read it last summer due to a book group choice. Couldn't pass the italian chapter. What a bratt!!! I just couldn't stand her selfpittying and \\"I am so Pretty, oh so pretty\\" approach. I started to want to write to her husband and tell him how much of a great guy he was, even if I didn't know anything about him.Well, the reason why I am writting this is because I found an incredible book to read, especially by EVERYONE who tried to read EAT PRAY...I just finished the Glass Castle,so I understand why women in search of evasion would read EAT PRAy... But if you truly want to cherish your life and see how fortunate you are, just read the Glass Castle. Complete opposite. It will make you ashame of self pittying (is that a word?).If you still want to dream or escape, you are better off watching the cooking channel or Discovery or Travel....I am stunned EAT PRAY... is a best seller. She doesn't deserve it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"CS Quinn said it much better than I ever could. Not even worth borrowing for curiosity sake. Author's metaphysics is much lacking in morality from a Christian perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ex Bali expat","review":"I loved Gilbert's book and I loved the Bali characters whom I know a few of. I thought that Gilbert described the expats' life and their relationships with the locals and the Balinese community with fairness, accuracy and lots of humour. I thoroughly recommend Eat, Pray, Love to any man who wants to know a bit more about women. Great book, great read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too deep into the Chick Lit genre.","review":"The travel experiences she describes, both spiritual and culinary are fun. HOWEVER, if you have girlfriends that are annoyingly complicated about relationships and you find their rants make you lose your will to live until they're finished, then skip this book. Wait for the Lifetime channel movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype?","review":"Not quite what I was expecting! I found it to be a little self-indulgent, however I did relate to a lot of her emotions (I wonder what that says about me?!). I read this as part of a book club, and only 1 out of 8 of us actually finished it in time - not really a page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"This was a self-indulgent, waste of time. I felt like I could have gotten a similar read from something titled, \\"You need a Guru to be cool and open minded like me\\" I was really dissapointed in this book. On the one hand she portrays herself as humble, but then sneaks in comments suggesting that Christians and Muslims, and many others, have it all wrong, and only she and a handful of enlightened ones see things correctly. I finished the book because a friend gave it to me to read, but I'm sorry I wasted my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book. So glad I got to experience it!","review":"This was such an enjoyable read. I love the way Elizabeth describes things with such great detail. It puts you right there with her.

A total bore-fest. It was a struggle to get through this book. Always hoping there would be some substance, but it never appeared. How did this ever get published?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"duh","review":"This book is full of subjective point of views and a lot of them aren't true. I am so annoyed by the author's ignorance and conceited attitude in the book. Moreover, The author seems like to reapeat same idea over and over again for a whole page. Honestly, I don't think I would be interested in her self-dstruct life style with boy-crazy problems througout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivial Pursuit","review":"It's hard to believe that this book is number one on the NY Times best seller list! But, then again, in a land of ghost-written bios and diet books, I guess it shouldn't be surprising. Skimming the surface, sound-bites, New Age narcissism, they're all here folks and Ms. Gilbert is a master juggler. It's amazing to me how folks like this can skate along on the surface of life, collecting book advances, multiple homes, spiritual \\"experiences\\", book contracts and new relationships and, at the end of it, still be as clueless as the Pillsbury Dough Boy. I am so grateful that I read this at the library, rather than buy it and be responsible for funding Ms.Gilbert's next excursion. She and Sara Davidson should take a trip through Third World countries together...now THAT would be an interesting read!

Normally I don't read self help or \\"soul searching\\" type of books so I guess that's part of the reason I didn't like this book. I found it to be a chronicle of a well to do woman's journey of \\"finding herself\\" only on a huge budget. She decides she doesn't want to be married anymore and takes off for exotic places to figure out what she should do with her life. Now some of it I admit was interesting especially the India experience with the culture, meditation, yoga, etc. But it was really hard for me to identify with this author and find any empathy with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the Tuscan Sun without charm or creativity","review":"Awful.

I am SO glad I did not pay more than $2 for it. I really wanted to like this book, but I found myself struggling to finish it. I have read at least 3 other books since having begun Eat, Pray, Love. While the author is a good writer, the story painfully drug on. At first, I encouraged myself to keep reading because perhaps I hadn't given it enough time to \\"take off.\\" When I realized it wasn't going to get any better, I foreced myself to keep reading just for the sake of finishing. I am in full agreement that this woman used her divorce to catapult her career -- her book idea molded her trip (with the oh-so-convenient advance) and not the other way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I love spiritual journeys and all, but this was painful to read, not particularly well written, and unbelievably self centered. I made it about three quarters of the way through the book before I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"An atrocious waste of time","review":"I dragged myself through the first part and could not bring myself to finish this book. Considering how much it was praised I found it to be a real let down and was furious at the author for wasting my time with such drivel.Authors personality: flat, boring, incapable of honestly conveying her thoughts and experiences, apparently thinks very highly of herself, shallow- incapable of any deep thought or of extracting any lesson from anything. Also, came across as a woman with whore-like tendencies, who constantly fantasizes of 20 year old boys wanting to shag her. And all this while, I thought memoirs were the arena of interesting people with amazing life experiences and some sort of insight into life. Silly me.There was just too much wrong with this book.It leaves a distinctly unpleasant aftertaste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost the worst thing I have ever read","review":"This is a best seller and has been made into a movie so I thought it would be a safe bet. I am bitterly disappointed. Too many cliches. Too many bad analogies. Too many adjectives (as a general rule, if you use three in a row you are probably using at least one too many). The story is ultimately dull and the author comes across as being egocentric and shallow. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book. If I hadn't bought it for Kindle I would have shredded it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Journey","review":"I saw this book on Oprah and I knew I had to read it.

Ms Gilbert is a very good writer but her self discovery does not seem to be enlightening at all. She came across as a narcissist and somewhat uncaring about the suffering around her. The book is not suppose to be a tourist guide but an emotional journey of someone who was in pursue of spirituality, peace, and communion with God and humanity. Regrettably, it does not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"Can I give this book zero stars? I read it for a book group, otherwise I'd have quit reading it after Italy.

What a waste of paper!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme narcissim","review":"I was flabergasted at the lack of sensitivity this woman portrayed toward others thoughts and practices. Frankly, I wanted to laugh at what she considers suffering. At times when she described having to go to a cold bathroom floor and beg \\"God\\" to help her escape the misery of her poor life. How many people could only wish for a cold bathroom floor and in Manhattan no less. Very self absorbed and pitiful. 0 stars !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure hogwash / so darn selfish author","review":"pure drivel... why this even made it on the bestseller list is beyond me...I'd rather read a teenagers diary, they don't sound as selfish and petty as Ms Gilbert usually.

Let me just say, the moment I picked it up , I despised this woman.I had a sense that this book was contrived from the first few pages, but then when I found out that she was given an advance before going on this so-called \\"self-journey\\", I shook my head in shame for dishing out money for this shameless account of selfish dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another turnoff","review":"Ostensibly about things spiritual, Eat, Pray, Love is IMO about nothing except its author. Narcissistic in the extreme and exceedingly repetitive (OK, we get it, you're depressed already), this memoir might better have been called \\"A Year in the Life of Elizabeth Gilbert\\". The author is to be applauded for taking a break from the life that apparently was destroying her soul, but there's not enough here of interest to others to warrant an entire book, unless you happen to care about Gilbert's every thought. Because I chose to stop reading it after the section on Italy, I'll stop writing about it here. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Believe It's a Bestseller","review":"I can't believe this book is a bestseller. I was so disappointed with the lack of an interesting story line. I kept reading thinking it will get better but it didn't. Maybe Gilbert shouldn't write when she is depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype?","review":"This book was really disappointing. Don't waste your time. It's a woe is me story, poor thing, have pity. Maybe I missed something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and enlightening---until the end.","review":"It was hard to put this book down, until the final third. Gilbert's description of the end of her marriage, followed by her determination to recover in Italy, India, and Bali were engrossing. The descriptions of her experiences in Italy and in the ashram in India, whatever their limitations, were enlightening and even charming.The problem, and probably the source of some of the reviewers' criticisms, is the book's final phase in Bali, where the author inexplicably shifts from appreciative descriptions of people whom she likes to a kind of cutesy \\"look at me, aren't I just amazing\\" literary voice. The change is a disappointment, and some of your reviewers have reacted badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Could Not Put it Down","review":"What a joy! I could not put this book down and immediately ordered several as gifts for friends and family.

Not my style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A woman's powerful jouney of self discovery","review":"I think that people who gave this a negative review have a hard time relating to other people and finding others interesting. I always say, \\"everyone has an interesting story.\\" Well, this writer chose to write a book about hers and I loved it. Who hasn't questioned their own decisions in life? Who can say 100% that each one of their decisions is perfect - no regrets. This writer is saying she's not perfect. Her marriage wasn't perfect. Her love life wasn't perfect. She's trying to figure things out and create something each one of us is capable of...fulfillment in life. Self-absorbed? More like humble. More like honest. I hope I learn from this to take more chances in life. Just because her journey is different than you or I would choose, doesn't mean it's wrong. It's her interesting journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be retitled \\"Laugh, B***H and Moan\\"","review":"While Ms. Gilbert has a wonderful sense of humor, it is buried beneath self pity and complaining. Her story is a search for God which I believe may of us go through in our life. Unfortunately Gilbert's journey is rife with indulgent self analysis that few people can relate to.I know too many people that have faced and conquered truly life shattering events and not only survived but extablished a relationship with God that is remarkable.I read this book with my book club and I am eager to see if anyone has the same reaction as mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Great","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I had great expectations, but I have to agree with some others that the constant whining and crying was hard to take. I don't feel as though she achieved any level of enlightenment, as it seemed more important to convey her very judgmental comments regarding ALL Republicans. It sounds like she is more of an immature Democratic tifoso. The Dr. Phil type character at the Ashram was so grating that I couldn't wait for him to go home!! The charitable inclination to help the family in Bali would have been admirable if she had not used it to write a best-seller. I do wish her the best on her spiritual journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Read It Anymore!!!","review":"Before reading this book, I've a high expectation and looking forward to read a fine book. After few pages, I cannot stand it and have to put the book down after each chapter. I just barely finished the journey in Italy and don't know if I can go on to finish the book.

However, when I finally sat down to read it, I couldn't believe how immature Ms. Gilbert came across. She babbles on and on about her \\"problems\\". Give me a break.

What is all the hype about? The author seems very naive and uneducated, especially considering she is almost a decade older than me. I found the book so frustrating and irritating that I couldn't read past the first of the three sections. All of the characters she described in her book were annoying- they reminded me of characters from a cheesy teenager movie. The book is promoted as an insightful and spiritual coming of age book but don't let the hype fool you.

So many seemed to like this book. Hello, it'd been done before.. Everyone should GROW UP ALREADY. Perhaps she should've volunteered in a country where there is real human suffering, (especially to women) the Middle east, Africa, etc. Then her life would be in perspective. All of you glowing reviewers should think about THAT! Perhaps the proceeds to the books, movie, and all this merchandise should go to a worthy charity.

Spoiled, self-absorbed rich girl, incapable of introspection, tours the planet feeling sorry for herself and finds happiness and true love. Had this been fiction, it would never have been published.

What?This book reminds me of why I avoid best-sellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is what it is.","review":"It's basically travel porn for white women of a certain age.Gilbert is the kind of US traveler for whom the whole world and all its people is about ME, ME, ME.And that includes the men, who have not much real ambition of their own except for finding the protagonist oh so wonderful.It was a big trope of novels in the sixties and seventies that the writer was married to a person who was death, death, death. And the writer broke away for life, life, life. Both genders wrote this stuff.\\"Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.\\"Reverse the genders and women would HATE this book, and the writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is so not worth the read","review":"I was excited when I got the book since I love learning about new cultures and food. The book could have been shorted to 3 chapters. Italy was not bad but her experience in India was rather monotonous. Don't even get me started on Indonesia. The part of her story where she tried to \\"help\\" the woman by raising money from her friends and family and then dictating to the woman how she should use it, felt narcissitic to me. Overall I am very disappointed with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glib and Shallow","review":"Gilbert writes well: the prose keeps the reader moving along through her adventures in middle-aged angst, and she is entertaining. But the book is supposed to take us through her personal growth and self-discovery, and I was left with the distinct impression that she finished her journeys every bit as self-involved and self-indulgent as she had started them. The people she encounters are two dimensional, either foils or backdrops (or both), and if there is any depth of feeling she developed, it is lost in her witticisms. A quick, light read, but disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent journey","review":"A thoroughly wonderful book. The author has a real gift of description. Parts were so funny and others were very poignant. I highly recommend sharing Elizabeth Gilbert's journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"There's a reason I often don't read non-fiction story-telling books.

'Nough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing.","review":"I couldn't get through this book, I felt depressed after reading the first half. I also felt like it was really slow paced. Maybe it's too close to my heart because I'm getting married soon, and nobody getting married wants to read about people falling out of love with their spouse.I thought it would be different, but I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did i read this whole book?","review":"I think it must have been because of the supershort chapters. I would never recommend it though. This woman obviously finds herself hilarious and enlightened. I admit, I did learn some interesting things about Italian and Indonesian culture. But I have to wonder how relevant it would be for a real person traveling and not some phony seeming (just my opinion) woman who is traveling just for the sake of traveling. Of course as someone who's never written a successful book this is all easy for me to say but I do read a lot and I am telling you- don't waste your time. Ugh it is so trite and predictable and I spent most of the time rolling my eyes. As I said I did finish the book so something about it must have compelled me forward but as I write this I can't quite put my finger on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doze. Sleep.

I don't want to give it 1 star because parts of it at least made me interested. But overall (until I stoped reading it)this book really didn't do it for me. I think first of all it was too spiritual to suit me and secondly I got really annoyed with the selfishness of Gilbert. I blame myself for the second part though - I should have realized that reading some other reviews and given the fact that the book is about one woman's life crisis. However I just found it bland and annoying. The part in Italy was ok (I think that this is because I have lived in Rome myself before) but it is the India part that made me give this book away. So many people recommended this book to me and I would too... if the person in question is really spiritual, to me it just got wierd."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overhyped book of 2008","review":"I truly can't understand what the excitement was all about with this book. This book is full of self absorbed drivel where the author carried on, and on, and on... about the demise of her marriage throughout the entire novel. I couldn't sympathise with her as the break up didn't appear to be that bad.I felt embarassed for her in the way she carried on about herself as though it was the worst thing in the world when outside the ashram in India was total poverty. Honestly don't waste your time or money on this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Woody Allen and Saul Bellow had a baby...","review":"If Woody Allen and Saul Bellow had a baby who inherited most of her parents' neuroses and love of self-analysis and very little of their talent, that baby would be Elizabeth Gilbert.Gilbert's writing style is okay. She was amusing at times and I found parts of her descriptions of her stay in India interesting. But I just couldn't get past the author's jaw-dropping obsession with herself. She simply isn't interesting enough to warrant it! I was pretty sick of her after about forty pages.Why do Oprah-ites think the way to \\"find yourself\\" is to spend 365 days thinking about yourself and nothing but yourself? Most of us in the real world know the true path to self-enlightenment comes thru \\"losing yourself.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Read","review":"I fell to the scepticism that surely if they made a movie about this book, it must be a great read. I have yet to see the movie and chose to read the book first.... much to my disappointment! I have been trying to finish it for 3 weeks now and cannot get into at all. I can hardly believe it made the best sellers list! I feel the author is terribly conceded in my opinion. I am not sure I will even waste time on the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality product","review":"the writing itself is wonderful, no doubt. It's the quality of the book I have a problem with. Usually Amazon is the best. However this book is falling apart by the day. The binding is a misnomer as it binds NOTHING. I have a handful of pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the money","review":"I could not finish this book. The section on \\"eating\\" in Italy was interesting as far as hearing about the food and language. The \\"praying seciton\\" started to bog down. Not a page-turner book at all. Several friends just could not finish it either. I made it almost through the \\"praying\\" section, but other folks I talked with could not even get that far. She needed to write a book to make some money after her divorce. Her publishing friends supported her in her time of need and pushed all the buttons to get this book hyped. But that is all it was--hyype--no substance. Don't waste your money. If you want to try reading it, go to the library or borrow it from a friend and don't spend the money buying it yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I read most of the reviews about this book, saw the author on TV, listen to my friends rave about it...but honestly it wasn't very good. It took me ages to get through and I found for the first time in my life skipping pages in order to finish it (or get over the really boring, overly wordy, insignificant parts)!!! I would not recommend the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check this book out of your library, but don't buy it","review":"There are already over 200 negative reviews of this book, so I don't know that I have much to add, except that my main reason for disliking the book is that I didn't find the author very likable. First off, this trip is all expenses paid by her book publisher, so that took away some of her credibility for me. Secondly, I just found her a bit too braggy and self absorbed to truly appreciate her stories. I hope the author is a nicer, more humble person in reality than she comes across in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous","review":"As the Title of the review suggests. Although there were certain injections of humor in some paragraphs and certain prudent characters; the rest of the book proved to be unenlightening and rather dull. What the author seems to constantly refer to seems only common sense to most. I really don't understand why the book is in the top seller list, unless because of a certain self indulged hypocrite. There are far more interesting books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully boring","review":"This was an immensely boring book! I would not recommend it.

I enjoyed her style of writing. This book was not what I expected at all but I thoroughly enjoyed it and will reread it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I just wanted to gag throughout the first quarter of the book. Never made it past her trip to Italy. Did you ever just want to punch a character in the face? That is how I felt with every turn of the page. Then to find out this wasn't her taking a risk in life by going on a journey of self discovery, she was sponsored by a publisher to find herself - in other words, get paid to \\"experience\\" crap that you can twist into a plot and sell to the ugly masses. Shame on me for being a consumer and buying the hype. Refused to watch the movie, even when it was free on a plane because I was still upset with wasted my money on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could be so depressed...","review":"If you have ever struggled in your life at all, you cannot relate to this woman. If everyone in the world had her problems we would be living in a utopia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bestsellers are not necessarily the best","review":"They sell! People recommend them. Gilbert is here on target. She is a NOW WRITER. She fills the expectations of a fast read tackling current \\"Inside Edition\\"-similar info on affluent modern women's woes. But her road to finding herself is painful,redundant and finally kitsch-like. A pity, since she is talented. Before her search to find herself she should have put the bestselling philosopher David Precht in her purse. Reading encouraging Amazon reviews, I may, however, give her previous book \\"An American Man\\" a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, thought provoking, educational","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Particularly the time in India. Shows how one can change. Recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disingenuous","review":"I could barely stand to read this book. I only read it because it was a book club choice. After the kudos it has gotten I at first felt like there was something wrong with me when I didn't like the book, the author, or anything she stood for. As a woman who did not have children, I at first felt some sympathy with her about not wanting children, but then the way she went about dealing with that issue was pretty selfish. She is a narcissistic person and I do not believe that she really experienced anything valuable (or teaches a thing) with her travel experiences and that rings loud and clear through her whiny \\"poor me\\" voice. To quote another reader, she is very annoying. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary journey","review":"This is a wonderful book that I recommend to have fun (it is a light read!) and also one to find wisdom. After Liz Gilbert's divorce she takes you on an extraordinary journey through Italy, India and Indonesia, and to the depths of her soul. This is one brilliant and inspiring story, not only could I not put the book down, but I also felt empowered as a woman because of her honest and sincere accounts.Through her quest for enlightenment and peace, Liz reminded me of another book Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment by Ariel & Shya Kane. The Kanes'inspirational and casual stories have touched my heart deeply and also made me smile in awe. Thru their pages I remember how rich and sweet life can be. Bravo! to both Gilbert and the Kanes for bringing us enlightenment for this day and age."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't understand the hype","review":"I really didn't care for this book. I was so looking forward to it, I really was. It was just so drawn out....I just about gave up when the book gets to India. AND as someone who loves India and lived there for nearly year that is saying a lot. The beginning is okay. The middle is way too long, and the end is quite humorous. I loved the parts in Bali. That being said I don't think it was worth reading through the 1st two parts of the book to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"too self centered to be of interest to anyone but the author","review":"If you know Ms. Glibert personally perhaps you will enjoy this work as a way to understand the writer a little better. For the rest of us: it reads as the all America ego trip and stands as a perfect illustration as to why we are considered bad/poor (but rich) world travelers.The writing was juvenile in its metaphors, similies and imagery and it was more of a first person lecture than it was a story or a personal observation of life.I didn't hate it as much as others; probably, because i didn't have high expectations to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought the film because Julia Roberts was in it. Even with her in it, the best I could rate it is horrible... story line, directing, music.......even Julia. Im sure there is a story behind why Julia chose to do the movie, and why she looked so horrible. Save your money , this is a low budget film you can let go by without any regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"I couldn't connect with this book.

Don't know why everyone raved over it.I would'nt recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"eat ,pray, love","review":"Not my kind of book, Character was too self involved. Couldn't relate to character or her life style. How many people can break away and travel for that long: very few I expect. All she talked was about herself. I rather hear about the places and the people more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"With all the hype and a long wait at the library, I expected more. I loved the author's style and her ability to laugh at herself. I love words too, as she obviously does--in many language--and I loved when she gave the history of their origins. That said, she was so self-absorbed, and I wasn't much interested in all the navel-gazing. Skip section two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia","review":"This book is fantastic! It is an adventure of mind, body and spirit. It is funny, intense and unbelievably well written. It is what the journey of self-discovery can and should be. Give this book to all your friends, male and female. They will love it and so will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I drank this book UP!","review":"I drank this book up! I counldn't put it down! Elizabeth Glibert wrote 'Eat,Pray,Love' in a way that speaks directly to her reader and she made the journey humorous and so enjoyable.

To call this a chick book is degrading. I truly felt sorry for the author at times. Does she not realize how pathologically egotistical she presents herself as? Apathetic. Self centered. Shallow. Conceited. Amoral. I had to stop and erase it from my Kindle once she alluded to her Bill Clinton sexual fantasies. Actually, that fit the book in a nutshell.

I'm an atheist and was initially reluctant to read her book, but instead I enjoyed her discussions of life, religion, sex,food, in Rome.....\\"the one word description most apt for Rome is...\\"sex\\"; but what about the Vatican, it's in Rome? \\"The word for the vatican is \\"power\\"!And I was delighted to learn the source of the Italian lanugage was a poet!, Dante Alihgieri, whose \\"Davina Commedia\\" published in early 14th century,in Itanian, not latin; Just one of many interesting facts you will learn from this author,and she also includes much good humor, human interest, and philosophical thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"I wish I was her - I would love to have this life and travel her travels!!!

One in English and one in Spanish. The book is funny, and fun to read. It make me laugh and at the same time make me think a lot about myself. Every woman could feel identified at one point or another with the writer.I read the book so fast that I want to read it again, but this time stopping to think more about parts that should be giving more time.A good mix of spirituality, meditation and humor.PilarSantiago, Chile"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in the beginning...then is went downhill.","review":"This book was very fun to read when the author was in Italy. Her character really began to develop and the way she wrote made you care about her failing marriage and her depression. However, when she gets to India, the book loses momentum (halfway in book). I just think there is so much more she could have done with showing the difference in lifestyle and culture from being in Italy to going to an ashram. Once she gets to Indonesia, it isn't very clear exactly what her purpose is (although it is supposed to be to let go and have the wild love affair with the Brazilian guy). I didn't feel connected to her character anymore and frankly, I couldn't wait for the book to end and found myself wanting to stop reading it toward the last few pages. I left it on the plane for someone else.Integrative Nutrition"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another narcissistic endeavor","review":"what is with all these narcissists and their books.

It was an \\"I feel sorry for me\\" book from the first page. It became difficult to continue reading about how easily she made friends and how she cried constantly, isn't that kind of incongruous? It dragged me down trying to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that it matters","review":"not that my opinion matters because if you want to buy this book you will do so no matter what reviews you read. with that said i suggest checking this book out at your local library before you purchase it. if you can read the first 30 pages and actually find one redeeming quality then maybe this book is for you, however i will not share in that opinion. the author whines about how terrible her life is for the first half of the book and then the second half of the book, well i didn't get that far. that's how disturbed i was with her complaining (side note: all of her problems she was experiencing were self induced). maybe if the author wasn't so self absorbed the book would be palpable. all i have to say is \\"boo hoo. cry me a river so i can swim in your tears.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY OVERHYPED BOOK","review":"I must be in the minority who really didn't like the book.

This book may put me off bestsellers for good--my natural inclination anyhow. So many missed opportunities to explore in depth some of these fascinating subjects, especially involving religion and spirituality. The author never really uses her lively mind to engage with the questions posed by the various religions she encounters, opting instead for what sounds like a pretty glib relativism. She skims the surface of these subjects in a trendy prose style, and her basic stance is familiar and predictable.And the extreme wordiness! Many times she's chewing on more than she's bitten off! Too often the result comes across as tiresome, self-absorbed, and superficial. But not altogether unappealing. She just needs to gain greater discipline in her thinking and writing and to attempt greater depth.At the end, though, I couldn't discern why anyone should be interested in this person's life or this writer's thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtext: \\"Hey Ex-husband, how ya like me now?\\"","review":"I was looking forward to reading this popular book and expected something light and pleasurable. I could not suspend judgement enough to tolerate her flippant, jokey, self-absorbed insights, and hope that I can spare you from wasting a precious moment of your life reading this book. I feel like the whole book is in some way a sort of act of revenge on an ex-husband. She comes off as a narcissist. Self-promotion is her main talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I picked up this book for some light vacation reading, and found myself stuck on a plane with it and very disappointed not to have chosen something else!While I for the most part enjoyed \\"Eat\\", I gave up during \\"Pray\\", and never made it to \\"Love\\". I just didn't care.There was nothing in Gilbert's story to suggest that she deserved any sympathy or feelings of empathy on the part of the reader. She was living what sounded like a charmed life, took herself out of a fine, if uninspiring, marriage and into a clearly dysfunctional relationship, over which she embarked on a year-long, publisher-funded pity party.It's a terrible thing to be stranded in the airport, your flight cancelled, and a book you can't finish. Now that's something to feel bad about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really can't figure out why people like this book","review":"The biggest mystery of \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is its popularity. Why on earth do people like this book? All it did was really annoy me. Wouldn't it be wonderful if everyone had the luxury of opting out of real life for a year to embark on a voyage of self-discovery? I don't think there's anything remarkable about her journey or insights (at least until half-way through Indonesia, which is where I gave up on this incredibly vapid memoir). I think it was the incessant whining that really got me. The reality of divorce recovery is such a far cry from the self-indulgent ramblings presented in this book that I don't feel Ms. Gilbert deserves any kind of congratulations. Normal people have to deal with work, and kids, and paying the bills, and not getting child support. Show me a story from a woman who figures out how to discover herself while maintaining a household and we might be getting somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"I don't understand what all the negative reviews are about. I truly loved this book. I think these people are too critical and need to lighten up. I could hardly put the book down. I thought it was funny, light hearted, and an interesting adventure.

If you want an easy and fun read, and learn a few things along the way, read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - Gets you from the first page","review":"I can only read a little at a time without being interupted by my Toddler, however, this book is a great read and searches the soul of a woman who is going through some changes in her life by capturing her travels, eating and finding that prayer works for her in ways that she could not imagine. Not preachy whatsoever, just a great inspirational read. Recommended for all woman and men too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Normally, even if I hate a book, I have to finish it but Eat, Pray, Love was an exception. Terrible! So pissed that I wasted my money on it. We chose it for our book club one month because none of us had read it before, well we soon found out there was a good reason for this. The only positive thing about the part of the book I actually read was a few lines about life, depression and happiness that were well written but the rest was rubbish. Never again will I read something that Oprah has recommended. Of course she would love this book because she is a rich woman who could also easily drop everything and go on a journey to discover happiness if she so desired. Don't waste your money people!

I have less than half way to go, and I can't stop there when I've gotten this far. I really wish I could, I AM SUFFERING. I usually am very lenient with rating books, however this one is THAT horrible. There is no story, no purpose really -- at least not yet -- and I force myself to read it.

I hated to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun, honest read","review":"This book made me want to travel again. I loved the way she wrote. I thought she was very honest about what she went through in her life and found it to be a fun and easy book to read.

We discussed it in my book group and we all really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My search has ended...","review":"I bought this book because I loved the title. From the very first page you become hooked. This memoir reads like a novel. Elizabeth Gilbert has a writing style that grabs you and won't let go. I was sorry when I got to the end because I wanted this book to go on and on. I have since bought this book for other friends because I know they would enjoy it and ordered her other books that I can't wait to devour. I have found a wonderful new author--praise to you Elizabeth Gilbert."},{"rating":"1","title":"tripe for the soul","review":"The Last American Man was a great book but this was a weak attempt loaded with rationalizations. Disappointed that she didn't draw a lot of hoots and hollers from Italian men, she goes on to explain that it isn't because she's not as attractive at 35 as she was at 23. No, it's that Italian men don't yell at the babes anymore. Oh and she meant to gain weight in Italy. blah"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!!!","review":"I am in complete awe of Ms. Gilbert for not only convincing someone to pay her to travel for a year but also taking something that resembles a poorly-written teenage diary and making a best-seller out of it.

It was boring. I've just finished the part on Italy, a country I have been to twice and absolutely adore, and could barely get through it. Her characters, who are real people, are not even brought to life by her writing style and I honestly don't even feel sorry for her trials and tribulations. She had a heinous divorce because she no longer wanted to be married. Hardly the stuff soul searching is made of.And I guess because it is so fresh in my mind, I dispute her interpretation of why Italy has never been a world power.

Appauling!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just off-putting","review":"Like many, after hearing so my hype about this book, I bought it. After reading only the first five pages, I was put off by the author's tone. She is glib, obnoxious and self-depreciating--and not in a humorous way. The tone only grew more arrogant as I read the rest of the novel, and I'm still not sure where I see her attaining spiritual growth...I see her eating too much, whining about her pants not fitting, and shacking up with some man at the end despite swearing off men.I had realized the book wouldn't be a travelogue, and being a memoir, would focus on the author; however, the author is very unlikeable and doesn't seem to see anything outside herself.I was just completely disappointed by the novel, and it pained me to finish it...I just kept hoping it would redeem itself; however, it only got worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"I gave this as a gift for a recently divorced friend and she just loved it.

I got to page 105 and couldnt take it anymore! Poorly written, in that she threw in pieces of writing style that were clearly not hers and forced as they did not exist throughout the book such as her description of the meat hanging in the butcher shops in Italy, and the beginning where she starts with \\"I wish Giovanni would kiss me...\\". an attempt to periodically inject a writing style that is by itself interesting but not her own or consistent throughout the book. It seemed to me that her overreaction to her awful marriage was pathetic and unwarranted and the person who probably really suffered a horrible marriage was her husband and not the writer - pathetically weak and melodramatic. I resent having helped fund this as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Cannot believe someone paid her to write this!!!","review":"First off this book is a waste of money!I cannot believe someone paid Elizabeth Gilbert to write this book.It's sick and horrible. She cries at night and wishes she died. She does not want kids. It's obvious she has some kind of mental issue with herself. She never appreciated what she had.

A book good for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"327 Pages of Self-Indulgent Logorrhea","review":"I have come to detest Liz Gilbert and her sorry, indulgent life. Too much money, too much privilege, too little warmth and charm. There is no mind behind all this weak, silly babbling. If a word somehow fires off a neuron she repeats this word many unconnected times, stream of consciousness style, interspersed with chirpy factoids right out of the travel guide. I can't understand why any sensible person at GQ actually paid her for writing anything.It is truly frightening to have such a vapid mind revealed. What makes it worse is blithe disregard for grubby stuff like earning a living or helping another human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"My mom bought me this book as I'm planning a trip to Italy in the fall. After reading through the first half of the book, I won't be investing any more time in this garbage. The other 1 star reviews pretty much sum it up: the writer is a spoiled, depressed, uninteresting person that I truly do not want to know. She clearly sails through life with ease and yet every chapter is about how she is depressed or how her surroundings do or do not compound her depression. I really don't care. Her one-sentence critiques of historic monuments and millenia-old cities reflect the impression a 13 year old might have, while we are subjected to a few chapters on her BORING enlightenment and personal details.

For anyone who has ever experienced a broken heart or unhappiness in a relationship, you should read this book. Gilbert puts alot of thought and emotion into her writing. Some people didn't like that she focused on herself so much. That was the point!!! For her to find herself and figure out who she was since she had lost herself in the relationship she was in. She had to relearn how to be by herself again. This book is one of the best books I have read so far. You should read this book and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Service by Amazon","review":"This book was a great suggestion; received it very quickly; I am more than very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"egregious at every page","review":"this has to be one of the most pretentious books i have every read. garbage through and through. if you have a fireplace..."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank you amazon...","review":"...because I thought I was the only person who really did not like this memoir. The chapters in Italy hit every Tuscan Sun caricature imaginable, and somewhere in the middle -- I believe it was in India -- I drifted off and found it impossible to stay with the main character's rambling prose without bribing myself to keep reading. In the end, I forced myself to read this because everyone in my office raved about it. From now on, I don't listen to their advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Crock!!","review":"Didn't like it at all.I finished the book to see if there was anything redeming about it and to see what ALL THE FUSS IS over this book. The answer is no, nada, nothing, zilch, zipp. I wound up caring so little about the author when all is said and done. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same same -- agree with C Quinn","review":"This book was chosen for our bookclub. Ugh. I agree that I'm uncomfortable with helping fund the author's trip -- although I didn't actually buy the book. It's popularity, however, got it into my library system. Ugh, again!I can tell that this book has an audience but, the audience that is impressed by this story of selfishness and \\"spiritual growth\\" is rather difficult for me to understand. Spiritual growth in order to have a sexual interlude that lasts for several nights? Did we need to know all that?I couldn't shake this book out of my hand fast enough. Hate to even take it back to the library where some other unsuspecting reader is required to read it for their bookclub. There are some good sections, especially the part about Italian food and, I do have to say that it is a well-written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully boring and narcissistic","review":"Being an avid reader and having four days on a retreat with no access to tv, phone or internet I thought I would have plenty of time to enjoy and finish this book. To my dismay, I could not make myself read this book and am still trying to read it for my book club but the author reminds me of a spoiled child that didn't like what she found in marriage so she chose to run and take the advance on her book to pay for her escape and we all must suffer through her narcissistic story. Her view of her self importance is revolting. I would not recommend this book. It is doubtful that I will finish it, this book is not an enjoyable read and if I do finish it will be soley for the purpose of being able to discuss it fully at the book club meeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"talented but self-important writer","review":"E. G.'s novel \\"Stern Men\\" is one of my all-time favourite books, so I had high expectations for Eat Pray Love. I also enjoyed \\"Pilgrims\\" very much. This book was disappointing. Granted it's an autobiography/memoir; but as I read I found myself becoming so irritated with Gilbert's self-absorption that I quit half-way through. Maybe I'm cynical, but the fact that she already had a big advance and contract for the book under her belt before undertaking this so-called quest to find some meaning and balance in her life makes me wonder how authentic the characters and experiences really are. Someone told me, \\"it's a very inspirational story.\\" It only inspired me never to read anything other than fiction by Elizabeth Gilbert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat Pray Love","review":"Kinda like \\"been there, done that\\" so this type of fluff is rather boring. Sort of like a hippe-wannabe 'cept the author actually got paid a pretty penny for letting the reader witness her mindless meandering. The reader ends up being her shrink, and pity, has got to pay for the honor. Very self serving. Don't have enough emotion invested in this to \\"hate it\\" so the product ends up getting two stars instead of one. Really - yawn - not recommended. Waste if time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Pleasure","review":"I'm just starting to read books about the quest for spiritualiy and I really didn't expect to enjoy this one as much as I did. I really liked Liz Gilbert and found her journey both enlightening and entertaining. From the looks of the other reviews it seems most people either loved or hated the book. I suppose it depends on one's level of spirituality. It's hard to imagine an enlightened person being outraged by this charming story. I intend to reccomend Eat, Love, Pray to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring...","review":"All I really want to say is, this book is inspiring. I have loved taking this very intimate walk with the author to grow closer to God. Through her specific experiences, I have been inspired to do more in my own practice. She has a lot of courage and a gift with words. I appreciate her humility in describing the challenges she had in \\"letting go\\" and changing her thinking. She is very open, real and puts herself out there for the world to see. I thank her for that and wish her the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying from the beginning","review":"I waited for this book from the library for a few weeks and finally got it! I started to read it with the excitement which wore off after a couple of pages, when I found myself thinking about something else while reading... The author is trying to be funny and philosophical, but is simply annoying and shallow, and self-absorbed! I gave this book 2 stars for the idea and because I learned about the meaning of beads in Eastern meditation. I may try to read it further, hoping to find some more educational facts about the places the author visited. But it is definitely not going to touch my soul! Too much crying on the floor over nothing! If you want a good memoir read: \\"Three dog life\\" - simple, deep, very engaging, and \\"The glass castle\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it...disappointing","review":"I only give this book two stars because I did enjoy the first \\"book\\" and that's why I give this two stars instead of one. However, the whining of the author gets annoying and it's also the same stuff repeated over and over throughout the book. Elizabeth Gilbert comes across as very shallow and self-absored throughout the book. I just had a very difficult time seeing her point of view as far as how horrible her life was because she didn't know what she wanted from it. This book did not live up to the reviews written and the hype around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucko","review":"I was interested in reading this book because someone told me it changed her life. It changed my life too, because now I have resolved not to ever read this author again. She is a talented writer, but the level of self-involvement and navel-gazing in this book is not to be believed. No matter how the author dresses it up, my take on her novel is that she dumped her husband, was dumped by her subsequent boyfriend, then embarked on a world trek to find another man. Once that mission was accomplished, her \\"spiritual journey\\" ended and she came right home. The longer I read the novel, the less I liked it, and my sentiment as I closed the book was, who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't make it past page 20.","review":"This is my first review and the embarrassing part is, I didn't even get past page 20. My sister accidentally left the book at my place after she visited, and as the mother of 3 with so little free time, I just couldn't bear to fill it with this kind of literature. I could just feel where it was going when, in the same paragraph, discussions about her \\"gorgeous\\" lover are intertwined with something this woman wanted to portray as spirituality, especially she talks about her own enlightened hindsight. I felt SO relieved when I read these reviews that confirmed my hunches."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge waste of time and money...","review":"I wish I could hit a fast forward button and see where this author is then....Ask yourself \\"what do i really, really, want today\\" ? What a piece of great advice.Oprah said on her show \\"the happiest part of my day today, will be talking to you\\" (the author).That is truly sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find Yourself Midlife Crisis porn","review":"My objection to porn is not the sex, but that it makes sex look ugly. The same in my opinion can be said for \\"Eat Pray Love\\" and books like it: they make self-discovery, travel, spirituality, romance, etc. look ugly. Very, very ugly. But millions of women lap it up like a double latte sugar bomb and the authors and publishers laugh all the way to the bank.There are many outstanding woman writers out there - it's a shame that writers like Gilbert are the ones who get the spotlight.A film version is opening this summer - it was only a matter of time of course. Julia Roberts has gone from the trite hooker with a heart of gold drivel of \\"Pretty Woman\\" to this. Guess we haven't really come such a long way after all, baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the big deal?","review":"I can't undertand what all the hype is about this book. It is average and very superficial. Many people of Gilbert's generation have done what she has done, the travelling, the divorce, the ashrams, the search for self awareness - the only difference is she must have had some very good connections in the literary world to get this book published as I am very sure thousands could do better and make it more interesting. Gilbert comes across as very irritating and full of herself. Why are they making a movie of this tripe? Please!! Also she gives seminars now??? There must be a lot of very shallow people out there who would follow this kind of thing as 'inspirational'. It is CHICK LIT, nothing more and nothing less.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"A nauseating travelogue of a conceited self indulgent 30 something.Incredibly hard to finish, but I forced myself.The first part of the book she spends howling on her bathroom floor.I am soooo glad when she starts on the anti depressants but then she stops...big mistake.Italy, hmmm she drools over her 20 something language partner, eats and buys underwear to take to the Ashram.India she discovers she can't meditate. And talks. A lot.Bali she self obsesses more, I really was glad her ex did well in the divorce.I really felt for the poor guy.I think she would've done better had she stayed in a psychiatric facility and stayed on her meds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe anyone?","review":"I made the mistake of buying this book to take to the hospital where my 10 year old daughter was \\"living\\" for two months while they figured out how to eradicate an infection threatening her spinal fluid. So, to be fair, only something very profound could have matched the situation, but, this, decidedly, was a grossly shallow and unfortunate miscalculation on my part.The woman is a garden variety neurotic. Irritating. Period. And reading her journey is about as appealing as digging into a steaming bowl of entrails. They look good, but, in the end, we know what they are and that makes them hard to swallow.I wish a publisher would say, screw the money...Elizabeth dear, get thee to a shrink and quit boring us all. (By the way, I never made it to India with this woman...I ran screaming midway through Italy) I would have given it one star, but I found the tiny strings of Italian palatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read","review":"I guess I have been picking up God awful books lately because I finally liked this book.:) It helps that I have been to the places she has. Even an Ashram. I have done the whole Guru thing while I was very young and I think it took me back. I had similar feelings in certain situations and some I dont agree with her. For example I did not find Rome so charming but loved Venice. Anyways, it is no Pulitzer winner but an easy, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed woman takes self-absorbed journey...","review":"I really can't call this a full review it as I couldn't get past the first leg of her journey in Italy. This was chosen by a member of my book club. I read 30 pages and put it down and dreaded picking it up again. I managed about 50 more pages but couldn't go back. The author's tone is whiny and tries too hard to be witty. I had no sympathy for her so I could not get invested in her need to find herself. I will gladly pass this book along rather than have it waste space on my shelf as I have no desire to continue the author's \\"journey\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would be better.","review":"I really thought it would be better due to hearing rave reviews about this book..and the premise seemed interesting but i was very disappointed. Fortunately, I rented the book at the library. Anyways, i found the author to be trivial and immature at times..the book also lagged on..and I don't know how i made it up to page 84..but after that i couldn't take anymore and i returned the book back to the library. I hear they're going to make a movie out of this book. I just hope it isnt as boring as the book. Although, I'm dubious about that because Julia roberts isn't exactly a great actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book so highly rated?","review":"I don't know why this book was on the best sellers list for so long. I normally love to read and always finish my books but I just can't finish this one. I can't relate to her at all and wonder if anyone who has a somewhat normal life with responsibilities such as a husband, kids, career, housework, bills, aging parents, etc. relates? I got so tired of her trials with meditation, prayer, and travels...she doesn't know what REAL problems are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I couldn't agree more with all the \\"one star\\" reviewers. I was looking forward to reading of her impressions of living abroad but instead it was all about her and her depression for which she refused to take prescribed medication. Don't waste your time, so glad I didn't puchase this, it was a library book, waste of tax dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Woe is ME!","review":"I can not understand what the hype is for this book. I just could not get over how pathetic the author is, and how overly self absorbed she is. I found it so difficult to relate to this person who suddenly decides one day she doesn't want to be married anymore (for no apparent reason than her own selfishness). This was so disturbing to me...she had said a vow at some time, right? I had trouble getting past the Italy section. I could not put up with another minute of the author's descriptions of what a \\"victim\\" she is that I decided to drop the book all together when 6 people in my book club were not in love with the book or the author much more than me."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book, happy to be shared","review":"of course this book is great. i purchased three to give out as gifts for christmas. they're loving it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"Excellent read. It is a lovely, personal story in three parts. I have recommended it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing . . .","review":"I found this book to be neither insightful or humorous. Okay writing, very self-absorbed, somewhat tedious, rather pointless. I am very surprised by the number of good reviews. It really seemed that she just wanted to feel loved again and that the sex and companionship at the end was all she really needed/wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very divisive","review":"I have never before felt compelled to write a review about a book, but Eat, Pray, Love is such a divisive book that I feel obligated to weigh in. Prior to reading it, I had heard people raving about how great it was and looked forward to seeing what all the fuss was about. Once I realized that her \\"journey\\" was a direct result of her leaving her husband and indulging her own fantasies, I almost put it down. Only curiosity kept me reading, and I began to enjoy reading about her time in Italy in sort of a superficial way. It didn't take long, however, for my initial instincts to kick back in. I struggled to finish the book and could not identify with what I considered to be selfish and irresponsible acts by the author. I can understand why some people may enjoy this book, but to those who have been dealt a tougher hand, it seems a little shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't get through this book","review":"This was picked as a book club book, the library owns no copies, so I had to buy it. I am half way through (book club meeting was last week) and I doubt I'll even bother to pick it back up. This woman is too whiny and I just want to smack her one good time! She keeps going off on tangents and can't keep on track. Waste of money in my opinion. Would never buy another one of her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"i had heard so much about this book and got on a waiting list at the library to get it. i was to have the book back in seven days as it was a \\"waiting list\\" item. i became so disinterested with the book, that it took me over two weeks to finish it and get it back to the library. i had to make myself finish it. i thought it would be an inspirational book about healing after a divorce and finding your purpose in life, but it's no more than the author's preoccupation with sex. thus, the book is just some sexual odessey through italy, indonesia and bali. it's crude at times, and for me was a disappointment. the author goes into such detail on some pages, i had to take a break and put the book down. it became so boring. i, in all honesty, would not recommend it to any of my friends or family. i wonder at times how the hype can get so huge on a book like this. how does it start?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I should have listened to the negative reviews of this one. Great title, but beyond that it fell flat. I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one. I'd just finished my book of the year in Michele Cozzens' A Line Between Friends and to get the bad taste out of my mouth with Eat, Pray Love, I think I'll go back and read A Line Between Friends again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of a Good Title","review":"The author may be an intelligent writer, but this piece is very depressing and seems to have too much focus on the authors life and it comes across as quite selfish. A me, me, me story. I am only into the second CD and want to take it back to the library. I am glad to have not wasted any money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"After reading the first 22 pages I had heard enough of this woman's pity party. The Introduction alone was enough to get under my skin. Granted I received this book as a gift and probably never would have purchased a book with the word \\"pray\\" in the title but LAY OFF THE GOD TALK LADY!! Maybe this book gets inspirational but I personally don't want to waste my time figuring it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely annoying","review":"After hearing all the hype, I bought the book and was psyched to read it. I was a little wary through the eat section, but thought it was pretty entertaining. But by the time she got to India, I was completely over it. Pretentious, repetitive claptrap. If you are the type of person who likes \\"The Secret\\" this is in your wheelhouse, but people who aren't searching for a spiritual awakening (or who don't want to hear about the voices that guide us)should steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regurgitate, Curse, Loathe","review":"I had also heard all the hype for this book and bought it without reading the Amazon reviews (a mistake I don't plan to repeat. I don't often quit books, but I was very tempted. I scanned my way through most of it. I find it interesting that someone can ramble on and on without ever making a point, yet somehow get a bestseller out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, hard to finish reading, hated every second of each page..","review":"Horribly written book, I made it to page 292 and couldn't FORCE myself to read any longer, I had too many other good books waiting. I was disappointed, everyone said this book was amazing, interesting, and clever - I couldn't get past the author's selfishness and obsession with food and her EX husband. Horrible horrible horrible !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I can read just about anything and like many of the other dissatisfied readers TRIED my darndest to enjoy this book. I too was unable to read past mid India. The breaking point for me was when she heard a story from her \\"dear friend\\" the Nat Geo photographer who had met men and women who had climbed Everest among other mind boggling and over achieving feats - and OF COURSE her response was to make it about HERSELF and how her spiritual enlightenment was far more impressive and superior. I threw the book down in disgust and never looked back. In no way do I admire this woman. As another reviewer said she is the type of woman you see at a cocktail party and run the other way. I don't at all pity or sympathize with her. It is truly sad that we, the reader are expected to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-discovery? Nah, just self-absorbed","review":"You have to really like someone to put up with their extended, detailed descriptions of self-discovery. Otherwise, they come across as hugely self-absorbed and self-centered. Despite Ms. Gilbert's proclamations throughout the book that she is extremely likeable, that she has many, many friends who find her likeable, and that even God finds her likeable...she comes across firmly in the \`hugely self-absorbed' category to me. Some of her descriptions of people and places are funny and worthwhile, but mostly she's like listening to an annoying pseudo-friend who asks you \`how you are' because they really only want to tell YOU how THEY are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I could hardly drag myself through this book. The first chapter was captivating. I throughly enjoyed the narrative voice and the content of the Italian section. The two following sections weren't nearly as engaging as the first one. I could have rated this book much higher had it only been the first section and nothing more.The two later sections, India and Indonesia, were not much more than a lot of complaining. There wasn't much insightfulness in those sections, it was like two totally different books than the first Italian section.I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever!","review":"This is absolutely the best purchase I have made all year long! The book Eat, Pray, Love is fascinating, heart-wrenching (in a good way), and comforting all in one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserving Drama Queen","review":"Can't like this. No matter the raves of friends and Oprah, I found the protagonist's gripes petty, reactions unconvincing and explanations too long. Don't get me wrong, I like some good break-up drama. I just couldn't sympathize with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat Pary Love Review","review":"This book makes you want to set out on your own adventure and find something that makes you happy. Wandering around the world is suddenly interesting to me and makes me want to take charge in my life and find something new. Starting a new beginning is always a tough task being a woman because you have appearance and acceptance to think about. Eat Pray Love, makes you forget about your negative life, puts you in someone elses shoes and shows you how one moan dealt with it. It is very inspirational and makes you think twice about your decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype - rubbed me the wrong way","review":"May be it's because i was born in a less affluent nation than Elizabeth Gilbert - but this was just another example of the culture of American affluence and focus on shamelessly putting sexual and sensual gratification above everything else in life - another sex in the city.I just just don't get that happily married woman will leave her affluent life and her husband to get laid in other countries by foreign men in place of finding something more constructive and meaningful. but then, it's her life and she is feel free to do what she wants to do with it - it just did not make an interesting read. I could only force myself to read a few pages, then had to skip through. I tried sampling other pages but same garbage and self gratification followed.thankfully, I was able to sell it at the college and get rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy from seller \\"LIGHTSCRIBE\\"","review":"Do not order any books from LIGHTSCRIBE. We placed an order for this book \\"Eat, Pray Love\\" back in August 2010. It is now mid december and we have not received any book. We realized belatedly that this seller has 0% positive feedback. Amazon.com really should prohibit this seller from using Amazon.com's marketplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read, Read, Read!","review":"I wasn't enthused when my book club chose this. The travel memoir as tale of self-discovery has been done. But reading Elizabeth Gilbert is like catching up with your funniest, most sensitive friend. Unlike other reviewers, I really didn't need her to offer up any post-divorce wisdom, observations on Indian poverty, or anthropological insights on the Balinese. I can get that elsewhere. This book entertains. Yes, she can come off as self-indulgent (claiming to pass on meeting the Dali Lama -- as if). But I couldn't help liking her and I thoroughly enjoyed her company. This is a good, fun, summer read. Maybe the title misleads; wisdom seekers can skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The more I read, the more I disliked the author","review":"The book is well written and entertaining up until Italy (chapter 36) then it gets boring and preachy. The thing that made the book almost unbearable in the end is how much I grew to dislike the author as the book went on. She just seems self centered and self indulgent throughout the entire book that made me ask this question in the end - why does she deserve a happy ending? A simple advise for anyone thinking of reading this book - you can spend your time more wisely than read about someone who is so unhappy with herself and full of herself at the sametime (sounds contradictory but this my thought)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many political opinions","review":"This is an entertaining book if you enjoy reading about someone who is self-absorbed and doesn't realize how great our country is. I was enjoying the book until the author kept dogging the government and Bush/Republicans. I don't appreciate paying for a book and the author write about her political opinions. I hope the movie is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better, a lot better!","review":"I really expected to like and sympathize with the author and her story but the opposite happened. Right from the beginning it is clear that this woman is a selfish, weak-minded brat. I would LOVE for her ex-husband to come out with his own book about what happened in their marriage since Ms. Gilbert does not share any details; probably because it would make her look really bad. I struggled through the middle when she was in India- boring! It had a few nice moments, hence two stars, but I don't understand why people rave about this book and think she is so inspiring. The annoyance that is Julia Roberts is the perfect actor to portray this woman and her little tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and real...but not real serious","review":"I am surprised that people are up in arms because this isn't a serious spiritual book or that is was all about the author. It was her journey and her memoir. Of course it was all about her. I didn't expect it to be life changing so I wasn't upset, but I did find many of her thoughts and ideas provocative. I really enjoyed her story and her truth. It doesn't mean that it matches mine. I liked her realness, her warts per se and how she didn't take herself to seriously in her quest. I find her relationship with God interesting because it is both reverent and irreverent. But I think God can handle that just fine. At least I hope so. I look forward to reading more of her work....but I am not looking for her to be my Guru...perhaps just another guide. I didn't even feel like I read the same book that some of you reviewed."},{"rating":"2","title":"very, very nice","review":"You might very well think that a book which someone's travels to various countries in order to \\"find herself\\" would not be all that interesting. In fact, reading the back cover, I shuddered to think about how incredibly bored I was going to be. But this thing got good reviews, so I thought I'd give it a chance.What makes the difference with this book is not necessarily the subject matter, the interesting locales (in fact, they aren't that interesting), or the revelations.THE WRITING is what makes all the difference in the world. Gilbert knows how to write. She knows how to catch your attention and get you to consistently and freely laugh. She can make you think, and she can paint a character very, very well.Things got weak towards the end of the book, but you have to forgive a little bit, as the author did have some wrapping up to do. I definitely recommend this book to others, and I plan to purchase copies to give as presents."},{"rating":"2","title":"I \\"LOVE\\" this book!","review":"There is nothing better than cozying up on the couch with a great book that you just can't put down and that not only makes you think, but truly delivers!From the introduction, I knew I would devour this memoir about the author's adventures revolving around different types of LOVE in three different and completely unique cultures: (1) in Italy for the love of food, words and coversations; (2) in India for the love of spirituality, and learning to love, forgive, and be herself; and (3) in Indonesia for the love of balance, helping others and romantic love.The book is so beautifully written, I find myself thinking about various parts of it weeks after I have finished it. I also must have underlined a quarter of the book - her comments and thoughts were so memorable and inspiring. I HIGHLY recommend this book and think it would make a great gift for the women in your life of any age!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UNrealistic","review":"While parts of this book make for a good read, it is hard to believe that such a spastic person has everything work out for just in time to write a book.

Its not what I expected. The early section in New York I enjoyed about Elizabeths marriage and new love affair; and Elizabeth's travels in Italy also were fun reading (being a food lover, I could relate to the enjoyment of good food in Italy) and then.........We get to India, and I had to skim read the pages and pages and pages about meditation etc. God, that was boring. Could not wait for that part of the book to be over. Onto Indonesia, and slightly more interesting, but still a lot of chatter about meditation and life.There are obviously people who love the book, and that is great to find a book that enthralls and motivates you so much, but alas, I was not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"just so so","review":"I decided to see what all the hype was about and honestly, pretty disappointed and found myself skimming the whole India section.

Just not my type of book I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I should have learned my lesson after the Oprah,\\" Million Little Pieces\\" fiasco but decided to read this book. Maybe I am too old to appreciate her work. I found it slow and boring. Yes, parts were interesting and educational but I truly had to skip large chunks of the writing. Otherwise i'd probably just fall asleep. My sister calls it, Eat, Pray,Snore. I think she has a point!I was really dismayed and perhaps this time can really discount what Oprah praises.I did read that the author married her lover which was a nice note.Hope they are happy.I don't think i'll be rushing to read her account of that situation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"Very nice story about a woman seeking some kind of self discovery and definition in whatever way she can.I enjoyed it from beginning to end and ordered it , after reading it as a library book, as I will definitely read it again and lend it to friends.Its not about being religious but being spiritually aware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial","review":"The title just about says it. Not much going on here other than search for everything without meaning. It's a superficial search for men everywhere--not a very worthwhile or provocative read. I finished it only because I don't like leaving before giving the book a full chance. I did and didn't find anything worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining but not inspirational","review":"Yes, this is a memoir. Yes, she's a good writer. But the book is irritating because I find very little in it to inspire the reader. I, like several others, see in the writing a self-consciousness in the trip that ties back to the book advance. Many times I wanted to just shake her and tell her to grow up and take responsibility for her life and seek some satisfaction and meaning by moving beyond herself. But perhaps, I already have the quiet mind that she mentions, and don't need to spend a year pursuing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining read","review":"This is a somewhat entertaing book. I did find my self rolling my eyes alot during the chapter in India though. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"book review","review":"I thought the book was boring and hard to really get into. If you want to read it try it out at the public library first before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed Rubbish","review":"This story is so frustratingly and sickeningly selfish that I threw it in the trash about halfway through. It's sad that women find this type of story inspiring. I think it's depressing, and it actually reminds me of \\"White People Problems.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"Book is fine. The only thing I wish the description had told me was there was writing on the cover and the inside covers of the book. I just would have liked to know that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, but it hasn't arrived yet.","review":"I have not received this book yet, but I have already read it and it is wonderful. I hope that I do receive it and that it's not lost in the mail.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat Pray Love","review":"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and IndonesiaThis book was a great read. Some very clever writing in parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really like it","review":"I noticed a lot of people had really positive or really negative reactions to the book. I chose to listen to it on audio book because I love to travel and liked the concept of the author taking off the discover herself. I can't say that I really hated it. I was just hoping for more. It was kind of boring. The author would be describing an interesting conversation and suddenly state that she was not going to say anymore about this. This happened several times and I wanted to hear more about it. I'm really surprised that it's being made into a movie. I can't see it being entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy reading style, uninspiring content","review":"Her writing style is fluid, but her precious self-indulgence made it a painful read and embodies the entitlement \\"all-about-me\\" vein in the current culture in North America. That this book is currently #4 on the Amazon best-seller list is disheartening because it reminds me of how this generation of women in America could make a difference but instead are focused on getting their lattes in their SUVs on their way to yoga class. Me, me, me! Try reading \\"Three Cups of Tea\\" by Greg Mortenson to see what one person can accomplish in the world as a stark contrast to Gilbert's self-centered story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, blah, blah, blah....","review":"I could not finish this book. When the author burst into sobs yet again in the middle of prayer, or a conversation, or walking down the street, or (more likely) on the floor of yet another bathroom, I gave up. This is the type of person you meet at a cocktail party and RUN in the other direction after a few minutes when she starts spewing out all her problems at you with no end in sight. Note to the author: I am your reader, not your psychotherapist. I really tried to enjoy the book and even like the author, but after slogging through a couple hundred pages of endlessly self-absorbed chatter, I was worn out and put the book in the Goodwill pile. When she writes, \\"I discovered my mind was not a very interesting place to be,\\" I have to say, \\"Amen, sister!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You Poor Deluded Readers","review":"You just don't get it, do you? I haven't even finished the book but I totally get that her message is pretty simple. You are the creator and owner of your own happiness. And doing that will create happiness for the planet. Simple as that. It all starts at home. Contemplating your navel is the one and only way it happens. So what if she is \\"selfish\\" and \\"indulgent.\\" What better way to be, I cannot think of. She writes a true story and doesn't hold back the negative stuff she went through. I am so impressed, so inspired. Plus, it's fun to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Easy Read","review":"Though not the deepest of all the existential novels, there is something very sweet and familiar in Gilbert's Eat Pray Love. Her writing is very straight forward and accessible. The joy in this book is the common theme of self-discovery that is universal. A bildungsroman for 30-somethings."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-absorbed drek, I'm afraid","review":"By all means, choose something else to read: Ishiguro, Ondaatje, the new translation of War and Peace, the phone book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Sad","review":"Ugh, This book I was hoping would be good, as chosen by my book club, but it was nothing but a huge let down. I wanted to like the reader, I myself was fresh out of a divorce so I wanted to identify with her.. but I just kept thinking \\"Oh, honey you already ARE crazy Aunt Liz\\". Her note book spoke back to her as she sat on the bathroom floor crying....truly truly pathetic.Her so called wonderful insights weren't anything grand, and they just seemed very shallow, self absorbed, and rather dull and ignorant. After then seeing her on Oprah and watching all these bored housewives talk about how insightful she was it felt cult like, like all these people needed to be told by some wack-a-doo that they are worth it? Please..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped, self-involved drivel","review":"This book was recommended to me by people whose intelligence I respect, so I began it with the expectation of loving it. For the first part, I did indeed like it somewhat despite being annoyed by the self-centeredness of the writer. I found the visual, sensory description of Italy simply wonderful -- at first. But, increasingly, the sense that the author was using everyone around her (and her readers) wore me down. By India, I took a serious dislike to her story. By Indonesia, I couldn't stand her and her story and couldn't finish this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was hopeful for this book--especially because it comes with a blurb by Ann Lammot on the cover, whose \\"Traveling Mercies\\" is a great read about finding God and faith. But \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" doesn't deliver what I'd hoped. I got tired of the author telling me how many other people called her \\"cute\\" and how social and open and friendly she is and so on. She struck me as an ebullient fourth grader. Cute? Sure, but her brand of emotional immaturity doesn't wear so well on a thirty-something-year-old.A friend of mine (we read it in tandem) said, \\"Maybe this book is like that mantra [the author] had to say that she hated in India. Maybe I'll get something out of it if I just stick with it.\\" Alas, neither of us found much reward.The writing is stellar, really: descriptive, strong. Elizabeth Gilbert can tell a story. But I never did fall in love with her. I didn't even fall into like with her. She remains separate, cute, and even worse: cute-sy throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"My eyes hurt from so much eye-rolling!","review":"It was painful to read this book (book group reading, otherwise I wouldn't ever have picked it up.) The author endlessly and tediously refers to her divorce, her depression, her loneliness, her divorce, her depression, her loneliness, her divorce... get the idea? Her \\"humor\\" was a source of much eye-rolling, and I found her writing to be shallow. The subtitle of the book is \\"one woman's search for everything...\\" I found her searching for nothing, but rather dwelling on the past, and not moving forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me, please!","review":"This book was a Mother's Day gift having been highly recommended to my husband from a bookseller. I kept wishing it would get better.... I would appreciate the author's style and her story as the pages went on and on and on ad nauseum. After getting through about 2/3 of it I quit. The author's personality was not one which I could either admire, her actions not those I would like to emulate. This was one of the \\"best sellers\\" that had me completely mystified. Hard to believe it's been on any charts - it certainly is NOT any book I would recommend anyone waste their time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A journal of selfishness and self-indulgence...","review":"I put this book down in disgust tonight, vowing to go no further when I reached the end of the Italy part. This is a very personal memoir, and while the writing is good at times, the author is someone I would personally not like to know. Selfish and self-indulgent, the author will never grow up no matter how far she travels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine, Pose, Indulge","review":"It only made me ponder one Great Question: How did she get a publisher to pay her to go on a world tour of self indulgence? The book is garbage. But her agent is a great artist indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get to the end","review":"It took me over 6 months to complete reading this book. It was recommended to me since I was going to the Italian Alps to ski. I felt no connection to the author. In fact I regret purchasing this book. I wish I would have used my library card for this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Boring Rant","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It's a great concept turned into a Hollywood film. However, this book is nothing but a long boring rant and soul-searching journey of an annoying, self-centered 35 year old baby. I really wanted to finish it, but couldn't. It's indescribable how awful this book is so I will say that my negative review encompasses the points of all the other negative reviews for this book. Read those reviews instead of the book... It's much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liz is Bipolar","review":"\\"Bipolar disorder is a mental condition that is characterized by periods of manic episodes and depression. A person suffering from bipolar disorder can exhibit any of a number of mood swings and periods of depression. It is not uncommon for her to be caught in any number of lies as well.\\"Liz starts off the book having achieved so much and yet she is sobbing like a child. She ends the book with one of her manic episodes.As for how honest this book is, even Liz admitted that her ex thought she was a liar: \\"He [her ex] let me [Liz] know that I [Liz] was a liar and a traitor and that...\\" Shouldn't he know her best?Read this book if you want to understand how a bipolar person thinks. Don't read this book if you are looking for an enjoyable read or an honest story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I absolutely loved this book! As I started to read the reviews, one thought hit me, how sad it is that those people didn't walk away with anything from this book. This was one I couldn't put down. I know I will re-read this, and I don't do that with many books. I did get alot out of it mainly from the first 2 sections. Makes me want to start meditation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"It is this month's selection for my book club and I am forcing myself to get through it, but feeling extremely resentful about the waste of my time. She is a competent writer, but maybe better off writing on topics other than herself. If you are going to spend time reading a memoir, a basic rule of thumb is that the memoirist needs to be someone you think you might enjoy spending time with. Liz Gilbert does not strike me as that sort of person. She is not interesting enough to be so self-absorbed. So, apart from her tip that there is a restaurant in Naples that serves the best pizza on the planet, I find little to commend about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but I gave up at the end of the India section. Italy section was enjoyable, but the author's whining, crying, and unending self-exploration did me in. I wish I had not bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I ever read","review":"I hated the author from the beginning and she got even more irritating as the book went on. Her views on marriage and kids were selfish and nerve grating. Dont waste your $$ on this book. Buy something else instead.I gave it 1 star but I really wanted to give it -stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"She could've gone to Iowa, Idaho and Indiana for all the difference it would have made to this book.","review":"Fond as I am of a good travel memoir, and fonder still of Italy, Indonesia (Bali, specifically) and India; I was induced to buy this book on the recommendation of someone in a favorite book store.I would like to find that person again, and shake them until they tell me just what about this book was enjoyable.I learned nothing about Italy, Indonesia or India, and way, way too much about Ms. Gilbert and her orgasms.Perhaps that's what people like...the hope that you can be incredibly self-absorbed and insensitive, and yet you still will find someone to love you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! All Hype, No Heft","review":"Okay, so I fell for the hype, the sisterly admonitions to READ IT, and waited a while to buy it--so can I have my money back now, please? Extremely disappointing on so many levels--frenetic, manic writing, a completely self-absorbed and selfish \\"main character\\" (the author), lots of admonitions/reminders that we awful, shallow Americans don't know how to live...we don't know how to do nothing, yadayadayada. It is extremely difficult for me, a full-time working mother living on a college instrutor's salary to relate to someone like Elizabeth Gilbert. Authenticity is not a such a struggle for some, as she seems to suggest. If you are, however, interested in this type of voice/narrative, may I recommend Martha Beck and Jeannette Walls? You'll find substance, grit, suffering, and authenticity all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I was given this book by a friend, I normally would not have bought this type of book. I think much of the story is fictitious and why do the people she meets always have some fantastic background, i.e., the Brazilian lady who worked for the UN, Richard from Texas, (an unbelievable character if ever there was one)? Luca Spaghetti? Oh, be real. I just can't believe she met so many exceptional characters. Her statement that \\"we all need God\\" just turned me off as I don't believe in God but I don't mind if anyone else does. How presumptuous to believe that she knows what I need. I became disinterested during the India section and my interest continued to wane until I couldn't finish the book. This book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it on the bathroom floor","review":"Man, my hat is off to those reviewers who finished the book because I just didn't have it in me to stick with it.

I've been told that the book is better (aren't they always) but the movie put me off so I won't try to read the book. I just couldn't find a connection with the main character. Perhaps the book draws the reader more into the characters desperation at not knowing where she fits in in the world but in the movie she came off as just lost and kind of whiney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Book","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I could not finish it. Skip the book and watch her [...] instead. She's a MUCH better speaker. I could never recommend this book as it doesn't deliver. Self-absorbed ramblings that only end up irritating the reader as you could be reading something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this on the NYT best seller list?","review":"I had a hard time getting through this book. The author is pretentious, whiney and very self-absorbed. She whines about her divorce, but it seems like she was the one who just up and left and took up with another man. Her year of travel seems less of discovering herself and all about a Year of Me. She goes to at least two places - India and Bali - with much poverty and never seems to note it or want to be involved. It would be nice if we could all just travel for a year after a divorce to find our way."},{"rating":"2","title":"admirer","review":"the book was a little slow at times but i would still recommened reading. i admire her courage to change her life after finding herself unsure and unhappy. also to travel so far away from home not knowing anyone or sometimes not even knowing where she would live."},{"rating":"1","title":"PDXbookstore","review":"I ordered from PDXbookstore and it took forever to get my item.

How crazy sad that we are so swayed by....media?? publishers?? I don't know how this became #1 NYTimes Bestseller. It's not even fathomable!!If you like to read about a pathetic woman who has such \\"enormous\\" struggles in life as to break up with a boy, then, read away.

The people and places are so detailed and alive, I want to follow in her footsteps and eat the same pizza, visit the same ashram, meet the same medicine man. The author finds her independence again after a long time in an unhappy relationship, and though she has to go to the ends of the Earth to find it, the message applies anywhere: enjoy, forgive, relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Woman's Search","review":"Good writing style, with a touch of humor and a good hard look at her emotions. Entertaining and helpful in my growth & search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed author leaves husband looking for spiritual fulfilmment through carnal excesses.","review":"The book is beautifully written, but I found the author/protagonist shallow, self-absorbed and pretentious..I was turned off at the opening when she walked out on her husband for unspecified reasons (i.e. \\"not fulfilling my emotional needs\\") and then had the balls to be surprised when he was hurt and lashed back..Another reviewer, \\"Wanjugo,\\" nailed it when she wrote: \\"Many people say it was courageous for her to leave him, but the word selfish kept coming to my mind. Also thought about the DOUBLE STANDARDS in the American culture because a man who leaves his wife because he is sad in the marriage I bet would not sell so many books.\\".This is appeals to the modern woman who, in a 21st version of Cinderella, expects her husband to satisfy all of her emotional and spiritual needs while supplying her with regular orgasms..This book did not push my buttons at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"It's such a shame that she decided to abandon her faith and go on a worldwide quest to find what she already had! crying about not wanting to be married anymore is like a spoiled child who doesn't get their way, but isn't that how a lot of women are starting to see motherhood and marriage? as a bore and a waste of time? marriage is honorable as having children is honorable. Promiscuity and \\"finding yourself\\" seem to be the hot ticket these days! but it comes with a price - heartache and STDs. Want to find yourself? just look in the mirror! travel the world by all means, but you won't FIND YOURSELF! I couldn't finish this book it was so irritating. I have traveled all over and been to India where I saw beautiful people with beautiful smiles but so many of them lived in wretched poverty."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for Italy","review":"I breezed through this book hoping to find the intelligent and inspiring story everyone seems to rave about. I was sadly disappointed: the author is self-absorbed, impulsive, and whines about everything in her life. Her constant \\"God\\" talk became extremely annoying. I did enjoy the Italy section with the descriptions of the food and language, although I think Gilbert missed out on the art and culture aspect of Italy.

My only question to the writer is why couldn't she have just stayed in the USA and had the same journey? She could have eaten in some 5 star resturants. Next, she could have went to a women's shelter, soup kitchen, cancer hospital, or Hospice, and yes the v word volunteer. I think then she would have really found God. The third part of her journey was love. Oh wait you don't find riches there just diamonds in the rough. With all the money from the advance on the book she could have did alot more for her self and people in need . I now understand why Julia Roberts is playing the lead roll in the movie. For the first time I hope the movie is better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I absolutely loved this book- rarely does an author speak to me- and Elizabeth Gilbert did, on so many levels. It was easy to read, it flowed well, and made me want to travel in the worst way- I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a little adventure, and learn a little about humanity in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selfishly indulgent","review":"As others have said before me, a well-written book (mostly) by an intensely self-centered woman. I feel so sorry for the rest of the world that this is the type of American women that they all must think we are. Selfishly indulgent, Gilbert made me totally sympathetic to her husband whom she divorced. Why? Even though she had a wonderful job, lived in a wonderful home, her husband was ready to start a family. For this she found herself having a breakdown on the floor of her bathroom in the middle of the night? Marriage counseling not an option?The book is worth reading for the world tour. But don't buy it. Get it from your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really???","review":"I am so glad to see that I am not the only woman in the world who found this to be a dull, contrived and tedious read. I attmepted not once, not twice, but three times to convince myself that this was, in fact, a good read. Gilbert's attmepts at humor are forced and annoying, her narrative voice somehow nasal and irritating. I made it about 2/3 of the way through and couldn't take another word. Life-changing for some...torturous for others. Count me in the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It amazes me that this book is so popular. I got about halfway through the book before it got so boring that I just couldn't finish it. I think Ms. Gilbert is self-absorbed and selfish and the book itself was boring! I was highly disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame...","review":"I don't know what else to say, but this lady needs to grow up.

Well...I purchased the book for my sister, who can be quite a bit more open-minded than I about things in this world. MUCH to my surprise, she was not impressed at all. Whether you are a Christian or just someone who is in search of Truth, don't be fooled by the word \\"pray\\" or the holes that were left on Oprah's show. It is DEEPLY \\"New-Age\\" and though I know that it is \\"One Woman's Journey\\"...it is still very one-sided on the political front. I truly was shoked by my sister's review of this book and the excerpts that were read and shown to myself, but also so very thankful that she didn't buy into the many false teachings that it contains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Elizabeth Gilbert is only about a tenth as funny as she thinks she is. Her story is only about a tenth as interesting as it could have been.Her writing reminded me of those people who speak really loudly and simply to non-English speakers.

Why is it on the best seller list and why did Oprah push it. This book is about a very selfish self absorbed young lady who thinks we want to hear her complain while she takes off a year to do nothing!! Personnelly I don't believe she did what she states. I think she created it because she was given an advance of money and she had to come up with something. Still it put me to sleep almost every night and I got to a point where I started skimming in the end because it was the same old droling on about her whining. I had to read this book for my book club or else I would have burned it. When I got to my club I learned that not one person in the group like the book even a little. One person saw the movie, like the movie but said it was not at all like the book!! She quit reading it at pg 100. So if you value your time do not pick this book up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After all the hype for this book, I thought it would be wonderful. Wrong.

UGH... talk about BOOOORRRING. She is self-absorbed to the point where I was rolling my eyes so much while reading I was wondering if my eyeballs were going to get stuck that way. I stopped reading it about halfway through. I really don't CARE about her and her uninteresting travels and you can bet your booty I sure as hell am not wasting my good hard earned money to see the movie either. To sum it up... don't even bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Insightful!","review":"I absolutely loved this book.I was at the Library looking for something to read and I came across this book a few times and never picked it up. One day when I was in a hurry and needed to grab a book and go, I just took it after not being able to find anything else that looked interesting.This book seemed like it was what I wanted to do when I was 22 and therefore I did not think it would appeal to me since I am married with a child and have happily put my travel on hold for my wonderful family. Wow, I was completely wrong.I loved reading this woman's story, her struggle to come to terms with who she is, how she will find happiness and her journey for meaning and self-discovery. Anyone who has felt any sort of pain in life would be able to relate to her struggle to deal with it in her own life. This book also spoke to me in terms of looking inward for happiness and not depending or blaming other people when it does or does not happen.Bravo, Bravo, Bravo!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, insightful, well-written","review":"What could have been a dry \\"discovery of self\\" treatise or an oh-so-cute \\"Under the Italian/Indian/Indonesian Sun\\" pseudo-memoir becomes, in Gilbert's talented hands, an honest, self-deprecating, funny book.

I'm also wondering - as she barely addresses it - if perhaps her self-indulgence is what sent her husband packing. People process pain differently but she's way to absorbed over her loss and I worry she might not have much to offer to children if she can't think outsider her personal box. Read like a travel diary (eating ice cream in Italy, yawn) but got more interesting as she entered the Ashram with a look into something we woudln't ordinarily know. Glad she found happiness with the new man."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhhh could be used as a beverage coaster","review":"I bought this book in November of last year stopped after the first 3 chapters tried to pick it up again this summer and had to stop at page 90 something...this book is just like its author they're both pretty much useless it actually deserves a rating of NEGATIVE 5 stars..lesson learnt don't always fall for the hype and do your research .. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste their money buying this nonesense..on the brighter side its been on my side-table and makes an excellent coaster"},{"rating":"1","title":"I watched the movie then read the book","review":"First, I am not one to write reviews typically. However, I have been reading this book while traveling to, ironically, Italy and India amongst many other countries. My travels were a mix of fun and work over a span of 5 weeks. I enjoy traveling to meet new people and see new things. I also enjoy having this time to myself to get back to my needs and focus where I am going in life. I just don't hide behind travel to think that it will make me more of a person.I admire her openness and her willing to write about herself and let the world read. I do believe that there are people out there that are like her. I swear I have dated her twin. They are running away from who they are and hiding behind who they think they are.My warning to those not trying to find themselves through someone else, it may be...um...shallow to you. I am not saying you shouldn't read the book, it is always good to see the world through others eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the first few pages.","review":"I was very turned off that the woman walked out on her marriage. Maybe if she had tried to \\"find herself\\" spiritually before she considered leaving her husband, I would have been more sympathetic. Basically, it looked like she traveled around the world, ate a lot of food, vegetated in India and then shacked up with a Himbo guy. Notice that relationship doesn't last, either. She doesn't seem to have learned much about commitment! Maybe she's taking her cues from Hollywood.Really don't see the appeal of this book and have no interest in watching the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not that good...actually it is not good at all!!!","review":"Bestseller really? How come it had such good reviews? It's s not that good, it's not that original and it is not even realistic.How many of us after a heartbreak wouldn't like to spend a year travelling around Italy, India and Bali???? Instead, we just have to swallow it and get our sorry aXXes to the office.I was really disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this a best seller?","review":"This book made me want to stick a fork in my eye. Whiny, self-obsessed and wah wah wah! \\"I got paid to travel for a year\\" \\"Doing yoga in India is HARD\\".Spare me."},{"rating":"1","title":"should probably be FICTION","review":"From the first page of the book, things just didn't sound right. It all seemed made up, from the way things happened to the people she met on her \\"spiritual\\" journey. ESPECIALLY the part in Bali, it seemed totally made up! It was all ME ME ME. I don't know why anyone would want to read a self-absorbed story that is supposedly true...For those who have read it and hated it, there's a new book called Drink, Play, F@#k by Andrew Gottlieb who writes Bob Sullivan's (elizabeth Gilbert's EX) 1 year journey to Ireland, Las Vegas, and Thailand. It's not a true story but SOO hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, pray, love, gag","review":"I am having an extraordinarily difficult time embracing this book. Although I can identify with some of the emtions of the author as I, too, have recently been through a messy divorce and custody battle with many emotional ups and downs. My problem with this book, is the incessant whining by the author and the fact that normal people do not have the means to take off for a year and spend 4 months in Italy, 4 months in India and 4 months in Indonesia. I have finished the Italy part and the first few installments of India, but I have had to put this book down indefinitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"Well, like some of the other reviewers, I found myself annoyed by Ms. Gilbert's tone from the beginning. I plodded onward, however, certain it would change, until I reached page 61. I quote \\"Americans spend billions to keep themselves amused with everything from porn to theme parks to wars ....\\" What's up with that, Elizabeth?? Americans are amused by WARS? Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most bi-polar book ever!","review":"I had high hopes for this book and the first section in India was rather charming. She eats great food, talks with interesting people and lives a life of ease that most of us can envy at least for a while.Unfortunately, when she goes to India, the book becomes this self-indulgent drivel. I just found myself not caring about how still she could become or how long she sat in a meditation cave.The last section in Bali is OK. The parts about the Balinese society are quite well done but there's an awful lot that was just dull.It's obvious that Ms. Gilbert can write, but she needs to do it without so much whining."},{"rating":"2","title":"just loved this book","review":"I loved this book. It was inspiring and funny. It was sad and brillant. If you \\"got it\\", it brought out many emotions and was just a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read","review":"I saw this book in a magazine after hearing good reviews from a friends and ordered it from Amazon. Reading Liz's journey through Italy, India and Indonesia was beautiful and entertaining. Each part was a completely different aspect that many feel at different points in their life. Like I've heard many others say, this book makes you want to travel and experience more in your own life. I loved this book and recommend it to anyone who asks."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOPY","review":"I really tried to get through this boring, self-absorbed thing, but somewhere at mid-point I just said to myself 'enough already!'There are too many good books out there to waste my time! Don't waste yours.Its crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Oh my gosh...I am half way through this book and I cannot believe how awful it is. I don't even think I can finish this shallow, liberal, and annoying journey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Over Rated!","review":"This lady is simply a self absorbed & ungrateful person.Also, this book is not practical at all- for most people can't afford to go to a spiritual journey as hers or spend months on their bathroom floor-things are very different when you have to get up and going in the morning- and an average person who spends a couple of months crying on their bathroom floor till the wee hours will have a lot more to be depressed about then their initial problems- for other things around them will fall apart. I guess this is a good book if you can afford to sc--w everything and disapear. But if you can't afford this- I don't think, as I already mentioned, that ur journey (being the authors journey) is a \\"practical\\" one to the point where her journey can help many others. But then again I am just speaking from my perspective as a young, single woman.As for the writing- its beautiful but the message gets lost amongst the authors self centered perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled rich girl","review":"Just think she's a spoiled brat.

I never thought I would ever get through this book, but I was determined to finish. I liked Italy and parts of Indonesia. I think anyone can write a book on their life. Everyone has fallen on hard times. We just do not write books about it. Maybe we should. I didn't feel sorry for her at all. I found her annoying and self-absorbed. She ran away for a year, because she couldn't bare to face her life that she made a mess of. I am glad I finished it, but I am not glad I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Italy made me hungry and the rest just made me bored","review":"I love reading and I love the idea of traveling .. but this book just didn't cut it for me. I got read this book because of the great reviews but I was miserable reading it. I really just could not stop thinking about food during her time in Italy - probably not a good idea to read this if you're on a diet! Meanwhile, India and Indonesia just made me bored. I found the book to be full of complaining and whining and just did not enjoy it. I don't understand why she went on a trip to find herself and be away from all the drama of life if she couldn't just relax and enjoy it? She seems to not understand what she would be getting herself into and neither did I... I finished the book because I was hoping for some glorious ending, but I never got it.I'm not a super girly-girl so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it but it was just a tough book for me to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat too much, pray you have a lot of money, love yourself","review":"I agree with the reviews that express disappointment with Ms Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love Memoirs. I wanted to like it, especially after hearing the book will be a Film in no time starring one of my least favorite actresses Julia Roberts.But instead I found myself thinking the author was nothing more than a vain, whiney, troubled and empty blogger/journal writer. Her lack of spirituality at the end showed me she is one of the many who think becoming spiritual is something that happens to you after a short trip to India. What frightens me more than this book are the millions of people who look up to her and feel her story is worth repeating.I don't believe Ms Gilbert knows what true suffering is. Nor is she somebody who's advice I would take for anything other than where to eat in Italy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful piece, I was fully enthralled","review":"I am an avid reader of all sorts of novels, but Eat, Pray, Love is easily one of my favorites.If you're looking for a book to carry you through a transition or hard time--this is absolutely the book for you! I read this book as I graduated from college, moved home, broke up with my boyfriend and struggled to find a career. It was such a buoyant and moving book that it truly helped me through one of the most difficult transitions in my short life.I highly recommend this to anyone who cares to read about travel, change, spirituality and adventure. It is a wonderful book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW DID SHE KNOW WHAT I FEEL??","review":"I discovered this book from Oprah's magazine which contained a snippet from EPL. Just that snippet left me in tears due to the raw precision of how Elizabeth expressed her experiences. I went and bought the book the next day and attacked it like a baby at feedin' time. I haven't travelled the globe like Elizabeth has, but my journey through emotions and all in the process of creating my true self has been very similar. Not only is the book affirming, but it presents solid proof that the pursuit of truth, self-awareness, honesty and authenticity is never wasted. May not always feel good, but the results are always worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attraversiamo","review":"Everything about this book was beautiful and well written. Ms. Gilbert brings the reader with her through all parts of the journey- the good, the bad and the pasta. When you reach the end, you feel as if a good friend has written you a letter that you want to read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"Dear Elizabeth, I don't think that you'll ever read this but I want to thank you for this amazing book and for being so brave and share all your inner feelings so truthfully. I'm reading it now and each chapter has something I can relate to. It appears that I'm not the only one who feels this way, who's lost and confused and this makes me feel sooooo relieved - you can't imagine! Of course each and everyone one has different paths in our lives but I'm happy that someone else out there feels the same way I do. Thank for this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This is a book that made me feel free... made me feel that I was invincible. When you feel that your days have just gotten bleak and dark because of things going on around you, pick this book up and take a peak at what it has to offer. This book is not a romance, action, suspense, mystery, or murder novel, this novel is based on a women whose life that seemed so perfect (wealth, husband, job she loved) fell apart in a matter of weeks. This the story about her traveling to 3 different areas in the world to help focus more on herself and make her at peace by only worrying about her for once and get her life in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"If you are interested in visiting any of the three countries Elizabeth wrote about, Italy, India and Indonesia, then read this book. She does a great job of describing the day-to-day live of the individuals in these countries. In some cases you will laugh out loud. Elizabeth's writing style is very conversational like she is talking to a friend. She is also very funny"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is so much better out there","review":"I can not understand the rave reviews this book get - maybe because it's an Oprah selection and her followers would buy whatever she recommends....what a pity. This book has taught me nothing. The writer is self indulgent and I could not connect with her at all. I read another non-fiction travel story recently titled Crying with Cockroaches and what a joy! Get it and spot the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"I tried to like it, then when I realized that wasn't going to happen I just tried to finish, couldn't manage to do that either. She just didn't come off as a likable person to me. A little too selfish maybe. I kept wondering why I should care about this experience of hers, that I would prefer to reserve those feelings for my friends and family. Plus it was an experience that she was paid to have. It seems like my generations literary contributions are all memiors, are we really that self-absorbed? It doesn't even bother me as much when someone has an experience and then decides to write about it, but when they have an experience specifically for the purpose of making money off of it, I'm a little ashamed that I made a monetary contribution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"One of the most self-centered, self-indulgent, self-important piece of drivel I've read in a long time. Don't waste your money or time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"i want my $12 back","review":"Gilbert is a whiny, needy, self-absorbed, oblivious spoiled brat who -- in 300+ pages -- doesn't learn a thing. Her desperation to be with a man (even when the 2 are completely incompatible) is pathetic.I rolled my eyes the entire time. It's amazing people buy into her self-pity. She's not depressed -- she needs a swift kick in the a**.3 passages that annoyed me immensely:1) her rented apartment in Rome isn't her NYC apartment, but it \\"will do.\\"2) she doesn't want to insult anyone by comparing her experiences to the generations of harship and poverty the Sicilian people have suffered...and then continues to make the comparison.3) David is her \\"soulmate\\". I miss David. I love David. Repeat. Whine. Repeat. Whine. Repeat. Whine. Repeat.What a pompous waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"I also wish zero stars was an option! Gilbert's shallow writing style combined with her self-indulgent point of view make this book nauseating. I received it as a gift but otherwise never would have read it. I kept waiting for the \\"good part\\" which NEVER came.Worse yet, Gilbert's narrow perspective exoticizes and orientalizes everything \\"different\\" or \\"new\\" that she sees. She belittles the people that she meets as they try to fit into her Gilbert-centric universe. Her book is the worst possible example of American travel writing. Spare yourself the pain and skip this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow, boring and poorly written","review":"this woman is seriously annoying. there are moments of her spiritual journey that ring true, but those moments are no great revelation to any reasonably self-aware person. the prose is flat and repetitive and self-indulgent... and so she. the clamor over this book is truly out of control... !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get through, putting it away unfinished","review":"I picked up this book as part of a monthly club and was excited to get started. Reading the book was difficult, first my disappointment with the author for not sharing the reasons for her divorce but forcing us to decipher the aftermath not knowing the entire story. Elizabeth Gibert's experiences, however real to her, came across superficial and I kept waiting to be moved by her revelations, but wasn't. Only one of the group of 7 women managed to get through the book, the rest put it away and watched her TIVO'd interview on Oprah instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I really liked the beginning of this book. For a third of it, I was enthralled. Then it slowly began to turn downhill and rapidly degraded into an unfulfilled, uninspiring escapist story. It might be that I'm simply not spiritual enough for the pray and love parts, but I failed to travel along for 2/3rds of the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!","review":"This was such a disappointing book. Too bad there isn't a half star! The author is so self absorbed and superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is totally into herself. Reads like a bad travel guide","review":"I prefer to give this book a negative number of stars. How did it ever get published? The author is shallow, immature for her years, self-absorbed and deserves to be pitied in her quest for love & happiness. The book reads like her personal travel guide for lonely hearts club members. I could not finish this book. It was a waste of time. Penquin Publishing lowered the bar for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too political","review":"(If I could have, I would have used no stars but the system wouldn't let me.) I bought this book for entertaining reading but was terribly disappointed. Some of it is interesting but the author ruins much of it with her political opinions that seem to pop up out of nowhere and the reader is left wondering, where the hell did that come from? I was also numbed by the author's flippant use of the F word. It definitely paints a very different picture of the author herself and I fail to understand why this book has gotten so much publicity. I would not recommend this book, at least don't buy it. If you must read it, borrow it so you can return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This is the type of book you read when you need to kill time.

I normally don't read this kind of book, but since a friend of mine kept nagging me to read it I decided to give it a try. I truly went into it with an open mind, but half way through the book all I kept thinking was; \\"when is this woman going to stop whinning\\". This isn't the story of a woman going on a journey of self-discovery, this is about a frustrated woman that goes on a \\"poor little me\\" whinning trip that never seems to end. This is my personal view of the book and no one has to share it, those that liked it fine, sorry to say I do not include myself in that group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"I tried, I really tried to get through this boring, self-absorbed thing, but somewhere at mid-point I just said to myself 'enough already!'There are too many good books out there to waste my time! Don't waste yours. I could go on, but even a more detailed review is not time well spent. The book is just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing","review":"This book starts out wonderfully. The writer is smart, funny, and the woman can write! She says, early on in her travels, that she can make friends with anyone, and you believe her because she is so engaging and vibrant, and her stories are compelling and fun to read. You are willing to listen to her say just about anything because she says it in such an entertaining way. But somewhere, in the middle of the book I started to get tired of the stories. Everything works out, nothing goes wrong, and there appears to be very little true soul searching below the surface. The book is being hailed as a spiritual journal, but it really never gets below the veneer of anecdotes. The author is good company, but her journey is ultimately disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This book should have been titled \\"Eat, Pray, Have Sex\\". This journey-through-life book is very pedestrian in its insights and ends up just where every 30-something woman wants it to end.

Nice title, but seriously? Nothing to write about. She was unhappy, unfullfilled, blamed her husband, had a midlife, got divorced, tried to escape, ran away and went on a spiritual search. But it was all about experiencing me me me me and indulging. In the end empty, unfullfilled, unhappy. Sad really. Yes I know she says she has found herself but thats only till her next meal or \\"experience\\" is over. I guess the attraction beside a good title is that all of us want to escape from time to time but she was acctually wreckless enough to do it and then write about it and made it sound fun. Really not true LOVE or real spiritual growth in her PRAY found at all. Lots of EAT though. Don't waste your $"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid in Advance","review":"It wasn't exactly like she cast her fate to the wind and took off on an adventure. She was paid by a publisher to make this journey and write a book. This wasn't real, it was about money and a business deal. That is why she seemed self absorbed, it is because she is. Don't waste your money on a phony!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat Pray and hopefully you aren't as self-entitled as you appear to be.","review":"I am going to simply state this. This book should have been called \\"I ate a lot of pizza. Did nothing for the year. And I just bored the crap out of you\\".I saw the movie too. I thought maybe I was missing something. I was hoping to see \\"Eat. Pray. I'm not as self-entitled as I appeared to be in the book\\", but that didnt' happen either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifico!","review":"This book is a winner! While I listened to the book on CD, read by the author herself, I felt like I was taking the journey right along with her. Listening to her voice, she quickly sounded to me like an old friend telling the fascinating story of her travels abroad (much of it enjoyably unpredictable). Although this book is cataloged in the travel section, it fits into other categories as well: adventure, self-help, biography, travel, spirituality, relationships, and more. I loved reading about all the people she met, especially the healer who cured Gilbert's \\"female\\" infection with some weird potion made out of plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved this book!","review":"It's one of the most inspiring and enjoyable books I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING.","review":"It's rare that I start a book and don't finish it.

I picked up eat pray love again, only to come to my senses and put it down once and for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the time??","review":"I started listening to the audiobook, but couldn't get past Italy. I got the book because I will be turning 30 in less than a year and thought I might be able to relate and/or learn something valuable from the author. At first I thought she was right on, but then we just started to drift apart. I became more and more annoyed at her \\"problems\\" - honestly, compared to the real problems of many people, she came off as petty and very very self-centered. Is this what I have to look forward to in my 30s? Also, it must be nice to be able to just take off a year and travel. If I had the time and resources to do something like that I'd be counting my blessings instead of moaning about the relationships I sabotaged. Did I make a mistake by returning the cd to the library so soon? Should I at least have stuck it out though India? Is there any hope for this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Punishing","review":"Save your time, money and sanity! One of the worst books I have read in a long time. The book should really be titled: Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Whining, and Ego Stroking Journey Across Italy, India and Indonesia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Love...Gag","review":"Ms. Gilbert comes across as a most self-absorbed, egocentric person and, beyond this, expects the rest of the world to coo and cluck in pity. Here's a thought: perhaps she should have volunteered with the Peace Corps, Habitat for Humanity, or the International Red Cross. Perhaps this would have lifted her out of her wallowing self-pity and benefited the truly desperate. But wait - of course not. She would never have been advanced the big bucks from her publisher to finance a soujourn in the slums. How I wish I'd contributed the price of this book to charity, instead ... especially since I could not force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Idiots Guide to Narcissism","review":"Other reviewers have shrewdly pointed out the negative aspects of this book (of which there are too many). Therefore, I will not repeat them.I will add this bit of advice, however: If you are a male (who possesses a good, kind and generous soul) and wish to find out if the woman you are involved with is a good, long term prospect, buy her this book and insist that she read it. If she dislikes the book, buy her some flowers, take her out for a nice dinner and do what you must to keep her. If she adores the book, finds kinship with the author and/or claims to be enlightened by what she read, run from her!...Run away as fast as your legs will carry you and never look back!And yes, I did (somehow) manage to read the book in its entirety. God help me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"I don't support non-fictional, autobiographical literature featuring immoral,narcisistic people. Why do people want to help her pursuit of fame and fortune as a writer by purchasing this book? It was loaned to me, and I couldn't wait to get it out of my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Every self discovery process tends to be a very personal & individualized experience. Not everyone can connect to spiritualized experiences from eating an extra cheese pizza in Italy or a mosquito - ridden meditations in an Indian asharm.A good writer would be able to make an interesting story out of a personal journey. While not every reader would necessarily identify wsith the situation, good writing would help the reader identify with the feelings. humor, or any other element the writer wanted to share while sharing the experience.For me, Elizabth Gilbert hadn't translated her experiences to a well written book that I can identify with. Even as a pizza lover I found her ecstasy over a slice of pizza slightly ridiculous, and found her behavior to be too childish (flying to Bali on some vague offer for lodging by someone who'd forgotten who she was by the time she arrived?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious, Indulgent, Read","review":"This book reads as a refreshingly intimate account of one womans quest at true happiness. Melissa Gilbert is painfully honest with her emotions and thoughts and at times I contemplated my guilt at delighting in this entertainment. She reveals herself like a confiding girlfriend and the details are enough to keep one engaged until the end. Her adventures are tumultuous and raw with emotion, spiritualism and sexuality. Gilbert keeps the reader yearning for more. The end; I felt a bit cheated but I suppose the typical reader will sigh with euphoria. A definite read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just go along for the ride.","review":"This is the author's experiences on the time-honored tradition of soul searching. She is an excellent storyteller.I think too many people take this book too seriously. It's just her story she is telling and it's interesting and funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun read","review":"This is one of those books that someone says \\"it's a great book\\" and so you go out and buy it. And then you realized that you could have waited until it was in the library or someone lent it to you. It's a fun and quick read but not really anything to write home about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat Pray Love","review":"Although this author is a good 25 younger than me, I truly enjoyed this book. I had seen the author interviewed, which may have helped, but I was also charmed by her unaffected tone. I have to admit I find anyone who blithely admits to meditating for an uninterrupted hour suspect--but at the least this author gets you thinking about the state of your own life, and there's nothing wrong with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"Basically a \\"chick-book\\" where we are asked to share the adventures of a recent divorcee as she eats in Italy, prays in India and loves in Indonesia. There are interesting parts to it (for this male reviewer) but I found myself skipping over much of the more emotional gush -- will she or won't she go to bed with her Italian translator. I for one could not care less. But for those who like books where women share their inner thoughts, you could do worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Self-Absorbed Self-Diary","review":"Reading this book is like reading someone's private journal - too much self-absorbed thought. I found it hard to relate to someone who disdained both marriage and children, had the financial resources to spend a full year traveling and indulging, and who has no commitment to other human beings - or at least as we're told. Personally I'm amazed she couldn't find God in Italy - the home of the Catholic church, and I got lost in the ashram, but eventually finished it, more out of curiousity than because it held my attention.There are some redeeming qualities towards the end that encourages us to re-evaluate our lives, sort of a stop, look and listen reminder. But all in all, I have yet to figure out the allure of Oprah and all the other outstanding reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just goes to show what a good agent can do...","review":"This was a complete waste of time and money. Pure drivel that reinforces my theory that a \\"good\\" agent can get even the worst of stories published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas, not much here","review":"I regret saying this, but after about thirty pages, I found the book boring. The writing isn't bad, with some nice phrasing and some fun metaphors, but the author's obsession with herself becomes tiresome and comes across as a bit juvenile. I had to laugh at the descriptions of her experiences in the ashram: this is classic \\"bliss bunnyism.\\" Once she's been engaged with contemplative practices for ten or so years, perhaps then she'll have something worth writing about. That this book, like \\"The Secret,\\" should top best seller lists makes me shudder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"Pleasant, funny, easy to hear, well read, hope to be able to choose some more books with the insight and familiarity of this one. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book!","review":"Very inspirational and interesting! I saw the movie and decided to read the book out of curiosity and I'm glad I did! It was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply boring.","review":"I read \\"Eat Pray Love\\" after a friend recommended it (turned out, she hadn't actually READ the book...). It's slow-moving and boring, and written from the point of view of a self-absorbed and narcissistic spoiled brat of a grown woman. I did finish the book out of principle (hoping that it would be worth it in the end), but wish I hadn't. Don't waste your time when there are so many worthwhile reads out there! Really, this book gets the worst description you can give writing: BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor little Rich girl","review":"I am trying to get through this \\"book\\" because it is an assignment. It is slow, boring and depressing. She quits her job and dashes around the globe to find herself. Rich family and friends meet her in distant countries as she travels. Can you say spoiled brat with rich rich rich friends and family. She had no worries she just wanted to get out of her marriage and flit around with no responsibilities and no boundries. She is shallow and lacks any admirable characteristics.I am glad I was able to get this book on Amazon.com for pennies. It will not be too much of a loss when I throw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps it's unfair to rate a book you couldn't even finish...","review":"Sorry; I just could not get \\"into\\" the main character's whiney, self-indulgent frame of mind!Life is tough... it's tougher if you're compulsively looking into a half empty glass. If you like alot of whining, this book (and thus probably the movie) is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"I purchased this book (after hearing from a few members of my book club that it was inspiring and wonderful) with an open mind and expecting something that I could apply to my own life. I regret to say that it was boring, uneventful and a complete waste of money. Every book is not for everyone and this one was not for me. I have been reading since I was four and I LOVE to read; this book is the first book that I have not been able to finish. I could not relate to anything that she did/went through to find herself. Just my opinion but this book was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst. book. i. have. ever. read.","review":"why? why america, why? why have we allowed this kind of mindless tripe to prosper?how is it that american women bought this woman's pretentious monologuing? what has happened to us? how could we have allowed it to happen?this book is FICTION.

Why do smart, intelligent, emotionally unstable writers think we might find delight in reading about it? Don't bother. Elizabeth Gilbert is selfish, self-centered and self-absorbed. She knows what she needs to do, doesn't do it and thought it wiser to make money, write a book about the horribly depressing and uninspiring story of her privileged life (no sympathy from me) and laugh at the suckers who bought it and got nothing. Get a life! (I like my motherhood, 20+ year marriage and all the ups and downs that go with husband, kids, pets, homes, jobs, etc.) I won't finish the book and it's the first and last Elizabeth Gilbert book I will ever buy! What a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely irritating book","review":"This should have been titled \\"Journey of a Narcissist.\\" What an irritating woman. I have my doubts about how much of this is even authentic. I just don't believe in most of the people she encounters. I wonder if this is another made-up memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chew Slowly","review":"I picked up Eat, Pray, Love in an airport over a year ago. I have been reading it off and on since then and still have not finished it. I am thoroughly enjoying this book. Perhaps the reviewers who left a 1 or 2 star rating read it in one day. Eat, Pray, Love is not to be wolfed down, but chewed slowly. I have found my own spiritual journey through reading this one. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring","review":"I would actually give this book two and a half stars. There were some somewhat interesting parts, but overall I found the book to be pretty boring even though I have connections with two of the three countries written about. The section on Italy was the worst of all. There was absolutely nothing of interest there. India was a bit better and my favorite section was on Bali, even though having been there myself I know she is not accurate in everything she says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"I was extremely disappointed when I read this book I expected so much more then what I received between these pages. This is nothing but a story of a selfish, spoiled rich girl who cares of nothing, and nobody but her self. Plus in the real world most women have lives, family, children or don't have the money to just pick up and travel the world. I would not recommend this book to anyone. But there is one book I would especially recommendWhat is Love?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book","review":"My creative writing teacher showed us a clip of the author speaking. I fell in love with her immediately, and I really wanted to read this book. However, the book was very disappointing. Pretty much the whole thing is about her whining about how miserable her life is and being completely selfish with her friends, monopolizing their time to talk about her problems. She didn't seem to gain a single scrap of wisdom from her entire year of travel, which was the whole point. There were a few good lines and ideas, but most of those came from other people, not from the author. I hoped for a lot more out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"EH","review":"While it was written well enough, I just didn't find her appealing. I didn't feel sorry for her, her journey wasn't incredible to me. In my opinion, she was a typical selfish middle-aged woman nothing to write home about. The book was just ok to me. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it, and I found the book even more boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subversive book","review":"What a subversive book ! it should be called Me, I and Myself.. impressive how Elizabeth thinks only about HER well-being.. the nastiest problem is that it make anyone believe you can do the same ! just drop everything and go on the road and you will find true love.Soooo romantic, except for real women in real world (like my ex-wife), she doesn't have the pile of money and she leaves two kids behind .. and guess what ? her beautiful trip to a better self ended in being miserable and not finding neither romance, nor spiritual peace, nor love.. just a lonely life and two poor kids shaken by their mom's departures.I would suggest to classify this book alongside The Little Red Book and Mein Kampf .. ;-)O"},{"rating":"2","title":"A divine and passionate meal!","review":"Elizabeth Gilbert has written such a vivid, engrossing tale that I felt like I was following her around the world, enjoying the amazing food, the spiritual journey and the passionate love along the way. Her writing engaged not only my mind but all of my senses. The book was as filling as a delicious meal - I wished it would never end. I hope she continues writing about her journeys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this One!","review":"This book was a total joy! Liz Gilbert writes with honesty, insight and humor. I gave it as a gift to a friend who was embarking on a year of traveling the world, and she couldn't say enough about how wonderful it was. A great read for anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An overrated folly of fanciful fluff.","review":"I can find diamonds in the rough this book. There are a great many memorable, comical and/or insightful quotes. However, mostly I'm thinking that Elizabeth Gilbert is certifiably insane. She can write, there's no doubt about that. It's just what she chooses to write about that gets my hackles up. Her neurotic over analysis of her life gets tedious really fast. If I wanted to relive a metaphysical crisis, I'd write my own memoir, thank you very much. I keep wondering how they turned this festival of self indulgent, self loathing into a movie. I probably should have saved myself the trouble and watched it instead of investing my time in reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The privilege of the privileged.","review":"I got through three quarters of this book before I finally said enough. I returned the book to the lender thankful that I had not purchased it. I found it to be a tale about self-importance and the privilege of the privileged. If you're looking for inspiration or a spiritual journey, read \\"Three Cups of Tea\\" by Greg Mortenson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I'm having a hard time getting through this book. I think that's because the book is about four years old and what was new and interesting in 2006 just isn't that exciting in 2010. I've read too many blogs that read like this and I don't find her ideas, thoughts and feelings all that profound. Maybe the movie is better, but the reviews said otherwise. Save your money, read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"I didn't really care for this book. It does give some insight into different cultures around the world. But, I am a Christian and disagree with her view of religion. The romantic will enjoy portions of the book, but overall it was just not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price gouging","review":"I wanted to read this book, but I refuse to pay $12.99 for an ebook. The cost of producing an ebook is negligble, and sales can be astronomical, if priced appropriately. I WILL NOT pay and inflated price for a book. I don't want to read it that badly. Publishers need to get a clue and realize they are losing profits by overpricing their product. I could begin boycotting publishers who insist on this kind of pricing. I have over 500 books on my kindle, and continue to add to it on a regular basis. But I won't be buying this. I wonder if the pdf is available online yet. I'm not in favor of piracy, but this kind of business practice gives me a better understanding of those who are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat Pray Love SUCKED","review":"I'm mad at myself for buying this book and for giving any sort of credence to this indulgent, self-absorbed AWFUL writer. She should spare the world and STOP WRITING immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in a long time","review":"I'm such a slow reader and I never put this book down. It speaks as though it was written for me...which I'm sure means it'll speak as though it was written for you too! The journey the author goes on can be seen as a metaphor for whatever is going on in the reader's life...and it's inspiring to think of how important things (especially one's search for meaning) can not be put on hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramble, ramble, ramble.......","review":"This book is OK until you get about halfway through than it is simply miserable.....I got so bored with her rambling while in India I couldn't even finish the book. I'm glad I borrowed this book and didn't actually pay to have this women bore me into a stuper. Great title - and that's as far as it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a wonderful book that details a woman's journey to find herself. It is extremely well written and easy to read. I would recommend it to anyone who has gone or is going through a journey to find out the person they really are. It is especially good for people who have gone through a divorce or other life changing event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and very dull","review":"Despite what other people said about this book I am very disappointed. You don't have to travel anywhere to find peace within yourself. Lock up yourself in your room, meditate and you will be able to listen to your heart and find peace. I found this book very dull, boring and shallow. Will not recommend this book to avid reader.Good thing, I did not buy this book, my friend lent it to me , otherwise I will have a hard time to hide this book. Don't waste your time. Read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"If you are looking for spiritual guidance, this is not where to look. This book is a fun and interesting read. I related to Liz in many parts of the book. I also enjoyed exploring Italy, India and Indonesia through her experiences. I love to travel, but it's not practical for me to do as extensively as I'd like. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the book. Is it going to help you answer your own life questions? I think not, but it will remind you that you are the not only searching soul on the planet. Liz is honest, hilarious and self-deprecating. She doesn't take herself too seriously, which I love. This is a story about her personal journey, not a self-help book. You need to read it accordingly. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many books, too little time to read this one!","review":"We tried to read this in my book club. It was almost unanimous. We all got throught the Eat part and thought it was fine. The Pray part was painful and only a few of us were diehards and ended up reading the Love section or parts of it. I don't understand why this book is so popular unless it is the title and cover. It was one of those books where I thought of all the other great books I could have read while I was wasting my time reading this one. Too many books, too little time to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"I loved this book. I laughted and cried through out and could not put it down. I especially loved reading about Gilbert's experiences in Indonesia. I wish I could take this trip and discover myself as she did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read, read and read","review":"I have not finished the book yet but I'm enjoying every page of it. In fact I try not to read it too fast as I don't want to finish it too soon. It is funny, deep, human and that is the reason I advice everybody read, read and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read, Smile, Enjoy","review":"This book is well-organized; the structure and numbering of the chapters is a clever touch that grounds the memoirs. Gilbert is a talented writer whose vivid descriptions move the stories along at a good pace. The ending was a bit weak - the third part of the book was not as strong as the first two and didn't have as solid a conclusion as I was expecting after being so firmly drawn in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda boring!","review":"This book was really slow in parts especially in the middle - and kind of boring. It was not what I expected. It did get better towards the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't engage the audience","review":"To see great stories about physical/emotional/spiritual journeys, read \\"Unbroken\\" or watch \\"The Way\\" or \\"The Way Back\\". This movie had great potential but just didn't reach into my soul and grab me."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it","review":"Irritating and wordy, straordinario, my favorite Italian word, does not describe this book. A tale I could only barely get through a third of, about an insecure, neurotic, gluttonous and self-absorbed woman who is basically trying to make herself (and others apparently) even more sick of herself. It's overwrought and self aggrandizing ... 'when i'm an old lady, i wanna be like Rome' ...? ok. Gilbert, and how crafty it was, 'used' a mala as a model of construction. For a journey of identity discovery, enough of it seems a bit second hand with paths already too well beaten to be authentic. I think i will aver - traverse ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What enlightenment?","review":"So many people have said they read this book, but often I discover most of them could not get past Italy and never finished the book. I really found it difficult to finish this book myself. I did not find the writing style to be particularly clever or witty. I could not connect to the self-absorbed author. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much whining","review":"While I loved the concept and trips abroad, there was simply too much whining about her ex husband even though she is the one who left him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Rip Off - Penguin needs to learn how to treat customers","review":"This has been on my \\"to read\\" list for awhile and I should have bought it when the Kindle version was $6.50 - yes - 1/2 the price it is now (just 2 months ago even!)!!! Penguin has increased all the Kindle prices that for now, I will wait for the library to get it back and not give them anymore of my money. I am disappointed that I can't read it on my Kindle which I really much rather prefer, but not until this publisher learns a little bit more about customer service. The fact that the Kindle version is $4 MORE than a paperback version really chaps my hide!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good, or healthy, read...","review":"This book should have been titled: \\"IT'S ALL ABOUT ME!!!!\\" All I can say is I cringed to have to even give it a single star. I thought this book was going to be enlightening on some level, but instead it is about a narcissistic individual unhappy with life because, well, it just doesn't make her happy. Waaaa-waaaaa-waaaaa! If only everybody had the money to jump on airplanes, explore life, and live strictly for themselves when things didn't quite provide enough pleasure, excitement, or satisfaction, but that's not how life plays out. Sometimes you have to give a little. Life is NOT about us, it's about making a difference in someone else's life and watching the impact you can make for good. This book is a clear example of how a person can go in search of the WORLD and still not find true contentment."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete overblown junk","review":"this book is absolute crap and its only merit is that it is testimony to the power of marketing. I actually threw it against the wall I disliked it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"Got it as a gift (M, if you are reading this, sorry, no offense!), which is why I even read the few pages that I did read of it - I couldn't get past some 12 pages or so. I normally finish any book that I pick up, unless I just can't bear the narrative style as well as the theme - unfortunately this book falls in the unbearable category.Obviously from the 5-star reviews here and from feedback from some of my friends, some people really \\"connect\\" with it.. I simply don't understand their view point on this one.The title itself suggests a sort of \\"self-help\\" book, preachy and pseudo-spiritual. Honestly, traveling to India on a spiritual quest has become an over-used cliche. Not sure if the author discovered anything of herself or spirituality in her travels - from the sound of the other reviews here, she did not! Glad I did not waste the time reading it fully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course it was about her!","review":"I am thoroughly amused by all the negative reviewers who complain that the book was all about the author. LOL!!! My literary-challenged fellow citizens, that's why it's a memoir! Who else is it supposed to be about? In any case, I found it a delightful read and I fully support her self-centeredness, self-absorption and self-indulgence. There are more than enough suffering, self-sacrificing women in the world. Good for her that she took the time to explore her inner landscape and so what that her problems weren't life threatening? Would she be a more worthy subject if she were living in abject poverty or suffering great physical pain? I do think India dragged a bit, but only because it came after the volumptous indulgences of Italy. And to the reviewer who was upset cause the book wasn't \\"Christian\\"...Why should it have been Christian? There are many routes to prayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray and Love","review":"This book is excellent I enjoyed reading and purchased it for my best friend I thought she would benefit from it like I did.

Our club reads a variety of books, from classics to historical fiction. The book we read prior to EPL was What is the What by Dave Eggers, which was a gripping, emotional and sometimes diffucult read because of the real tragedy that Valentino Achak Deng had experienced. Proceed from that great read to Eat, Pray and Love. Our group in its entirety really hated the book. We could not appreciate the insight and humor that the author was trying to convey because all she did was cry, complain and whine. We heard it was a great read, but our group gave it a 100% thumbs down. The best part about our club meeting that night was the book inspired dessert and the iced tea served in jelly jars."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding","review":"Save yourself the money and the time and don't bother. If I could bail out on my family, friends and my job to meditate in a cave in India for four months, I would probably find some peace too. I found her to be very self absorbed and self centered. I spent more time saying to my self \\"give me a break\\" and \\"when is she going to get over her self\\", than actually getting anything meaningful out of this book. This book came highly recommended to me, so I was thrilled to see I was not the only one who felt they have also lost several hours of their life that they will sadly never get back. This truly is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed junk","review":"What a waste of time.

I have never returned a book but i did return this one, and the attendant didn't seem very surprised to see it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was surprised at how disappointing this book was. I lived in Italy for over 5 years and was really looking forward to reading a book that might capture the essence of living in and experiencing Italy. I agree with other reviews that the author's insights are actually annoying, cliche, \\"pat\\" (used this way: so glibly plausible as to seem contrived [...], cloying, superflous, shallow, and just fake. I have read better books by expatriates of true Italian experiences, insightful, inclusive, with depth and true self-discovery and growth (the book, \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\", by Frances Mayes (long before the movie came out) or \\"An Italian Education\\" by Tim Parks.

However, I disagree. The author was incredibly honest about her mental state along the way. I found the book to be a quick, easy read with an inspiring, teaching approach. I enjoy reading travel novels because I can really get invested in a city and it's culture through a writer's narrative. Although I don't consider this book to rank up there with the best of travel books(like Under the Tuscan Sun), I do give her credit for leading me through the difficult personal time she was experiencing. She resisted the easy path of allowing the book to rest on the laurels of the countries themself and instead focused on her particular perspective and how it was enhanced by the native people and culture surrounding her."},{"rating":"2","title":"eat pray love","review":"I think this is a moving book about a women who is deprived o happiness and mves forward towards changeing her want s dersire ot learn about love and life an plseasure. this is a moving book for woem or anyone one is a afarid to make a change in there life. i comend her for her word that she shared through her experiances and her efots to share her story to the world. and kgives hope that there is love and god and faith that will bring you happiness"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised it was a bestseller...","review":"I'm surprised this book was a bestseller. The premise of the book is very interesting but I agree with other reviewers that the author is self-absorbed, immature and seriously lacking self esteem. I can't believe how selfish and self-centered this woman is!! She gives the stereotype, that women are neurotic, validity. It's a good thing she doesn't want children because she definitely shouldn't have any. As a conservative new mom, I found her views on motherhood and politics semi-offensive and irritating. That being said, I thought SOME of the book was well written and humorous. I found a lot of her spiritual \\"exploration\\" to be irritating but it did make me think about my own spirituality. And I did enjoy the historical and cultural information she included, written with a nice twist. If you are trying to pass a rainy day, it's not the worst book to read. There were parts of the book that were difficult to get through but overall it's a pretty \\"easy read\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I don't understand all the hoopla over this book. I have tried two different times to get through it and CANNOT. It's so boring. People rave and rave and say it's fabulous but I just don't understand. I've only made it to India and can't stay awake. And I read and LOVED LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA which was slow...but good, intriguing, had a plot. So I can get through books others find boring. I gave it two stars because I didn't finish - one star is a freebie for the part I didn't read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I saw Elizabeth Gilbert on TV talking about her book and she came across as a likeable person and her story sounded interesting. In the beginning of the book I was very surprised how high strung and self-centered she appeared. She seemed like a big drama queen, also trying too hard to be funny. But I thought she toned down a lot as her journey and the book moved on. I don't believe in the highly exceptional spiritual experiences she claims to have had, which is besides the point. I did like the book and she has a good way of expressing herself. Also I thought she had some interesting background information regarding her host countries."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Didn't Want it to End!","review":"I LOVED this book!

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring book - really get lost in another world","review":"I loved this book. I also listened to the Book on CD, read by Elizabeth Gilbert, the author. It was wonderful hearing the book as it was intended by the writer. This book is a journey to another life, a life focused on bliss, solitude and compassion. Beautifully written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH???","review":"I just got online to read the reviews for this book. I have to admit, I am floored. I LOVE my Kindle, BUT THE KINDLE PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE PAPER VERSION? HUH?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book was just a waste of time and money!","review":"I really expected a lot more from this author as her book was advertised all over and became popular. I thought it can teach me something I don't know. But the whole thing was about this woman's shallow thoughts and feelings here and there and her boring journey with her exaggerating some unimportant happenings in her life and making an annoying cliche out of them. I forced myself to finish this book and could easily throw it in the garbage afterwards. I don't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"spoiled","review":"Yes, Gilbert's prose were written very well. She is talented. But, this talent has left her self-indulgent and spoiled. I couldn't get past the first 10 pages of whining. And before I proceeded any further, I asked friends who read the book if the author arrives at any meaningful revelations or redemptions on her quest. Everyone responded with a \\"no\\". Spoiled author. Can't waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Terrible Terrible","review":"This was just awful. I echo the views of many who found her to be just self-absorbed and whiny. There are gimmicky silly devices all over everywhere (e.g., I've changed the names of everyone, oh but not of this Texan chappie, ok almost everyone; and I've omitted mentioning my spiritual guru in India because, well, I'm sure he doesn't want the publicity...).I also could not bring myself to finish this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend it","review":"My heart goes out to those who say this is the best book they've ever read. Man, they are reading some bad, bad books! I just can't recommend this one. I found it too self-indulgent from an author too self-absorbed. I slogged through to the end because it was a bookclub selection, so was mildly surprised by the tolerable 3rd section, which concentrated on Bali. I did come away feeling I'd learned more about Bali than I have from any other source, not that I've had much exposure there. I know that the book was NOT about the places she'd been, but rather, about herself IN those places. Still, I think any reader is more interested in the place and not the writer's reaction to it. Maybe if she'd been a more compelling character herself, I would have granted her that privilege."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over it and grow up","review":"I wanted to shake the author and tell her to grow up. I was so annoyed by her and her whining while reading this book that I almost didn't finish it. Had it not been a selection for a book club, I would never have spent the time on it. She was so self-centered that I could not handle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So glad to know I am not the only one!","review":"I did not like this book AT ALL!! I thought it was going to be so great, based on what I had heard and I was so disappointed. Were I not so Type A and a person who hates to leave anything unfinished, I would have put this book down after the first 20 or so pages. To be frank, I didn't become the least bit interested until the last 3rd of the book, when she got to Indonesia. My book club is reading this for February, so I am anxious to see if anyone else disliked it as much as me. Maybe I am not \\"deep\\" enough or enlightened enough, but I thought it was pretty much drivel, as well. Save your time (and money)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say, \\"self absorbed?\\"","review":"This is a book by a self-absorbed, wealthy, spoiled Manhattanite. Her life seems to consist of basically whining, self-analyzing, and the pursuit of her personal happiness. Her world is All About Wonderful, Deserving Me.If that sounds interesting to you, read away.All I can say is YAWN. (With a fair amount of GAG mixed in.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I could not make myself finish this book. Not only is the author self-absorbed and annoying, her narrative is BORING!! In her book, Gilbert states that she can make friends with anyone . . . her ex-husband and anyone who spends more than 30 minutes with her might have to disagree. I could only suffer through about 100 pages of whining, complaining and neediness before I closed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I expected insight, not self-absorption. Unfortunately, reading this book was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from enlightenment","review":"The first third of this book was painful, but I stuck it out due to my friend's strong recommendation. The incessant whining and droning on about her life was compounded by paragraph-long analogies that were recycled from a few Sex in the City episodes. (And yes, I find it ironic that I am complaining about Gilbert's complaining) The writing was self-absorbed and downright egotistical at times, which is quite a juxtaposition to her spiritual quest of egolessness. But in order to see the light, you have to go through the darkness. And maybe this was Gilbert's intention when writing this book. But regardless, I found it neither well written nor enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"With so many books to read, why read this?","review":"I understand the author's pain and respect her journey to heal her heart. However, I found the book woefully lacking in depth. I cannot fathom why people have found this book inspiring. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't finish this book...","review":"Having heard so many positive reviews of this book, I really, really wanted to like it. I have been struggling through every page of her narcisistic babble and have finally decided I can't go on. I made my decision upon reading last night that she had decided to stay another 3 months in India. I think my exact words were, \\"Oh dear God, you've got to be kidding me.\\" I can't do another 3 months in India with her...I think I'll lose my mind.The ONLY reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the Italian portion of the story piqued my interest enough that I am now more interested in learning more about the Italian language and making Italy my next travel destination."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"So THIS is what all the noise is about? I guess I too could write a \\"memoir\\" about my trip to Italy and all my great meals and drone on and on about my ex boyfriend. The India section? Total impenetrable stereotype. Indonesia? Hunh? Another work from a moneyed, privileged NYC writer that makes women appear superficial. I'm embarassed to have bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"grow up","review":"Elizabeth Gilbert turns 35 during her year of self absorbed indulgence. Her time in Italy read more like that of a run away teenager eating, drinking and lusting for Italian men while missing the great opportunity to study the ancient civilization, art, religion and culture that exists in Rome. In India she talks obsessively about \\"her guru\\" (who we never meet) and the difficulty to unselfishly be introspective. Bali shows Elizabeth having so much sex she must reach for her collection of antibiotics. Her behavoir is immature and reckless. And, of course, she did all this on the publisher's dime - imagine had she genuinely taken this journey, kept diaries and THEN pitched it to her publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm biased because I didn't like the narrator","review":"In a book like this you need to have empathy for the lead/subject. I couldn't find it in me. I know she addresses this but, yes, she does sound spoiled. And my lack of connection to her spoiled the book for me. Good for her for living her dream and her success. But the book isn't much of anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average, boring book","review":"I am half-way through the book and I am finding it: boring. There really is nothing to it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Journey","review":"I was surprised to see how many negative reviews there are about this book. It is a beautiful story of one woman's journey to loving herself. Whether it is by traveling for a year or doing something else it is a beautiful thing to find a way to take the time to learn who you really are and to love yourself anyway. For all of those women out there writing reviews that criticize Elizabeth for referring to herself in positive ways and who are calling her self absorbed, you are only perpetuating the stigma that woman should only speak of themselves in self deprecating ways. This is a beautiful read and a wonderful reminder to us all of how important it is to be true to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent book but...","review":"Live Like A Fruit Fly, a book i recently found on amazon, cuts to the chase much faster and is far more practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"I listened to this on tape and found my mind wandering almost the whole time. Her monitone drone was a snooze. Or was it the content? I did try to pay attention to the Italy portion, but even this wonderful country, which she narrated as a history teacher, was a snore after a bit. So glad I did not waste money on this drivel. She is a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat Pray Love","review":"I could not get into this book. I am going to watch the movie and hopefully I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish it","review":"I tried to like this book... I wanted to like this book... I could not finish this book. The only thing I appreciated was her sense of humor at times. She seems self-centered and completely unaware of others needs. I really question her great ability to make friends. On one level I can see that she could be a great person to have at a party with many entertaining stories etc. but I define \\"friend\\" differently -she doesn't seem like she would be a dear faithful friend, someone you could count on in times of trouble (although I'm sure she'd make it for the good times). She seems unstable and flighty. It is probably a wise decision for her not to have children. Also in regards to her husband... sounds like a very painful time for him but it's probably for the best that she's moved on. I hope he can heal and find peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Dude's View","review":"I picked up this book out of curiosity as my wife was reading it at the time - it was well written and engaging in the technical sense, but I kept reading it for the big reveal, waiting for the author to pull back the curtain and let us in on the joke: \\"Ta da! I'm not really that narcissistic or self-indulgent!\\". It was not to be.Did you ever have that friend that went backpacking through Europe/Asia/South-America and came back as *that* person? You know, the one that wants to share with everyone their new found worldliness and appreciation for foreign cultures? As they hold you hostage in the corner, trying to convey the importance of every minutiae of their adventure to your increasingly wandering mind, you begin to realise that they are simply a self-centred bore who wants to dress up their fancy vacation in the guise of a shallow, faux-spiritual journey of the soul.No? Well, you're in luck. Elizabeth Gilbert can be that friend in 352 glorious pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self absorbed girl goes traveling","review":"If you can stomach the first 90 or so pages of this book, you'll probably enjoy the rest. I had to read it for book club or I never would have finished. This chick is so self-absorbed and pampered she just doesn't get it. Why so many women love this book is beyond me.She spends the first 90 pages crying because she's unhappy. So, do something about it -- get a prescription or make some changes.And, of course, she eventually does. How easy to make a year long journey of self discovery -- especially when you get an advance to pay for the whole thing. It's all about her, her, her. She really doesn't learn much except to indulge herself even more.I can't help but feel that folks who find her story inspiring are spoiled navel-gazers and need to do some volunteer work for the less fortunate to get over themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Live Your Own Dreams & Leave This Book Behind","review":"Her other books are just as poorly written as this one, and none of them were interesting. I found nothing enlightening about this book either. I actually returned it to the bookstore to get my money back. If you want to be on the Path of Enlightenment, don't follow the masses, get off the internet and stop watching TV, seek out what inspires you and create your own path!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Go Home","review":"This is my first taste of chick lit. I enjoyed immensely EATing, found PRAYing ponderous and self-important, and found LOVE just odd. So our heroine who speaks no Indonesian befriends a Balinese woman and then writes to her myriad of wealthy friends and buys her a house! Our heroine has a serious Santa Claus syndrome. What will the effect of acts like this be on your ordinary Balinese meeting foreigners? When I was in Nepal and American couple became so found of their Nepali porter that they brought him to live with them for a year. Santa Claus!Soon Bali will face a tsunami of EPL carrying divorcees bring their emotional baggage. I am in Ubud and I see them now and they want to buy villas. One woman I met has followed in our heroine's footsteps, spending four months in Italy, India and now Bali. The medicine man has been overrun with needy women hoping that he will provide them with a special someone. All I can say is that there is a lot of suffering out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiration.","review":"This book was wonderful, and an easy read. There are so many wonderful gems through out the book regarding life philosophies. The story made me laugh and cry, and inspired me to look beyond as to what I need to change in my life in order to keep my life fresh, fun, and moving forward. I recommend this book to all women!"},{"rating":"2","title":"raw and real, speaks what many have felt","review":"I highly recommend this to friends, mostly women, but anyone who goes through changes in life. All of us do. What I appreciate most about this story is how Gilbert is unflinchingly real and raw with her internal emotions and dialogue. I connected with several of her anguishes and questions. While some call this self-indulgent, I believe it is a story of someone learning about themselves. When we learn, about ourselves and others, we expand the world. Thank you Ms. Gilbert, for your honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual and kept my interest","review":"I pretty much enjoyed this book. It captured my imagination though, at times, I sort of found myself wanting more...or more accurately, something else. Well written but a difficult combination of subjects to cover in one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Honest","review":"I loved this book. I feel like the author wrote it on behalf of many single women who are in search of their purpose in life. Reading this book was a liberating, educational, and captivating experience. It also made me realize the power of meditation, which I am starting to practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"eat pray love","review":"This book should have been titled \\"binge, loneliness and sex\\" which is really what it is all about, but maybe that is not such an attractive title for what you know has to be a best-seller. People don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Enjoy Smile","review":"A very positive documentary on exploring not only the places, food or meditation but also love and peace of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a boring and self-absorbed, disappointing book!","review":"I have never taken the time to do a review of any book online... but I absolutely think this book is crap and boring that I had to go to Amazon's website to write a review. I think the author is so self-absorbed that she has not really done any justice to researching and thinking what search for self and life's meaning really is. Granted that it's her book so she can talk about herself all she wants, and for some reason, a lot of people have bought her book that it has become a bestseller, there are so many more books that are more insightful on the same topic! I will be more wary next time when I see a New York Times Book Review that says a book is irresistible. Her book's a New York Times Notable Book... and I suddenly had this thought on whether author's can pay to get such accolade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This book is drivel, a waste of time, and garbage.Elizabeth Gilbert is odious, hedonistic, and as far from spiritually enlightened as I can imagine. She starts as a needy, dependent woman who is obsessed with men, and she ends at the exact same point. What a great transformation.This book made me cynical."},{"rating":"1","title":"there's just too much of blah blah...","review":"I had refused to read this book for its best-seller status fully supported by Oprah... However, I decided to read it when it was given to be by my friend. I don't think it was a complete waste of time but do think that this book's acclaimed fame and popularity are complete nonsense. She's self-absorbed, self-obsessed, exaggerating and self-acclaimed guru. I admit I did read this entire book. When finished reading it, I was like, \\"so??????\\" \\"So what??????\\" \\"What is this???\\" \\"Did this women finally finish with her blah-blahs, which really don't amount to anything but blah-blahs?\\"I'm giving 2 stars only because of my ability/willingness to read this entire book.I can only imaging how insecure and unhappy you have to be in order to be inspired? by her blah-blahs, idolize this woman, and then rate this book 3 stars or more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am listening to the audiobook version of this (which is narrated by Elizabeth herself).So far the odds of me finishing this book are not looking good. I feel as though several times a chapter I want to tell this woman to shut up. Stop babbling on and on about your personal attributes and how well you can make friends, what color your hair is, what your boring, normal childhood was like. I find no inspiration whatsoever in this story. Her humor is not funny to me and has actually made me cringe several times.To sum up, I feel that this COULD have been an amazing journey through words. But the author (and her editors) really missed the mark on this, getting too caught up in the author's narcissistic ramblings and not sharing the beauty and spirit of her travels.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"A must read for all of us who are on our own personal/spiritual journey. A women who you immediately relate to and would want to befriend. A Real, down to earth and a laugh out loud read. Treat yourself today to: Eat, Pray, Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow up on a previous review","review":"As was mentioned in a previous review, I enjoyed this book but not as much as Happiness That Is Guaranteed. It is much deeper and more substantive, less self-indulgent. It take you straight to the source of transcendent, joyful states that Gilbert approaches side-ways. No need to travel or change anything external. It is an internal journey to potentially will provide everything you want or need.Happiness That Is Guaranteed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilbert Unmasks the Emotions that Afflicts Us","review":"and takes us on a journey in search of peace, real fulfillment and reliable love.The themes that she deals with, reminds me of a recent book that I read called \\"Happiness That Is Guaranteed.\\" At a time in my life when I needed peace, real fulfillment, reliable love, and to feel alive again, this book saved my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding oneself","review":"This is a very good book and gives an interesting view of life abroad in Italy, India, and Indonesia. Elizabeth goes to these three countries in that order and there she finds balance and gets to know herself much more personally. Parts of this book are painful and other parts are blissful and in the end there is balance. Now what to read?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Indulge, Gaze at Your Navel, Obsess","review":"This book starts off well; it is well written, poignant, humorous, and insightful. Somewhere before the end of Italy though, Elizabeth Gilbert goes from all these lovely and positive traits to a person bent on proving that she deserves to have whatever the heck it is she wants. In fact, we should all do ourselves the favor of becoming self absorbed and selfish.And that is the journey that Gilbert suffers us on. She deserves a break today and everyday and sets out to figure out, \\"What does Elizabeth want.\\" Period.And really how terrific is that, an advance for a book, this book, telling all of us how to achieve selfishness, like we need told, duh.I really enjoyed the first third of the book, but Gilbert gets to be so full of herself, her wisdom, her desires that is just got b-o-r-i-n-g."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine, whine and more whining","review":"My God I want my time back for reading the 1st half of this book!I so hope that her ex-husband got a portion of the royalities from this book, because she dumped on him sooooo much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused theology","review":"The writer of the book \\"Eat, pray, love\\" ventures out to find new meaning in life and ends up confused in a pool of different religions."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIMP","review":"I've traveled, and I've spent some time in Italy, India & Indonesia. Reading another's blather on limp and dramatic philosophies, bored me to tears. This is not soul-searching material. It's drool-inducing drivel.Don't even pick the book up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic, Annoying, and Too Girly","review":"I'm not sure who started the hype about this book, but it's not true. While the author's storytelling is witty and funny, this does not make up for the narcissism of a relatively spoiled woman who happened to encounter a kink in her life (a bad relationship). Rather than doing anything that could help better the world with the year she is given to take off and write this book, she spends her time fussing over a cute boy or two in Italy, obsessing over exactly how to meditate in India, and justifying the break from her self-imposed year-long fast from sex while she's in Indonesia. The Pray section of the book is the most annoying, and I would have stopped reading the book altogether had I not promised the girlfriend who gave me the book that I would read it. The book lacks any depth (emotional, cultural, or otherwise), and inspires its readers to nothing but their own self-centeredness. The only thing going for it is the author's wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly readable and thoroughly enjoyable","review":"I really loved this book. (Sorry I didn't give it 5 stars, but I need room to move.) I just found it compelling and honest, and even though the author covers geographical terrain that's been done before - Italy, anyway - she did it in such a unique and well-written way that I honestly started getting cravings for the gelati she spoke about. She wasn't just on a meandering journey across the world - her travels had purpose and intent, and for that reason I found the book meaningful, too. Each of her pitstops around the world - Italy, India and Indonesia - are so different from one another, both in location and in her experience and what she did there. I found her journey fascinating and it did make me wonder how to include more prayer (or at least meditation) in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost sale for Amazon and Penguin","review":"As has become my practice, if I see a book featured that looks intriguing I immediately log on to my iPad and download it. But as I always do I looked at the cost of other editions, confident in the knowledge that the savings in printing and distribution cost translate into a saving for me. But No, in this case I and all others are being ripped off as the dinosaurs at Penguin defend their printing businesses by cross subsidizing them from eBooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"EAt, Pray, Love","review":"Very long, very dull.The story is about a very self centered,self indulgent lost woman, looking for love in all the wrong places. Is it any wonder why we are such a lost society, when we do not believe in the one true God, but look for substitutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise - you are in control of your life....","review":"A re-count of the author's year spent in Italy, India, and Bali in the wake of a difficult divorce. This book is easy to read and enjoyable. The author does an excellent job of providing her outlook on the variety of experiences she has + how they relate to her dealing with her \\"life issues.\\" She eventually comes to the self-actualizing realization that she is in control of her life (as opposed to anybody else) and takes steps to make herself happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites EVER!","review":"I listened to this book on CD and absolutely *loved* it! It's my opinion that Liz Gilbert was absolutely NOT \\"selfish\\" in leaving her marriage, as one reader put it. Instead I found her to be unbelievably courageous in what she did...being true to herself, rather than continuing on in a relationship/marriage that looked good on the outside but was no longer working for her. What else should she have done...\\"pretended\\" to be happy and at peace, when in actuality she was totally miserable? I've been there/done that...and it didn't (doesn't) work!Liz's tales and travails of her year long adventure were alternately sweet, funny, sad, touching...and always incredibly real and honest.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I've told several friends about this book, and they've practically flipped over backward in appreciation that I did.FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS BOOK! READ IT...YOU'LL BE SOOOOOOO GLAD YOU DID!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This book was recommended via a book club I belong to. I was really drawn into Elizabeth's story. My favorite line in the book, which still resonates with me, and probably always will, is when she tells herself \\"I love you\\". It's just stayed with me, and I think about it every so often. For me, that's a sign of a good book. As I said above, I loved it. A great read for the summer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I still haven't finished it...","review":"Oh. My. God. This book was boring. There are no words. I managed to struggle through the first part ('Eat') and got so bored over the part in India ('Pray') where the character goes all religious that I put the book down and didn't bother finishing it. I don't understand why there was so much hype. I've only gotten through the 'Eat' part of the movie and haven't finished that either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan of the Book...","review":"Not even close! I was so excited to read this book. But even as I *trudged* through Italy, I knew I wouldn't, couldn't finish it. I think i gave up somewhere in India, so i have no idea what happened in Indonesia, and i don't even care. There are sooooooo many more, much better written, literary masterpieces out there. Why would I want to spend my precious time on this drivel? Self-serving, self-involved and self-important...that's how this author comes across in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basket case","review":"This book has been so often-recommended to me that I thought I should buy it for my latest-generation Kindle. I will not finish it. I was very bored: She is so \\"more sensitive than thou\\" (\\"I honor the sensitivity that resides in me, but not in you\\". And all that weeping on bathroom floors? Maybe she overcame that, but what about those bathroom cooties?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given it a big Zero if I could","review":"An awful self indulgent book by a person who obviously has no comprehension of real challenges or suffering. It has no depth at all and it is somewhat alarming that the author is now doling out relationship advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-indulgent writing - should have been a blog not a memoir","review":"the first 10 or so pages were ok, after that I had to do employ extreme ahistorical empathy to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question","review":"Why is the electronic versin continually more expensive than the physical book copy and more expensive than the German Kindle cost?

It can very quickly and in great condition. There is another i heard that is called Women food and something else. It makes you evaluate your life and what you have always said you wanted to accomplish versus what you have actually accomplished. It makes you evaluate the people in your life and makes you want to eliminate anyone in your life that is not loving, kind and supportive to you. I want to see the movie to compare how it is in regards to the book. This is one you will want to read and find hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle price vs paperback","review":"My Kindle was stolen a couple weeks ago, so I purchased this book in paperback new for $8.99. I received my new kindle today and was dissapointed to see that the Kindle price was higher than the book price. Guess I'll finish reading it in the paperback format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you. If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title is Deceiving","review":"Will not continue to read this book! The title is deceving, how can one give it this title? When she says the (F) word. I will not recommend this book to anyone. So glad I didn't see the movie either. I will never read this authors books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I reccomend this book all the time!","review":"This book was a gift from a friend when I was going thru some extreme changes in my life. It was the perfect read for that time in my life. A heartfelt story that lingered long after the cover has been closed. A must read for anyone who struggles with the idea of what they are supposed to want and the reality of their heart's desires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please...Stop the Pity Party","review":"Elizabeth Gilbert's quest to deal with life post-divorce could have been interesting, enlightening and entertaining. Instead, the reader is treated to whining, moaning and more whining. I rapidly lost sympathy for her and could only wonder how her marriage lasted as long as it did. Ms. Gilbert is a gifted writer and parts of the book were witty and humorous, but too often she succumbed to the temptation to wallow in self-pity. Too bad...this could have been a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, if you need something to read - don't go out of your way, though","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that said that this book is very over hyped . I heard the author interviewed on NPR and thought the book sounded mildly interesting but wouldn't have read it unless two of my friends recommended it. From page 1, I felt that the author used way too many words to express very little in terms of content. She goes on and on, tries really hard to entertain us, and it shows. The section on meditation was illuminating -- she said she had monkey mind, which made total sense because that's exactly how she writes . It's still an entertaining book, but not a great book; there are a lot of better books around ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Read Ever","review":"This review should be zero stars. I had such high hopes for this book, but I only finished it because it was our book club's selected reading. The constant whining and crying (good gracious, in what country is she sobbing now?) was almost too much to bear. Never have I read a story by such a self-centered, narcissistic author who genuinely believes her readers should have some sympathy for her. I whole-heartedly agree with all of the other reviewers in their descriptions of the disaster that this book is.

Yikes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is all about the journey","review":"Personally, I love this book. I think anyone whose journey has been a rambling road can relate to this story. I found myself terribly jealous that she was able to spend this time traveling, finding herself and making peace with the negative thoughts.I found myself laughing out loud throughout this book and have given it to friend's as a gift. It is definately a fun read but it is also one that makes the reader consider who they are. It has only increased my desire to travel to these places and what an honor for her to be able to really absorb the culture of these places. I recommend this book to anyone who still has those nagging thoughts, who longs to travel or just wants a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!!!","review":"Thankfully, I borrowed this book from a friend so it didn't cost me any money. But it did cost me lots of time! I actually stopped reading it after the second part of the book and getting through that was absolute torture. The author is just so freakin' WHINY!

I wish I read them before I opened the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything and more.","review":"Okay, so the ending was a little schmultzie...or maybe I'm just envious...but the book was terrific, inspirational, motivational, transformational, ya-da, ya-da, ya-da. Oh yeah, and it was funny, too. I'm on my second time through, bought it for a gift and have recommended it to many. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"get over your stupid self","review":"This book is a load of crap. I cannot for the life of me understand how so many people, women in particular, can find this book enlightening or even interesting. All I could think was, honey, you need to get over your *&c*ing self--you ain't all that. Why do so many people have to fly around the planet to find themselves? If you want enlightenment, you can walk down the damn street and help a kid whose parents are working 16 hours a day at minimum wage. What a stupid waste of time this book is. But it makes a nice slap if you throw it against the wall, and it's an excellent tool for smashing flies and cockroaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This was a self absorbed self centered woman. Her subtitle was to find everything. She ended up with nothing. When she said her eyes during the divorce were like a refugee, I thought you should have spent the money going to Africa and seen REAL refugee eyes. And in Indonesia when she got a bladder infection, and called it a TRAGEDY, it was too much.Better still she should have gone to Africa to help people and she would have ended up with what she searched for which was \\"everything\\".I certainly will never buy a book by Elizabeth Gilbert!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A litmus test for out-of-it","review":"I really hesitate to write a review for this book, much less admit I read it. I consider it sort of \\"slumming,\\" as if I was caught rubber-necking with all the others to see what the fuss was about...When I run into people that talk about this book, and how much they enjoyed it, I feel a burst of superiority, a sort of self-righteous pride, and I secretly hold it against them for their high opinions. I don't like feeling that way--but this is one of those books that is beyond awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was horrific!!","review":"I could not even get through the first chapter. I found it extremely difficult to empathize with the author. \\"oh poor me getting divorced, I think I'll travel around the world. boo-hoo\\". When I got divorced I did not get to travel around the world, I got to move in with my Mother! So, sorry Liz, sorry that I contributed to your bank account by buying this piece of trash. Clearly, everyone has their own opinion, for some reason people like this book. In my opinion, it is a complete waste of money. If you must read it, borrow it from your library first, but you might want to save yourself and read something more worthwhile, like your coffeemaker user's manual. Much better reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and self-centered","review":"Isn't it ironic that the three countries that the author traveled begin with the letter \\"I\\" as did nearly every sentence in the book? What a sex-crazed narcisist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self absorbed drivel","review":"I challenge anyone to name an author more self absorbed, trivial, cliche, and boring. Who are these 5 star reviewers?Amazon - please offer us negative ratings so we can appropriately rate these moronic books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiring but needs editing","review":"I am motivated to pursue writing from my experience after reading this. While amusing, inspiring and enlivening I feel it could have been best told at half its paper space.Written by a young and ambitious writer the book has had major impact on many young women, we are living in a golden age of stream of consciousness publishing based on the ability to put pen to paper.Let this book be a lesson to all: if you feel you can do it, you can; the success of this book proves this however, there is a far longer and higher road to Greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I am an avid reader so I joined a book club. This book was on the list so, I bought it. I have had a hard time getting into it even though, I too, after my divorce went with a friend to Italy. It is probably just not my type of book, very slow, really boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I can't figure out what people got out of this book. The author should have made it a short story of Italy. It was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A whine","review":"It was very hard to like the author. It felt like a long whine. I put the book down after the third chapter. For those of us that aren't globetrotters yet there are better books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED IT.....","review":"Ok....in all fairness I did enjoy the first section as the author traveled through Italy. I gave up on it when she got to India and I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. I tried to like it, but it bored me. There are far too many great books out there to waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for More...","review":"After seeing this book do so well, I had to read it! However, while reading it, I found myself wondering what all the fuss was about. While I found Gilbert to be incredibly talented with metaphors and insightful at times, she displayed an air of superiority that got under my skin and kept me from fully enjoying her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK I EVER READ!","review":"I honestly don't know what all the hype for this book was about. It was the worst book I have ever read. I have read better books as a pre-teen (heck, the Baby-Sitters Club and Goosebumps series are wayy better than this book). It was definitely a waste of my time. In fact, it was so painful to read, I didn't finish the book. I stopped at the beginning of her Indonesia trip. Whoever paid her to do this book deserves pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"Basically entertaining and spiritually helpful.A good read, but a bit slow in the beginning, then picked up halfway through the first segment.What could have been a very boring story is rescued by Gilbert's amusing way of looking at life.I recommend this book to those with open hearts and a willingness to go on this personal journey with the author. Let her story unfold and bring into your own life the discovery of a fresh way of being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - Not great.","review":"After seeing the buzz around the film, I thought that I would invest in reading the book as the story is usually much better. This book was worth the $6.00 I paid for it...but not much more. Now, there was considerable amounts of wisdom I took from it, but despite the wonderful wisdom you can take, the approach to the telling was an issue. The writing was very sappy, too heartfelt and too intimate for me to feel comfortable with at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I normally stay away from \\"chic lit\\" (even though I'm a woman) but I decided to give this a try after reading the description. The book is great! The author is funny, down to earth, and connects well with the reader. This is a very inspirational and thought-provoking book. Good for anyone who is going through a break-up or just kind of at a standstill in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"OPRAH WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?","review":"This is a self absorbed and selfish woman who came up with a cleaver title and is laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad case...","review":"This book should be called DON'T-BUY-ME...I rarely, rarely purchase books of this type and did so on a whim since I had heard it was so great. I was SO incredibly irritated I didn't even make it through Italy...From what I ready, I found this woman incredibly self centered, severly lacking in self esteem, totally lost beyond words. Nothing I could relate to... To think I funded this woman's diatribe annoyed me badly. I intially decided to throw it out, but I used it as a fire starter - as I curled up to read a real book. Unless you are lost and confused beyond words, or would like to learn how to be, just skip this colossal mess of a money grab. The only satisfaction I derived was watching it burn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Felt Sorry For the Improved Her","review":"the first dozen pages were brilliant. 90% of the books is lousy writing and a miserable read.she could be likeable but seems cold-hearted: for example: she doesn't feel sorrow over the two orphans in wayan's shop whom wayan seems to have taken in simply to work as free cooks and housekeepers for her and her shop. the author mentions that wayan doesn't include these poor 'orphans' in the new house purchase and the author doesn't really mind. i bet those 2 poor, abused homeless children are not in wayan's house now (there is a small chance she kept them on as servants after the book was published and widely read). that is just the type of thing the author is unintelligent and insensitive about.she is an oaf. an emotionally rough yet weak person. she obsesses on a random person and gloms onto that person 24/7 to an embarassing extent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste brain cells reading this","review":"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. So badly written I just wanted to take my editor's pencil to it or re-write it. Preachy tone, boring prose.Someone told me that it would be a good book to read while I was in Ubud. The only good thing to do with this book in Ubud was to throw it into the ravine of the Monkey Forest."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I kept waiting for the story to get some point. It just dragged on and on forever! I got about half way and couldn't take the torture anymore. It basically is about an unstable divorcee (her choice) talking about 'finding herself'. Whine, Wine, Praying, more whining and food. Oh and then at the end everything is kind of hunky dorey. (I had to skip to see if anything got any better). I ended up watching the movie to quicken things up and just out of curiosity. I felt it was a real blow for Julia Roberts to have resorted to this role. It was just as much a snooze fest as the book. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining","review":"Okay this book is just a four country whine fest. Elizabeth Gilbert whines about not wanting to have children in America, eating too much food in Italy, not being able to meditate in India and the heat in Bali...give me a break.There were moments when this book was not a tedious bookclub task book to read...some of the characters seemed a bit exaggerated but that did make parts of this book palatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of whining","review":"i bought this for my kindle because of all the hype, got about 24% of the way through and returned it. To sum up the whole 24%, she gets divorced, is depressed, learns italian in rome and eats a lot of gelatos. this book is full of useless rambling and whining. i wouldn't recommend this to a friend.i will say that i'm very pleased that i was able to return it. i got a credit to my account within minutes and customer service was very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Pray, Love. And Read This Book","review":"Even if you end up disagreeing with this author's approach and/or conclusions, read this book for its delightful play with words and word pictures. But, you'll likely come to appreciate Ms. Gilbert's journey--physical and spiritual, all the while laughing out loud, and will be provoked to think hard about your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wittingly Surprising","review":"After hearing so much about the book on various TV shows, and women commenting on it, Yes, I decided to purchase the book.The book is written with alot of entertainment, a play on words, she is very good in terms of being witty and capturing your attention. Although, she expands her stories to three locations. She looses me after Italy. The writing is still good, her description of emotions and experiences are still great. But I was a touch disappointed!Nonetheless, the book is about a journey in finding oneself, and I must admit was therapeutic for me, the book did manage to change my views on things. However I too, come from a long journey of events, and yes. I choose to find a sense of humour in life. So I do eat, pray, and love.I would recommend a definite read."},{"rating":"1","title":"FUNNY BUT NOT ENOUGH!","review":"I thought the writing was entertaining and very genuine but not mature enough. I couldn't wait to finish the book .... I had to scan through the last few pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"boo hoo","review":"I found this book to be whiny and self-absorbed. I honestly couldn't get past the first 20 pages, skimmed thru a lot of the rest and felt like it's a 300 page version of a lame women's magazine article. Oh boo hoo, you have 2 homes, money,travel around the world. Poor you, to have so many hot men interested in you that you have to declare celibacy- what about those of us who are celibate because we don't have hot men chasing us? Who have to work for a living and can't afford to go on soul-searching vacations? I just couldn't relate to the author. Lots of people get divorced and have a hard time of it, what makes her so special?...this book isn't worth your time or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck it up and move on.","review":"Is it wrong of me to want to slap her?? I just really couldn't identify with the character because I thought she was a self-centered, over-privileged, egotistical b****. Like all of us, most problems are self-induced and rather than face and deal with them, she escapes. That is cowardice in my book and I can't respect someone that chooses cowardice over perseverance.It sounds like a lot of fun to just take off and I'm glad she chose to celebrate herself with her new-found wealth, but guess what sweetie - self-indulgence only takes you so far.I usually enjoy memoirs but the people have to be interesting to me, have to capture my emotions through growth and/or sentimentality, and this character did neither.Then they get J.Rob to play the lead; perfect casting. Doesn't look a thing like the author (I thought Elizabeth Mitchell would have been a much better choice) but the attitude is spot on! Good job Hollywood"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a good travel memoir.....this book wouldn't be your best choice!","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. It dwells far too much on the author's divorce and her issues with depression and loneliness. If you're looking for a self help book on how to recover from a painful divorce and/or get past issues of depression, perhaps you'd enjoy this book. However, if you're looking for an enjoyable tale about world travel, this isn't it. The brief details included about the three countries Ms. Gilbert visited are not enough to make up for the overall dreary tone of the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promiscuous author","review":"I think this book should be called \\"sleeping my way across the world\\". She cheapens the concept of love and what we need to bring peace/respect to our civilization. This is an \\"Oprah mentality/religious treastise\\". Pitiful!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"indulgent, spoiled rotten, selfish, vapid, narcissistic-EMPTY","review":"It is a good text for all that is wrong about our culture today...vapid, narcissistic, over-indulgent & spoiled.The author is incredibly self-serving & shallow and gives Americans a bad name. Her thinly disguised bragging about literally everything is very annoying.Navel-gazing at its most bothersome."},{"rating":"1","title":"I...I...I...","review":"This is the first book I have reviewed without finishing the book...but I could not. No wonder the author only went to countries that began with the letter 'I', because that is exactly what this book is about - I. It is just such a selfish, self indulgent exploration. The 4 or more starred reviews must be from very young women whom are still in that phase of their lives. I suggest reading Three Cups of Tea, Swan House, What is the What - a book where the protagonist has something to GIVE to others..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I would compare this book with the Stock Market.So, at the beginning I was an enthusiast so let's say \`HI STOCKS'In India they went very low( very hard to accept totally exclusion from the real life...what a hoof) then my hopes raised again by the beginning of Bali... and ended extremely low with the Love Story ( I hope it all hold well, but it smells more like an typical American love story....) .Blah Blah BlahBut I am not expecting too much from the average American traveler.Good lecture for the Babies divorcees out there running for meaning ( OH, there may be something else to LIFE, I see!!! Ha Ha Ha)"},{"rating":"1","title":"so what, really?","review":"big deal, a well-paid journalist from new york city gets a divorce and then gets a paycheck to go rent some houses, hang out in Italy and do yoga in Asia for a little while. WHOOP-DE-DOO!sorry, i just don't see much heroic or adventurous in her endeavor, really, having traveled around the world for years on my own grit and survival skills - not a recurring paycheck from a huge magazine! it just kind of gets my goat that so many people find this story inspiring somehow... there are thousands upon thousands of far more inspirational people out there.the writer, however, is sometimes funny and entertaining - as she should be, as a paid professional. it's a cute read, but in all seriousness, how this book got so popular is beyond me - must have been an AWESOME publicist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"What self-absorbed drivel. I had to force myself to finish this book and just kept hoping it would get better and less infuriating. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"After all the \\"hype\\" about this book, (which I had to wonder where it came from?) I gave up and couldn't finish it. Ms. Gilbert talks about a failed marriage but only explained that it was she who decided to just leave to \\"explore\\" and find her \\"inner self\\"?? I got through Italy with paragraph and paragraph about sightseeing and eating. In India, I'm still trying to figure out just what inner peace she needed? Perhaps she had past issues in her life that should have been explained besides a bad marriage and a man she is or is not in love with? I will admit she does have a witty personality, but this was so disappointing and I'm sorry I wasted my time trying to get into this book. I was determined to finish it but just couldn't. Ms. Gilbert just came off as a spoiled, self-absorbed brat. Good thing she didn't want children!If it's an \\"Oprah pick\\", I'll just leave Oprah's recommendations out of my searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there were an option for 0 stars","review":"Don't even waste your time. I can count on one hand the number of books that disgusted me so much I couldn't finish them and this was one of them. The whining is unreal for someone with no real responsibility in life. The author is very melodramtic. This woman needs real problems and has WAY too much time on her hands. I really wanted to slap the selfishness out of her. Awful, awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissaponting blow for womankind","review":"What started out as quirky, fast paced and funny quickly turned into a painful read for women who have passion and purpose in this world. As a twenty something who is trying to establish herself as a world traveler I found nothing insightful about how Gilbert's experiences shaped her into a strong and independent women- which made me doubt if she really is one. This book is a bulls eye target for women in their mid thirties, trying to define themselves in their post divorce era. Its for women who cannot see beyond themselves and therefore will identify with Gilbert's shallow introspections. If you think that your divorce is the catalyst for a new beginning to be self absorbed while trying to redefine yourself in a Oprah Winfrey feel good way- read this book. Actually contact me and I will send you my copy for FREE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems never ending","review":"The author rambled on and on...I found myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the \\"point\\". Don't waist your money. NOT ENGAGING, at ALL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh -- self absorbed writer travels globe...yay","review":"I'd read a good deal of these reviews before reading the book and still read it anyway. What a waste of time. It's not that the author is simply self-absorbed it's that she's self-absorbed and at the same time an incredibly self unaware person -- her repeated surprise at finding out that she's a control freak or that she's got \\"issues\\" about her serial monogamy are a surprise to only herself. Eat is tolerable and Love is an interesting review of Bali but Pray is just a beat down. If \\"Richard from Texas\\" writes a book I'd be interested in what he has to say about the ashram but this book is over-hyped and under delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore-fest!","review":"Usually when I hear there is a film and a book - I go for the book - I don't like the edited version. In this case, though, I believe the film will be better - editing could be just the ticket plus who doesn't love Julia Roberts!I have been a world traveler - did the travel through Europe and middle east as a student and more traveling as an adult - that is what drew me to the book but that is not what this book is about.Self-indulgence of the worst kind, too much looking within for answers when generally you'll find more looking outward, reflected off others.\\"Production is the basis of morale\\" is a wise saying and would help - I suggest you get out and help others, get involved in the world. The life of a writer - sitting home and looking inward needs to be balanced with other activity that is all good for the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling to get through the book","review":"So I got this book because of the movie. I struggled to read it. The author goes into tooooo much detail about things and it just drags on. She also writes the book for higher level readers which turns me off since there is toooo much detail"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Unlikely","review":"I hate to say something bad about someone else's life/experience. However, since she has put it out there, it is fair to be critical. There were a few sections which held my attention, but over all it was a boring and unlikely tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"the book was an excellent gift and came extremely quickly. I ordered the book with two day shipping and received it the following day. Although i have not read it I hear that it is an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a terrible book. If you are self-centered you will love this book.

Help -- can't think of one thing positive to say"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"I wanted to like this book. Everyone I knew loved it and said I had to read this book. I didn't make it past Italy. I was disappointed that she was paid to take this trip (book advance) and wondered how much of it was manufactured for the book. Also, to me, her tone seemed haughty and self-important."},{"rating":"1","title":"title is better than content","review":"With all the hype, I was disappointed with the book. All women struggle with identity, and this just seemed a little whiny to me. It was not the best book I read this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"EAT, PRAY, LOVED IT","review":"Having read a few of Oprah's recommendations, I wasn't too eager to read this, but I was attending a class at my church and this seemed to go along with the topic. I thought the Eat section great, but then Pray turned out even better, and by the time I got to Love, I was giving the book to my friends to read. I have always been a believer in God, and much of what Elizabeth experienced rings true. Certainly God is love, and if we all realized that, the world would be a better place. I'm Italian, find yoga a much needed escape, and my faith was boosted in the pages of this book. Guess it met all my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY ENTERTAINING","review":"I loved taking the journey across the globe on her quest to find a deeper and truer \\"self\\". Don't we all struggle with so many of the same aspects in life? The book is well written and while I have not yet seen the movie, I am sure it will also be good, starring Julia Roberts.I also just finished reading \\"Why NOT Me?\\" - by Raymond Rodriguez-Torres. It is the real-life story of his little daughter's victory over cancer and how God provided a miracle for this family. My faith has been taken to NEW heights!! Read it today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Cow","review":"I'll admit I did not get a chance to read all of the posted reviews so I apologize in advance for any repetitions. This wasn't my favorite book by far, but I appreciate how hard it is to write ANYTHING so I don't want to knock it too bad, but I wanted to recommend another travel story about India. The book is called \\"Holy Cow: an Indian adventure\\" by Sarah Macdonald. Macdonald gives a unique account of her travels to this wonderful, but very un-western destination. I was blessed enough to visit India myself, and Holy Cow just felt truer, (although still way out there), to the experience of visiting India. Hope this helps!Holy Cow: An Indian Adventure"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"Elizabeth Gilbert I am sure is a very sweet woman. But, the book was very..... I don't know, annoying. There was something about the author that made me want to scream. She was a whiner. A very big whiner. And it did not stop through the whole book. By the end I could not wait until it was over. The traveling bit was great but shut up and stop complaining already. The book was very blah, blah, blah. That is what I kept saying to myself by the end of the book, I basically skimmed the last ten pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"much adoo about so little","review":"a very advertised and highly recommented by different people....to my opinion though,it is certainly a lot less than expected, and very ''posed'', too.The writer tries to make her point.the fact is that, neither her language, hor her writing talents, prove enough for the issues talked about in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat Pray Love <3","review":"This is probably one of my favorite books and I cannot wait for it to become a movie! Elizabeth Gilbert is so funny and blunt and a great writer. She talks to you like she is talking to a friend when you read her book. Her story is about her first getting a divorce from her husband and then trying to find herself and getting to love herself before she can love anyone else by traveling to India, Indonesia, and Italy. Her trips make me want to travel the world like she did and I am currently reading her second book \\"Committed\\" about her being married and I am very excited to see how her life plays out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, Terrible, Vain","review":"What is it that compels people to buy this book? Even as I attempted to suspend judgment and read through to the end, there was never a point at which the author was capable of transcending her own experience -- and she is nothing but trite, terrible and vain throughout! Apparently the author strikes some self-help, self-realization chord that is popular in our culture at the moment, but I do not believe this book will withstand the test of time. It is very trite, terrible and vain throughout all three structured sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time on this one","review":"Not one interesting character. Not even the author. A horrible divorce... big deal. A love of food ... not really worth 116 pages. I had to get to page 156 to finally understand. She is in an Ashram in India having trouble silencing her mind and meditating.\\"What I am alarmed to find in meditation is that my mind is actually not that interesting a place after all.\\"That sentence sums up the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disastrous from beginning to end","review":"I beg of you, do not waste your valuable time on this book. The author's unparallelled self-absorbtion is entirely understandable in light of the fact that she was trying to work through a serious depression, but do you really want to spend your time listening to her analyze the minutiae of her daily life? B-O-R-I-N-G. There were only one or two insightful, interesting paragraphs in the whole book. I suffered my own existential crisis reading it because I could not understand how it became a best-seller - how could I be so out of touch with my fellow readers? Spare yourself this pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"agreed","review":"I couldn't get through the first thirty pages of this book either. A year after I gave up on it (not just gave up, but was utterly exhausted, irritated, and distressed by it) the author is on Oprah in a room full of women who call \\"Eat Pray Love\\" their bible. I logged on to find out if I'm the only person who found Elizabeth Gilbert to be, well, self-absorbed, self-obsessed, afraid of her own company, unable to see outside of her own drama. I am relieved to have found so many similar reviews. It makes me sad that women cling to this book as some kind of instruction manual on how to find rightness in their lives. P.S. Ms. Gilbert makes the same impression on Oprah as she did in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried.............","review":"I really wanted to love this, but while reading it, I could not get past the fact that the author is 34 years old! She's slim and lovely! She's wealthy! She's on a ALL-EXPENSES PAID \\"research\\" vacation(oops, I mean sabbatical) to ITALY, INDIA and an island paradise! And she's whining, crying, pontificating about the meaning of her life, complaining... I mean it really was a struggle for me to get to the end. Oh, and my goodness, the end....the \\"point\\" of the book, the climax, oh I won't ruin it for you. I admit it, perhaps I am being \\"age-ist\\" here--- had the author been a 55 year old divorcee, perhaps a survivor of an illness or catastrophe, maybe I could have bought it.... but no, this was too much \\"Carrie Bradshaw goes Under the Tuscan Sun\\" for me... I'll take Frances Mayes anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny, self-indulgent and dull","review":"Being absurdly coy about the reasons surrounding her spectacular divorce flameout, Gilbert makes it impossible for the reader to empathize or sympathize with her desperate need for self-discovery. Mostly, she just sounds like every woman who's been through a bad time and obsesses about a guy. And yes, it can be bad but hardly worth a book. Worse, however, is her insistence in romanticizing the non-Western Other--Indians and Balinese are reduced to stereotyped portals to her self-awakening. In the end, she may have achieved perceived enlightenment but she certainly seems just as blinkered as she was when she started."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Better Name for This Book: \\"Trite, Self-Serving, Psychobabble\\"","review":"Sigh. It was brutal getting through this book. Never before have I been so disappointed by a book that so many of my female friends have raved about. This simplistic plot revolves around the narcissistic, yet supposedly \\"buddhist-cleansed\\" ego of Liz Gilbert. At one point she \\"becomes one with God\\". Need I say more? Lame. She throws in cheaps shots against everything from Republicans to Vipassana meditation under the guise of her smug, know-it-all attitude. I didn't need to hear why her first marriage failed; the more I got to know this annoyingly \\"deep\\" person, it was too obvious.Bottom line: I would rather sit down and read \\"Buddhism for Dummies\\" 100 times than have to try to get thru my copy of Eat, Pray, Love again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat,Pray,Love - a good book to read more than once","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I'm not a reader of novels, per se, but I found it to be very entertaining, funny and also reflective and deep. I picked it up from the library and then had to buy my own copy. I'm now reading it again and underlining things that touched me personally. It made me laugh and also brought me to tears. It's a travel book and so much more. It's a journey of self-discovery, romance, dedication and love. The way the author was very discriptive of the landscapes of each country, emotion and people. I do most of my traveling in books and this was a very educational and informative trip. I felt I could taste the food in Italy; the coolness of the spirit-filled Ashram with the chantings of the mantras, and the romantic surroundings of Bali. This is one of those books whose movie I then had to rent and I enjoyed it very much also. The soundtrack isn't bad either with Eddie Vedder singing The Long Road. Yeah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with lots of meaning","review":"I LOVED this book. I will admit that it was really slow getting starting and getting into good parts. I mean, it seemed like it took months to get to the meat but when it did, I was not disappointed. There were so many lines and little tidbits of knowledge about self, spirituality and embracing life that I learned. I found myself highlighting certain lines throughout the book. The biggest lesson I learned took away at the end was to embrace life; even if it makes you or other uncomfortable. Sometimes we have to be uncomfortable to learn to appreciate comfortable. That goes for all aspects of your life. When I finally saw the movie, I felt the passion of the book. There were some scenes cut out of it due to the length but it was totally worth it. REad the book and then see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED EAT, PRAY, LOVE","review":"I felt like I traveled along this wonderful journey with Gilbert as I read this book. Not since, Michelle Kane's CONFESSIONS OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL have I felt such a spiritual awakening in my own life.Confessions of a Catholic Schoolgirl"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best by far","review":"BRAVO on a job well done. One of the most fantastic women's novels I've read in awhile - honest, inspiring, refreshing, and HILARIOUS. I hope they don't alter her journey by making it into a movie. It is perfect just the way it is. I recommended this book to several girlfriends who couldn't stop talking about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't like it...","review":"I may have missed it, since there are so many reviews, but has anyone said this book was just not well written? I read non-fiction as I would fiction - I want good writing to go with a good story. This is neither. I know she's telling her own story, blemishes and all, but, my god, she is annoying. Her insights are shallow (cleansing the stones at the ashram is like cleansing her heart? I read that three times to find the punchline), her style of writing is too slick (someone mentioned \\"Sex and the City - good comparison), her humor is self-indulgent. mostly too cute and coy.I have no problem with people exploring other spiritual paths, indulging in food, or exploring their sexuality. And maybe she came to some spiritual understanding of herself. She just didn't express it well. Not a good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"Read the movie review in the WSJ, which basically said to skip the movie, read the book, something about missing the author's talent and too much of Julia Roberts. Eating her way through Italy was fairly fun, although ridiculously gluttonous. India and Indonesia, even her commitment to marry, drove me nuts. This woman was, and probably still is, so into herself, I couldn't believe it. Bored and too self-centered to have kids, she asks for a divorce, and then, suffocates her boyfriend. Hey, Liz, it happens all the time but most of us have had a lot more baggage we've had to deal with, in a lot less time, with a lot less money! We learn very quickly that life is made up of balances. The book's in the dumper, a waste of time. The movie? I'll wait to get it a the grocery store for buck, just to see Roberts and the privilege to Fast Forward, Stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I love to read almost anything, but this book just is not good. I had no idea I would be reading about someone's depression. I too, went through a divorce. But this is just ridiculous. Get over it already. I guess I'm only reviewing the 'eat' section, since I could not get through it to make it to the other sections. I love Julia Roberts so I thought the book might be good. After trying to read it, I don't even want to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgent, whiney, It didn't enlighten me. . .","review":"I felt like this woman was so self indulgent and whiney. Why oh why did she have to tell everyone about her very important boring life? I tried to like this. ..I really did. I just couldn't relate. I kept thinking I'd eventually start liking her as she started travelling or something, but I couldn't. She just kept annoying me and I kept rolling my eyes. Maybe I've seen tragedy and her life just isn't it. Yes, pain is pain, but I wish she had some sense to be more thankful for what she had rather than having to search far and wide. . . .I guess it's memorable because I read it months ago and just the thought of that woman still makes me grit my teeth. However, I know many woman that just loved this book. . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the editor?","review":"I tried to like this book. I wanted to like this book. But I don't. The writing is incredibly unfocused. The author is amazingly self-centered. Yes, it's a memoir, but even for that genre it's worse than most. And it's boring. A trip of a lifetime to Italy (which is as far as I got) could (should) have been captivating. It wasn't. So I'm giving it back - unread - to the person who loaned it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"GLORIFIES NARCISSISM","review":"I thought narcissism like this was widely recognized as a character disorder. I like David Denby's comment in The New Yorker: \\"We may get the impression that the world in its glory exists principally to satisfy her complicated needs.\\" Why is this book so popular? Are the women who like this book as self-centered and self-indulgent as the creepy, self-centered author? This woman and this book are digusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"self absorbed","review":"I may have enjoyed reading this book, but listening to Elizabeth Gilbert drone on about herself was really annoying. I liked the last part best - the part about Bali, because she started talking about other people more and less about herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent summer read!","review":"This is a must have for anyone that needs the story to really engage the reader and forget about thier surroundings. When you read this book you almost feel the emotions that Liz experiences as she goes through starting with her breakdown early in the story all the way through her finding herself and love at the end of the story. I normally would not pick up or be drawn to a book like this one. I'm a reader of mystery and suspense novels. I stumbled upon it when the intructor at my bikram yoga class read a page during our cool down to help us focus and relax. The story just grabed me and I had to run out and buy the book. Gilbert is so decriptive you feel like you are actually in Italy, India and Indonesia. I did not want to put the book down! Definately a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable it's so bad","review":"I have never encountered such an astonishingly self-cenetered creature in print before. I was embarrassed for her and for myself during the entire first chapter that anyone would see her mission in life as cutesy commentary on everything in the universe. She really thinks she has discovered Italy and she is very smug about how she is the only one who can adequately describe it. Egocentric? This person shacked up with her lover and destroyed her marriage and and comes out the victim and has to travel all over the world to reward herself - and on and on and on and on. PLEASE save yourself the money and take my book FOR FREE! Just pay the postage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Needed","review":"After going through some rough breakups and hard times of my own, this book was exactly what I needed to regain my self-confidence and get me back on my feet again. Very thought provoking and entertaining all at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea...","review":"Overall I was disappointed in Eat Pray Love, I had heard so much about it before I read it. I wanted to love it and I tried hard to relate to Elizabeth (the author) but I just didn't. I don't know if my expectations of the book were too high before I started reading it, but I wanted to fall in love with this book and for it to be one of those books that I just could not put down. Instead, I found myself struggling to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stunk!","review":"I couldn't read the entire thing, I just skimmed it. The author was just too annoying and self-absorbed. It was as if she thought we, the reader, would be so enthralled with the inanities of her pampered life that she could afford to write basically a diary of her life.And a boring diary too. Her \\"problems\\" really aren't that problematic. Her solution of traveling the world and taking a huge amount of time off work, to cavort with assorted men, etc., is not realistic for most of us.Her decision to divorce is not explained well; it seems as if she just got sick of her spouse. Selfish, complaining and whining, self-absorbed to the point of narcissism, and supremely confident that the reader will sympathize with her and her mundane writing....I just cannot believe everyone loved this book so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I luckily did not pay for this book and got it through a paperback swap. I thought I would like the book read maybe 100 pages and sent it off to someone else. Most of the descriptions of Italy made it sound like she had never even been there. I seriously am doubting that she actually went to these places and if she did then she changed and embellished a lot. NOT WORTH BUYING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book goes against my beliefs","review":"New age...junkI cannot condone this book. What a selfish woman the author is.Some people think she is a god after they read her book.Ms. Gilbert needs to eat humble pie.Ms. Gilbert needs to pray to the right GodMs. Gilbert needs to love others more than herself"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rom Com Quality Book","review":"I just didn't care for this book. After reading it, I feel just like I've watched one of those solidly mediocre romantic comedies (after seeing about a million glossy promos): I'm disappointed in myself for falling for the hype, & irritated at having spent the time & money.Liz seems fun & funny--I can see why she makes so many friends throughout the course of her story--but I simply was not interested enough in her life or her journey to spend so much time with it, & didn't find her narrative voice compelling. I suspect the book only really resonates with people who can relate to her personal situation, which is too bad, since its premises (heartbreak, eating, connecting with God & others, finding love) hold universal appeal. I'll bet an excellent editor could have brought that out.As it stands, I wouldn't recommend EPL to anyone who is not recovering from divorce and/or deeply interested in eastern religion. Unless they enjoy rom com quality books."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"What else can I say? One of the most boring books I have ever read. Very hard to read through to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me, Myself and I","review":"I really tried to get into this book, but I agree with the 400+ other 1 star ratings that the character is all about herself and woo is me. Let's get the Klennex out and cry some more. The book was depressing, all about herself and didn't really care about anything else. I had no empathy for the dear women even after she listed her various anti-depression drugs. I've been in a depressed state at one point in my left and I certainly didn't leave my family and run off to Italy and the likes! Stay home and deal with it! I didn't find the book have any spirituality value AT ALL. The movie had better find some quality plot or it will be a flop too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth, next time, stay home","review":"The real subtitle should be:One woman is paid extraordinary advance for extraordinary travel drivel!She ate too much, loved herself more than was warranted, and I pray her sister never speaks to her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough, already.","review":"Picked this up after all the hype: \\"AMAZING BOOK, AMAZING WOMAN.\\" Ah, not so much. In fact, not at all. Couldn't finish this self-indulgent drivel. I'm heartened to see that so many reviewers agree with me. Quit your whining. You are a privileged woman who got a divorce. Not too tough to take. Enough, already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This is one of the few books I could not finish. It bored me to tears. I found the author very self-absorb, and irratating. She acts like she is the only person in the world who has every been depressed and experienced heartache. Save your money and time. Read a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely awful.","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I'm sad to say that it was a huge waste of money and this woman should never have had a book deal to begin with. She is whiny and self-centered and I'm sorry that I had to read anything about her shallow life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decided not to read.....","review":"Had thought I would like to read this book, but once I read the premise reconsidered. Realized she wanted neither a child nor her husband...divorced and transformed into a hedonist. GROTESQUE! Spiritual? Baloney. Serve in a soup kitchen. Life isn't all about self. A little less navel gazing, PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but not sustaining...","review":"It was a perfect commute read. Went down easy but didn't sustain. Once I closed the cover, poof, it vanished, the literary equivalent of junk food. I was also perplexed that the author determined in Italy her only (apparently) source of pleasure would be food and that she did not take advantage of all the art, history, culture, architecture and music that are also there to be enjoyed. Often, I found her descriptions of eating and food kind of gluttonous. As a practitioner of yoga myself, I was surprised that she seemed to lean so heavily on her guru for insight and guidance. She mentioned nothing of learning to follow the \\"inner teacher\\" which is what yoga is supposed to help you do. If you come to the book with low or no expectations, you'll probably like it. If you come thinking you (or she) are going to have some earthshaking epiphanies, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought it was a great read and a unique book","review":"Am surprised by the number of negative comments! I really enjoyed this book, and it's very different from other books you'll read. I don't think the author was self-absorbed; I think she was coping with one of those watershed events in life that change everything and deserve some introspection, if you can afford the luxury. Her true appreciation of the different cultures that she's exposed to and appreciation of the people she meets is engaging. She also is obviously a lover of words (not surprising, given that she's a writer) and describes things in an often unique and funny way.I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Give it a read......women often don't take the time to take care of themselves, and it's a lesson to us all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1/3 Good","review":"I know this story is about a woman searching for, well, the meaning of life or really the meaning of her life as she enters a sort of midlife crisis. I really enjoyed the first journey which was through Italy. That part was great and I really wanted to like the rest, however I just never made it that far in enjoyment. I finished the book but I'm just not a fan of this one.Gilbert is a talented writer and this book is written well but just not terribly interesting to read about a person who just eats and travels, has sex and then moves about leaving all responsibilities behind. I wanted something a little deeper. It would have been great if the culture of each location was expanded upon. I'm also not sure why the author felt the need to include her own political opinions in this book. Didn't seem necessary to the story. Silly really."},{"rating":"1","title":"eat pray live in fantasy land","review":"Really can anyone just move around on a whim like this broad? And whose paying for it? I was disappointed in the \\"flow\\" of this book and also how unlike my life it was. I was I guess hoping to be inspired. Instead I'll hope the movie is better,.. but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I was excited to read this book. I loved the movie & thought the book must be twice as good. I found it a little boring. I even tried to listen on cd, as I do with many books, but Liz's voice is too soothing. If I sat down to listen I would fall asleep. I don't think the book is awful, just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, but WAY overrated","review":"Pros: At times Gilbert writes in an interesting and funny way making SMALL PARTS of this book entertaining to read.Cons: The rest of the book (a majority of it) is painful to read. The book is more of a pity party for Gilbert's failed marriage than it is a deep look into these amazing cultures.It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but I would recommend spending your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, pray, love. Get real....","review":"The author knew how to eat. Well, she had been paid for it in advance. She prayed. But she couldn't define to whom. And she got paid for it in advance. She loved? Well she certainly loved herself. And she got paid for it in advance. How about a donation from Ms. Gilbert to the humanities to study how a book of such caliber could reach the audience that it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I agree with all the other reviews about this book being very disappointing. I couldn't wait to hear about her experience of self-discovery and independence, and I felt like it never came. Granted, I didn't make it half way through the book, but that should tell you something. The writing wasn't that eloquent and it was frankly, boring. It's tempting to read because of all the great reviews it got, but trust me, skip it, or at least get it from the library. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat Pray Love by Elizabeth Gilbert","review":"Books that help transform me to be a better human being are not usually on the best seller's list but Elizabeth Gilbert writes in such a delightful way and uses words and phrases that made me think. She spoke with honesty which was often shocking, but showed 'guts'. Often was a laugh-out-loud book with much humor along with Wisdom. She is a real free spirit which will cause you to sin - the sin of envy, jealousy and the list goes on. Highly recommended - not only for women. I will be watching for next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"This is the first and last book that Oprah raves about that I'll ever read. YUCK what a bore. Gave up on it half way through, then gave it to good will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book by self-absorbed although talented author","review":"I'm glad I borrowed this book from the library. I decided to give it a try because I'd heard so many good reviews, because I'm an avid reader and I love to travel, too. I only made it through the first several chapters of the book before I had to return it to the library for another patron, and I won't bother requesting it again. It's not worth the wait.The author's writing style, I will admit, is engaging. However, her whiny tone, self-absorbed outlook on life and overall interpretation of her experiences is vain and unbecoming. I read her words and think, \\"If I met her in person, she'd probably be someone I'd try to stay away from!\\" She seems to have a \\"poor me\\" attitude that, although it likely improves over the course of the book, was far too heavy at the beginning for me to consider pursuing the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"so what already?","review":"\\"beautifully written\\" is not a phrase I would use to describe this book. although this book is about the author's \\"journey\\", the constant introspection gets tedious and the word \\"I\\" becomes a cancerous tumor that begs to be removed from the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty annoying but slightly informative","review":"I really expected to like this book based upon all of the stellar reviews it got. May be it is my personality not matching up with hers, but I found myself incessantly irritated by the author's narcissism and sappiness. I am all for introspection and self-exploration. I have once or twice or, okay, a gazillion times, fallen prey to the itchy feet syndrome when confronted with a life crisis. I keep wondering why so many people liked this book, and it kind of reminds me of a Fried Green Tomatoes kind of thing, or maybe a Thelma and Louise thing... kind of a \\"you go girl\\" mentality. I found a lot of the information very interesting, especially regarding yoga and meditation, and it did make me think about my own spiritual life, but I couldn't help but think that maybe she was writing this book with her ex-husband and ex-lover David as an audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Pray, Love","review":"Reviewed by my wife ---- Very easy reading and fun stories. Feel the author's pain, then laugh out loud as you read how she copes with it and gets through everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Classic","review":"Elizabeth Gilbert bares her soul in this moving memoir. I found her search for personal truth relatable even though it took her far from anywhere I've ever been in the world. Her story made me laugh out loud, cry and think about my own life in ways that I had not thought before. Ms. Gilbert's way of moving between the serious and the hilarious made tough subjects easier to handle and made her book an extremely enjoyable read. I recommend this book to anyone, but particularly to people searching for themselves because I think they will find this memoir to be a great help and inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally! Hope for the upper-middle class!","review":"At long last someone has written a book to help other miserable, upper-middle class white people transcend their sad, sad, lives! Gah. I can recall a far better book. It's called \\"Siddartha.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely idiotic","review":"I loved the concept, but hated this writer's voice and her insistance in interjecting her political beliefs into almost every chapter...for example, her sister's biggest fear about being pregnant was not that her baby would be born unhealthy, but that he/she would turn out to be a Republican! How incredibly witty! NOT! The book lacked any real insight about what the people are really like in the countries she visited, just a bunch of bull about how much weight she gained, how she couldn't meditate, blah blah blah, stupid, boring, waste of money. Threw it in the trash half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's simply confused.","review":"I found some pretty interesting facts throughout the book, but I'd rather read them out of an encyclopedia than go crazy reading the adventures of a woman who is clearly confused about who she is, and especially what she believes in. It seems as if she is so desperate to get better that she experiments with so many beliefs. Ghandi embraced different religions, yet his mission was world peace. Liz Gilbert, on the other hand, is a tangled net of new age spiritualism, eastern religions, and Christianity, who doesn't understand any of them. Her book may be a testimony to the difficulties we all experience with our identity, but I would recommend you do not waste your time reading about a woman who never finds hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartwheels for the self-indulgent.","review":"When a little girl learns to do cartwheels, she tells and shows anyone and everyone, all the time saying, \\"Look at me! Look at me!\\" My current perspective of the author in this book is an adult showing off her cartwheels all the while saying, \\"Look at me! Look at me!\\" She tells everyone (in great detail) the who what when where & why of her cartwheels, including each time she tried and failed. Perhaps her voyage of indulging every whim will help others, but I don't think reading is how most learn to do cartwheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"like so many others, very dissappointed","review":"Not only did I find her whiney and self-absorbed, but also didn't see her as a really great writer. I almost quite half way but I hate not to finish, so I slugged through it all. There were a few interesting times in the book, but they are few and far between. Just find someone who read it and ask them to recap their favorite paragraph and you're done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Liberal Bush Basher","review":"When I opened this book, I identified immediately and felt comforted. Then she got into the Bush bashing and it ruined the whole thing for me. I didn't finish the book and I felt really bad about it. I can only say -\\"shut up and write.\\" I'm not interested in your political opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Recommend It","review":"I read the first \\"section\\" of the book and it was just okay. Maybe because I've been to Italy and knew the places she spoke of, etc. The second section bored me and I didn't even bother to finish the book. It constantly felt like Gilbert was bragging, blah blah blah I left my husband but it's okay b/c I have wealthy publishers to finance a trip around the world for me, and so on. I can't connect with that. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A narcist's rant","review":"I read this book for the sole reason that it had been on the best seller list for a long time.The good thing about this book is that it shows how the author saw herself through the bad times and was able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm sure a lot of people can relate to it and learn something from it.However, it was unbearable to see everything in the book being about herself and nothing else. Her every interaction with people has a sole purpose. Herself.She talked about a girl she befriended in the ashram in India. She says that the girl wore spectacles that had broken lens but that didnt keep her from wearing it.. For some reason I got stuck on that line.Even when she supposedly falls in love, it is all about how he treats her/compliments her and such.Also, It wasn't very convincing to see someone change from one mode to another seamlessly (Eat pray love) and become oblivious of the previous mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"I am so happy to see that other people had the same reaction to this book that I had. I, too, had to quit before getting too far and I NEVER do that! But the author is unbearably self-absorbed. Thanks to other reviewers for their honesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure awfulness, worse than a bad rash","review":"I hated this book after the author while sobbing in her bathroom yet again, announces that she knows she should think about having a child but when she gets her period is relieved that she gets to live, yes these are her words, live yet another month. Please for the sake of soicety don't EVER have children! This book made me mad to read, the author is a disgrace to women with her endless self absorbtion, whiny narrative and ugly disregard for the cultures she polluted by visiting looking for guess what? Herself. This book isn't worth the paper it was printed on and like others, I only read it because it is was a book club selection. Godawful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the Book","review":"I loved the first section about Italy but during the \\"pray\\" section I found I kept looking to see how many more pages until I finish the section needless to say it gets a little boring.

And the inclusion of gustatory references gave it an additional dimension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I thought this was a really great read I don't think everyone realizes that this is based on one womans journey so it's not meant to be a definitive guide to your own journey but it definitely does inspire the reader. After reading this book it makes me want to start my own journey of self discovery, not that I want to travel to India and visit an ashram but still being able to experience these countries through the writer is inspirational and insightful. I thought this was a really great book and watched the movie the day after I finished it. I, of course, thought the book was better because there was just so much more detail and personal emotion. I would definitely suggest this book to other people, it's a great story and for me it sparked something inside me that has always wanted to start some kind of spiritual journey of self discovery to come alive again and say so why not now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"eat, pray, love","review":"Loved the book, and I am not an avid reader, but I felt like I was on the journey with the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a woman!","review":"I loved this book - since I am a grandmother many times over, all I can say is WOW, I never would have been able to take the steps this woman did to \\"find\\" herself - but it was great to read about someone who did. Gilbert is a very talented writer who really got me totally wrapped up in this emotional book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Real, and Hard to Put Down.","review":"This was one of the most engaging books I've ever read.Hard to write about it but if you're interested in anyor all of the three subjects; eating, praying, and love,you won't be disappointed. I was sorry to finish it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful book","review":"I thought this book would be good because it was made into a movie. That is not the case.

I didn't even bother with the sequel to it. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"When you encounter the f-bomb in the first few chapters it's really not worth reading further, any author who isn't creative or tactful enough to avoid crude and vulgar language is not an author worth spending a portion of your life on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"With so much fanfare surrounding this book and as someone who has traveled (as a woman solo) to Australia, Bali, Thailand, Japan etc. it was so lacking to the point of nausea. And, to add insult to literary injury, the writing style was so elementary that it actually detracted from the already mediocre storyline. Maybe a better writer could have done the story more justice??? Maybe!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Penguin is the worst publisher around","review":"The Kindle book costs $13 and the paperback costs $8.25.

I read it for 20 minutes, skimmed through the whole book for another 10 and thought - that was a waste of 30 minutes and I will waste no more than that! I was embarrassed for the writer as well as for all the people who have wasted their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This started out so promising, then became weighed down with self absorbing drivel.

The first section was pretty interesting but I actually stopped reading once I was into the 2nd part. Maybe one day I'll go back and finish it but I'm choosing to wait for the movie. Not sure if you have to be really spiritual to enjoy it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore, Snore, Snore","review":"I cannot understand why people like this boooooooring book. I painfully made it through Italy and started India...that's when I couldn't take it anymore and felt that stapling my hand to the wall would be far more interesting than continuing with this woman who never stops talking about the damn bathroom floor...save yourself and save your money! I hope I can get a few bucks for it at the used bookstore especially since I only read a portion. Seriously this woman quit her marriage for some reason that she won't share....umm ok isn't that part of what sent her out on this journey that resulted in an overly hyped up, waste of paper, diary of a cry baby? She roamed around Italy eating and talking a bunch of nonsense meanwhile not having to worry about money thanks to her book advance. What idiot publisher did that! I agree with many of the other reviews.....she is a spoiled lame. I will not even bother seeing the movie ugg!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Catchy title, but what a crapfest...err...huge disappointment. The author is selfish and shallow. Did I mention shallow? This woman feels sorry for herself. Her solution is to take trips around the world and meet with spiritual gurus? Gaaack! I read that she got an advance on the book prior to all the trips. I do not know if that is true. But I tend to believe it.There is nothing Christian about this book. I usually pass my books on to other people. Not this one. It's going in the trash. If you absolutley must read it, check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is \\"spiritual\\" about this book?","review":"I agree with the reviewers who said that Gilbert's writing is \\"dishonest\\" - it's as if she deliberately dumbed down her experiences in order to make Oprah's book list and to sell a lot of copies of this marginally written shallow book.Even her experience in Italy is sort of depressing. THAT is hedonistic pleasure and re-awakening? Her life before her journey appears to be identical to her life during the jouurney- being paid to travel and write about it in a way that appeals to the masses - essentially saying nothing at all. And how are any of her actions or beliefs spiritual? She is more self-obsessed than a teenager and I was sad and embarrased for her.I should have been scared off when I saw it was a best-seller. It's not entirely awful because it's amusing in places but ultimately not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about herself","review":"Eat, Pray, Love -- lots of great material there, you would think. But this book is all about Gilbert and her not very original life crisis. A great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting in Touch","review":"I picked up Eat, Pray and Love several times in the bookshops since it was published in 2006. I put it down. Several friends asked me: have you read the book? I hadn't. Finally, at the bookshop a few weeks ago a friend asked, you haven't read it? Let me get it for you. OK, I said. I finished reading it a few days ago. It reminded me Sarah McDonald's Holy Cow. Written in a breezy style, I felt it lacked depth. However, I was empathetic with the Gilbert's need to do what she as doing and needed to heal. The strengh of the book is that Gilbert does carry out her dreams and helps herself. Many women I know have this need, but not the courage to cary it out. For those I think the books is inspirational. It talks of following your heart and geting in touch wiht your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've got to read this book!","review":"From a fellow author, I highly recommend reading this book.

Very Enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a reality check...","review":"This book is highly frustrating. I can't decide if it's because I'm jealous of her ability to pick up so hastily and take off traveling for a year to experience pleasure... (while I'm \\"trapped\\" in my conformist life of having a hubby, job, and 2 kids) or if it's because what she is looking for is not being found abroad, but rather within (I don't think she realizes that). How nice to experience such pleasure, devotion, and self-absorbed meditation for a whole year! There is no balance in her life at ALL, contrary to what she states. Wouldn't we all be better off dumping our husbands and experiencing pure hedonistic experiences whilst the rest of the world is busy living? And then writing about how nice is is to \\"find\\" herself among beautiful people and good food? Ugh. How can I learn any valuable lessons from this. Very unrealistic. Show me someone who finds themselves while using the tools of reality. Then we'll talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"i found this book to be way overrated and the author egotistical. would've been nice to read more about the cultures she encountered and less about her. about half way through the book i wanted to tell her to get over herself already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Futile, boring, and pointless...","review":"I see absolutely no value in this book. I was extremely excited to begin reading this book and now I'm extremely disappointed that this is actually a best seller. I believe this book has no point and I simply do not care for the character at all. She is like a girlfriend who complains and cries about everything and she simply won't stop her self loathing. Her whining and obsessive need to express detail is enough to put me right to sleep at the end of the day. Therefore, I take back my sentiment that this book is futile because it does accomplish one thing for me--sleep! My recommendation is this: do not to waste your money, time, and intelligence on this poor excuse for a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUVTHE BOOK","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed Liz Gilbert's account of her travels and her self exploration thru these three very different countries.

The author has a nice way /writing style and the book was very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Sympathy","review":"The author got bored to hell about life suddenly in the 30's even after having a good income, education , excellent country, friends, husband etc. And she starts enjoying the world with our money (Publisher's money doesn't fall from sky), learns new language, gets fresh friendship and sex with a man in 50's(who knows how many women he's cheated in life), all under the banner called LOVE. Women, in general, if they follow the author, are surely bound for a failure in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This What Passes for Spirituality?","review":"Just because someone practices gluttony for a year, chants in a ashram and screws around in Bali doesn't mean they had a spiritual experience. This is pathetic and one of the most self-absorbed ramblings in recorded history. Does the world really need a field guide for selfishness? Can't they just watch a few minutes of Joel Osteen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Morally embarrasing","review":"A spiritual journey paid for by a publisher? Need I say more?

We picked this book based on publishers' reviews. We cannot comprehend how it got such great reviews. With the exception of one group member, all of us thought the book was shallow, contrived and irritating. We did not find the author likable. None of us would ever want to take a trip with her because of her endless chatter. She did not illicit sympathy from the group, we think because she just wasn't real. She skidded on the surface with little depth of feelings. Her story might have been more believable if we hadn't known about her $200,000 advance to write the book. It seems the money was her real motivation, and not to honestly share her journey. We gave it 14 thumbs down, 1 thumb up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bull....","review":"I wonder exactly what the time of prayer taught this woman as she immediately came out of her \\"prayer\\" to resume a completely average (of meat and men) life where she basically promotes her book on TV, what a crock"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you want to share with all your friends","review":"This is a book I almost didn't read.

She learns a great deal about herself, and is very honest in recording it. I really wish this book had been available earlier - it is most inspiring. A deserved bestseller.

I am very happy that I borrowed it from the public library. Ms. Gilbert came across as an immature woman who could never fully comprehend the overall ramifications of her personal actions. I quit reading this book after page 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is she trying to fool?","review":"I recognized the ashram very quickly. Who does the author think she is fooling? Here are the clues: the ashram in the U.S. is in the Catskill Mountains. The founder dies in 1982. His successor is an attractive female. The ashram in India is near Mumbai. Before you can attend that ashram, you have to study for two years and apply. So you want to know my \\"guess\\"? The founder is Muktananda. The female guru is Gurumayi. I suggest you google their names and Siddha Yoga. Be sure and read the article from The New Yorker by Lis Harris dated November 14, 1994, \\"O Guru, Guru, Guru\\". Also, read Daniel Shaw's article \\"Traumatic Abuse in Cults: A Psychoanalytic Perspective\\". Notice that the reviews with a one star of Eat, Pray, Love and Daniel Shaw's article refer to \\"narcissism\\".

Is there a minus column in the stars rating?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great anticipation- BUT self-absorbed all about me book","review":"I eagerly anticipated reading this book since I am devoted to yoga and would love to visit India one day. Unfortunately this book is a story of a woman and it's all about me, me and more me! I suppose my purchase was based on what I had hoped the book was about -the joys of travel and new experiences, not a self-absorbed rendition constantly forcing the reader to hear more about her divorce. Give me more India and travel extravaganzas and less personal woes and me me me!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just canning it so Amazon will stop recommending this to me","review":"I've read a few reviews and thus I have no interest in reading the book or watching the movie. This is divorce porn that panders to women thinking they are going to do better by deserting their family and shirking their responsibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for those who seek self exploration, travel, spirituality and adventure","review":"I have not seen the movie and just finished reading the book and overall I loved it. While some of the criticism below are valid, I was not affronted so much by the self indulgent author. As I am already open to the idea of self exploration, travel, spirituality and adventure, this memoir delivered big for me. The author strikes a chord with many of us because what a treat it must be to leave stress behind to find inner peace and/or love in exotic places. I finished reading Eat, Pray, Love and now I feel uplifted. I enjoyed reading the memoir and would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Search for Happiness Found in Obstacles","review":"I was surprised at the many negative reviews of this book. To me, this book was a home run and presented a glimpse into what changes us. Yes,Elizabeth Gilbert may seem narcissistic and sometimes callous, but that probably is who the author really is (or was). What is surprising about this book is the humor and depth of introspection. I imagine some of this was very difficult to write. Most autobiographies tend to be self absorbent!This autobiography of \\"finding one's self\\" is just so hilarious and full of irony. Time after time, Elizabeth found that the answers to her problems of unhappiness lay in overcoming what she thought were obstacles and in embracing life's crap rather than trying to divorce one's self of the unpleasant parts.Although many may consider this a \\"chick\\" book, I would have been proud to write it as a man. It is full of truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great example to follow!","review":"Her unhappy marriage came to head when she knew she didn't want to follow the \\"script\\" which is imposed on us so much as women: the script that says we need to be wives and mothers. It's a brave thing to admit that you do not want this! The drain of her divorce coupled with her painful split from David is something a lot of women can relate to; who hasn't been through the heartache of a breakup: rollercoaster moods, the phases of anger,the sadness, guilt, fear and lonliness? I found I could relate to her in a lot of ways, but unlike her I do not have the opportunity to travel, so it was fun to travel vicariously through her. Her anecdotes about the people she meets are very amusing, and what better way to feed the body, mind and spirit than the way she has? Hers is a great example to follow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"eat, pray, love: one woman's amazing journey to finding herself!","review":"Liz Gilbert opens up her mind & her soul to share with readers her personal journey almost as a rebirth! You'll cry and laugh and absolutely LOVE this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Exploration Of A Broken Heart","review":"When I started reading this book I found myself completely bogged down in India. Being a Christian this portion of her spiritual journey eluded me. After mentioning my boredom to a few readers I decided to return to the book with an open mind and I truly enjoyed it. Her journey to heal after a difficult divorce touched me. Many would love the opportunity to travel while healing from the brokeness of divorce. Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style is truly wonderful. I enjoyed her spirit while meeting people and making just about everyone her friend. I agreed with her aversion to marriage and questioned marriage. I purchased Committed shortly after completing Eat, Pray, Love since my curiousity about how she made peace with marriage was nagging. I find her to be intellectually stimulating. Gilbert makes profound, but realistic comments throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grass Is Always Greener Somewhere Else","review":"I don't understand this lady. Why did it take her so long to discover the fact she didn't want to have a child or to be married? And why did she stay in New York three more years before deciding to travel to Italy, India, and Indonesia? Why not Paraguay, Siberia, or Lithuania? Personally, I would have stayed in New York. This has to be one of the dumbest books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend, interesting read","review":"As a woman who went through a difficult and emotionally draining divorce myself, I can relate to the author's desire to make a change in her life, yet at the same time not knowing exactly what she is searching for. A divorce or any other traumatic life event, while turning your life upside down, can also be a catalyst for exciting new changes and self discovery. This book is a great read for women, especially if you are on your own spiritual journey after a major change in your life. If you cannot, like most of us, afford to travel the world on a spiritual quest, you can enjoy this book and lose yourself in the author's story.Christina Roweauthor ofSeven Secrets to a Successful Divorce"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just wanted to tell her to grow up","review":"I read this book because my wife wanted me to. I hated it. There was plenty of good writing, but every time Ms. Gilbert fell into a weepy pile of self-pity on the floor I wanted to scream. Everybody has problems. A friend of my daughter's was diagnosed with brain cancer two years after finishing college. Now there's somebody with a serious problem, but she hasn't let it stop her from getting married and going on with her life. I can't even begin to understand the appeal of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter stupidity","review":"I thoroughly agree with C. Quinn's review.

This woman's retelling of her \\"spiritual\\" experiences and everything else is nothing but childish and narcissistic. She likes to conform GOD to a box, not realizing that GOD is bigger than she is and that HIS thoughts are higher that hers.I can't believe that people love this book. It's absoluteness worthless. Once she comes off this honeymoon she's in with her gross narcissism she's going to be back at square one realizing she didn't find anything at all and that she has lead thousands if not millions astray with her book.You want to find God?

This reminds me of all the women who are always looking for something more, never appreciating what is right in front of them. I am sure this Author (if you can actually call her that), will go on to have a very rich (in Money) life, but very poor life, in everything else that matters.The best thing i can say about this book is, I can ask people if they like it and then take them off my sharing a book list, and write them down as Vapid, self absorbed people, who can't wait to leave their families, etc....Don't bother..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than One Star...","review":"Possibly the most selfish, conceited, boring woman alive.

After mentioning she was not going to talk about her acrimonious divorce, she continually brings it up time after time. How pathetic that this book has good reviews when it is clearly a tale of self-indulgent whining and moaning about her lot in life. It is disheartening that this book has achieved good reviews when it is clearly a prime example of our generation of women in our society who could make a difference, but prefer to be extremely self-absorbed and focused on material goods, prestige and the \\"me-me-me\\" syndrome.
