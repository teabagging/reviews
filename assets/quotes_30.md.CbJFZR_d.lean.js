These go in the dishwasher and she has a fresh straw for her beverages. My goal is to keep her drinking at least 3 glasses of water daily. These straws make it fun. Plus, I love them for my ice-tea.

Unfortunately, the majority of it I found to be self-indulgent, preachy, amateurish pap. Insipid pabulum. Passage after passage sure to make you wince if not heave. Okay, maybe that's a little harsh and to be fair there was _some_ good info on the history of the trail, but the ratio is something like 80% crap to 20% good stuff. Not worth it. Doesn't have the humor of Bill Bryson or the maturity and authority of John McPhee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Journey North: One Woman's Series of Constant Complaints","review":"I read this book because of my own appreciation for hiking. I was hoping that it would give me a window to thru-hiking. Unfortunately, A Journey North is hardly the story of the author's hike of the Appalachian Trail. It is more of a collection of unrelated stories, endless complaints, and one-sided, oversimplified lectures on environmental issues. Readers searching for accounts of life on the trail will find this book lacking. In addition, Hall seems to dwell on her negative experiences while breezing over the positive ones she includes.While this book covers the subjects of the AT, the environment, and some women's issues, I would recommend that anyone interested in any of these look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Woman's Hike","review":"Having been a hiker (even though I have Cerebral Palsy) I enjoy reading about the AT. Being a woman I look forward to stories of hiking from other women hikers. I've read over 22 books on the AT. This one rarely covers the topic at hand. She wanders from Indian stories (aren't we all related to Cherokees? I HATE that) to the plight of every topic of society that constitutes over 40% of the book. The AT part is sparse, her struggles (while expected) mostly has to do with her own ignorance: don't hike with a three season sleeping bag! A floorless TP (please!) and expect to share sleeping with Boy and Girl Scout's because it is expected to do so. Of all the books to read on the AT that truly captures hiking experience--this isn't one. I found myself skipping more and more pages as the book went on to try to \\"find\\" the real story: her hike. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story about hiking the trail?","review":"I chose this book thinking that I would be reading the story of the author's hike through the Appalachian Trail. Instead, she would write a few paragraphs about her experience, then go off on a completely different subject, opining her liberal views on the national park system, reintroduction of wildlife, Indian mythology, blah, blah, blah. After the first 100 pages, I started skipping pages at a time just to get back to what I assumed was the point of her story--the trail hike. She and her boyfriend seemed quite likable--but you never got a real feel of how this affected them. Even the epilogue was vague. Where is she living? What is her occupation? Did they ever marry? Yeah, they ate granola then junk food, but how did this affect the rest of her life (as she continued to claim that it would)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a honest and interesting read!","review":"I have read many books on the Appalchian trail, and this one felt so honest to me. I picked it up at a local library before I left for a vacation at a rustic cabin in the woods of Maine. Quickly, my yearly camping experience in Maine no longer felt nearly so rustic. Ms. Hall does not romanticize life on the trail, she gives the reader insight into the loneliness and pain. I also enjoyed her strong environmental voice. I would have liked a little more discussion on the social interaction with other thru hikers, but that is the only area I found lacking. I would recommend this book for anyone who would like to read from a woman's voice on the trail. Adrienne Hall is an author I would like to read more of. Did she tie the knot with Craig?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I bought this book because I expected a strong female voice about thru hiking. Adrienne whines through most of the trip, always complaining about something. Before I hiked on the Appalachian Trail, I read most everything that I could find about the subject. Thankfully this book was not available at that time, because reading her accounts may have encouraged me not to proceed with the hike. I would suggest the Bryson book (A Walk in the Woods), it brings humor to the subject and maybe Adrienne would have had a better time with a little sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this ...?","review":"I have put up with many games long enough to beat them. I put up with Pikmin for god's sake. This game starts out great. You get to create your character from a choice of many sweet looking aliens.

Knock some sense into them by eliminating a few of their friends. But this didn't work. This game is so bad, I only played an hour, in which all I did was create characters. pPretty pathetic, yes? I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly Disappointing","review":"I was so excited when I read that a sequel to Master of Orion II was being developed, but I am truly astonished at how bad this game is. MOO 2 was burdened by cartoonish graphics and limited diplomatic options in dealing with other players. What it has been replaced with is primitive graphics, a buggy interface, and a nearly incomprehensible game which is just downright mind numbing. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME until it lands on the bargain table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy! Stay away!","review":"What a complete waste of time and money. Even with the patch applied, this game is terrible. It's boring, the AI stinks, the graphics are terrible, and the fun parts of the game have been abstracted (particularly the space combat) while the boring parts of the game, including economic management, have been expanded on. It makes no sense. It's as though they were intentionally trying to make the game boring and dull. If I was on the design team for this game, I'd be ashamed.One and a half stars. That speaks for itself. Do not buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah Baby!","review":"Ok, I haven't played the game. I mean i played Moo I and Moo II, just yesterday in fact, and I have followed the developemnt of this game somewhat religiously (alright, I didn't check the Designer's Notes every Sunday, but for <insert deity name>'s sake, they didn't really change all that often until November... when the game was supposed to be released. The delay was disappointing, but if it adds to gameplay, I'd rather they take their time than rush to market to make it here \\"for Christmas.\\"Let's say this... if this game is anything like the two prequels it will rock... and if half of the stuff in the Designer's Notes makes it into the gold press, it will be bad ....

I have been hearing about this game for I don't know how long, and it makes me somewhat angry. Now, I did give this game five stars, mainly because it makes you want to read this review when coupled with the title.

If (like me) you've invested in a high end graphics card (nvidia GeForce) and a high resolution LCD monitor (1280x1024) you're likely to be appalled at the game's graphics. Various user mods have attempted to improve the situation with more detailed ship models and more readable fonts. If you have a CRT and loved the earlier games then it may be worth a try, but on an LCD you'll either have a tiny rectangle in the middle of the screen or a headache inducing blur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master of Orion 3 (or why, oh why, did I waste my money?)","review":"I enjoyed Master of Orion and Master of Orion 2. My dislike of MOO 3 is equalled only by my dislike for prune pudding served on ultra bran wafers and topped with an alphalfa derivative syrup. The interface is extremely poor, the graphics were dated when MOO II was new and the enjoyment level doesn't even register. Bottom line don't buy this game.

I have to admit that this book was SO bad that I quit half way through. The review \\"Love & Divorce in England\\" equated Trollope to Maeve Binchy and Rosamunde Pilcher. PLEASE... they develop characters, and whether or not you like them or not, you at least understand where they are coming from. The characters in this novel are like paper dolls. Guy leaves his wife for what? A girl who is completely self absorbed? She treats her mother like trash for disliking the fact that she's having an affair with a married man? Somehow I've missed something. What did the wife do? And the daughter-in-law, the most developed character... she cheers the cheaters on. Then she treats the mother-in-law like a piece of garbage, as do her children. What a screwed up bunch!

Unfortunetly, I was disappointed in this one. Quite honestly, I didn't quite \\"get\\" the choice made in the end. It made the Judge appear weak. So the ending spoiled my ultimate enjoyment of the book...rather than a strong ending, this one felt as if it just trailed off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the Mistress, hate Carrie even more!","review":"I actually found myself hating Carrie, although she was clearly supposed to have all the readers sympathy. Guy is 62 and his mistress (who is also self obsessed and self righteous, just like Carrie) is 31. Guys two sons are both around 40. But we are told to believe that all this is the fault of 'evil' mother Laura. Not a believable story, both Guy and his mistress are a joke, and it is by making Laura ridiculous that the author tries to portray them as the wronged ones. No it does not wash, Laura has all my sympathy. Carrie is Guys son Simons' wife. Leave her Simon, leave her......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family disfunction at it's best","review":"I thought this was a good story.

I would definitely read more Trollope."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Artistic Anatomy of Trees","review":"I rated this a 2 only because it is not what I expected, I'm really not qualified to rate it's accuracy.

Everything from the shape of branches in a windswept oak to the way the leaves and flowers are structured is covered for flowering leaf trees. Conifers are not covered. The composition of groups of trees as well as examples from artwork are here.

I was struck by the powerful emotions of this book and I looked forward to others equally as powerful. But I have discovered that there can be too much emotion -- that there is a danger of drowning in it. And that's what I felt like here. I felt manipulated by all this angst, and I found myself skipping over parts trying to come up for air. There is a certain truth to the dictum \\"less is more.\\" Less would definitely have been more in this case. I don't think I'll be trying another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fly Away Home","review":"I have now read several of Kimberly Cates books and see a maturity in her writing as time goes on. I am a horse breeder/trainer and she met my high and skeptical expectations with excellent equine knowledge and understanding of the importance of how very much hurting chiildren and hurting horses share many similar traits including the deep terror of trusting again and yet the even deeper desire to do so when offered that opportunity.I enjoyed the emotional drama others seem to dislike. We deal with damaged relationships and the process of healing and it is not a shallow nor quick fix so perhaps I bought into this and Ms. Cates other books more easily than others might.I give this book two thumbs up and look forward to reading many more of this authors books. I understand that there will be a few that won't sweep me away as the first three have but I feel confident I will find more golden moments with them then sour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly Away From This Book","review":"This is the only book I've read by Kimberly Cates and it will be the last. I was disappointed in the lack of horse content andthe barrage of emotional analysis that was unending. It seemed to me that Ms. Cates had no faith in my ability to make inferences or draw conclusions when it came to the characters.She wrote repetitively and tediously about feelings and motives, yet her descriptions of the Irish countryside and other scenes were very weak. I've been to Ireland to ride horses and it really is quite magical. This book isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Visual of Both Ancient and Modern Symbols","review":"A really straightforward approach to understanding symbols that man has devised since the beginning, to include a nice cross-reference between categories of symbols. Many excellent visual examples of both ancient and modern symbols. It is interesting to note how quickly symbols take root in this modern time versus ancient symbols that took centuries to take and evolve. Since I am an herbalist I especially love the sections on symbols of nature, trees, and plants, which lead one to delve much deeper into various cultural origins.

I found myself wondering how it even got published, and whether the auther just thinks her readers are stupid. The dialogue is ridiculous and annoying, the characters and situations are inconsistent. The ending wraps up way to easily and quickly. I can suspend my belief to get behind reading minds, but what I can't get behind is an author that doesn't even research the details of her book. The security system stuff was confusing and ridiculous. I finished it only because I cannot put a book down with out finishing it.

But what's wrong with nostalgia? This LP is every bit as influential as early Eric B. & Rakim material. Guru was more topical than most, inspiring everyone from Nas, to Biggie to Big L. DJ Premier's stripped down beats, and vocal samples as hooks, made the Boom-Bap sound of mid-nineties NY hip-hop what it turned out to be. That said, this one is strictly for hip-hop junkies. The Gang Starr-uninitiated might want to listen to Moment of Truth first: a less important historically but highly revered, and more accessible album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely important reference work.","review":"In this mammoth work (which is regularly updated), Melton has provided clear and unbiased descriptions of virtually every religious body of any size operating in the United States today.Every religious body is identified by the \\"family\\" into which it fits (or from which it came) eg.

That is why they need to be bred. On a certain day each year they are released, and Miko and her older brother Toshio witness such a summer night's release. Young Miko is so enchanted by the fireflies' light that she tries to catch them and take them homein her rice lamp. Of course, this does not bode well for the fireflies, and so on this very special night, Miko experiences the joy of granting freedom when releasing what she thought she should keep for herself.This is one of the books you read with a soft and quiet voice.

But even as a neighborhood guide this is a failure.If you are not a New Yorker and are reading this book from afar with an eye towards moving to New York, this will be a waste of money. New York is a complicated, ever changing sea of people and the neighborhood demographics ebb and flow and change almost over night.

I have a few minor quibbles with the introductory material, but that's to be expected. Richard Zenith is a terrific translator, and also obviously an excellent poet.

During his lifetime, he assumed a number of names and personalities, which reflect different and complementary ways of understanding life and poetry. From theoretical paganism towards XXth century malaise, his work is very thorough. Whereas some of his poems might seem a bit depressing (I am thinking about \\"The tobacco shop\\" and \\"The road to Sintra\\"), the mere fact somebody wrote something as beautiful and human makes them enlightening. I know this isn't an academic review as such, but Pessoa's poetry needn't only be read from you mind, but also from your gut. This a book definitely worth buying if you consider yourself a poetry lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy translation","review":"I don't speak Portuguese, but I've read Pessoa in Italian translation, and I consider his poetry remarkably powerful. I would think that, based on linguistic similarities, Italian translations in general would be more faithful to the original Portuguese than English would be.I bought this edition of Pessoa, translated by Richard Zenith, and was so terribly disappointed by the shoddiness of the translation that I was forced to write this review to defend Pessoa. Zenith fails miserably in conveying the sheer haunting power of Pessoa. Zenith's English is too colloquial for the task. Portuguese is not like Russian or Arabic: one would have to work fairly hard to make a translation this bad; or be awfully enamored of one's own poetical abilities, instead of being a faithful conduit of the original language.You ought to read Pessoa, but find a better translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"was hoping to start an online store but wouldn't up load, no support and to costly to get running, just get a yahoo merchant account, cheaper and easier"},{"rating":"1","title":"eComm Store","review":"I bought this software at a Fry's superstore.

After they realize that it is the one and only Marcus Brooks, they decide to take matters in their own hands (literally) and kidnap him.

Technically it performed very well in terms of amplitude and tone control as well as allowing independent control of each headset. However, within a relatively short time, the \\"flexible\\" arms of one of the headsets snapped. I was able to glue the sections but it simply cracked in another part of the \\"flexible\\" arm. When I reported this to the company, I was told to simply BUY a replacement headset. In rapid order (at intervals of a few months), both \\"flexible\\" arms of both headsets cracked. In short, although doctors may recommend this product, according to its advertisement, it clearly needs an engineering assessment and truly flexible arms.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT without checking whether the above manufacturing improvement has been made!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TV Ears Work, But Will Break Before Long","review":"I have bought two sets of TV Ears 2.3They work wonderfully, when they work.And, that is not for long.I have had a transmitter die, one channel in a receiver die, and the plastic stalk on one side of the receiver snap.

Their warranty is lousy, I suspect, to match the durability of their product. We are a two person household and I bought two pair of TV Ears. They were not used daily, by children or careless people. However one of the transmitters went out, then one headset, and then the other headset; all within 6 months of purchase. When I called TV Ears, they explained their lame 90-day warranty and offered to send me a new transmitter for a mere 49.99.Buy yourself a real pair of wireless headphones that has a legitimate warranty.

That means only one headset unit can be charged at one time.The ad for this headset claims that the TV Ears will fully recharge in only 1 hour. That is not true.In addition to the back part no longer charging, the batteries do not last more than 3 to 3-1/2 hours.I called TV-ears yesterday and they said there is nothing they can do to help me since I purchased these thru Amazon, not directly from them.Please take my review seriously.

He takes out his hearing aid, and uses the unit to watch old movies that don't have the same volume level as other TV broadcasts.In the beginning he did not position the headphones exactly right in the charging stand. It is not hard to do so, and when I pointed out that a green light will come on when the headphones are positioned properly, he got the hang of it.For anyone who has difficulty hearing, even if they use a hearing aid, this unit will make it very easy and enjoyable for them to watch TV without missing a word."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poorly made","review":"We bought one of these for my mother in law - it worked great for one night.

You need at least a familiarity with Hebrew to follow the copious notes. Where Houtman is better than anything out there is the connections he makes to other OT texts. The downside is the price. Four volumes and this one, Vol. 1, is $70. Who thought that was a good idea? Again it's too bad because the only place this book will be found is in theological libraries.

However, one would assume the 3rd version would be better than the first. Not so. The first version has better features, makes you earn additional equipment, gain skill, select how long you want to hunt, gives you bag limits and a list of what you can hunt for, etc. It's all fairly realistic for a hunting game. Trophy Hunter 3 is far less advanced than the original. You get everything up front and can basically hunt for everything and shoot as many as you want. You even add poached animals to your \\"Trophy Room\\". It's very lame. Game control from the keyboard is also much harder than the original.

All the missions are short and linear, there's only one way to do anything. Like a previous reviewer said, you go along a path, kill some people, then run to the objective. There's only one path to take, you cannot get lost or take neat side-trips, you do it the one way or no way.The weapons are kinda neat, but you cannot effectively use but 2-3 of them to get anywhere. The baddies always do the same thing, attack the same way.And you can EASILY finish the game in about 10 hours the first time. Then you can finish in about half that time from then on. Someone got lazy when then designed this game.When the price drops [lower] in the bargain bin, THEN you should think about buying this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meh...

Not!","review":"I don't understand why everybody puts in the obligatory \\"stunning graphics\\"; the fact of the matter is this game is just ugly. I bought this game hoping that it would look as good as Unreal Tournament 2003, but it's not even close. What's worse, it requires you to have twice as powerful a machine (as UT2003) to look at muddy enviroments with no sense of color theory. The graphics are okay, but hardly \\"beautiful\\"; its more of a disappointment because of all the hype about the new \\"engine\\". The visuals are as good as any other game out there, but they should have been better. (And no, it's not my system: just look at the screenshots at unreal2.com).The fact is, the Unreal Tournament games looked better, and were more fun to play. Designers need to stop thinking just in terms of detailed textures, and think about visual appeal. Lessons could be learned from art school graduates; games need the same level of graphic professionalism as movies (disney, pixar, lucasfilm)."},{"rating":"1","title":"major let down","review":"i bought this when it came out (full price!), eagerly expecting the awesome storyline, revolutionary non-linear play, blinding graphics and amazing engine it promised. What i got was a sub-par, completely linear storyline; LAME characters (the hero often refers to the female member of the crew as 'toots' in annoyingly stereotypal 'marine' voice); adequate play and good graphics, all rolled together in a game that i took a few short hours to finish and that i haven't touched since.Impressive visuals don't make up for not-so-impressive everything else.

The graphics in this game are very good, I would scale them on a 5 out of 5 (make sure you got the latest drivers!). The single-player gameplay is not nearly as bad as these guys say: The AI is about as good as the original Unreal (I would give it a 4 out of 5). I found the game entertaining enough to finish, which means a LOT, since I lost interest and never finished the original Unreal (I was hooked on HL and Quake 2). I would suggest this to any serious gamer who want some serious eye candy with a few challenges thrown in here and there. This game is NOT a dog, I guarantee it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb graphics & sound but bland plot","review":"I was really looking forward to the release of Unreal 2, and bought it almost immediately when it came out in the stores. I was blown away by the graphics and sound. However, within a week or so, I was done with it. The plot is hackneyed and linear, and the game seems a bit too short. This wouldn't be so bad if it had good multiplayer, but there is actually NO multiplayer. I played it through a second time and then sold it. I'd recommend Raven Shield, the new Tom Clancy shooter, as it uses the same superb game engine as Unreal 2 but includes great multiplayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feh.","review":"They tried real hard. Maybe too hard. Over-written commentary, over-polished graphics, and an occasionnal feeling that they forgot how incredible the first game was. It's pretty, and it has some wonderful elements.

Anti-aliasing could have been better addressed, along with the character's movement speed. Everything is is top-notch, though.

This book might possibly be acceptable for someone who is already familiar with anatomy and physiology, but for someone (such as myself) who has never taken this course before, the text is extremely confusing. Specifically, the text refers to various anatomical structures which are supposedly represented with an accompanying graphic illustration. Sometimes they are and sometimes they are not! Many times the text does not provide any accompanying illustrations. Different terms are introduced which are not defined, nor is there a definition in the back of the book. I have been reduced to looking in my dictionary or trying to \\"google\\" terms.

My professor contacted the publisher and there is no recourse - NO online version, the Mac version of the software (for release with the next edition) is not ready yet.

Now that I am in graduate school for Speech Pathology, I was told by a professor that the book is very inaccurate. She stated that it was one of the worst Anatomy and Physiology books out for Speech and Hearing. She also mentioned that I would not be able to use it as a reference in any papers or research, due to the poor quality of the material.

Chesbro's plots are always on the goofy-paranoid side, and this one is no exception. Don't get me wrong, the plot moves along and holds together, but one has to suspend disbelief immediately upon opening the book. But don't read this or any Mongo mystery for the plot, as fun and fantastic as it may be. Read it for the character, Mongo, and his brother and friends. There is no more likable character, detective or otherwise, in fiction. Chesbro's narrative voice is always pitched perfectly, and even if you don't buy his politics, you can't help but like him. Read it. Then go back and read them all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripping over his political paranoia again...","review":"I've generally loved Chesbro's books, but in this one and in the Language of Cannibals, he prefers to launch political diatribes rather than worry about telling a story. Whether you agree or not with his left wing tirades that turn aging hippies and former communists into heroes (as in Cannibals), if you're fair and objective, you'll agree that his eagerness to make a point interferes with his normal storytelling prowess, and his paranoia becomes a Johnny-one-note theme. The entire plot, from the opening sentence, is a long, paranoid tirade.

Just ordered another for other door, which seeped just a bit I noticed in last storm. It is easy to instal. Measure, trim to right length, drill holes and screw it on.

You get 3 different baskets divided into separate courses: breakfast, lunch, dinner. They baskets are a great size and have a handle so they can be carried around.

There are approcimately 11-14 pieces of food in each basket for example, a fried egg, pancake, bowl of strawberries, sandwich, burger, corn, peas, potatoes, bread, steak, chips, cake etc. What I like the best is there aren't any cardboard boxes which get destroyed easily.

Davis's portrayal of the caring school teacher is believeable and touching, in part because she has an edge to her that makes one believe that she could live this rather harsh existence in Wales with pride and dignity. I find it refreshing to see a performance which is risky for the perfomer because everyone grows from it and the fan gets a new glimpse of real talent. I will always hold this performance of Davis's as a most special one because, although one senses she can bite if needed, the dialogue is not her typical \\"chip on the shoulder\\" jargon.

One of the great things about All In The Family was its ability to take the viewer on a slice of life journey through the comedic irony and sometimes painful reality of life. In my humble opinion Carroll O'Conner and Jean Stapleton were and are two of the greatest acting talents ever. This DVD collection is very well done.

I thought DVD's were supposed to be better? But at the price Amazon is selling these for, still you can't go wrong. I asked around about this and was told it was in the transfer. All DVD's you buy say \\"digitally remastered\\" and that is meaningless.All that means is that is was put onto a digital formatted DVD. What to look for is \\"restored masters\\", meaning that before it was transferred to DVD (or VHS), the master tapes were restored and usually the audio was enhanced with dolby stereo.

Sound quality is excellent. I'd never heard any other songs by Quando Quango, but it really isn't anything special, and becomes boring quite quickly. A couple of songs have a \\"new wave 80s\\" feel, but most of the tracks are repetitive and uninteresting. Nothing on here is a lost 80s gem.

It features the superfight between Shamrock and Kimo, which was not a let down like the previous superfight.

I had never read it until the recent reprint. There is no way that it is true. No airline would put up with a lot of stuff in that book. The stewardesses could not have met all of those celebrities and men from different countries. I could go on and on but suffice it to say that it is quite obvious that the book is totally made up by Donald Bain who is a ghost writer. However for this book he is a fiction writer. It is funny and entertaining, and totally ridiculous. It doesn't reflect at all the real world of airline stewardesses in the 1960's. If you realize it is fiction you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing read...","review":"I don't know why I got this book, maybe the title grabbed my attention.

I've really enjoyed reading about Trudy and Rachel's escapades, especially the chapter about their \\"basic training\\" like stewardess school. I haven't finished the book, but I am about 80% through it. I pick it up every once in awhile and read a chapter here and there.

They are very accurate and better than the Official Strategy Guide. The Official Strategy Guide also has many errors when listing what the suffixes/prefixes/uniques do. It's Shrine List also has many errors, and does not even include some of the shrines. It does not have any real good quantitative data, which are all available on downloadable guides.However, this guide has pictures and screen shots, and is also written in a story-telling like format which makes it interesting to read. But if you want the real numbers that the game uses, get a guide from the Internet. In my opinion, the guides on the net are a lot more informative and useful. Then again, they are not as fun to read as the Official Strategy Guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is so bad, it's sacrilidge!","review":"If you want a real good in depth strategy/cheat guide, this isn't it.

Barely a plot, outrageous overacting, not even a remote nod to historical accuracy, ie. in one scene, the pirates are firing RIFLES.

True, most of the sea battles are stock footage from The Black Swan, but the standing backlot sets at Fox give this Sam Katzman quickie a fairly lavish look. Shame it never finds much interesting use to put them to, with the third-rate cast failing to provide any color to offset the clich��s, although it does offer a rare opportunity to hear the oft-dubbed John Richardson, the Clive Owen of his day, use his own voice in a supporting role.

I have done the other practices, and enjoy them as well, but Magically Hips alone is worth the price of the discs for me.Many others have already commented on Eoin, and I have to say that I find him helpful, encouraging and his joy of yoga comes through and makes me smile during the poses... all in all this practice is wonderful and I will certainly be buying the Surf edition in the near future. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful DVD!","review":"I have only done three of the practices offered on the dvd and I have enjoyed them all.

It's challenging, but not impossible, with a nice variety of postures. Eoin is a gentle, charismatic (not to mention great-looking!) teacher.I like to vary my practice depending on how I feel on any given day -- energy level, soreness, time, etc. -- so I like the range of practice lengths and appreciate the fact that people of differing yoga abilities are shown to illustrate variations on the postures.The group-hugging during the final credits is a little too cult-ish and weird for my taste, but, hey, it's a small price to pay; by that time I'm feeling so chill and limber and strong that I don't care what's happening onscreen. Anyway, who wouldn't want to hug Eoin given the chance?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Gift","review":"My boyfriend is used to think that yoga was not for him.

No mention is made of the fact that Keynes established two major arts organisations that still exist, namely, a theatre in Cambridge and the Arts Council of Great Britain.

This is a brilliant film about relationships and love and life. The French know how to make a film that stays with you, there ain't no hollywood ending here. So worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Release","review":"I had been waiting for quite some time to view this DVD but was unwilling to pay the high price. Thankfully, it has been re-released and is now available to rent at NetFlix. I'm not sure what the picture quality is like on the original DVD, but this disc is very crisp and clean.As for the movie itself, I (bravely) give it 4 stars. I understand that the main character is emotionally stunted, but it's just that reason that causes the film to be a bit slow and dry at times. It's also difficult for me to see her motivation for such a strong attraction to such a cold character. But it is a very rewarding film for the patient and open-minded viewer.No review would be complete without mentioning the wonderful music. Emmanuelle Beart trained for a year to learn to play the very difficult classical pieces and she is brilliant. Of course it's not her actual playing that we are hearing, but if you didn't know better, you'd swear it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"french movie fans must see it.","review":"This is typical but beautifully depicted French movie. The story is basically about triangular love affair, which French movies are likely to choose as the theme. The friendship between two men, Stephan and Maxim, begin to be shaken after Maxim introduced Camille, a beautiful violinist, to Stephan.Muse like looking Emmanuelle Beart is right cast for the part of Camille. She did great job. You will be impressed on her violine scene.Also, Ravel's works are used as the sound track. It greatly contributes to make this movie beautiful. In addition, French way of expression gave us unique impression which hollywood movies do not have.If you are French movie fan, you will like it. It never betray your expectation."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspense","review":"what a beautiful film, as i would have expected... the surprise came in the film's consistent, suspenseful construction of an emotional / romantic bond between stephane and camille, even as the bonds between the others suffered. the fact that the movie ended with no 'resolution' and that the viewers didn't mind at all was amazing! a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my 2 favorite French films","review":"\\"Un Coeur en Hiver\\" and \\"Monsieur Hire\\" are two of my favorite movies from French cinema. I recently saw Un Coeur again after a long respite and I was struck by how I was responding to Emmanuelle Beart's portrayal of the young violinist. How many times have you ever actually deeply felt sympathy for an actress who is as visually stunning as Beart? Rarely is my guess, because the \\"looks\\" tend to overwhelm the acting (at least for us guys!). Well, Beart's tortured scenes with Auteil as she desparately is trying to find a way into his heart were the \\"heart\\" of this movie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"This book is a nice beginner business book.

This is the best there is if you want to be sure you don't miss out on anything of interest or importance. I used Michelin for 30 years living in Europe. Now living in Florida, the state guide is incredibly accurate and complete. Same applies to all the other US ones. Some find it too comprehensive, but you can choose what to read and ignore some details. Be sure you will never miss out on any place of importance with a Michelin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singer needs to be featured more","review":"Overall the record is palatable. However, this listener only gives \\"Dust\\" a two-star rating because the lead-singer's talent is frequently drowned out in the mix.

Where can I get a poster size album cover?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mathes' CD a Worthy Debut","review":"Jay Mathes' CD, \\"Leave it all Behind\\" is a wonderful synthesis of his influences. Yet there are definite overtones of the sometimes gutsy, growly side of Bruce Cockburn in Mathes' voice. This CD brings the listener into Jay's experiences of the world in a subtle yet poignant way. His music deserves multiple listenings in order to fully appreciate both the lyrics and the phrasings of his guitar. His passion for his music shines through in this debut effort.Like a woven carpet that has an intentional flaw to emphasize that \\"only God is perfect,\\" I give this 4 stars because this artist will need some room to grow, because he will definitely be moving up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"If you are looking for music to bellydance to, this is not what you are looking for.

However, if you are looking for club style music with a little Middle Eastern flavor, you may like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for professors","review":"This book was an excellent read. Covers almost all aspects of a professor's life. I would highly recommend this to any new professor or any professor who is truly interested in improving his/her teaching effectiveness.

I was hoping this could of been it according to the title. Since I'm a beginner with no real photoshop experience I need a simplistic step by step guide. I'm sure some of you have found it's really hard to find a book for us noobs. This book is not it. It contains many overviews into different artists thinking process. Most of them use multiple art/cad packages in this book. For example, one artist may use maya, 3d studia max and then photoshop. Who really has all those tools? There are only a few that cover photoshop alone and other than a glance into the thought process of a true professional you won't learn anything from this book. Seriously most of the step by step guides are one or two pages for something that may have taken the artist 24 hours to complete. Unfortunately this book was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much painting as posing.","review":"I was disappointed that the book featured mostly posed 3d model type illustration and offered little in the way of actually painting on the computer. Maybe the title should have been digital fantasy image creation techniques. Being a painter I was just offended that the poser files with some lighting and photo shop filters is classified as painting. There are some good examples in the book of his technique and there are a few varied techniques. I was just hoping for something more about painting specifically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on Art, short on tutorial","review":"I bought this book impressed by the variety of digital art reproduced within it. However, I also expected that there would be some helpful tutorials discussing how to achieve the effects in the artwork. While some tutorials are included, they are hardly of the helpful, step-by-step variety - the eager learner is given short-shrift and the tutorial explanations are very shallow and less-than-helpful. For those looking for some nice art to look at, certainly pick this book up. However, if you want a book to learn from, go somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"There is nothing here of artistic or camp value, and certainly not nostalgia. Out of focus, overexposed junk. What a farce! When I think what this guy could have done...terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain weird","review":"While witty and charming, this book still manages to be a disappointment. In her last two books, eventually, all the twisting plots came together and made sense. In this novel, they did not. Only because I chose to use this book for a project I was doing did I half-heartedly trudge through this book of nonsense. What happened to the yellow dog? What happened to Ferdinand? When I chose this book I was confident that it was not a sci-fi. Then why did so many supernatural things seem to happen? Now I'm stuck doing a report worth 15% of my grade on a book that does not make sense and basically, has no continuing plot. This book has certainly discuraged me from picking up another of Atikinson's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally Wierd - Kate Atkinson","review":"This book was a total load of rubbish. I have started to read it twice but after eventually arriving at page 103, I have had to put the book down as the story does not seem to be going anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like this book","review":"I like Kate Atkinson but I found this book irritating and exhausting. Unlike some commentors, I didn't find the first 20 pages difficult at all. I quite enjoyed some of the twists and turns, the distracting interruptions as characters popped in and out of the story, the several stories compressed into one. However, near the end, I just became tired. I could not care anymore about what happened to any of the characters and so, I did not finish reading it. I seldom give up on any book, reading dutifully to the end of far worse novels than this. But as the ending became more frenetic, more fantastic, more convoluted, I simply gave up. No matter what the ending was, it was no longer worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally disappointing","review":"I thought that I would find a funny, entertaining and extremely neurotic story in this one. The first few chapters of Emotionally Weird were done very well. I was getting what I wanted: a satire of college life in the 1970's, but then it got irritating and trite. Unfortunately I found the series of stories and character anecdotes annoying and misguided. Yes, it is very funny. But the comedy does not make up for the ludicrous and confusing situations. I am not going to say that you shouldn't buy this book, although you should know what you're getting yourself into. In the end, you will either love or hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters were just strange","review":"I have read several of Kate Atkinson's books and enjoyed them. This book was just too strange and out there.. I couldn't relate to it at all. I thought all the characters and happenings were extremely unbelievable and nonsensical. I too rarely give up on a book, but I just didn't care about this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionallhy Weird","review":"This book was for my wife and was recommended by a friend, that obviously dosen't know her as well as she thought. Very hard read ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing in a Pirandellian fashion.","review":"As other reviewers have said, this novel is worth sticking with. The plot twists of both Effie and Nora are intriguing in a way reminiscent of Luigi Pirandello. Are the narratives true admissions of the personal histories of these ladies or merely plots for novels? It all ties together at the end...or does it? Read it and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slog","review":"Based on my love for another Kate Atkinson novel, Case Histories, I thought Emotionally Weird would be a good read. To my disappointment, I ended up having to force myself through the book, hoping that at some point I would begin to like at least one of the characters in the novel. Instead, every character came off as slightly repulsive and one-dimensional, and I never gained an appreciation or sympathy for any of them. About halfway through the book, I began to feel like I was stuck in a Groundhog's Day scenerio, where every chapter seemed to repeat slightly modified descriptions of characters' weird clothing, drug-filled dorm room conversations revolving around Star Trek quotes, and excerpts from lame papers/novels being written by the students or their professors. My advice is to skip this one and try some of Kate Atkinson's other books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very gripping","review":"I have read and loved 5 or 6 novels by Kate Atkinson but I couldn't finish this in spite of all the reviews advising readers to stick with it. Parts of it were interesting and funny, but the majority of it I found really tedious. I was more than halfway through the book when I decided I really didn't care if it all came together in the end, I was going on to something more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally Weird","review":"I've read other books by Atkinson and enjoyed them. I'm finding it difficult to stick with this one as it's almost like reading a stream of consciousness, which makes it difficult to follow. However, Atkinson usually has a surprise ending so I would really like to hold my judgement until I've finished. It takes a dedicated reader to read this one.I gave only two stars because I've not finished the book yet; still waiting for the surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird but well worth the read","review":"Kate Atkinson is among my very favourite writers for her keen intelligence and wit, the economy and inventiveness of her language and her empathy with human frailty.It's all there in Emotionally Weird, but this is not the most satisfying of her novels, hence only 4 stars. I read it commuting on the train and often had to control the urge to laugh out loud, but it had the feel of a book she banged off between more important books. It's a testimony to her brilliance that even though she wasn't doing her best work here, it still engaged me thoroughly from first to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"emotionally weird","review":"Kate Atkinson is among my favorite authors, thus my disappointment in this work is profound. The book is pure self-indulgent drivel; so much so, that I wonder if she wrote it just to see how much she could get away with--with the critics. Not a single character is less than repulsive - no - reprehensible; every location is soiled, literally or figuratively; who cares if the mystery of the protagonist's heritage is solved; why bother to finish this demeaning yet boring missle...... The word that comes to mind is \\"pejorative\\", which I don't commonly use because it is so often used by self-important psuedo-intellectuals. But Atkinson's dance through the hallways of profoundly defective academia-speak has to be described with words of equal disimportance. Don't touch this book; it is NOT clever and the sleasiness might rub off on your assaulted psyche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better sources are available","review":"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome!!","review":"This is very interesting.I thaught the internet would be slow and would freez...It turned out to be great and i always look forward to it"},{"rating":"1","title":"No is a good Method","review":"I am new play the bass guitar,and this method is old,and the songs are very slow and easy, that no help to learn how the bass guitar is can be play, and excuse for my english."},{"rating":"2","title":"A collection of memorable Elmore Leonard characters in a western setting","review":"Elmore Leonard does create truly memorable flesh and blood, though often quirky, characters and this was just as true when he wrote western pulp fiction in the 50's, 60's, and 70's as it is now. For instance, there are Rueben Vega and the title character of the main story, Pat Brennan (The Captives), Bobby Valdez and Lyall Quinlan (Saint With A Six-Gun), Amelia Darck and Simon Street (The Colonel's Lady) among others. There are classic tales such as 3:10 To Yuma\\" and \\"Hurrah For Captain Early\\". There's much about the independence of women and about troubled ethnic relations. These are western tales which can be enjoyed by those who ordinarily dislike westerns. And those fans of the later Elmore Leonard will find much that's delightful in his western stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of the Western","review":"THE TONTO WOMAN by Elmore 'Dutch' Leonard contains short stories that will redefine how you view 'The Old West' with plots twists and turns the likes of which any writer can envy.As a long time reader and fan of Leonard's I like to revisit the western stories from time to time to enjoy the dialogue, storyline construction, and characters that are anything but stock or easy to pigeon hole.THE TONTO WOMAN introduced us to a strong female lead long before it became common place, good guys who weren't necessarily all that good, bad guys who weren't all that bad, and folks caught in between who are still struggling with where they fit in or fall into the picture.Hollywood gave us a number of versions of the 'Old West' but I suspect it is authors like Leonard who provide a better and realistic look.This is a great commuter book. The stories are short, entertaining and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet but bulb is too yellow for me...","review":"Easy install and it makes absolutely no humming noise. I purchased this to go over my computer desk. However, the stock bulb was too yellow for my taste (15 watt, T8, 4100K). Went to Home Depot and bought a Philips 15 watt, T8, 5000K bulb (Natural Light) for $10, and it's almost perfect.I think the next color temp up would have been better for me, but it's a huge improvement over the stock bulb. White paper under the new bulb looks white, and the reflection doesn't hurt my eyes... maybe if I do go the next level up, it may be too bright.

Yet personal bias aside, this is truly a classic and inspired interpretation of the Bard's last and most haunting work.'Canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell?', asks the banished enchanter Prospero of his daughter Miranda. The cell being the key. The Tempest takes place in a Moorcockian artificially-sustained reality, such as in Michael's Dancers At The End Of Time and The New World's Fair.It is this essential element that Jarman captures so brilliantly, adding to the unreality by a number of techniques, such as the use of coloured filters and by placing his anarchic, wacked-out cast in a Gothic setting.The Island - the cell - is our individual sense of identity and reality, and in a fascinating interpretation which brushes the cheek of Zen and the Baghavad Gita, Jarman reveals that there is no mutant enemy, except ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time if you're looking for a good interpretation!","review":"Don't waste your time on this version of \\"The Tempest\\", if you're looking for a good interpretation!This one is like a San Francisco \\"Beach Blanket Babylon\\" version!

But bumping into an abused teenager, and inviting her to stay with her draws her into a strange world, where curses exist, and time travel (sort off) is possible. This book is not really a time travel novel (as I thought when I bought it), it's more of a fantasy book. But I never read any other book like it. Lynn Abbey, the author, creates a believable fantasy world. It reminded me a bit of Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere - a fantasy world superimposed on our modern reality.

I was hoping for more sci-fi to go with the supernatural theme, but didn't find it.Sadly, when the story runs its course, much of the mystery is unsolved and the roles of some seemingly important characters remain unclear. Even worse, last minute plots are introduced in a \\"stay tuned for next week's episode\\" way.Overall, this book introduces an imaginative idea for a story but it fails to support it with interesting details. Rather than telling a complete story, it seems that the author is setting you up to buy a sequel.

While a bit more pricy than the standard \\"kit lens\\" it would replace in your lens collection, the fast 2.8 speed and image quality can not be bettered at this price with these features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well spent!","review":"I bought this Tamron lens 9 months ago and I've taken well over 30,000 pictures with it. I was debating between the Nikkor or the Tamron and it came down to cost. I've not been disappointed.If you've got the cash go for the Nikkor and sleep better knowing you own the best. I sleep better knowing my pictures rock just as hard and I saved a thousand bucks.Check out my blog and judge for yourself - if it's a wide shot it was this lens.

It's all about the lens.I did put out the cash for the Nikkor 70-200 2.8 - no regrets there either.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive vignetting with f2.8, take the full frame 17-35 f2.8-4 rather!","review":"I returned this lens in fast succession as I saw the extent of vignetting, which it causes. Especially with f2.8 the problem is extreme with all focal length.You might verify this finding on several well known online sites, such as Photozone (dot de, not dot com!). The well known author of this site measures on a Nikon D200 whopping 1.4 steps darkening of the edge. He uses Norman Koren's Imatest software. Even on Canon it is still 1.0 step darkening (Canon uses a smaller sensor size, scale factor 1.6 versus Nikon's 1.5.)Do yourself a favor and take rather the quite excellent 17-35 f2.8 Di full 35mm frame! You will like your images much more, and you will be able to use the same lens with film bodies as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific exploration of past lives by open minded skeptic","review":"A very easy read, considering the subject matter. Almost like sitting and talking with the author. Scientists and laymen will learn a lot and enjoy this book, and if either group reads only one book on this subject, this would be a good choice. Thorough examination of the subject including all the usual arguments against the reality of past-life regressions (I as the reviewer have never had one). Four stars because since its publication, the vast addition of information by the translation of texts of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as the science done on Tibetan Buddhism and altered states of consciousness could add to this work immeasurably."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest, well-thought out treatment of the subject","review":"What I like most about the book, besides the content, is the honesty of the author. He doesn't pretend to be promoting something he doesn't believe. He tells you straight away exactly what his stance is and what the purpose of the book is. It is up to each reader to draw the conclusion he or she wishes. The stories he relates are very interesting and eye opening. It's hard to simply dismiss them out of hand. As a firm believer in reincarnation, I found the book to be informative and thought provoking. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about reincarnation from the psychiatric perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming Back","review":"I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it to the paranormal discussion group that I attend at the local library"},{"rating":"2","title":"Iceland isn't that cold !!!","review":"It was funny to see Iceland and Icelanders shown in such a strange way.

Mostly Icelandic humor !"},{"rating":"2","title":"winter wonderland","review":"I traveled to Iceland this past March, and watching Cold Fever made me positively nostolgic for its wintry landscape and sense of mysticism which this film so gorgeously captured. The landscape seemed to function as the main character in the film, unyielding and rich with stories and secrets. I particularly enjoyed the array of bizarro characters in Cold Fever - the funeral collector, the sock puppet wielding Americans, the Icelandic cowboys and caroling truckers - peppering the film's themes of alienation and ritual with wonderful humor. Anyone who has been to Iceland can attest to its power and eccentricities. From the moment that Atsushi arrived at the Reykjavik airport and took the flybus to the Blue Lagoon, it was as if I was there all over again. I recommend Cold Fever to film lovers everywhere, and especially to those of you who dream of going to Iceland."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIRD TOY","review":"I gave it high ratings on every level.

Through their words and actions, the girls demonstrate that although many things have changed since the Victorian era -- such as what women can and cannot expect from their lives -- many aspects of adolescence (cliques, rebellion, emerging self-understanding) haven't changed a bit. The fantasy part actually struck me as a bit weak, though that may be partly because (not knowing it was the first part of a trilogy) I read the whole book expecting things to be resolved and explained at the end. Instead, the end feels more like a beginning, but I look forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so very lame!","review":"I really wanted to like this book.

It begins with some beautifully imagery, but jumps right into action before you know the main character at all. I found it difficult to force myself to finish this book. The plot seems to lack direction. I kept waiting for something to happen that wasn't completely predictable. The underlying dark current of the book is disturbing, almost remisniscent of a fantasy version of 'Lord of the Flies', but at a girls boarding school. It definitely wasn't romantic either, unless you consider a teen girls sweaty dreams of a boy touching her breasts romantic. I won't be reading the sequels.

The novels were well thought out, with wonderful characters, plot, conflict, and lovely tension. However, by the end of it crazy things started happening. In the third book these relationships suddenly change in an incredibly forced way, as if the author suddenly decided she needed to portray a more diverse set of characters and situations to widen her fan base. The lesbian action seems forced, thrown in, and unbelievably sudden. It wasn't believable for the reader.Also, the SPOILER!!!!:The way Kartik died was unforgiveable!!! It may seem juvenile and ridiculous but unless the novel is post-apocalyptic, I want a HEA. This trilogy steals that away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing!","review":"I found this book in the \\"Young Adult\\" section of the book store and what a score!

I'm a sucker for Gothic-type mysteries with a touch of the supernatural, and Gemma, the protagonist, is so real and down-to-earth that you can't help but like her. This is quality writing for young adult readers. As an aspiring author of young adult novels myself, I'm of the strong opinion that talking down to young people - as many YA authors do - is insulting and certainly unncessary. I'm 35 years old and found this book to be as well-written and entertaining as anything in the adult mainstream market.

I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with the book as a whole and will not be picking up the other two anytime soon. Overall the story seemed contrived, predictable and rather boring, I will say that this could be because I don't like the fantasy genre usually but I am just telling you how I felt. This was a major disappointment too as this was my first YA book in a very long time and I was hoping to have this one help me back into the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique way of looking at magic and the power of dreams","review":"When I first started reading this book I thought, \\"ugh, another modern writer with no writing ability\\" but as I progressed through the book I realized that it was a perfect style for the content and age target. It is nothing to Mary Stewart or Agatha Christie or the Bronte sisters but it still holds your emotion in its hand.It is also a unique way of looking at magic and the power of dreams on the mind.

(I am American.) I found Gemma irritating, and her all-important visits to the \\"realms\\" boring. Many of Gemma's experiences are supposed to be frightening, but they were just dull. Most annoying, the book left several loose ends, which, I imagine, the author intends to address in one or more sequels that I do not expect to be reading.

I enjoyed it while I was reading it, but the climax was pretty rote, diminishing everything that came before it. A tad Harlequiny at time as well. The protagonist's friends are too unlikable, and there's no character growth. And it's all kind of overly-protracted, which you don't mind so much until there's no satisfying payoff.There's a Q&A; at the end with the author who says things like \\"I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you,\\" which of course only makes matters worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST teen novel ever written!","review":"Seriously, you can not find a better written teen novel. Libbra's style of writing even exceeds many adult authors by far! Her writing is poetic, full of symbolisms, and just waiting to be heard! And best of all, its full of funny sarcastic comments from the characters! Loved it!The story itself, also amazing, dark, and engaging. Its hard to put down once you get past the first chapter. Gemma's mother just die and she's off to England for the first time to go to all girls finishing school. The worst part of it is that she is having visions for the first time in her life. She actually saw her mother's death even though she was no where near where it happened. At the boarding school, she learns to be a lady, while finding out about a secret society called the order.(ok so i'm no good at reviews...but there you go)Trust me, read it and be amazed by the story and the quality of the writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrible great read!!!!","review":"I was finishing up with the Twilight series and wanted more.

I LOVED it!! I have been telling all my friends that if they miss twilight they should read the Gemma Doyle Trilogy. I hope they make a movie of this one as well!! It would make a really exciting film! You should read this book!

I couldn't put the book down. The charcter, Gemma Doyle has a bitter whitt to her that makes you laugh out loud in some places. The twisting of the plot is constantly changing into something you don't suspect thus leaving you with a curiosity to know what will happen. The book is very well written in a unique style. The author, Libba Bray, mixes the victorian age and it's meany social standards and rules with modern writing skills that make a wonderful book that I would recommend to any young adult. If you haven't read this and don't entend too then you are missing out! BIG TIME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The story of this 16 year old teenager was rich and vibrant. Being the 15 year old girl that I am, I could relate to the situations Gemma faced and I ceaselessly admired Gemmas all to rare strength of female character. This is a great coming of age tale intertwined with the dabblings in magic and fantasy which make the tale all that more alluring.

Felicity decides that she and Gemma should start a club with some other girls. They call themselves The Order. But what secrets might they unlock from the past? And what about this strange gypsy boy who keeps warning Gemma against her visions? And why does Gemma have rather erotic dreams about him?The story can be sort of confusing as it rushes the first chapter and then it gets sort of slow. Also the end is sort of confusing to which is why I didn't give it all 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Dull...","review":"Since this book got decent reviews, I thought I would give it a try. Turns out the book was dreadfully boring. It took forever to get into the story, and once you were in the story, it was a little too fiction for common sense. I had higher expectations for the book and I was disappointed. Unless you like boring school girls and snotty cliques, this book will not interest you at all. Some parts were alright, but the majority of the book was monotonous. This would be a great buy if you are looking for a book to read when you are trying to fall asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"About: This is a story about a girl who get's visions. She is desperate to go to Europe and have a 'normal life.' Well, she gets her wish. There she finds out about the truth about her family, the secrets, who she is, who her friends are, etc. Overall, the plot is intricate and twisty. I would not recommend to this to anyone younger than 13 - the vocabulary would be a bit too much.My Opinion : some thing about this just didn't intrigue me as much as a good book would. There was no magic while I was reading it. All the while, I was secretly hoping I would soon finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great and terrible book","review":"There are very few books that I meet that I don't like, this would be the second one. It was terrible. I know the author was thrilled with her research about the period, but I thought it was lame. I'm not a huge history fanatic, but even I knew the basics about corsets and button hooks fot shoes. And I find the relationship with the gypsy absurd. I can't imagine no matter how ill behaved a young Victorian lady may have been she would have never allowed herself to fall in love with a gypsy.The parts in the story where they cross over were quite lacking in description. All I could sense was a white haze with your own character description choice plopped in, since there was none to reference.I found myself to like the description of the author more enjoyable than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great and a little Terrible","review":"I was really excited for this book, after reading many good reviews it seemed like it would be great. I got it from the library only to find it to be a major let down.I didn't feel connected with the people, and some twists in the book make no sense at all.Also, the fantasy/magic parts were often too dull to read the whole part. I found myself skimming and skipping pages.Although not the worst book I've read, it was hardly worth all the excitment."},{"rating":"2","title":"victorian novel with modern twists","review":"Libba Bray has managed to incorporate all the great elements of a Vicorian gothic novel, using modern language and concepts while still maintaining Victorian gothic settings.The characters are what makes this novel so engrossing and relatable. Although, as written by others, it is fairly obvious that a sequel or series is on the horizon. (Or there should be a sequel as many loose ends need to be tied up, much to the reader's frustration.)Definitely for a wider audience than young adult, but parents should note that younger readers may encounter some mature themes - so it wouldn't hurt to preview the book before your child reads it.I will look forward to reading more from this author and will enjoy meeting up with these characters again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This trilogy is a must read!","review":"I highly recommend this trilogy. It is different from other paranormal books. No vampires or werewolves. Gemma is quite funny. This series have everything: death, honor, caste, dreams, visions, success, addiction, love, romance, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone who found this book to be something other than great is crazy","review":"i found this book compelling and thoroughly intriguuing. it took me a little while to really get into it, but once i did i was hooked. The beginning is important, so for those of you who are impatient and skip boring parts, you have to read it. all the mystery, emotions just spilling off the page, it is thought provoking and shows a much darker side of the victorian era. even if you find this book to be less than satisfactory, i still suggest the world read it because the next book Rebel Angels, is so overwhelmingly spectacular. there are no words to describe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Forced Finish","review":"This book bored the socks off me.And it was a strange thing because Bray has a wonderful grasp on prose. It was well-written in that sense. But as far as the story goes....it's what I call a \\"platform book.\\" A platform book or movie is one which was solely created to push an agenda. In this case, girl power. Not to say I'm against girl power, I am a girl, but I'm against it feeling like the sole purpose of the book. The characters were cut-outs and uneventful. The romance, if it can be called that, was awkward and not at all enticing. I had the BIG SURPRISE PLOT TWIST figured out early on and once it was made known it took a lot of effort just not to abandon the book, but dang it, I paid ten bucks for that book to sit on my shelf and I was gonna finish it. Should've kept my money. I won't be buying the other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding","review":"I am very willing to read books for entertainment value only, not every book needs to be a literary masterpiece, but this book just fails in every way. The writing is flat and uninteresting, the characters are lifeless, and the story held less interest for me with every page. I know youth fiction isn't usually multilayered but I was able to predict the book's ending before I was halfway through. Also the setup for the next book was not subtle, it's more like the author took one book and chopped it into pieces to end up with a small series.However, from the number of positive reviews I am in the minority, so perhaps my opinion can, and should, be ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise :)","review":"I enjoy historical fiction from a woman's point of view, and so I picked this one up, but it wasn't what I expected. It has a large supernatural theme that I found to be a little abstract. Normally this wouldn't thrill me, but this book is very well written, so I found myself very absorbed. I liked the main character and her imperfections. Better yet than reading the book is listening to it on CD, as the actress who reads it, Josephine Bailey, is brilliant. It's one of the best audio book performances I've come across. I would look for other performances by Bailey. Very, very impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in ages. The narration from the main character, Gemma, is flawless and Libba Bray's prose spot-on. The story is fascinating and enchanting. Gemma is a realistic 16-year-old - vulnerable, reckless and stubborn - which makes her both relatable and frustrating. The other characters are well drawn and believable with an array of good and bad qualities. I wished there was more of Kartik and hope his character becomes more prominent in the sequels.This book has a little bit of everything - romance, mystery, suspense, and magic set in an alluring Victorian atmosphere. It's a fantastic, fast-paced read. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The beauty is in the writing","review":"When I first picked up this book at my local library, I did not know what to expect. All I know was that I was intrigued by the title and the cover art. I am so glad that I made the choice to read this. This book can appeal to a wide audience - it has intrigue, mystery, and everything in between. I did not even know that this could be found in the teen section - Ms. Bray just captivates you with the story. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This was an excellent book! (And I'm very excited that a sequel is to come out later this year.) The characters were well-developed, and it was suspenseful and eerie."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPENDICULAR","review":"I found \\"A Great and Terrible Beauty\\" to be one of the best books I've ever read. I would love to read a sequal to find out if Gemma and Kartik get together.Hopefully the author reads these review and writes another book or one like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars- Nothing to get excited about","review":"I expected this book to be much better than it turned out to be- I guess it was just skillfully promoted. The plot holds much potential, but I found Libba Bray's writing style to be unremarkable and not very rich. I also thought that the whole premise of the book (the realms and the \\"Order\\") was ill-formed and without any deeper connection. The story just doesn't \\"click\\", somehow. It left me feeling dissatisfied.The lone unusual (and amusing) element of the book is the main character's (Gemma) quasi-love interest (Kartik). The hints of torrid romance were quite entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're all looking glasses, we girls","review":"I was really surprised by this book. The cover image does not (or at least not to me) hint at what this story is really about, which made the depth of the characterizations and the compelling story line a pleasant surprise. At the beginning, I was a little bored with the idea that the story would take place at an English girls boarding school--midnight feasts and mean girls, no thanks--but as the novel continued and the author showed us more and more about Gemma and her fellow students, the story became riveting. I especially liked how Ms. Bray portrayed the stifling aspects of life for young women in Victorian England and made us feel their frustrations and need to rebel. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to picking up the story of Gemma and The Order inRebel Angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read.","review":"This book is everything you want it to be: fantasy, creepy, realistic, romantic, mysterious, etc.. It left me speechless and while reading, could not put the book down. The ending is not disappointing, and the book is a fast-paced exciting novel the whole way through. I would definitely recommend (or demand you read) this book to anyone over the age of 12, since it has some quite scary parts in it! A must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Poetic and Literary Masterpiece","review":"This is by far one of my favorite books of all time. As a frequent and diligent reader, I have read many stories and books and yet very few strike me so interesting as this one did. Three years after reading the book, I can still recall the vivid descriptions and beautiful language used throughout the book. The story itself its extremely creative and it manages to allow you as a reader to imagine yourself in situations far different than you have ever been in before. Its amazing descriptions enable you to almost feel as though you are taking the place of the character themselves, enabling you to experience an exceptional reading journey. I highly recommend this book and I promise the reader will have trouble looking away from that beautifully scripted and extremely exciting page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to say that I am completely shocked by all of the positive reviews for this book. The basic idea wasn't so bad, but the one dimensional characters and absolutely horrendous writing were too much. I had to literally MAKE myself finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly grating","review":"Utter garbage. Cardboardy, one-dimensional characters are put through their paces in this mess of cliches. The \\"magic\\" is surprisingly tedious -- mainly because the parallel world from which it springs is so ill-defined.Don't waste your time, money, or patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titillating, but that's about it.","review":"The only time this book was fully engaging was when Gemma was crossing the lines of acceptable sexuality in thought or action. Then the narrative felt seductive--dangerous and forbidden. But that's like putting chocolate coating on a mangy, dog-eared house shoe. I could have cared less about the heroine on either side of those episodes. Titillation just is not good enough.So the book pushes boundaries.Let's not celebrate that.Celebrate that when it comes *with* solid writing, characters you embrace and new worlds or ideas to explore.Fair warning. There's not any of that here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"I purchased this book for someone else online, and unfortunately I did not read enough about it, or I would never had purchased \\"A Great and Terrible Beauty.\\" My friend received the order yesterday, delivered by post office and left in the rain. She told me she didn't think it was the kind of book she could read and certainly not pass on to anyone else. Today she told me about the little bit she did read and I regret she will have the memories of it in her mind. She definitely will throw it away. It is full of supernatural, demonic things and nothing anyone should dabble in if they want a sane mind. Also, it seems this author only wrote 2 books, and my friend said no wonder, given the nature of her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epilepsy and Spoons Don't Mix!","review":"I wish I could give less than one star to this book for perpetuating the myth that the best response to a seizure is to force a spoon in someone's mouth. It's completely untrue and actually very dangerous.You can't swallow your own tongue (try it right now and see if you can!) but a spoon or any foreign object forced in the mouth can fracture teeth or choke a person. It's probably one of the WORST things that you can do when a person has a seizure.I wish that Ms. Bray had either done a little basic research before she included that scene, or included a more helpful response, like making sure there was nothing on the floor for the girl to hit, or to loosen her corset so she could breathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This was absolutly the most horrible book I have ever read. I picked it up because it seemed interesting. I was so wrong. It not only was extremely boring, but the story didn't make sense what-so-ever. Good try though."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This would have been a good book if not for the same sex omplications. I do not know why the author felt the need to add this in. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent book for pre-teen girls.","review":"This book was ok, good but not great. I think what kept me reading was that it would have been a book I would have loved when I was around 11 or 12-years-old. I loved the whole \\"boarding school\\" genre when I was around that age. It is definitely a book written for children or teens. As children's books go it was pretty good. The story is interesting and the characters are very real to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Keep","review":"From the first time I saw this book I was hooked. When I finally got around to reading it, I coudn't put it down. I read it in two days! Between school and chores. I absolutely loved it. It was very intriguing and dark, but the nice, suspensful kind. It has a little of everything, magic, friendship, romance... anyone who's fascinated by magic and things like that would love it. I don't mean to build it up, saying it's the best and the greatest, it depends on tates. I will say though, that once you read it, you won't be sorry.Another thing about this is... I don't think the story ends here. At least I hope not. I think there may be a another installement. And I'm definetely looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome book!","review":"A friend of mine told me about this awesome book she had read, A Great and Terrible Beauty. She told me to pick it up and read it, and I did.I loved it! Especially the Victorian setting... I'm a sucker for that time period. It's a very unique book, very different from most books that I have read.It was a easy and very entertaining read. One of those books that pull you in and makes you feel like you're part of the story.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love the scenery created","review":"The charectors are interesting and I love the images/scenery described. Ive heard it may become a movie which would be great, but I really hope they change the ending if so. Hated the way it ended for the lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vividly victorian","review":"I really loved this book. I'm a big fan of fantasy books and of the Victorian era. I felt the terminology the author used to describe certain characters was spot on for this time period piece. I will definitely check out the other two books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start for a trilogy.","review":"I liked the setting of the book. I enjoy historical fiction a lot and this book was written beautifully. I loved the description of the school and its surroundings where the adventures take place. Libba Bray is able to describe in enough detail without going overboard to bore you with the little minute details.What I didn't like about the book was it did seem slow in parts. It seemed like it would hit an exciting part, slowly take off a short while and then come back down with some set up business. Quite a few characters involved in this first book of the trilogy, but not too many to get lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I read this book a few years ago and I've never forgotten it. I think about the story from time to time and that's unusual for me. I've also read it about three times which is something I don't do. I read a book once and I'm done with it. But this story is really intriguing and all (MINI SPOILER) about different realms and death and magic that is more original that what we've seen a lot of.Her sequels are also really engaging and I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, especially the first half","review":"This book starts out being very interesting, with Gemma living in India with her mother and father. Then her mother is killed and Gemma goes to a boarding school in England. The first half of the book is better than the second, which is my biggest complaint about the book. A boy from India travels to London and it seems as if there would a good amount of romance, and it dissapointed me when there was not as much as I expected. Also, the second half becomes somewhat darker. I don't want to give anything away, so I wont say what i mean by that, but you'll know what I mean once you read it. On the plus side, it is a good thick book with a lot of detail, and the ending is pretty surprising. I suggest checking this out from the library or maybe buying it if you have the money for it.The sequel to this book will be coming out soon, called Rebel Angels. I have a feeling that it will be even better than the first book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome book","review":"when i first read the summary of this book i was a little skeptical about it, but was i ever wrong. this book was a wonderful srory of magic, mean school girls, love and the need to belong, and it all took place in the victorian time period. This book was great. i can't wait to read rebel angels. I definently recommend this book. it is a must read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much foreshadowing!","review":"I was kind of excited to get my hands on this book after reading the reviews, but was disappointed to find that it's really too immature for me. The foreshadowing ruins the book completely. It's predictable and only vaguely interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"My two biggest problems with this book were that it was extrememly boring and I felt that the author didn't really have a good enough grasp on her own ideas about this thing called the \\"realms\\" and all that it entails to get a clear understanding across to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've Read in a Long Time","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a while. It was truly great, Libba Bray seems an awesome author. Make sure you read Rebel Angels, the sequel to this book. I can't wait for the third one. This book has everything, even though it is set back in victorian times, the characters are very real and you can relate to them. It is fantasy and has magic in it, but there is also other teen girl issues in it that have to do with real life. It was a great book. I strongly reccomend it to teens and adults too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, but...","review":"At the start of this interseting sounding book, the author points out that we should not judge scientific blunders with 20/20 hindsight. After saying this, he goes on to do just that in most cases. Many \\"blunders\\" were simply hypotheses that turned out to be wrong as new information came in or simply beurocratic errors.Most annoying is his tendancy to stand up on a soapbox and denounce the evils of anything that is not based on \\"the epitome of rational thought which is science\\" (or words to that effect). Psychoanalysis, economics, and even medicine come under attack for not meeting his criteria for science and therefore constituting blunders of the highest magnitude. Combined with the frequent errors in word use and scientific information, this holier-than-thou attitude makes it clear that he is more interested in scoring points against certain disciplins than pursuing the putative purpose of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author got the facts wrong.","review":"With respect to the author's claim that the first Apollo lunar landing was almost a major blunder, he got the facts all wrong. He doesn't cite his exact references or data sources to back up his claims. The book is entertaining reading and it tells a tale, but can you believe his assertions? Is this book, in part \\"junk science\\" that will itself perpetuate half truths?"},{"rating":"1","title":"deeply flawed book","review":"As a layman I am offended at the bad scholarship of this book. The author conveniently did not allow his credentials--obviously he is uneducated--to be placed on the back cover. If I had written this book I would want to remain unknown also.The book is filled with assertions--NO FOOTNOTES!--that are untrue. His ignorance of the history of science, the history of philosophy and the history of religions make this book a complete waste of money. I hope I can return it.Buy some other book. Anything but this one. Hopefully it will soon go out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book of Blunders...","review":"The strong point of the book is that the author emphasizes how the scientific method works to weed out errors. But if you write a book with this title, you had better double-check your facts, so as not to produce blunders yourself. This has not been done, there is an embarrassing number of howlers. It is i.a. claimed that the range of the strong interactions is 1 nanometer, that a room-temperature superconductor would violate the second law of thermodynamics, that the power of the Chernobyl reactor was a measly 1 MW, that the Second World War was already on in the summer of 1939, etc., etc. Another excellent idea for a book spoiled by shoddy writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I'd really like to read a book about scientific blunders, but this certainly isn't it. For the most part, it's a review not of scientific blunders but of commonplace mistaken notions of the past--the earth is flat, the earth is the center of the universe, alchemy, perpetual motion, and so on. All done very superficially, as if from an encyclopedia. I can imagine having a reason to refer to it sometime in the future, which is why it's not a total waste (and why I gave it two stars instead of one), but if I didn't already own it, I definitely wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every Science Major","review":"As a secondary science teacher, and would be philosopher of science, I found Youngson book, \\"Scientific Blunders\\" incredibly useful. He addresses areas of science that are not really beyond High School, but his discussions take the mystery out of the \\"process of science\\".Beware that if you have an almost religious conviction to the superiority of science, its scope, aim and process, be prepared to lose a little awe, but gain more respect.Philosophers?? Certainly, this is worth the read. It will give you the necessary background when debating your hard science counterparts.Science Majors?? Don't let well organized lectures, and practiced oration fool you. Science does not proceed in such a linear fashion. Scientific Blunders is a necessary read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normal science blundering?","review":"Presented as blunders made by scientists, the author in fact shows how science is struggling its way to truth. Nobody expects scientists to be right from the first moment, they have to find their way through trial and error, and this is normal science. To present old and wrong theories this as blunders is not justified. Presenting blunders made by politicians, managers and ingenieurs as blunders made by science is not fair either, so it is very questionable that technological disasters as Chernobyl, the Challenger and Bhopal belong in such a book. Some factual information is not correct about the Apollo project (Apollo 7 and 9 did not flight to the moon) and about physics (a small object falls slower than a bigger object from the same material). Having these kinds of facts wrong throws doubt on other facts. A missed chance for a book using this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and incorect","review":"This book is very disappointing, on average there is an error on every page. This makes the arrogant tone with which he describes 'blunders' even more annoying. The author has obviously no idea what he writes about.

I contacted amazon and they nicely agreed to send me the right material. The second time the item got to me was still in english so by then I was really upset to have received the same item twice in the wrong language and all this process made me waste my time and now my father does not have his book to study for this exam.

It is impossible to read this story and not become completely enthralled with the Mayhem character.By the author of the wildly popular Pressure, Dweller, and Benjamin's Parasite, Graverobbers Wanted demonstrated early on that Jeff Strand is a master storyteller. Dark and humorous, this mystery-action-thriller will hold you until the last page, and leave you still wanting more.And thankfully, there is more! Further Andrew Mayhem adventures can be found in:Single White Psychopath Seeks SameCasket for Sale (Only Used Once)Suckers (with J A Konrath)No matter how many smash hits Jeff gives us, Graverobbers Wanted will always hold a special place, being my introduction to the author's twisted genius. I can only hope we one day see the often promised further adventures of Andrew Mayhem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed AND Cringed - Enjoyed this Book Immensely","review":"I laughed out loud during the first half of a book - Strand can be a very funny writer, but by the second half I was laughing less and cringing more. He's an amazing writer, flawless execution keeping the action moving along quickly, and again the book is quite funny - especially in the dialogue - early on. But this is a horror novel, make no bones about it - not a spoof or satire of the genre. Some scenes were quite horrific and cringe-worthy as the puzzle the protagonist Andrew Mayhem is forced to solve gets more gruesome and the stakes get higher. I got pretty creeped out. It takes an artist to have such a dark tale while still managing to bring a laugh. Jeff Strand is a master at this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow after good start","review":"After a good start with one or two laughs the story and the narrative looses its grip.

It lives up to its description very well. My entire family has GI issues and/or diseases, so I'm pretty well read on both medical and alternative treatments, and this book covers the 'natural' remedies comprehensively. You are given sufficient information to use a remedy, and enough to give you the knowledge to pursue additional information if desired. And most importantly, in my opinion, in many cases Dr. Minocha explains WHY these conditions can exist and why these remedies should work.I wish we had tried a few of these remedies we didn't know about before my husband had his entire colon removed.

The books and television show were my absolute favorite growing up, and in fact, I still watch them to this day on DVD. The paperback format is actually better suited for girls slightly older than mine (she could easily bend the pages if I let her run off with the book), but she sits through the story beautifully when I read it to her and brings it to me to read to her again and again. I'm actually a little surprised because I found this particular book to be a little boring in it's composition. But hey, works for me! The illustrations are lovely. I definitely plan on buying more books in the \\"My Little House\\" series. If you want to pass Little House on to your girls, this is a great way to do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"Penelope Ann Miller is not the greatest actress ever born, but this is a cute romantic comedy.

It tries to be like Romancing the Stone but it falls short. The acting isn't too great, the characters cheesy and the plot silly but it's watchable.I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it never made a big impact.For a romance it was disappointing. The characters are thrown together and fall in love in a day. I guess it's supposed to be spontaneous but it just seemed ridiculous to me. The so-called villains act like they jumped out of a Pink Panther cartoon.This was definitely a mixed bag for me. It starts off intriguing but becomes less and less interesting as it goes on.I wouldn't have kept watching it if Tim Daly hadn't looked so hot in it. He looks good with a mustache!I wasn't too impressed by how the film looked. It hasn't held up well at all in 20 years. This was made in 1992 but the quality of the movie makes it seem like it was made in '72."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't play in the USA - Region 2","review":"BUYER BEWARE!

It's almost like the producer, director, and screenwriters got together to view the rushes and decided to jazz up the story. Their goal seems to have been to make it entirely implausible. The result is something that makes a Tom and Jerry cartoon look like \\"Gone with the Wind.\\"Probably the worst and most far-fetched aspect of the movie comes at the end when the Tim Daly character bids on a bottle of wine from 1811. He has spent the preceding 90 minutes playing a stunt double with a bad back and now he's a bio-chemical genius from MIT. Not only that but he can afford to spend $5 million on a single bottle of wine. Hard to believe that anything could be sillier than that.Hollywood surpassed itself for shlock when it made this movie. No wonder this was Louis Jourdan's last film. Don't spend a nickel or 5 minutes on it if you consider yourself a thinking adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a very bad year...","review":"This movie is bad. Not VERY Bad, but bad enough. Penelope Miller has neither the sex appeal or charisma to be a heroine, and Tim Daly (with his moustache) comes across as a former porn star in his first \\"legitimate\\" role.I bought it because I collect wine and was very interested to see an adventure movie with a rare bottle of Lafite at its center. Sadly, the scenes of rare wine in musty cellars are few, and I hated to see the Imp��riale of Lafite treated so badly.If you want to buy it because you're interested in wine, don't. There's not enough of it. If you're interested because it's an action/adventure move, don't. It has little of either."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Gem","review":"This movie has gotten some unnecessarily bad press. It's basically a Cinderella story with wine. The performances are excellent and the Louis Jourdan subplot is clever. This is a straightforward romantic comedy with some international adventure elements.

His favorite part is the last page which introduces all the animal babies that were pictured throughout the book. He likes to repeat each name as we say them. However, he does seem to be disturbed by the picture of the mother lion carrying her cub in her mouth. He always wants to look at that picture the longest and he keeps saying \\"Bite\\" over and over. We've tried to explain that this doesn't hurt the baby, but it still bothers him. There is also a picture of a mother crocodile carrying her baby in her mouth, but for some reason, this doesn't bother him. Otherwise, we really enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, gorgeous illustrations!","review":"This is my almost-two year old daughter's favorite book these days. She asks for it every night (\\"Babies Onna Go!\\") and she loves to point out all the animals, and she \\"reads\\" (says) the last word on each page. She now recognizes the previously unfamiliar animals (bats, opossums, etc.) when she sees them in pictures or books elsewhere. The story is cute, the rhyming is appealing, but it's the gorgeous watercolor illustrations by Jane Dyer that really make this book an all-time favorite. If your child is attracted to animals and beautiful artwork, buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves these babies","review":"At 18 months, this was one of my daughter's favorite books. \\"Baby\\" is one of her favorite words, and the (human) babies at the beginning and end of the book give lots of opportunities to use it.

I tried to install MS Picture it 99 only to find that it wouldn't install with all the XP updates etc. This is what I find discouraging about Microsoft products, just when you get used to a piece of software's interface, they change everything and remove other key features.

It has a condescending tone, constantly comparing a car's engine to the kitchen. I found the assumption that all women must have a good understanding of the kitchen at best frustrating, since am no cook, and at worst, degrading. The author implies that male mechanics are hulking brutes, and that they intentionally invent words just to confuse us, like \\"viscosity\\" to describe the thickness of oil. The first time I encountered this word was in geology class, while studying the variety of lava flows. While the book does contain a good deal of useful information for car owners, it is delivered in such a manner as to make any intelligent woman wince, and I'm surprised the author's male colleagues aren't complaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last order","review":"First and last order with this vendor... the standard shipping rate was 35% of my total!!! ...and the shipping was SLOW.

I was very excited, then ultimately let down by their recent \\"comeback\\". The new singer Steve Augeri is a 2nd rate Steve Perry clone. In an effort to cash in on past glories, Journey has taken the easy path by recruiting an almost exact replica to replace Perry. Had they found a new singer with a distinctive voice to expore new territory, this might have been a more interesting reincarnation of a once great band. Augeri's limitations become startlingly clear with the blatant use of prerecorded vocals used to augment his limited ability to mimic Perry's sound. The musical performances are lackluster and the true genius of this band, Neal Schon, is never given an opportunity to shine that he deserves. Very dissapointing to this fan of 25+ years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey has ARRIVED!!!","review":"If you want to see the way that rock and roll was really meant to be played, you have to watch the Journey DVD, Arrival 2001! This DVD captures the excitement you feel at Journey's live concerts beautifully. Steve Augeri was born to be in this band! His vocals were amazing! Neals Schon's guitar was electric, his fingers hit each note with such passion and precision, it is as if his guitar was on fire! Jonathan Cain really rocks out on the keyboard like nothing I've ever seen! Ross Valory plays the bass guitar better than anybody out there! Deen Castronovo is an amimal - a maniac on the drums!

The Journey 'Street Team', as they call themselves - discredit everything that Steve Perry has done, and totally WORSHIP Steve Augeri...The new singer on this DVD, Steve Augeri - former singer of Tall Stories, and the subpar Tyketto - can't seem to hit the notes that 'The Voice' can.And although the NEW songs aren't neccesarily 'bad', they can't recapture the magic that was once JOURNEY.So please look at these reviews with a skeptic eye. These are biased, Steve Augeri puppets....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see - hear DVD","review":"Journey has always been one of the most underated bands around...nothing has changed, they don't get promoted properly and most casual fans don't realize they are still around.

I hope that thecurrent band members will continue to make great musicfor many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want MORE Journey DVDs!","review":"Finally! A DVD comes out for those who have waited in vain for it. As Neal Schon said, changes has always been crucial to the band's success. After all, without Steve Perry, Journey would not have charted mainstream. There is NO Steve Perry in this DVD. But Steve Augeri proves he can carry Journey just as well with his oddly similar voice. Augeri sang even better when I saw Journey at San Francisco's Warfield, 1999. It's a new chapter for these five guys. All my favorite hits to sing along to.Cmon! Don't you remember when you held your sweetheart tightly in your arms at your high school dance, listening to \\"Faithfully\\".

You can tell the author really does his homework and actually walked the trails on Molokai as well as the streets of Waikiki. I got caught up in the story and carried the book around with me to doctor's appointments, lunch, shopping, etc. in case I had a few minutes to read while waiting. The surfing detective, Kai, is a complex character who uses surfing as a means of relaxation and meditation while working on a case. I can relate to him as I grew up in Hawaii as a local haole and can switch on \\"da kine pidgin\\" when I need to. I am looking forward to reading more of the Surfing Detective books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Activities","review":"Activities that teach has worked very well for us.

The members have enjoyed working through the activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Activities That Teach is filled with great ideas","review":"This book is filled with great activities. I've only had the book a few days but the activities appear to be practical and easy to administer. Although the activities' required props are not elaborate most of them do seem to require some preparation, mainly to get the props together. One feature especially helpful is the list of questions included with each activity. Each activity also tells the estimated time for the activity. Most of them require between 10 - 30 minutes plus discussion time. The only reason this book did not get a 5 star rating is because of the number of props required. Each activity needs only a few props but they don't seem to be reused in other activities. Nevertheless, I was so impressed with these activities that I went ahead and ordered his second book of activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASuperset of Clash of Wings","review":"Here Col.

However, when they threaten to call off his sister's (Malik) wedding, unless he finds himself a nice Indian girl, he hires an escort, Sue, to pose as his fianc��e. From there I leave you to the movie. The simple use of music and satire to make this redundant tale capture your attention and your laughter is un-surprising in the supreme skill of the director's ability to portray the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for my SUV","review":"Didn't work on my seats.

I have read through the Bible at least 32 times cover to cover -- and I mean gneeologies and all. I began the practice that many years ago with the purpose of getting a more balanced view of what the Bible has to say to us. As a rule I read a different translation and usually with the purpose of researching a specific subject. I realize that as a layman I would approach a look at a new edition of the Bible with a different view than a Bible scholar. However, I was greatly impressed with the readability, the footnotes and the overall quality of such a reasonably priced volume. I have paid much, much more for leather bound high quality editions that were, bottom line, not comparable.I would not be at all surprised to see this edition in time become more popular than the NIV, NKJ, or NRVS and many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first part, second part disappoints in long term","review":"Following the traditional pattern of a requiem, the firt part of this contemporary requiem is the most thrilling and exciting part of the album. Preisner perfectly knows how to build up the tension towards the end. The vocal parts are very strong, here and there the orchestra sometimes sounds a bit shaky. The second part is interesting to listen to, but wears off very rapidly. Serves fine as film music or back ground music if you can't be bothered to listen carefully, but does by no means live up to the expectations raised by the first part. My four-star rating is based on the first part only. Preisner should not have bothered about the second part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully beautiful","review":"The music I love is the music that makes you FEEL SOMETHING.

It will not repair gouges or huge scratches you can see across the room. It is designed so that it takes very little plastic off the surface in order to allow multiple repairs to the disk. It is slow because it has to run over the CD scratch many times to polish the scratch out. Also you don't have to polish the entire CD back and forth just the badly scratched parts. When used per the directions it makes skipping CD's play smoothly again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"I used this product to fix some games for my childs Playstation 2 i used it hoping it would make it better so i followed the instructions finished gave it to my son and he put in the disc and it read disc read error this product made my arm sore and to top it off it didn't work"},{"rating":"2","title":"A diamond in the rough","review":"At first I thought I had bought a crap kung fu film,however,if you look past the TV soap style picture and sound quality,there lies a really cool kung fu film with a great story and excellent fight scenes masterly crafted by genius Yuen Woo Ping.In fact the film is actually an edited version of the TV series with the same name.I strongly recommend this title to hardcore kung fu film fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit well","review":"It's kind of adjustable and because I sew (a little) I think I can actually make this work for me.

His style is really vastly different from any other trumpeter's I've heard; his tonguing is often explosive, and his vibrato (he uses it rarely) is slow and long. His volume is powerful. While I think his playing is ill-suited the the Italian baroque, he does capture the imperialist grandeur of the Empire in his playing. The highlight of the album is Arne's Rule Britannia. Edmund Barham's strong tenor is a good match for Wallace, and they cut throught the at-times cumbersome chorus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok... nothing special","review":"This book needs color pictures.

However, I feel the book expects reader to know important and advanced fundamentals of lasers which it does not go through in the book and may prove disadvantage to both advanced and beginner researchers interested in semiconductor lasers. The book includes many complex equations but they are, in my opinion, not explicitly explained in the text. In addition, what I found most disappointing about the book is that there were no examples to demonstrate gain calculations on any material (like GaAs-AlGaAs etc), which would really help in modeling a quantum well structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My best reads....!","review":"This book uses so much imagery its hard not to see the story in your head while reading it.

It's also really fun to watch the creative juices flow in the behind the scenes look for the videos of \\"Drive\\" and \\"Stellar.\\" This is definately a best buy for an Incubus fan, and a maybe for someone that enjoys this type of music.

Go read something by Homi Babha or Judith Butler, sweethearts, and come back and tell me Verdery uses too much jargon!)I found the particular cases--particularly the one on Inochentie Micu--a remarkable window into understanding why the postcommunist transition hasn't worked out according to the blueprints of neoliberal planners. It says a remarkable amount about the hopes, fears, and passions of people in the region, none of which are taken into account by those who seek to apply bloodless ideal-typical models to a region with an often bloody history."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor","review":"it is a real pitty that the amazon editors didn't choose to publish the whole of Bickerton's review -- there we would, for example, see that Bickerton actually hopes \\"for a sequel\\" in order to have the book actually says something one could appreciate. this title certainly doesn't do justice to Verdery's otherwise excellent academic record. it is written in haste, with a complete lack of attention and needed careful reading of details. at the end we get an impression that she is making fun of other people's misery. it was obviously a too difficult task for her aims: the analysis is highly superficial, as if she aspired more to amuse than really teach. but dead bodies is something I find difficult to laugh about, no matter how pathetic the circumstances of their manipulations are."},{"rating":"2","title":"great intro to fela","review":"this was the first album i ever heard by fela kuti and i was immediately impressed by it. the best descrption i can give likens fela's music to that of bob marley's political message with the driving funkiness of james brown's 70s bands added to fela's own african styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unknown Soldier: My Favorite Fela Song","review":"Keep in mind, I am a hard-core Fela fan.

I think songs like Gentleman or Lady are better if you've never heard Fela before. Remember to start slow and work your way up.Unknown Soldier is a song that goes beyond anything you can imagine. It is 31 minutes long, and super-dope. I don't know what to say, it's like describing the Grand Canyon to someone who's never seen a picture of it. They walk away with a vague understanding, but no idea of its true powers.Just curious if anyone else does this....I never turn a Fela song off once it has started. It has to play itself out.

If there was only one book to buy to learn Mathematica this should be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written intro to the Mathematica product","review":"This book is a good high-level introduction to Mathematica's major built-in capabilities. If you read this book you'll get a good idea of what Mathematica can do without much programming. Of course you can write programs in Mathematica, too, but this book only gives a brief discussion of that. This book also doesn't go into the rigorous details of Mathematica's evaluation mechanism (term rewriting). This book is certainly not a very thorough reference for writing computer algebra algorithms in Mathematica. Luckily, there are other books out there to round out your Mathematica knowledge, if you need them: look for the books by Trott, Shifrin, and Mangano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful resource guide, but a little out of date.","review":"An excellent book, but written for Mathematica 6. The latest version of Mathematica is version 8, and there are some differences. For example, the way that histograms are plotted in Mathematica 8 is very different from how histograms are plotted in Mathematica 6. Mathematica 6 required frequency data for its histograms. Mathematica 8 requires raw data for its histograms. Of course most of the other commands have remained the same or at least very similar. The Mathematica Navigator is an excellent book, although I think the section on probability and statistics could be longer and more in-depth. It's a great book, and I give it four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic Orginally Published in 1919","review":"Be careful to make sure that this book is what you want.

A high school girl's tears allow Fat Albert and the gang to jump out of the TV and into the Real World to \\"help her with her problem\\". Stuck in the 70s into which they were written, they aren't familar with the modern world of cell phones and laptops, and to the girl's embarrassment, they employ their simplistic TV sitcom ways to try to help her, like going up to kids and telling them that she doesn't have any friends, so they should be friends with her.The gang knows that they are cartoon characters come to life, and they begin to enjoy being out of the TV, only to discover that they need to get back in. It's a clever, cute story, great to watch with kids, and with no swearing, sexuality or other objectionable materials. And, of course, there's a good message."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is wrong with you people the movie is bad!","review":"I know that everyone is sayin that this movie is great but in my opinion it's really not.

And this deserved to be as funny but Joel Zwick just didn't nail it this time and this does deserve something The Nicest Most Shiniest Golden Razzie Award so if you like the show maybe you should skip this one. But if you want a film that will be known as what is a plan old movie with actors and actresses maybe you will like it and I would predict about the gross to be like 51 million or something like that.

I cannot for the life of me understand why it isn't on the usual lists for classic works, as on par with the very best of them. The novel describes the personal growth and observations of one man in England between WWI and WWII, a soldier-come-schoolteacher with a deep sense of honor and compassion.

It is a book along the lines of \`Good-bye, Mr. Chips.' This book was used as the basis of a PBS Masterpiece Theater production with the same title--which I watched with much interest.This book is the story of a shell-shocked World War I veteran, who begins to teach history after the war. The story covers his life's ups and downs from World War I to World War II at a rural British boarding school. This book is the author's best by far, and I have read all his books over the years--the local librarians got tired of trying to locate his books for me.Despite this book being fictional, the book is an excellent example of one average man's service to his follow man and society. Individual service to society is something we all can benefit from personally and for society's greater good, and we should strive for this goal daily.This is another book one can read over and over again, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Mark Albert (Review of To Serve Them All My Days)","review":"This is one of my favorite books, too.

The prose style is a mixture of Camus' \\"The Stranger\\", Hesse's \\"Siddartha\\", and Graham Greene's \\"A Burnt-Out Case\\". There is a hard-boiled aspect that reminds the reader of Graham Greene's best \\"entertainments\\" and a philosophical strand similar to the French existentialists. Mix in a little Sufist wisdom and Egyptian scenery, and you've got a rather interesting literary mixture.I advise any fan of world literature to give it a try. It's short and fast-paced, so the time investment will only be a day or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very dry read","review":"In The Thief and the Dogs; Naguib Mahfouz explores some of the disappointments in the failure of the revolution to bring real change. His characters live in a world rich in emotional and political colour. Anyone can identify with their dilemmas, their passions and their frustrations. The Thief and the Dogs deals with the experience of Said Mahran, a burglar and smalltime political activist who goes to jail before the revolution in 1952 and emerges four years later to find the world he used to know has completely changed. Both in personal and political terms Said feels betrayed: his wife has married his old sidekick Ilish, and his former political mentor Ra'uf has given up his student radicalism for a comfortable job with a newspaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A one-time revolutionary who cannot adjust the new era.","review":"This is the story of a man who had stolen for the Revolution.

Rather than paintings or drawings of clothing from their own time periods, it consists of redrawings in a Victorian style, thus distorting the historic lines.It might be useful to theatrical costumers, Victorian recreationists or those interested in the history of costume interpretation or illustration. But it does not give accurate representations of the garments illustrated, so if you want to make historical garments, get books with pictures that are actually from the time periods of the clothing you're interested in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 19th Century view of the history of fashion","review":"This book is valuable in it's position as a 19th Century-written book on the history of fashion.

It tries to shock you and sets up with scenes or necophilia etc but they are just laughably bad and campy. There is no plot, except to string up these boring and idiotic attempts at shock.

Its good to love your wife but this man takes it a few steps to far. He preserved her body cause he just couldent say goodbye. Its kind of sad in a way.

I had always believed she was a prostitute who gave it up and followed Jesus teachings for the rest of her life. Upon further study I find there is no Biblical proof that she was a woman of ill repute and I learned that the vatican had changed their teaching about that.This book gives a very interesting account of Mary Magdelene drawing from the Bible, the Gnostic writngs, and tradition. She is called the 13th apostle and some sources seem to indicate that she was closer to Jesus than the disciples. The book contains prayers to Mary Magdalene and devotions and ways to venerate her as a saint.I am interested in early church history and books that did not make it into the Bible. The Gospel of Mary, is one of these books.

The book, like Marshall himself, overstated the legal battle for civil rights and downplayed the efforts of leaders like Martin Luther King. The crusade was fought outside the courts as well.

The film is set in Japan on the eve of Pearl Harbor. Cagney is a Newspaper editor who uncovers Japan's secret war plans. What follows is an atmospheric cloak and dagger thriller with a climatic showdown. The film has a B movie flavor, but Cagney's star power, the fast-paced setting, and the exotic, atmospheric locale make this 4 star fun.The premise for \\"The Great Guy\\" may not sound to promising -- Cagney is an ex-prize fighter now busting cheapskates and chilsers as the deputy of the Bureau of Weights and Measures. But Cagney is a kinetic bundle of energy, capable of making even this pedestrian material entertaining.

His descriptions of events, some real and some postulated, provide a very real image of the events as they occurred. My only fault with the presentation was I would have liked more details on the actual search and rescue teams.

It's not a criticism to say I wanted to know more: why did Gibbo sue the man who saved his life, and why did Beaver commit suicide years after surviving 29 hours on a flimsy life raft? The author did a brilliant job of bringing everyone to life on these pages, making me care what happened to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gripping read!!!","review":"I read The Proving Ground in one night ... I just couldn't put it down. And I didn't mind that I was exhausted from lack of sleep the next day because I so enjoyed the read. Bruce Knecht not only has written a detailed account of the horrific experiences of the yachtsmen on three boats in the Sydney-Hobart race, but he has captured what it was like for the sailors to endure the ordeal ... the fear, the heroic sacrifices, the physical endurance, and the struggle over having to make decisions that could result in fatal errors (which some did).As an experienced ocean sailor, I can say that Mr. Knecht has done an excellent job of portraying life at sea on a racing boat, without getting overly technical. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a gripping adventure story with characters who are both heroic and flawed, and for the men who died, are also all too real."},{"rating":"2","title":"WALTER CRONKITE IS RIGHT!","review":"This is the best book on sailing ever written. But it's so much more. The story is so griping that I read it in one evening. What the author does best is geve you a great sense of why in the world anyone would do something as insane as enter this race. Its as much a human interest story as a sailing epic- Incredible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough Riders","review":"An excellent, gripping account of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart. G. Bruce Knecht takes readers out into the salt, wind, and waves, and recounts the race from the perspective of several yachts, all of which were damaged or sunk. The author extensively interviewed a number of people including Larry Ellison, the world's second-richest man, who swore off the Australian race afterward, and became involved in the America's Cup instead. Mr. Knecht's book is for sea-salts and landlubbers alike, explaining nautical terms, yacht design, and the big money involved, while also telling an age-old tale of man versus ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"A good look at how devasting the ocean can be even if you are an experienced sailor. It's also an entertaining look at how rich boys like Larry Ellison hold up under life threatening situations. And I love his comment, \\"This isn't how racing is supposed to be!\\" You get what you get out there, Larry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factual yet engrossing","review":"Weather forecasting and yacht racing have an unfortunate collide in this account of an Australian yacht race. I find these sorts of books to be fascinating.As an outsider to the tragedy I thought the author did a good job of telling all sides of the story, conveying the information in a factual and non-confrontational manner. He managed to tell what happened without unjustly accusing anyone. I found this to be a good book.I also enjoyed the section where he talked about the implications for future weather forecasting."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping story...","review":"The Proving Ground tells the story of the 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race which takes place every year in Australia. In 1998 a ferocious storm crippled many of the over 100 yachts entered in the race. This story is a gripping account culled from interviews with the sailors. The cast of characters ranges from Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle to Beaver a 19 year old sailing in his first Hobart. This race would change all their lives forever. It is a gripping, harrowing account of nature's fury versus man's quest for greatness. As always man is no match for nature and in their struggle to survive mammoth waves pounding their yachts. This is a moving story expertly told by G. Bruce Knecht."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know what it is, but I like it!","review":"Usually classified under \\"ska\\", like many original and excellent groups, African Head Charge in reality defies classification.Not really African, certainly not ska.

The china is not thin, the color is beautiful, and very shiny. They are packed extremely well. The only complaint I have is that there are places on the pieces that are rough as though the shiny finish was skipped. When running your hand around the edge of a saucer, for example, you feel a rough spot as though there was a chip. There are not many spots like this on my set, but worth mentioning if you are very particular. Even taking this in to account, I am very happy with my purchase.

If you have never seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch the original. There was no chemistry between any of the actors in this newer version, so it was hard to be pulled into the emotion of this tragic story. The original ripped me to shreds when I watched it years ago, but this version does not give justice to the true story.

The first movie was a great movie as well,but I do believe this is better. I understand that many people will felt differently. But when you look at the 2001 version it's just plain better. Overall. Acting, effects, the story-line. The 1971 version, well was 70s. They did the best they could with what they had. But this version concentrates more on the friendship of the two athletes as well as the family that the Chicago Bears has provided to it's players since it's beginnings in the 1920's. Pfeifer and Maher's performances are wonderful! Coach Halas was played excellently too! As a HUGE Chicago Bears fan and Chicago Bears history buff, I'd have to say this movie was almost perfect.Oh and have your tissues ready for almost this whole movie because it's sadder than the first. Granted the stories are the same, but they focus more on the illness and not the race issue.

Eventually had problems with discs not ejecting, unit freezing up etc. I thought it was the unit I had and I'm very careful with my equipment, cleaning them as needed inside and out, storing them carefully etc. No easy fixes so like a lot of folks just had to throw this one away! I've never had any similar problems with any of the Sony equipment I've owned, but I guess every company can produce a lemon, and by reading the reviews looks like most of them were.

Frankly, it's kind of a bummer. The dust cup does not seal well and dust flies everywhere when I remove it to dump it. The hose frequently unseats itself from the suction tube, usually when it's least expected. My over all opinion is that it's cheaply built. Yes, it has great suction when it doesn't come apart. I've gone through several vacuums (bagged and bagless) since my trusty old Eureka Boss bagged upright finally bit the dust (pun intended). I've leaned there's no such thing as a dust-free bagless vacuum, at any price, because the user still has to empty the dust cup and there's easy way to do that without re-circulating dust. So, I'm back to a bagged Hoover Windtunnel that's much lighter weight than a Eureka Boss. Yes, I bought it from Amazon. I'll review it after several uses.

A couple months later the motor became so loud that you have to wear earplugs while using it. It still runs, but is louder than a freight train. The filters were regularly cleaned after each use, and it hasn't been too heavily used... Very disappointed, and now in the market fora new vaccum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't suck so this item really sucks!","review":"I have owned vacuums that cost less that worked better. I do not have plush carpeting and it could not even clean something so basic. It worked okay for a while but after a short time, it seemed to lose any suction. It sort of moves things around but absorbs nothing. It's also incredibly messy when you clean it.

Swallow tape worms? If you find these ideas appealing then by all means, read this book. If you have EVER even considered the idea of starving yourself or bingeing and purging, then do not read this miserably, sickening, twisted, self-defeating book. Written by a bunch of sick women who are self-proclaimed gossipers, diet junkies, and bitter at the world, this book revolted me.

It makes a small disclaimer in the beginning about not using the book if you are a teenager or have an eating disorder. My guess is, if you follow much of the advice in this book, you will end up with an eating disorder. There are a lot of suggestions that are potentially dangerous to your health, and don't offer almost any of the risk factors involved. Of course it is meant for a mature adult to read, and decide for themself, but there are many other books out there that have much better ideas about getting skinny. By the way I have many friends who have healthy, lean, and strong bodies who simply eat healthfully and work out a couple times a week.

If, on the other hand, you DO want to be happy, read \\"Intuitive Eating\\" (look it up here).

Now here is the warning, the unit should have been able to handle this setup. The result was in the middle of pumping the air cylinder exploded sending plastic shards in all directions and left me hard of hearing for a few (think pipe bomb). It is amazing that nobody was hurt as we found pieces 15 ft away and we still have not found all the pieces.

The height that the rocket reaches is impressive. I've only tried the lowest pressure discs -with these the rocket reaches somewhere in the vicinity of 300 or more feet.

They commented that this is relatively trouble free (and has a good performance) compared to the rocket engines which require igniters.

The set of 4 and the completer set, however, are MADE IN COLOMBIA. The color is more saturated, the salad dishes are about 2 inches smaller than those made in England, the \\"bowls\\" are cereal bowls, and the vegetable bowl and platter are both smaller and less detailed than those made in England.

To be fair, he fits some of the songs and even sounds strong on \\"Chosen Ones\\". But, there are several spots where he straines to hit notes he is not capable of, sounds out of tune in other places, and ends one song sounding like a tone deaf first day loser on american idol. You will know which one I am refering to when you here it. All of this is relevant because I just heard that this Guitar player, Magnus Karlsson, is teaming up with Tony Harnell in the new band Starbreaker! Due out March 21st.

The statute of limitations was about to run out and he was told to read the file and act like he was the arresting officer)and deception. We had a diet of this for 18 months and all of us agreed that these guys can't be trusted. This book bears that out and brought back a ton of memories.

This book provides the reader with the idea that there is life after death and that we have choices in this life that will affect us forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I purchased the cable because I heard that the video using component cable is better than S video.

Amelie is living in a world that is totally unreal it has been specifically targeted towards audience. Although the movie is set in 90's it gives an impression that we are seeing 50's world and tradition there. The plot is too thin. The lead character Amelie certainly doesn't know what she wants in life. So one can hardly call it an inspiring movie. The lead character sneaks into others room in the name of doing good, counts orgasms, hooks up shamelessly two people only to see them part later. It defies logic. On the other hand Lagaan is movie making at its best. It is an epic. It has struck a beautiful balance between plot development and character development where as in Amelie there is no plot to develop. Amelie can at best be called a good comedy movie. Certainly it is not oscar worthy. No Man's Land is better than Amelie."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not buy again","review":"The sender sent the product quickly.

It's pure drama.The DVD quality is also commendable. It's very impressive to squeeze 4 hrs of essentially artifact free anamorphic video and crisp DD 5.1 audio into one single disc.

It gives you some highlights of Indian Movie making with great scenery, dancing and music. But the storyline, is even for Bollywood movies standard, incredible weak. The second part of the movie shows a cricket match where all Indians cooperate to beat the evil British Empire (in a cricket match!)...it's boring, totally unbelievable, not funny, patriotic and therefore a waste of time.If you want to have your first time good bollywood experience, try movies like: \\"Bombay\\" or \\"Monsoon Wedding\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, and pretty racist","review":"It's a beautiful film, and if you like Bollywood musicals this one has some wonderful choreography. The story is absurd, and probably shouldn't be taken any more seriously than a Gilbert & Sullivan operetta, but even so its version of the Raj is utterly skewed. More importantly, the portrayal of the British \\"baddies\\", especially Cpt. Russell, plays on every racist stereotype of an Anglo-Saxon \\"whitey\\" (to use the subtitle's term) ever divised.

This one misses many opportunities to teach Spanish--there are whole songs done only in English, not to mention some rather strange and drippy information about Spain, Columbus etc. Even on an imaginary tour of Spain one learns mostly obscure words--for instance the Spanish word for creme brulee. I'm sure your 7 year old need to know that one! On the other hand FUN SPANISH is a complete joy, and teaches MUCH of this same material plus a whole lot more. I just don't think there's any comparison between the two.

An American boy Bobby only speaks English and his Spanish friend Maria only speaks Spanish. They both speak a lot and sing however, it is seamless. My kids have learned so much, but the important thing is that they ask for it all the time - making for lots of repetition.They just love the mysterious Senora Magica. A lady with \\" magic powers\\" who whisks them off to Mexico. BTW, the music is an important plus - the songs review a lot of vocab and are very catchy.The pronunciation is authentic and clear. Spanish is spoken with many different pronunciations, all over the world. This pronunciation is typically Latin American. It is important for learners to hear all pronunciations, in order to develop a good ear. We have all of Beth Manners' CDs and they are all phenomenal. We also like the coloring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful cd but not necessarily the most common Spanish pronunciation","review":"We love this cd and will probably purchase the other Manners Spanish disc, but I do struggle with the fact that this is not the Spanish that the other kids around here speak.

Other than that aspect, it's by far the best kids Spanish cd we've owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids' favorite","review":"My children are learning Spanish so I bought them this CD .

NOT CRUSHED ICE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No crush on this crusher","review":"This ice crusher does a good enough job if you like ice chunks that are smaller than a pea. The ice melts very fast in your drink but keeps it quite cold for a short time. The hopper is not nearly large enough which makes the processing of ice for just a few drinks a long process. Sometimes the blades get jammed inside of the grinder, necessitating unplugging the unit and fishing around in the difficult to access hopper with a utensil to dislodge the ice which is jammed. I recommend a manual ice chopper for the right sized crushed ice with very little fuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for its price..","review":"I bought this for my mother and she had a manuel crank ice crusher earlier.

I'll be taking this back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I like chopped ice for slushie type drinks and this machine chops them to the perfect size. That's the good news. The bad news is this machine is very loud, only takes one cube at a time and now it's making a grinding metal to metal noise and I'm sure I will be throwing it out soon. This unit is about 2-3 months old. There are way better choices than this one. -UPDATE- It finally broke. I lost the receipt and thought I would try another. It worked for a a couple weeks and the exact same thing happened! The same grinding noise and then complete failure. This has to be a known problem with these.

In addition, you have to hold the machine down to keep it from jumping all over the place.Slow, crappy, wouldn't even use it for snow cones. I returned mine for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"Maybe it's the ice my refrigerator makes (you know, the typical rectangular domed shaped), but all the ice would do was jump around in the machine and not crush. I tried putting fewer cubes it, did not work. Then I tried putting a lot of cubes in, still didn't work. So, for the first time ever, I returned something to Amazon. The unit is also much smaller than I thought it was. The book said it would crush about 14 oz of ice per minute. I get much faster results from my blender. I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap","review":"got it out of the box... put in ice cubes, and turned it on and it wouldn't crush it. I tried 2 different type of ice cubes and wouldn't crush them. So boxed it up and sent it back.

Know what I mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the noise.","review":"It only crushes one (!) ice cube at a time, which seems pretty foolish. Perhaps if you're patient you'll eventually have enough crushed ice, but I found the design too frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice crusher","review":"Works really well. Handles only small amount of ice at one time and is quite loud when operating but for the money is a great bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst electrical appliance I ever bought","review":"I bought this to replace a manual ice crusher, and it is absolutely terrible. It gets jammed, it's slower than the manual, it has a tiny capacity, it is slow. P.U. I recommend ANYTHING else, like holding the ice cube in your hand and whacking it with a spoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you're looking for an Ice Crusher that doesn't crush ice","review":"I bought one of these for a party I was having - figuring that way I'd always have plenty of crushed ice for my mint juleps.It worked really well at first, ice cubes went in, crushed ice came out, well, as long as you only put 1 or 2 cubes in at a time. More than 3 ice cubes? Forget it, it would jam and you'd have to unplug it, unjam it and try again.So then, as the party wore on, mind you, the thing was not running constantly, it refused to crush the ice even if you put just 1 ice cube in there.In short - Total piece of junk and you're better off with a bag of ice from the grocery store and a sledge hammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"Did not work as advertised. Filled compartment 3/4 with 6 ice cubes and turned it on. It made 2 little ice chips and jammed. With experimentation I determined that it would crush 2 cubes at a time. It took forever to make a glass of crushed ice. Crushed ice size was also very fine, OK for frozen drinks but not high balls."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed!","review":"From other reviews, I was expecting the Deni ice crusher to be fantastic!

Great product for the money. Works better than expected. Use it every day. Easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I hardly ever write reviews but I was so disappointed I had to say something. First time I tried this product it took 5-10 to crush the ice. Once it started it was fine. The next day I turned it on and it just sat there. Never crushed any ice and then it started smoking. This product will be returned asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"If you load more than a couple of ice cubes, the crusher locks up.

Just got hot and water leaked out. I wouldn't recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great!","review":"I love crushed ice so after not having crushed ice in my fridge door (just cubes) I was determined to find an inexpensive unit to give me my crushed ice. Well I am loving this great little machine! It's so nice to have all the crushed ice I want when I want it. Very easy to use & the ice is crushed so nice, small & uniform...no big chunks. This is awesome & let me tell you, I've been enjoying a lot of crushed ice since buying this. My husband & son are liking it too. Now my best friend says she's gonna get one too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one cube at at time","review":"I really like this except it only allows me to feed one cube or one small scoop of mini cubes at at time.

Sure it looks cute on the counter but It jams if you put more than one ice cube in it and it's noisy too. I'm going to get one of those retro ones with a hand crank. They do a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and too fine","review":"This product will only handle a few cubes of ice at a time at best and is fairly slow. It is not a heavy duty unit at all.If you want fine crushed ice that's what you get. I somehow was under the impression that the chunks would be a little larger.I prefer small chunks myself and this unit will not do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Crowd Pleaser!","review":"Don't understand how a company can make such a useless item as this so called ice crusher. It is laughable as the machine can only handle just one cube at a time. It takes forever and the ice is pulverized not merely crushed! We looked at the reviews and it sounded good. We only wanted it for two martinis not a crowd. Sent back immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"I was so excited to receive the ice crusher but after I read the instructions and put it together, it did not work. The blades would not move at all to crush the ice. The ice sat in the chamber and was starting to melt. I re-read the instructions and saw that I did everything right. Still did not work. I packaged it up and mailed it back to the manufacturer and I hope that I get one that works this time. I was extremely disappointed because this was, I thought, a new machine. I am hoping to get a replacement soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Don't buy this item!!!!It takes F-O-R-E-V-E-R to crush the ice, and it can't crush more than one cube at a time. This item sucks, just get the Warring ice crusher for like 20 more bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"My 9 year-old daughter was so excited to give this to me for Christmas. I also received the tiny cube ice trays and bucket, so I waited until I had enough ice for all three of us to have crushed ice before I took it out of the box. It hums. That is all. I put the tiny cubes in and it hums then later the ice melts and pours out. Nothing more. So disappointing for my daughter!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream Come True!","review":"I have always wanted an ice crusher for my fresh brewed ice tea and now my new found martini recipes. Well this is one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon!Yes, people complained about one ice cube at a time, that is not the case.I have an ice maker and can put two to three cubes at a time and it crushes a large glass full within a minute! It makes perfect crushed ice and it's not loud like trying to use a blender.I HIGHLY recommend this product for those of you considering the purchase!Happy Summer drinking :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending it back!!","review":"I was ecstatic to receive this as a birthday present but was utterly disappointed! Yes, it does crush ice, but the short-comings of the appliance far outweigh its crushing performance. The trap door system of inserting ice cubes allows ice to shoot back out at you if you are not quick enough. Crushed ice gets stuck inside and continues to drip out 10 minutes after crushing.The worst part was that I was finding little pieces of metal in the ice and the water smelled like metal--not safe or healthy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised","review":"The product crushes ice as stated, but they recommend only to crush 1 ice cube at a time. Can you imagine how long it takes to crush enough ice for 1 drink? By the time all the ice is crushed, most of what was already crushed has melted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ergonomic nightmare","review":"This does chop up ice into sizes I want.However:You put a single ice cube in the machine. They suggest using the door lever so you can insert the ice. It immediately explodes during chopping. Apparently, you are supposed to, with lightning agility, replace a cap over the chute for the top of the unit.Then you repeat this procedure.Do not, under any circumstances, put a cube in with your face over the chute...you may end up with an injury.Just my observation. It works...but beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deni 6100 Automatic Ice Crusher","review":"The problem with this product is that it will only crush one ice cube at a time, which information is not in the description. Needless to say it isn't good for making drinks in volume. Also, it has to be shut off before inserting each ice cube. A child should definitely not operate this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last three months!!","review":"At first I was happy with this purchase, and used it three or four times a day. Today, it made a terrible noise, and black plastic appeared in my ice. It is broken, and I truly did think it would work longer than three months!!! I won't buy another of these products, will instead buy another product that looks more like a blender and has several blades especially designed for ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after only 4 months","review":"I bought this for my mother, who loves eating crushed ice. It worked great for approximately 4 months and then the motor locked up and it stopped working.

This little ice crusher does exactly what she wants -- turns a couple of ice cubes into a glass of ice chips quickly, easily, and simply. It has a small footprint and a very simple interface: drop the cube in and turn it on. And it does it without a massive cost too.

It is a wonderful film.It is a very well acted bittersweet romance which connects on many levels without too much melodrama.Without giving too much of the plot away it is a story of girl meets boy, girl loses boy and hires anew boy to find the old boy.

Only the last review had 1-star rating, and the author explained that Oneida changed the formulation of the steel from \\"18/10\\" to \\"18/0\\". The difference is that 18/10 steel is more expensive and truly stainless, while 18/0 is cheaper, and rusts.

Think of this as a more expensive edition of \\"Jackass,\\" the MTV show where idiotic guys do dangerous activities for laughs and thrills. It is difficult for me to be at all sympathetic about two men who engage in a mindlessly, very dangerous and irrational activity such as mountain climbing. When one of the characters breaks his leg and fears that he will die, my only response was, \\"what did you expect?\\" Two idiots playing russian roulette with a loaded gun would have been just as uninvolving as this movie was. I nominate these two jerks for the annual Darwin awards - the awards given out to people whose stupid activities and choices eliminate their DNA from the gene pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood and blubber","review":"I just figured it wasn't my kind of hardcore movie and continued on with my meager, uneventful existence. But on top of that, we get to celebrate two antisocial outcasts and their meticulous, hard-scrabbled methods for filling up a waste of time. Ever heard of an airport bathroom? It's an obvious fitness-minded, modern allegory about two men plagued by demons of buggery. By which I don't mean the practice of driving a buggy. What's kind of icky is that the ambiguous duo go back and recreate their carnal dark night of the soul and get teary-eyed and shaky.

It makes Hollywood's actioners pale in comparison. I would like the film even if I knew nothing about climbing; as a climber, it is an incredible true journey into our deepest fears. The DVD I have has additional features about the making of the movie and the return of the men to their mountain; the honest look at the long-term impacts of this event is worth the price of the whole DVD. As a Christian, it was heart-rending to hear Joe disavow any spiritual faith, even after living through such a harrowing ordeal. But he told what he felt . . . for me, I'm glad I know the Rock when I'm climbing on rocks. Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching the Void","review":"Based on Simpson's bestselling book, this harrowing, suspenseful docudrama recreates the events of Yates and Simpson's fateful, arduous climb, sparing nothing in the traumatic details: exposure to the elements, violent snowstorms, and an icy 150-foot crevasse Yates unwittingly pitched his crippled mate into--then abandoned, believing him dead. That Simpson, the narrator, survived is a miracle in itself, but hearing his jarring account of the escape couldn't be more engrossing.

Seeing the actual terrain in which the story took place made it even more spectacular and amazing. In one scene Joe (the real Joe did this scene) is filmed from far off zigzagging his way along the glacier by sitting backwards and pushing himself with his good leg, that scene alone made me realize just how big this mountain is and how hard it was for Joe to get down. Read the book first, it is a very quick read and it is well worth it, then see the film, I promise you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Climber","review":"This documentary was very exciting and held your interest throughout most of the film. I did find myself continuing to wonder who was filming the journey, so one has to get that thought out of their mind and realize that it is a film.

Put yourself into the shoes of a climber, who must decide whether to stick by his injured partner and sacrifice both his and his partners life, or . . . cut the rope and save his own life. A decision that would haunt you the rest of your life. But, wait, the injured partner, through sheer will to survive, drags himself from the depths of a glacier and back into camp . . . and then goes on in life never blaming his partner for making that decision.

The story itself is incredible- a man's exemplifying the human will to survive. The events surrounding his ordeal are equally as incredible. The director does a great job of reenacting the climbers' successes and accident, as well as the ensuing harrowing trek. Initially in the video it was a bit challenging to determine who was who (who was Simon & who was Joe), but that was the only slight trip up. It truly is an inspiring documentary, and solidifies the idea that it's better to make a bad decision now than a good decision too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching the Void touches the soul...","review":"A heart-pounding, non-stop adventure full of action that shows us how amazing the human body and will to survive really is.

I also thought the DVD would show the paper mache pumpkins on the cover, which is the reason I bought it, but there was nothing about the paper mache pumpkins.The quality of the video is not particularly impressive, but the host was good and the projects were interesting. If this was a pilot, it would have made an interesting show. But this small pilot does not merit the price of a full-length DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jorma Lite At Best","review":"For what it's worth, the album is just average at best. Pete is like a really weak version of his brother Jorma on a bad day. It's ok, but I'd much rather hear Hoppkorv or any of Hot Tuna's mid 70s stuff ANYDAY. Or Jorma's 70s solo material.Funny how Peter never recorded another solo album after this one, at least on any kind of major label. Sure says alot about his (lack of) talent. Riding on his brother's legend and little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jorma Kaukonen in a bad day","review":"There is just one good song on this album: the song \\"THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION\\", the others are just an ugly copy of Jimi Hendrix stile of playing, and the voice sucks like the hell.This album is not a very good one: Peter Kaukonen is known just because of his brother Jorma, not because of is talent.He has no style, no rithm feel and his guitar sound is always dirty, both electric and acoustic."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A BOOTLEG, DO NOT BUY!!","review":"This is a bootleg!! Do not buy from this person. They are selling illegal recordings. If you want to buy this item the only way to buy it legitimately is from the artist himself.

I thought all I really cared about was to put an end to the yellow rust stains, but it's far less frustrating to use the old iron with a mister bottle alongside, than it is to steam with this one.It simply does not get hot enough to iron cotton quilting cottons and handkerchiefs, and it also takes far too long to get up to its max temperature.I would forgive the fact that the steam holes are huge and catch on everything, and the fact that it's needlessly heavy, if only it actually ironed.

When I came across this relatively expensive set of books in junior high school, I ran home and did every chore in the world in my entire neighborhood for three straight days --and added up the dimes and quarters people would give me until I had enough to buy these two volumes. They have been with me ever since. For the first time, I understood what all those words were that I couldn't find in a dictionary, with illustrations and explanations. Even more amazing, I learned that Sherlock Holmes was a real person -- or at least, the editors of these books believed so! The product of a great generation of Holmes fanatics, this collection is full of the arguments over what each story means, what has been included by Dr. Watson, and what must have been left out to protect the innocent. The one truly indispensable volume for Holmes fans, \\"The Annotated Sherlock Holmes\\" is an unadulterated joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YESSS!","review":"Awesome is the only word I can think of to describe this particular collection--there is all the novels and stories with amplifing info on particular items in the story/novel you are reading listed on the sides of the pages, ala footnotes (sidenotes?)--and the supplementary info is staggering, with bios of Doyle, Holmes, Watson AND Moriarty, the history of Holmes on stage, screen and in print, 221B Baker Street info, etc.--these sections take up at LEAST the front 3rd or 4th of the 1st volume alone! If you are a Holmes fan, you MUST find and buy this collection ASAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sequel!","review":"This book was just as exciting and touching as the first book, The House on Honeysuckle Lane.

That said, this misbegotten saga of a Jewish teenager trying to crash show biz (think That Girl with bat mitzvahs) is a semi-forgotten Cheese Fest of the highest order, a real treat for bad-movie buffs who've grown weary of Jackie Susann and Ross Hunter movies. See Natalie Wood spew \\"You rotten tramp!\\" to two-timing Gene Kelly. See miscast Gene acting his toupee off during a hissy fit with some Broadway producers. And see wise-cracking Carolyn Jones waltz off with the whole show in the inexplicable role of Marjorie's slutty galpal, a knockout who's somehow unable to hook anyone better than Jesse White (The Maytag Repairman). Vintage Brie gone horribly, odiforously, delectably wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Dated","review":"Although the performers are competent and pleasing, this film is seriously dated. Wouk's novel was powerful for its honest portrayal of its Jewish milieu, something the film does not understand or appreciate. The ending is particularly dated and trivial. Wouk's narrative should have been followed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marjorie Morningstink","review":"As a huge fan of the novel and of Natalie Wood, I had high expectations for the film. Natalie Wood is believable as the plucky young Marjorie; however, the woeful miscasting of Gene Kelly destroys any hopes of making this film even passably enjoyable. Herman Wouks' Noel Airman is in his late twenties, irresistibly sexy and crushingly sardonic. Using the bloated, aging Kelly in this role makes the viewer question Marjorie's intelligence and objectives. The supposedly geeky Wally Wronken is obviously more attractive than Kelly, who plays Noel not as a frustrated ne'er-do-well, but as an embittered man far past his prime. Further miscasting of the pert Carolyn Jones as slovenly Marsha only hastens the downward spiral."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Electric Gel/Lotion warmer","review":"In the month that I have had this lotion/gel warmer used for massage therapy, it does what it purports to do very well...warms massage oils and lotions to a pleasant temperature for clients.

I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I got this to be able to put on warm lotion out of the shower (Midwest winters are cold!!). The bottles weren't that warm, even if I left it running for awhile. Also, I really just needed one bottle but the single model was more expensive. I returned this and there was no hassle at all, so I admire the way they handled it. For home use, just get a sturdy microwave-safe bottle, fill it with fav lotion, microwave for a few seconds and apply :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is mostly English","review":"I purchased this CD on the basis of the positive reviews but after hearing it I am really unsure how it got any. I suppose this CD would be fine if you were primarily interested in something to keep the kids' attention on car rides and considered the French words a bonus. My kids did enjoy listening a few times. However, if you are actually hoping your kids will learn the French language, I doubt this will help. Many of the words are spoken with loud background music which obscures pronunciation. Further, instead of the Three Bears story actually being told in French (or fully bilingually), the story is told in English and only nouns or broken phrases are translated. I believe this CD uses a very dated model of language acquisition and the attempt to make it entertaining for kids makes it even poor at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorts are good, but threads started to open after second use","review":"Shorts are very good.

Something personal and profound. A strong testimony of life after life on earth. This book was random and gave little details or specifics of experiences. The meaning behind the experiences was lost as the person who wrote about them didn't actually experience anything himself. There was no emotional connection, nothing that draws you into the story.

Then they were challenged to go to to southwest China where the amazing outpouring of God's SpirVisions Beyond The Veilit took place. In 1949 when the Communists forced their removal from China they moved to Formosa where Mr. Baker ministered until he went on to be with the Lord in 1971.

However, for the last 100+ pages the author deviates from the Reiki system entirely and discuss topics that have no relationship to the system of Reiki. He talks about his attunements (initiations) which are unrecognizable, how the symbols the students receive are made up to fit the particular student's personality/being, that spiraling your hands down the body is how to do a Reiki treatment, etc. (And it gets worse and worse.) I was shocked to even find a book like this with the name Reiki on the front cover! :( I have read about 35 Reiki books and have been a practicing Reiki Teacher for almost 3 years now. I recommend Traditional Reiki For Our Times by Amy Rowland and any of Frank Arjava Petter's books on Reiki.

I am a Reiki teacher in several branches of Reiki, but I've never seen some of the practices the author describes as \\"Reiki\\" in this book. Since he and his teacher also studied in India, perhaps it's a hybrid of Reiki and something else.Originally I bought the book to study the marma points, but upon further study, I see the ones illustrated in the book are not accurate, either.So, for me, the book was a dud.

The video is widescreen anamorphic (1.78:1 or 1.85:1) and the audio is PCM stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1. As for the picture and audio quality, both are quite fantastic. The use of discrete surround is frequent and effective. I was fortunate to see the shows live in Baltimore and Virginia last year, and Roger's enthusiasm and energy is captured very well by this video production. I'm very anxious to hear the SACD version of this concert as well, if ... ever manages to get it in stock! :-)No matter which side of the Pink Floyd (Roger vs. Dave) you fall, you will definitely enjoy this DVD. You will be particularly pleased with the guitar playing of Doyle Bramhall II and Snowy White.

Although my favorite Floyd album is Wish You Were Here, my favorite song on this DVD is \\"Dogs\\" off the Animals album - simply amazing. For you lead guitar enthusiasts, Roger has two of the finest I have ever watched. Any Floyd fan would consider this a key component in their collection.

The sound is terrific, the video is terrifc, and there are some choice selections, like \\"Dogs\\" off Animals. Roger seems at ease as a frontman, and the assembled musicians are good.

You can't realize how fast time passes with Jacky on the rocks beside you. STANLEY KUBRICK's contribution to 'Perfect Sense' has made the song awesome.

I doubt there is another music DVD on the planet that compares to this colossal tour-de-force. Zeps recent one, and Rush in Rio are excellent, and worthy runner-up's, but In the Flesh is so far out there that it's within the grasp of Syd Barrett himself - Shine on you crazy diamond.p.s. this DVD is the antithesis to the \\"Say No to Drugs\\" campaign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waters or Gilmour?","review":"Roger demonstrates his ability to put on a full blown arena rock concert. Unabashed showmanship is his forte and this DVD captures that very well. Excellent sound and video. This is completely opposite of his former bandmate David Gilmour's DVD David Gilmour-In Concert where David puts on an intimate and very musical show. Any yet, it's not Pink Floyd. How could it be? While Roger's band is skilled and puts on a great show, the vocals and guitar of Doyle Bramhall II don't contain the same smooth eloquence of Gilmour. In the same manner, Roger's voice is sorely missed on Gilmour's rendition of Comfortably Numb. Both Waters' and Gilmour's DVD's remind us old Pink Floyd fans (I was there in '73 for Dark Side of the Moon) that it's over, but we can remember how it was thanks to these two exeptional recordings. Buy them both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now it makes perfect sense","review":"If you got the CD, you missed out. The music is half the point. Roger Waters was never that much of a musician, but is a master writer and virtually invented the concept album. Here he has a killer band, who stand out more now that we can get a clear idea as to who is doing what, and has found the apt way to visualise his songs - such as \\"Perfect Sense,\\" wherein the voice of Marv Albert sports-casts a nuclear war. While Roger's acting is wooden, he puts a genuine feel into his songs that nonetheless comes through quite well. Only picking point is the visuals for his excellent concluding song (hear it nowhere else) \\"Each Small Candle\\" come off too much as a push for Amnesty International, unintentionally dimishing the song's deep message.

And this has turned out to be the best music DVD I have in my collection. All the Floyd songs are faithfully played by this excellent line-up. It is a huge yet understated production, and the lighting and visuals fit the music to a T. Sound and picture quality are excellent. The performances are flawless from beginning to end. The guitar work is first-rate as is everything else. This is a definite must-have for any music lover, Floyd fan or not. You will be astounded! Classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"pomp and no circumstance.","review":"I wonder if it's ever occurred to Roger Waters that for all of his carping about how the concert milieu has diminished the performer's ability to communicate directly with the audience, he plays right into that stereotype of \\"big, bigger, biggest\\" and has since THE WALL. What is so freaking \\"direct\\" about all of this stage puffery on display in this video? What, Rog, too scared to find out that if you stripped all of it away, people would find out you had nothing to say?On it's own terms, IN THE FLESH LIVE makes for a decent enough rock concert spectacle, but, please Roger, spare me the sanctimonious garbonzo about audiences being \\"amused to death.\\" Want to communicate directly? How about showing up with just a guitar and see what happens? Until that time, welcome to the machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great memories, disappointing DVD","review":"I saw Waters on both the 1999 and 2000 leg of his U.S. tour. Somehow, on this DVD, he has managed to drain all the joy, excitement, and exhiliaration from his live performances. What remains is a strangely sterile parody of what I saw. Even the camera shots are badly chosen.There is also a choppy, boring documentary on this DVD, which gave me no new insight into Waters or his band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has the Pink Floyd sound gone ?","review":"I'm a all time Pink Floyd fan. I own a dozen of their albums and I was at the unforgettable 1978 concert in Paris.I was so excited to buy this DVD after all the great ratings I read about it.Sure it's a nice selection of titles, the image is good and the sound quality is technically superb! But that's all. :(Where has the Pink Floyd sound gone ? Where is the magic? Where is the emotion? The arrangement is terrible. Take \\"Shine On Your Crazy Diamond\\" for example. The voice misses completely the desperation it has on the Wish You Were Here album, the 3 background choir girls are good looking for sure and probably talented, but gosh, they have nothing to do here, it's a sabotage.How dare you play PINK FLOYD like SOUL music ? Appaling. I could not stand it and switched to the \\"real\\" albums.If your are a real Pink Floyd fan, you'd better listen to it before spending your money in this mascarade. The Pink Floyd touch is definitely not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was AT the concert and regretted it.","review":"A floyd fan since the 80s and a follower of the solo carreers to a lesser extent since about the mid 90s, when the opportunity came up to see Roger Waters in concert, I jumped at the opportunity.It had its moments, but as a show, it left much to be desired. After doing a couple old Wall tunes, he closed with his Amnesty International dedication. Fans were incredibly disappointed that the progression of tunes they were used to from Floyd albumms and shows was not followed. It was a TERRIBLE closing tune and everyone knew it. Before it was even over, roughly half the seats in the MGM Grand stadium were emptied. It was SAD. The fact that no encore followed only drove home what I'd heard all along (from fans as well as from Roger's interviews) that he didn't really have much respect for fans.Hold your money. With a little luck, they'll all get over this childish garbage and do a Wall reunion. Until then, I'm not supporting this garbage any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"I really can't believe people think this is better than Pulse! The sound quality is good, but the back up singers are too high in the mix (very distracting, and the camera man seems to be infatuated with them). An electric guitar starting Wish You Were Here?!? David Gilmour, where are you when we need you? Given the fact that these are some of my favorite songs....this DVD was uninspiring. The only good thing about this DVD is getting to hear Roger Water's voice again. Hate to say it but Guy Pratt's (on Pulse) bass playing is far superior to Roger's in every aspect. Same goes for all of the other musicians. Release Pulse on DVD and we won't have to settle for .... imitations anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Good Lesson For Any Musician...Terrible DVD...","review":"This is a very sad DVD, because Roger Waters was once a musical genious and his downfall does not make any less of his previous accomplishments. The only reason i gave this DVD a 2 instead of a 1 is because its worth seeing to learn a very valuable lesson, but the actual performance is sickeningly aweful. Roger Waters has really lost his mind, he considers himself to be some kind of untouchable GOD in this DVD, he is more of a Las Vegas Seigfried & Roy theatrical performance, than a musician, just like every other gutless pop hit in todays music industry. If you cant pick this up from the intro and the performance itself (i love his hair flick ever time he hits an important note, lol) then check out the behind the scenes feature, which is more of an \\"undercover with a corrupted musician\\" and you will see what i mean. Its actually rather sad and disgusting, but a very valuable lesson for any quality musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you only own 1","review":"I SAW THIS CONCERT 3 TIMES IN HIS TOUR.

The Hamiltonian Centralizers purposely provided us with a document that would destroy true Federalism (decentralization) and exalt the notion of a highly centralized form of Republican tyranny. The \\"Anti-Federalists\\" were the TRUE Federalists, and the \\"Federalists\\" were actually anti-federalists when the meaning of such is taken in its proper context.Boston T. Party deflates the wet dreams of the Parchment Worshippers. The Constitution actually went through numerous re-writings so as to pave the way for later interpretations that would grant ultimate power to a Central Machine. The Articles of Confederation should have been left to stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow a Traitor.","review":"Man those tyrants were really smart making up this Constitution,I mean look how much power it has given them. PEOPLE, TYRANNY ALWAYS GROWS IN ANY GOVERNMENT. THE FOUNDING FATHERS KNEW THAT THE CONSTITUTION WOULD ONLY DELAY THE GROWTH OF TYRANNY.

He made certain it gave the illusion of giving the power to the individual states while, in fact, it was worded to allow the centralized government to gain all the power. The Bill of Rights slowed the process down but not for long.There is little I can add to the other reviews except to say no one could have held the Constitution in higher esteem than I. The book shredded my faith in the Constitution by showing the historical facts and logically explaining how a careful reading proves the intent of the Constitution was to provide for strong centralized government.Hamilton made certain that the Constitution could not enforce itself and that there was no provision whereby the people could enforce the Constitution. The power to enforce any dispute went to the centralized government."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias book with little substance","review":"This book was presented on the back cover, in the introduction and in the reviews as a book for both males and females in regards to their relationship. I call B.S.!What the book is - a book written by a woman about women in relationships. I read through this book looking for insight into relationships and all I could pull from it was that relationships are one sided. The book presents relationships as 'controlled' by a man and what the book proposes is that the woman should take back 'control.' Relationships should not be controlled by one or the other. In fact relationships work best when the people involved work together and not try to 'control' it.If the author reads this, I hope next time she re-writes this and includes a mans to co-author the book, so his opinion can be included in each topic discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Point of View","review":"This book looks at relationships and sexual intimacy in terms of power and power relationships. Most of the follow up was somewhat technical and mechanical, and less helpful than understanding brain chemistry reactions would have been. However, the early chapter allusions (almost a priori in their nature) to the basis of relationships was useful however elliptical since I have not previously understood that sexual relationships function in that manner for some people."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ex made me get this. Lol","review":"He thought our intimacy problem was \\"my\\" problem or rather fault and would not shut up about this book. Turns out being in an abusive relationship was my problem. In reflection, his knowledge about this book and its author should have told me that it may be highly plausible that he may have bullied other girls into making them think the \\"problem\\" was theirs and not his or a shared problem, just a thought! Funny, the common denominator was him.Ok, so I didn't read the book. It may deserve 5 stars (or may not). Ill never read this book. Ill only remember why I bought it and being bullied to buy it WAS NOT COOL!!! Being constantly told that I \\"alone\\" was the cause of the problem and bullied to purchase and read this book has helped me put myself in a place where I will NEVER EVER need this book! So maybe I should give it 5 stars cause now I eliminated being in a terrible relationship.I'm over it I swear.

I would recommend it for someone looking for the accuracy of the NASB, but readability of the NIV.This particular book is basically a paperback Bible with an imitation leather cover. The pages are made of the same paper as paperback books. This is the only paperback Bible I've ever seen with red-lettering. Just like other paperback Bibles, there is no book marker.This would be a great Bible for a new Christian, for a confirmation or Sunday School gift, for a \\"first\\" Bible, for handing out to evangelize, or to just check out the HCSB translation (like what I'm doing with it). It isn't as nice as more expensive Bibles, however, considering that it only costs $5, it is a very nice Bible for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth checking out!","review":"First, it goes without saying this is an excellent value. It provides a great opportunity to check out this new translation.The HCSB is one of only two new translations that I like (the other being the ESV). The only thing I don't like is its tendency to be a little too conversational at times.On the other hand, the translators seem to place a high priority on accuracy (my one problem with the NIV, at times).Bottom line: get a copy of the ESV and a copy of the HCSB and you'll have two great alternatives to the NIV (for those times when you want a change of pace)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skrowaczewski's Bruckner Symphony #1 Is Very Good","review":"Without much fanfare, Arte Nova has produced an excellent Bruckner Symphonic series with Stanislaw Skrowaczewski at the podium. With Symphony #1 the piece is underrated, Skrowaczewski's conducting is excellent, as is the Saarbrucken RSO's playing, and the recorded sound is good, if at slightly too low a level.

Not very practical.Just now, I found out in a couple of reviews below this one that pictures can actually be downloaded at http://www.web-linked.com/PhotoLightingTech/uk/index.htmlI downloaded one image. Such poor resolution and tiny size with a huge water mark right across it. I could never practice on this type of image.So, first no mention of images download or CD anywhere in the book. Second, if by chance or a miracle, you manage to find them, they are unusable.

They flow so easily from big rocking numbers like 'Paint the Town Red' to slower ballads that still pack a punch. A definite highlight of the album would have to be 'Now Is The Time' a song of encouragement and call to action that sums up nicely the overall theme of the album. I highly reccommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute worship","review":"This is a totally new experience with Delirious as the band continues to create new music for praise and worship. This album filled with songs of all kinds, spreading love of God. \\"Stronger\\" and songs like \\"All This Time\\", \\"Miracle Maker\\", \\"Our God Reigns\\" and \\"I'll See You\\" are brand new feelings that gives u a soothing yet strong feeling. It gives a pleasant feeling unable to describe, just like the words of God. Besides that, songs that really rock your heart will be \\"Now is The Time\\", \\"Solid Rock\\" and \\"Paint The Town Red\\". \\"Now is The Time\\" guest written by Matt Redman and also cello solo by Gerard Le-Feuvre in \\"Our God Reigns\\". Totally worth buying CD! You'll just love it just as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delirious? simpily wonderful!","review":"Great!

I also enjoyed several of the hits that were hits outside of my region. I'm especially happy to have the Castells, Sunny & the Sunglows, the original Donnie Brooks and Keith Colley.

A lot of it is the same footage played over and over, same with the music. The sound quality is HORRIBLE, not to mention that a lot of the sound was recorded seperately and doesn't even match up to the moving mouths of the (dare I say?) actors. I think Bruce La Bruce might have been shooting at an \\"artsy-fartsy, foreign\\" type feel with this film, along with the B & W thing, but fell WAY short. The skinhead stays mute for about the first half, where he basically takes a very stupid & LONG bath, then dances around badly in only his boots, flailing his arms around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Purely stupid film. I rented it, so I FORCED myself to finish watching it, hoping something, ANYTHING would develop. The thing ended as stupidly as possible and made no sense whatsoever.

The close-focusing ability with the \\"macro\\" switch is very handy and a joy to anyone who likes flower close-ups. The bokeh on this thing is buttery-smooth, and it's pretty sharp up to about 185mm, the shortest setting you can have with the macro function on (beyond that, sharpness drops off).

I've only had it 2 weeks and found out that it will REFUSE to record some shows because the software has some way of knowing that the transmitter wants copyright protection.

The support and drivers to manage the MMC portion (TV, etc.) is awful. When you send in ticket requests ATI, now owned by AMD, sends back canned replies with links which don't work. In addition, you have to keep reopening the case to get someone to provide you assistance. At this point, the card that I have can only be used for its basic capabilities of being a video card. The TV with PVR capability is useless if you are using it with Windows XP SP2.

The author has done a terrific job of portraying her characters, and making the reader feel their emotions. I applaud her and hope to see more books by her in the future, but I will not buy any more books from this publisher. While the story is marvelous, the book itself is appalling. There are numerous typographical errors in it. A ways into the book, the font changes. There is even one place where a very large section of text is repeated in the midst of a sentence on another page. These seem like errors that could have been caught simply by reading the manuscript. The publisher should be ashamed for letting something this poorly edited go out its door. Even though the story is very entertaining, the book is certainly not worth the price paid for it because of the poor quality. 5 stars for the story, -4 stars for the book quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just marvellous!","review":"This is my first reading of Miller series and I simply find this story irresistable.

This is one of the best buy books I truly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Like someone else mentioned on here, it's like a hetero romance, but with two women. I basically skipped all the love scenes because they were making me gag. (And the \\"I love you\\" bit during those scenes was so repetitive that I was getting pretty annoyed.) Also, I couldn't help but look at Rose as something of a Mary Sue. She was way too perfect and conveniently everything Ronnie wanted in a woman. It took forever to get anywhere, and the plot was really hard to believe. No one acts all lovingly towards a stranger unless there's something wrong with them. If I were Rose, I'd be a little freaked out that this woman who appeared out of nowhere was treating me like some potential love interest or like we'd known each other for years.Seriously, unless you want to read some cheesy, soap opera-like romance (with \\"strong hands\\" and tears galore) in a book filled to the brim with typos, stay far away from \\"Accidental Love.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"Take two characters from completely different lifestyles and throw them together, they fall in love and it's rocky but they have a happy ending, that's how you get a Romance novel. Take two characters from completely different lifestyles, a car, an accident, guilt, one big secret (or lie, which ever way you see it.) add in family issues and then they fall in love, you get Accidental Love. It stood out from a lot of the other romances that i've read, mainly because Veronica Cartright wasn't the knight in shining armour as Rose Grayson thought, there was more depth to it than just wanting to get each others clothes off. Every time they seemed to get closer to each I kept asking myself, but what about the accident? And I did feel that it took a long time for Rose to find out the truth and only a short time for her to forgive Ronnie but it still worked and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Now that I've recently upgraded to Blu-ray, with their slightly slimmer case size, I would expect to fit a few more than the advertised count of DVD's per stand.

The title is a givaway to start with even if you didn't guess the plot line after that. The rest is so similar to a bad soap opera: this one slept with that one's husband and then the other had that one's baby and then one of them shot the other to protect the family secret...and on and on.

Spoilers","review":"CD/abridged/Romantic Suspense: I have listened to several Coben book, and liked them. This is Coben first book reissued and I don't understand how he was ever published after this one. This book has too many problems. The biggest problem being that Mark starts to play for the Celtics after David's death. Really? By the first disc, I knew the two were going to be brother and sister, only not be be siblings and able to reunite by the end of the book. I even guessed the murderer. Then disc four, the wrap up was a mess. The whole abortion thing was not only really gross, but mostly a stupid plot device. I won't go into the gross details, but it was completely unbelievable.Skip it, skip it, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Coben Page-turning Novel.","review":"I listened to this one on audio and found myself looking for excuses to be in the car so that I could listen to yet another chapter!

I liked it more than \\"Caught\\" and I thought that was excellent! I didn't figure out \\"who dunnit\\" until the last 20 pages!My only criticism is that Hamilton, NY, is NOT Northern New York...it is considered \\"Upstate NY\\". Northern NY, Mr. Corben, is north of Watertown and Warrensburg!!I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good suspense novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is dead","review":"I always read an entire book no matter how bad it is. Reading this book was a real chore. The story could have been told in no more than 20 pages. It just goes and on discussing trival details that the read could care less about. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Wanting it to end and it just goes on and on and on","review":"I've read a few Harlan Coben books. Harlan Coben is a fabulous writer. This is not even close to a fabulous book. It's tedious, its characters are unbelievable, and I should have stopped reading after reading the author's apology preface. I just wanted it to end and it went on and on and on.There's lots of good Coben books. Don't chose this one to read because this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"First of all let me start by saying I am a huge Harlan Coben fan. I picked up this book for the simple reason I hadn't yet read it. A quarter of the way through, I was wondering if I was the only one who thought the book was so horrible. I found one review who referenced the author's own disclaimer in the front. Mr. Coben actually says if this is the first book of his you're going to read, put it back and try another. In other words even he knows it sucks. But hey, he's making money off it right? One of the few books I put down and walked away from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I didn't find the book satisfying at all. It rambled on and on. It really felt more like a romance novel than Coben's standard fare. The \\"plot twists\\" seemed more like random oddities than a thoughtful process. If this was the first book that I had ever read of Coben's, I would never read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want My Money Back!!!","review":"Mr Coben should have insisted to his publisher that PLAY DEAD continue to play dead. I managed to read 30% of this book before removing it (permanently) from my Kindle. The plot is amateurish to say the least with the usual totally predictable characters. As a soap this story might succeed with \\"little old ladies\\" on afternoon TV.Quite a few reviewers have outlined the plot/characters so I will not. The only reason for this review is to add my one-star which might save some of you a few dollars and hours better used reading almost anything else.Shame on you Harlen. Why put a disclaimer in the book....I already bought it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlan Coben phones one in","review":"Terrible book by one of my favorite authors. Read the \\"Author's Note\\" at the front of the book and pay heed. He basically says it sucks. I read the \\"Author's Note\\" after buying it and thought \\"what an odd intro, hopefully he is just being hard on himself\\", but no, it really blows. Why did this get republished? My only thought is Cha-ching. I can understand and excuse learning on the job, but republishing something you know to be amateurish and making it look like a new book is inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"This is really one of the most disappointing books I've ever bought. I've have been reading Harlan Coben books for about ten years. I love the Myron Bolitar series, they are fun adventures. I've read all of Coben's more recent books as well. I find that his plots unvariably stretch credulity but the stories are fast-paced, fun reads. So when I saw this new title I purchased it. It wasn't until I got the book home that I read the inside apology page, telling readers that he wrote this in college and not only is it out-dated but filled with cliches. Coben flatters himself here. It is worse than filled with cliches, the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes out of a frat boy's fantasy. The plot is so convoluted that it is hard to follow. The dialogue is just plain silly. I can't tell you about the resolution because I did not finish it. I cannot imagine why Mr. Coben would publish this horrible piece of writing except to rip off his loyal following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists and Turns You Wouldn't Believe","review":"The first page of this author's book states that if you have never read a book by him before to put it down now. I can't imagine why he would say that because this book was a very good read. It was full of twists and turns and just when you think you totally figured it out, it changed course. I did figure some of it out but because of the way it was written, some of what I just knew to be true was not. I say if this book that Harlan Coben did not think worthy enough to read first was this good, I can't wait to purchase more from him and I will do just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Buy Coben Again","review":"Like so many of you, I grabbed this off the rack because I'm a Harlan Coben fan. Read about thirty pages, then checked the front to see when it was published, thinking this trash couldn't be something new. And I was right! Yahooooo, I spent money on a terrible book! Suckered again!Next ACTUALLY NEW Coben book: buy used! The one after that: buy used! It will take a while before I spend money on anyone who would pass off such a piece of junk as new. I really have no respect for Coben. Did he make money? Yep. Did he lose respect? Yep. Which was more valuable to you, Mr. Coben?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Train wreck...","review":"Sadly, since the book was on a \\"new in paperback\\" stack, I didn't look inside to see the disclaimer. If I had, this book would not have made the trip home. It is truly like watching a train wreck in slow motion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing","review":"I have read nearly all of Coben's books and have enjoyed all but this one. The disclaimer mentioned by other reviewers is not included in the Kindle version I bought, so I was surprised by this dreadful book. It seems to have been written for teenage girls, or whoever reads Gothic romances. Each time I resume reading it I wonder why I did so. I can't bring myself to finish it. If you're curious, borrow it from the library and save your money. Beginning authors, take heart! You can write a first novel this bad and still become a first-rate writer. Play Dead should never have been re-released."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever","review":"I like Coben's books with Myron Bolitar. They are clever, funny, engaging, and an easy read. THIS book is so bad, so horribly written, so nonsensical, that I am appalled. It has a plot that you can figure out in the first twenty pages and then assaults you with the tritest and most boring plot development -- it is unbearable. The characters are so unappealing that YOU will want to murder them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romantic suspense","review":"I am a fan of romantic suspense and I loved \\"Play Dead\\". This is now my favorite Coben book. It is a powerful story of love, family, addiction, friendship and demonstrates the best and the worst in people. This book could have been written by either a man or a woman, as it is gender nuetral.I believe most of the negative reviewers are probably fans of Coben's macho writing style demonstrated in his \\"Myron Bolitar\\" books. As a woman when I read one of these I felt I was intruding in a male locker room. I prefer Coben's stand-alone books.\\"Play Dead\\" was full of Coben's usual twists. I could not wait to get back to it daily and was disappointed when I read the last page and knew it will be months before I find another book I enjoy half as much.In summary, if your favorite Coben books are his \\"Bolitar\\" series this is probably not the book for you as it is too \\"touchy-feely\\".Happy Reading, whatever you decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely an old novel","review":"I love Harlan Coban novels. But I must say that I was sorely disappointed over Play Dead. The novel went on much too long and the constant reference to the female character's beauty got old fast. There's only so many times you can right about someone's beauty. I realize that this was either his first or one of his first novels so I shouldn't be so critical. I'm just glad I rented it from the library rather than purchasing the book. I'm still a HUGE fan of his and his current novels show how he's matured in his writing.... Harlan is an excellent author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play like you never read it...","review":"This book started badly and never got better; as someone wisely said, \\"There is no greater thief than a bad book.\\"I feel robbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coben Isn't Playing Dead!","review":"Coben once again is at the top of his game as he weaves an intense mystery that captures the reader right up to the final twist! The rich, enjoyable plot gives way to a decisive conlusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't drop it, read it!","review":"After read \\"The Woods\\" I read some recommendations about \\"Play Dead\\". I try the MP3 AudioBook and the Scott Brick narrative took me into the book. As the prologue says \\"If you have never read a Harlan Coben book before, drop it!\\". After this words I understood what it means. I agree with James N Simpson that some parts of the book is far fetched but the whole part is strongly acceptable. The characters is well detailed with strong personalities which paved the way to a well written history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Harlen Coben Really Write This?","review":"It was all I could do to finish this book. I think I skipped through half the pages just to finally get to the end. This was the worst book I have ever read and I love Harlan Coben books! I can hardly wait for each one to be released. What a disappointment and waste of money. I read after the fact this was a re-released book. The publisher should have thought better of putting it out in the public again. Thank goodness his writing has dramatically improved since this one. Please Harlan don't ever do this to your loyal fans again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheesy, dumb and predictable","review":"this was the cheesiest book I have read in a long time! This was also the first book written by Coben that I have decided to pick (the title sounded intriguing) and I think I am not going to pick this author again.At first we have this hot model who is also the smartest cookie in the world. Her fiancee is also a HOT model who happens to be the best basketball star in the world. Then there is the model's best friend who is the politically correct African American lady who ALSO happens to be a model......and the list of Coben's stupid ideas goes on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this and read any of Harlan Coben's other books","review":"I'm a huge fan of Coben's, but this book is a stinker. I understand it was his first book; apparently he was still honing his skill. Play Dead is implausible, way too drawn-out, and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars","review":"Absolutely one of the worst books I have ever read. Coben proves himself an incredibly lazy writer. Instead of trying to bang out as many books as possible, he should concentrate on writing a creative, thoughtful product. Completely implausible and contrived. So angry with myself for wasting the time reading this. Will positively never read another of his books. I resent the fact that someone of this caliber is published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written and convoluted","review":"First I will state for what ever record, I am a huge Harlan Coben fan. However this book is easily his worst book to date. Harlan does us all a service by putting in a preface that this book is not a new issue but a reissue of previous work. I am sure that his publishers loved that, but it is obvious that his publisher tried to slide one by Harlan Coben's fans by reissuing this book and pretending that it was something new.As for the book itself, the plot is far too long, the characters are not his typical sympathetic and believable people caught in extraordinary circumstances. I can see some of the characteristics which Coben uses in later books to become so great and easy to read but in this book it falls very flat. As a Harlan Coben fan I would suggest you save both your time and money and read his later books. He gets much better after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great read","review":"The author says this is his first book and from reading it, he was not kidding. I found the characters to be superficial and predictable as was the whole story.The book is almost like a made for tv movie. A bit cheesy and predictable. Glad that's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"I usually quite enjoy Coben as a holiday read- but this is absolute drivel. Kind of Harlequin Romance meets teenage creative writing assignment. I couldn't even bear to finish it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book - fair warning, you'll never get back the time you spend on this nonsense","review":"Picked this up at an airport, I love Coben's Myron Bolitar series. What a mistake! Seems to be written for young adults: overblown suffering, gothic style, twists you can see a mile ahead, characters who are the best in their field or stunningly beautiful or both, even a redeemed rat. The main character is by turns meek and mild or strong and commanding, depending on plot requirements. A truly hot mess. Worth neither time nor money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must not be a mystery reader","review":"I got 12% into this book and gave myself permission to not read two mysteries within a year of each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Excellent book.

These arrived on time and as described. I was happy with our order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play Dead: Dead allege way","review":"This was a stupid book, at least three times a long as it justified being for such a simple plot. I'm sorry I wasted the time reading the whole book. Should have trashed it after 10 or so chapters. I was stupid to stick with it. Probably the worst book I've read this year, & I've read a lot. Based on this sample, I've read my last Coben."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"He does warn you it's his first story, fair enough (and kudos to him, other authors don't do this.) But couldn't he have edited it a little?It's all back story, description, telling (and telling and telling and telling.) We get it after the 1st repetition that his wife is drop dead beautiful. That they're both wonderful and perfect people w/o a flaw.Really, after the 1st hundred pages all we have is a man is missing under mysterious conditions. No action, no real plot, just lots of intrigue, more like a soap opera than thriller. Where's the mystery, the suspense, the thrill.Not sure if I'm going to finish. Already guessed the plot, and it's not pretty. Struggled with another 10 pages this morning . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I've read quite a few Harlan Coben books and this by far is my favorite. At the time of Coben's writing Play Dead (twenty years ago or so), I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it as much as I do now. It is rich in detail and the technology needed to pull off this type of storyline is current and refreshing. I can't say much more about the story without giving too much away, but the difference between this book and his later works (although great)is startling. I thought Play Dead is one of the best books I've read in a very long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a reason why this book is out of print.","review":"Wow. This book is really bad. I just had finished 2 recent books by Harlan Coben and figured I would read more of his work, starting with his first book Play Dead. I have no problem with a reasonable suspension of belief when it comes to enjoying a book but this is the most preposterous plot I have ever read. The main event that drives this whole story is so over the top ridiculous that it ruins the entire book. The rest of the plot is also based on an incredible number of coincidences. I almost gave this book 2 stars because there is a glimmer of the style that Coben has in his later work, but the ending was just so preposterous (and yet predictable!) I could not do it. I've noticed that, since Coben is now so popular, people are paying $30 for used copies of this book. I suggest you do what I did and borrow it from your library. Your joy at finding this rarity will only be exceeded by your joy in giving it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"What happened to Harlan after writing this one is for the better.

Love Harlan Coben's other books that I have read. This one should have stayed out of print. Characters don't feel real, plot twists make no sense (such as \\"Mark\\" trying out for the Celtics instead of some other team). Not worth your time unless you are an academic studying Coben's development as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the Author - Poorly Written","review":"I am a fan of Harlan Coben and was excited the other day when I saw Play Dead for sale. I assumed that it was one of his newer novels that I had somehow missed. I excitedly purchased the book and could not wait to dive in.I knew something was amiss when there was a note by the author on the first page saying: \\"Okay, if this is the first book of mine you're going to try, stop now. Return it.\\"I wish I had taken the advice and simply never have purchased it. I read the first 140 pages and stopped. Terrible writing, shallow characters and everyone has a (not too interesting) secret. The most beautiful super model in the world marries the NBA all-star who always wins every game on a last second shot. Really?I felt like I was reading a book by a 16-year old version of the Harlan Coben. Not fit to print or read.

The set of 4 and the completer set, however, are MADE IN COLOMBIA. The color is more saturated, the salad dishes are about 2 inches smaller than those made in England, the \\"bowls\\" are cereal bowls, and the vegetable bowl and platter are both smaller and less detailed than those made in England.

Thus, unfortunately it doesn't match the 45 piece dinnerware set (8 place settings) of the same design which I also ordered.Having said all that, it is still a very nice set.

It focuses on his youth and several of the mystical and magical experiences he encounters as he grows and develops in his knightly skills. The full-page illustrations are absolutely grand and will serve well to ignite youthful interest in these great sagas.

Its a reminder on how hard good music is to find theese days and what a reward it is when you do find that special album that stops time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Exceeded my expectations.

A mixture of meaning and rare humor, the end product is a classic. Terrance Hill is unequaled in his portrayal of a young, subtle, free-thinking natural gunman who cares about the legacy of his hero. The bond that builds between the two main characters is that of a dutch uncle who develops a genuine fondness for an unruly nephew. The story line, though a bit cryptic at first, is well worth the extra attention required to expose it. This is a MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it was funny and made me laugh out loud","review":"hill is so funny in this movie he makes you laugh just the way he looks at you with those big blue eyes it is a great satire on westerns and gun-slingers"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I don't get it.","review":"This movie was HORRIBLE! I can't believe Henry Fonda would reduce himself to that. I bought it for the New Mexico scenes (Mogollon, Acoma, and White Sands), but I had read the other reviews here and thought it might be good. Wow, what do I need to smoke before I watch it to make it bearable? It was not funny, it was stupid. The plot (if it had one) was impossible to follow. Fonda was good, but Terrence Hill was a total ham, complete corn. No wonder he never made any serious movies, HE CAN\\"T ACT!Unlike most of the others who have posted reviews, I would rate this as the WORST movie ever made (with the exception of Telephon, with Charles Bronson).The only funny part in the whole movie was the music part where they played \\"Ride of the Valkeries\\" on what sounded like automobile horns. But the movie itself WAS NOT FUNNY, nor was it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"My name would be \\"nobody\\" too if I had to be in this.....","review":"Several things came to mind while watching...a)scenery is great; if you've never been to Mogollon, make a trip. b) Henry Fonda was a great actor and must have been blackmailed by Sergio Leone to appear in this mess. c) Leone was no doubt popular with investors for recycling everything from costumes to music on each of his music. d) the video quality was too damned good, if you ask me. e) The word \\"Interminable\\" came to me several times. This is one of those movies better with the sound off. If you want a western, watch any of John Ford's, Ulzana's Raid, Butch Casidy and the Sundance Kid, or the Magnificent Seven. Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody !","review":"This is a hilarious movie. Not everybody likes what I like, but this is a classic comedy.

Deserves to be in any western film collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic that's often overlooked","review":"I am reviewing the movie as opposed to the dvd itself. Afterall, it is the movie that we buy the dvd, not all the extras. Now, the movie is really a classic shot with all the campiness of the time. Henry Fonda plays an aging gunfighter looking to get out from under his reputation. Trinity plays an up and coming gunfighter wanting the attention but also has a dream of seeing Henry Fonda single handeling taking on the Wild Bunch, a hundred of the toughest riding outlaws the west has ever seen. The whole movie builds to this moment as Trinity's character leads Henry Fonda into his taking on the Wild Bunch. I consider this one of the great moments in any Western. So if you like your Westerns with drama and a sense of humor, this movie is well worth the money to view."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did it end???","review":"I bought this video as a gift for my Trinity-lovin hubby. He enjoyed the whole movie right up until the very (end??) Whoever materminded the production of this particular video has alot to learn.

It is a thoughtful, interesting story, as many of his movies tell, and well acted, but not very well directed or filmed. His amateurish use of pans and zooms are distracting and the overly long scenes which do little to advance the story are often rather boring without conveying much of the suspense they are meant to suggest. I have often wondered as I watch his movies, if he has spent much time watching well made films, or merely cut his teeth on silent slapstick and just rushed out to make his own. They were popular I suppose, in an era when people were searching for something new, but his techniques have not aged well and are thankfully gone from more modern cinema. He came and went, and left his mark, but it wasn't a very high one. If you like Sergio Leone movies, you will probably love this one, just don't expect anything more than his usual offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phewwy!!

There may be some minor glitches I personally didn't see them though. The movie is more a continuation of the Trinity movies except no Bud Spencer, but Terence Hill is funny as always and what more can be said about Henry Fonda who is one of the greatest actors of his generation? I enjoyed it as much now or more than I did as a kid, there's no graphic violence, no blood that I could see really. I am not a western movie fan but this movie I love. There are the usual gunfights but nothing more to prevent a child from watching except the SOB words. Try it you'll like.

The film spoofs gunfighters, The WildBunch, and the cinamatic version of the old west in general.It all works pretty well.

Also, I called the manufacturer on the first day to tell them that the filling inside the cushion covers was making me itch. These are not cushions with a black cover.

I experienced a similar problem being described by other reviewers. After putting my knee on the bed, one of the wooden \\"flex\\" slats snapped.My futon mattress (also a year old) has inner coils and it's quite comfortable but it's outer edges don't seem to be holding their shape as well as I would like. If you're looking for comfort, I would buy the futon mattress separately. One of my previous futon mattresses had a 3 yr expected life span and after 3 years it had a huge hole in the middle (I may not have turned it as much a I should have).

One of the best features of the desk is that it is so easy to clean. And there is so much storage space for all of her art supplies. I do agree that the light could be a bit brighter, but with an overhead light on you really don't even need it.This is definitely one of the best things that we have ever bought her and even thought it will be two years that she has had it, it doesn't seem that she will be outgrowing it anytime soon.

It all seems so real. Could there really have been an Englishman who helped aristocrats escape out of Paris during the French Revolution? Each of the Scarlet Pimpernel's plans actually could have worked. Finding out the ingenious schemes the Scarlet Pimpernel used was my favorite part of the book. The plans the Scarlet Pimpernel used to get the aristocrats safely out of Paris included several disguises and even fake passports. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy short adventure stories. These stories include tricky English spies, determined French patriots, scared French aristocrats, and severe consequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond a classic!","review":"As I was browsing in a local bookstore for something new to read, I accidentally came over the Scarlet Pimpernel. At first, I had put the book down numerous of times, despite the price. Somehow at first, it did not appeal to me as much, even if the first page caught my eyes, but how I was wrong. It was amazingly written with an ardent array of mystery, romance, and suspense. It was everything that you expect from a book!The characters are just simply memorable and unforgettable. The book kept me up late at night, urging me to read till the last page. An unbelievable piece of work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful adventure","review":"How much readers enjoyed this 1905 adventure can be judged by the fact that Orzy wrote thirteen more books about the Scarlet Pimpernel from 1906-1936 and by the more than several films and TV shows made of her story. The well-known tale is about Paris during the French Revolution. The Scarlet Pimpernel hides his true English identity and outwits the ruthless tyrants of the French Revolution, men and women who are determined to bring the citizens of France freedom and a better life, even if it requires them to kill many citizens to obtain it. The book is filled with drama and frequently humorous dialogue, including:We seek him here, we seek him there,Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.Is he in heaven?

The first chapter is set around completely different characters than the rest of the book and doesnt seem to fit until the end of the book. Along with a very confusing second chapter where way to many different characters were introduced making it hard to follow their conversation.

You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, blah, blah, blah.Anyway. I am glad I read it, despite the title! It was a fun read, with lovely descriptions, interesting dialogue, and a fair plot.

Reading other translations' stuffy attempts at turning this beautiful play into boorishness and pompous moralizing really makes me wonder why Kaufmann's translation, for all its liberties with the text, has not become THE English version.Buy this book; but read it a few times before you judge it. You will find it makes far more sense and becomes far more powerful each time you peruse it."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the devilishly obsessed perhaps","review":"This is a classic, and you have to appreciate the classics in their own right. Be patient though because some is lost in translation. Faust was a strange man, to voluntarily make a pact with the devil, and this does not make the read any easier. Worth the read, to confirm that these ideas have happened before"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is mislabeled; it isn't Walter kaufmann's translation","review":"This hardcopy facsimile is not Kaufmann's. It is a mixup in labeling. I have compared it with a paperback version and this isn't the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goethe's Faust","review":"Good classic literature. Intense with human turmoil. Not recommended for a younger audience. Faust takes the internal conflict of deciding on right and wrong and turns it outward with the use of Mephisto. This shows what happens when you choose the worldly path as opposed to the honorable path. Our actions have consequences and not just for ourselves, but for those around us as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful translation","review":"This translation of Faust is great, and on the left side pages you can also see it in the original German! The second part is also abridged. For anyone new to Faust, this is a good book to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greatest Play Ever Writtten, so WHY DID HE CUT IT????","review":"I make no bones about it: \\"Faust\\" is the one drama that outdoes Shakespeare in scope, impact, the kind of complexity that makes one THINK about what one is reading (or viewing, on the rare occasions that the play is staged). So why the brutal abridgement by Kaufmann? \\"Faust\\" deserves a completely uncut translation, and if we're lucky enough, uncut staging. So much is missing in this version that it just becomes a mutilated torso. If you want really to experience this Mount Everest of dramas, learn German and read something like the Hamburger Ausgabe (Hamburg Edition). And if you're lucky, see it staged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good translation","review":"I thought the translation for this play was excellent. There is even a great introduction at the beginning. But I must point out that there were many typographical errors in the book and also a large portion of Part 2 was omitted. The play itself also was not so great. I did enjoy its humor, provided by Mephisto himself. It starts off very well but by the start of the second part, you lose yourself. Goethe even decided to change one of the characters names halfway through the first part (just for the heck of it!). The ending was also a bit disappointing. It seems like Goethe's skill began waning by the end of the first part (much like Conrad when he neared the end of Nostromo). But still since it's a classic, you probably should read it. Then again, some 'classics' are terrible and I hope should soon be forgotten (Dickens for one!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pace and story","review":"This book won't take very long to read, even for the slowest readers. It is fast pace, especially when you get into the rhythm of the poetry. The story is pretty good and has many great messages. My advice: just read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute catastrophe","review":"It is interesting that reviewers appear to be so critical of the translation, ignoring what Goethe himself did to the Faust legend. From the annoying homunculus to the exorbitant Walpurgis Night to the self-indulgent Gretchen 'Travesty,' this is a story that never should have been written, with parts that would have been useless to try to stage. Faust and Mephistopheles were used as tools in a story that Goethe wanted to tell, rather than him telling their story. It is an overwrought nightmare.The only reason I give it one star is that the site does not permit zero.Read Christopher Marlowe's version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A passable attempt","review":"While the translator deserves praise in his efforts of tackling a difficult work, the result is average at best. The excision of text, as has already been noted by other reviewers, is the biggest reason to avoid this translation, but I will admit that it is perhaps the most accessible and easily read translation available. For those with a serious interest in Goethe and Faust, I would recommend the Walter Arndt/Cyrus Hamlin critical edition from Norton. I believe that to be a much more accurate rendering of Goethe's exemplary work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaufmann's translation doesn't compromise Goethe's poetry","review":"Walter Kaufmann's magnificent translation of Goethe's \\"Faust\\" preserves the original poetic qualities of the classic play. He neither compromises the integrity of the work by using shallow 90's-words or mires it in unpleasant, unreadable \\"ye\\" and \\"thou\\"s. In my opinion, it is the best translation of \\"Faust\\" I have come across, and Kaufmann's commentary (being a native German himself) proves that he is an authority on both the idiomatic elements of the original work and the intent of Goethe's style. The only drawback to the book is that most of Part II is excluded; while Pt. II generally is considered to drag on ad nauseum by first-time readers, students of German romanticism miss rich imagery and lush allusions by receiving only a synopsis of the robust scenes of Pt. II. Otherwise, Kaufmann's work is unequaled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saffron Skies","review":"It was abridged and made absolutely no sense. It wasn't advertised as abridged.

I am not a fan of this technique.

The blurb on the back of the book talks about two half-sisters falling in love with the same guy. That didn't happen. Instead the book focused on Amber, Becky, Madeline, and Amber's family members.A lot happened in this book that was definitely out of the ordinary. It's not a light fluffy read, so be prepared for heavy material, some thought provoking, and some that may disgust you. I have to hand it to Lesley, she sure doesn't pull her punches.Now that I know somewhat to expect, I won't be so surprised the next time I pick up a book by Lesley Lokko."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop! You're embarrassing me!","review":"OK, I liked it too but \\"beautifully written\\"? \\"Great book\\"? I don't think so. This is one of those sprawling, over-many-continents kind of books, the kind of book you read by the pool (not your own pool, the one at the hotel you stay at on vacation) or the beach (the public one) or, if you're really tight on cash, in the backyard, the kind of book that lets you live the jet-set-life vicariously. You'll get some folk doing the right thing as well as weathly brats behaving badly and a parade of couplings throughout. It's a soap opera, that's all. Enjoy it for what it is. It ain't high art, just a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst writing I've encountered in years","review":"I read this entire book because it was one of my book club's choices, but I should have stopped after the first few pages. The writing is flat and unimaginative, and the characters' situations are unrealistic and completely random. Lokko seems to rely on dicey topics such as incest and abortion to keep the reader's attention, yet she never really follows through with addressing the significance of these weighty issues - the characters just plow through events that should be life-altering, but don't seem to be affected by them. None of the storylines or themes come to any resolution.

All of the reviews I read rated it as terrible for one reason or another. But, I thought it was a pretty good adventure flick (circa Indiana Jones). Only negative for me was movie was too long...probably could have been cut down by 15-20 minutes without hurting the story line.

But soon got to thinking that the murder was about something much more. They are wanted by the cops, trying to hide out, some people double cross them. But they soon find out the all this is the history of someone they know.

Hollywood relativsm and mainstream Christianity aside, the film never quite captures the solving of intellectual riddles with any success; Cage's \\"National Treasure\\" and the TV series \\"Numb3rs\\" do a much better job.

Follows the books fun (preposterous) theories fairly well, but really struggles to make them even marginally believable. The book is interesting and actually makes you want to do a little research.

Tom Hanks brings tothe screen a truly believeable character who will not be deterred from discovering the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one strayed too far from the book","review":"Having read this book more than once, I wanted to see the movie. Full of action and intrigue, it moves rapidly and most everyone probably enjoys it. But I was disappointed! It strayed so far from the book that I was let down.

It's really boring, Tom Hanks (usually one of my favorites) is miscast and adrift, the supporting cast is dull except for Ian McKellan, and the screenplay is plodding and dull. It's amazing that they could take such an entertaining yarn and turn it into such a sleep-inducing piece of junk! Great production values and a big-name director do not make a good movie.

Fortunately I only sacraficed four bucks on this dud and still feel ripped off.I am not even addressing the theory though that has plenty of holes enough to leave it as fiction. The movie itself was slow and Hank's acting was forced and plastic.

I could not even finish the book and decided to wait for a movie.From the first minutes of the movie it became clear that Ron Howard would be following the story, line by line which was bound to flop. I don't know exactly how the Hollywood screenwriting works but someone was suppose to put their foot down and insist on coming up with a better script. As a result of the \\"follow the book\\" concept, the movie turned out plain and disturbingly silly.What an interesting premise (I don't care if it's based on facts or not, this is after all the work of fiction anyway), that got the entire world shaken up and what a poor interpretation of it by both the book and the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:The DaVinci Code begins well enough, though the audience is asked to believe that upon being gutshot a character would use his own blood to leave cryptic clues for his pal Tom Hanks, but quickly gets bogged down in the endless machinations of the plot and ends up collapsing under its own weight--airtight this ain't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Mystery, but Not Good History -- & WHERE'S JOHN?","review":"The Da Vinci Code is worth seeing as a mystery, period.

One is Christ. The others are the 12 Apostles; the one to Christ's left (though you'll note NOT NEAR him like a wife would be!) has always been identified as the Apostle John -- until the theory came along that it's really Mary Magdalene.Now, John was Christ's most loyal disciple.

Though only mildly more entertaining than the book. The conspiracy theories surrounding the idea of a Christ-bloodline are not new and they are at least illustrated (no pun intended) through a vaguely entertaining story. But this movie just missed the mark all together. Way too slow in trying to compile all of Brown's story into one movie. And for those of you who were distraught by the movie's changed ending from the book - are you serious? Did you really think that the book had a \\"good\\" ending? That sour drivel (which sounded like it was written by a horny 13yr old...) was charming and good?Don't waste your time or money on this movie.

One of the many mistakes that sticks out with this film was the obvious rush taken to make the movie, and that's exactly what this film feels like as you watch it-rushed, leaving behind a trail of omissions from the actual novel that made the whole storyline intriguing and understandable. Even the conclusion of this film doesn't help matters as the character of Robert Langdon explains the mystery of the grail to Sophie, as if he's reading a script for an audio book rather than portraying a character attempting to solve a murder mystery. Audrey Tautou is pretty, but that's about it, and Tom Hanks, while a fine actor, is not who I pictured for the role and has never come off as more bland in his career. And that God-awful hairdo-where did they come up with that style?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I expected to be incredulous, but the screenplay and Howard's attention to crucial setting and details didn't allow for any disbelief. Every aspect of the characters was honed until the stage presence brought the viewer to the edge of the reality/imaginery fold. The story brings out the depth of the dimensions of history and I loved the thrill of chasing the clues (I hadn't read the book yet).

I have not seen Ms. Tatou before this, I think she is stunning. Ok, well, Tom's hair--I guess they wanted him to look like a New England academic liberal..I get that. Not a great choice in terms of flattering him, but Hanks is still a wonderful actor.

A little more mystery would have been nice. Sort of like that \\"mystery of faith\\" thing.On the plus side, the overall aesthetic of the movie was very attractive. There was a beautiful grittiness from the colors. Much like that of an oil painting, eh Leonardo?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Code","review":"Anything less than this movie sucks would do a disservice to the term.Unbelievably poor acting. Hanks just walked through the part as did everyone else including Jean Reno who should have been flamboyant with this part. It is really no ones fault but the director. I'm sorry Opie (Ron Howard) but you should have went fishing with Barney instead of directing this one. I trust that Angels and Deamons will have a better director otherwise another incredible story will go up in celluloid smoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Just Don't Get It","review":"I loved reading the Da Vinci Code; in written form, the plot was high energy and full of intrigue and passion. On screen, the plot was executed poorly, and I think it is due in large part to the casting. Yes, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but not for this part. It shouldn't have mattered that his name would bring in the fans, this story had enough of a following that they could have hired a no-name and still profited. There is such a lack of chemistry between Hanks and Tautou, it is almost laughable. My advice is to not waste your money, rent the film before buying it because you may be disappointed if you were a fan of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"It's a complete bore! A waste of good two hours. I just wanted to go home and watch one of my favorite movies than watching this crap. Wait till it comes on DVD. Do not see it in cinema.

I quit catholicism for Jewishness. Dan Brown's secret plan is working... I can feel it working... the albino monk... he's irresistable!

I read the book and didn't find it particularly enthralling (give me a good James Patterson novel anytime), so I've never understood the hype. The movie however, is slow and a lot of folks got up and walked out or fell asleep.

Also, movie started with nearly 2 minutes of cutesy CGI logos from several companies - very boring and distracting. Maybe one of those companies could have put the subtitles high enough to read on a widescreen TV!

Audrey Tatou, Tom Hanks and Sir Ian McKellen are completely wasted. Jean Reno plays his usual role of the though guy law (of God) enforcer, and Paul Bettany keeps fighting against a pair of cheap contact lenses. The characters pursue planted clues as if they were on a crazy car rally in what may be the longest night in the history of movies -since it begins in a conference hall and ends (in what feels like ages later) somewhere in the French countryside discussing theological issues. In one of the final sequences you see a group of men entering a medieval church... and once inside, some of them turn into women! Nice locations, though - that accounts for the 1 star vote.

It is an incoherent, baffling and tedious tale about some vast conspiracy by the Catholic Church to cover up the truth about Jesus (that he was married to Mary Magdalene and had offspring), and apparently just about everything that has ever happened in world history since has been caused by this continuing cover-up. I have seldom seen a film both so ridiculous and so boring. It is slow, dull, pretentious and almost entirely incomprehensible.

To my surprise I left the theater satisfied, as did most of the other people whom I overheard as they were leaving. Tom Hanks did a decent job here (nothing like his usual Oscar worthy performances), and Audrey Tautou was really good (Amelie is still her best work), not to mention very easy on the eyes. Ian McKellen really added some fun and humor to the mix and was needed in a serious film such as this. He turned in the best acting performance of the movie. While I think many critics are giving it bad reviews because of the religious aspects, I think it is a well made film that kept my eyes glued to the screen.

But, for all the hoopla I heard about this movie, I must say I was bitterly disappointed when I rented it recently.

He was protecting the Holy Grail. Who we find out is a descdent of Mary Magdelene and Jesus Christ. The Priory of Zion is supposedly holding that over the Catholic church.While this movie does cause alot of scandal I think most people need to realize it's fiction and not real.

Tom Hanks is one of THEE finest actors of our time, but he could not even save it. He plays Robert Langdon, a guy with a fictional degree in cryptology who can suddenly turn into a super athletic hero type when called upon. Jesus had a cousin whose sister had a nephew who married a truck driver that had another boy whose daughter married a guy a while back and now they live in Memphis. In the meantime of course, it is all laid out in a painting until they find this Rubiks cube device that would make the people at Monopoly laugh.

There is very little to make it interesting.It was filmed in Paris but instead of having footage of Paris as a backdrop, pictures of the city and its attractions are almost nil.Instead it is primarily watching the characters in brown and grey cubbyholes and listening to them talk a mile a minute.I suggest at least get up and take a break after the first hour and a half because there is still a long way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.

Again, some familiar tourist sites and some really great new places.The extras on the DVD were really neat. I especially like the short about Dan Brown and the director getting together to put cryptic items in several scenes to act as pointers to what was really going on.

(I'm personally aware of at least 3 books on the subject - not all are fiction.)Dan Brown enveloped his exciting and very well written fictional story around known historical figures, unsolved mysteries, a damsel in distress, ancient conspiracies, and an innocent by-stander turned hero.

I put the DVD on the next day, thinking I just wasn't in the mood. Wrong. Another 15 minutes into this complex tale of symbols, car chases, madmen and murderers, I was cutting symbolic zzzz's. Again. Why? None of these characters were even remotely interesting, the story is abstract, vague, a mess of confusion, pretends to be important, but it's not.

As the intelligent plot needed to be squeezed into a normal length movie, the story is constantly in a rush. Perhaps some kind of series would have been a better idea..Anyway all other details, like actors and pictures looks well in order. It's almost impossible to accept Tom Hanks as a professor though.

I am very anti-organized religion so the knocks on the church (with RC's subbing, in my mind, at least, for all OR) resonated. But such silliness. And there was little of the suspense that the makers seemed so proud of: I KNEW after about 10 minutes that THAT character was THAT CHARACTER!!!! Tom Hanks was good in his typical fashion; Ian McKellen was awfully silly; the girl OK. But I was terribly disappointed.

Another disaster waiting to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Adaption of the Controversial Potboiler","review":"Ron Howard's movie version of the Da Vinci Code is a pretty good adapatation of the controversial potboiler by Dan Brown. It's a combination murder mystery, intellectual scavenger hunt, and quest story. Tom Hanks plays the main charecter, Robert Langdon, with a reserved, intellectual air that only opens up toward the end of the movie. Audrey Tautou, as Sophie, bears a good combination of beauty, chic, and vunerability. Ian McKellen, as is his tendency, steals every scene he's in. Paul Bettany his wonderously creepy as the mad monk assasin, Silus. Of course, this is the movie that the Church does not want you to see, which to my way of thinking makes it imperative to see it.

Unfortunately, it ends up as an \\"action\\" film without the subtle substance of the book. If the viewer had not read the book first, I'm not sure they would have a clue what was going on in the film. For those of us who read the book, there is disappointment in the efforts to push everything into 149 minutes. It doesn't work.Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors but he is like a cardboard cutout here. There are no emotions. As one reviewer reflected, Hanks seemed consummately bored with the whole endeavor. The character gave nothing to the audience to hold on to. The same is true for Audrey Tautou and her character. There was no chemistry between the two; the viewer has a difficult time empathizing with the characters, or engaging in the adventure with them.

And after Hanks makes this rambling speech at the end to Tatou, who is \\"the last living descendant of Jesus Christ,\\" (forget the Tatou's grandmother we met just a few moments ago), Tatou makes a joke about not being able to walk on water.

It's pixels, just pixels.The bonus feature that are specific to Blu-ray are ridiculous, easily put on a regular DVD.That being said, why is it necessary to release an extended cut of Da Vinci Code only on Blu-ray? Why are they forcing people to pay for pixels?I don't know about you but this kind of shenanigans is only going to increase the piracy problem. People, like me, don't want to pay for pixels. In fact, having seen Transformers in BR, I can tell just how FAKE a movie actually is. So why are studios supporting this move?I don't pay for pixels and neither should you.

Really have no idea why people was so crazy about this movie, because scenario, acting and everything at all is absolute zero.I know that when was a premiere of movie is Russia, many people - critics and most of them famous singers, actors come to watch it. All main cinema of Moscow was full of people, but in 30 minutes people begin to leave cinema and to end of movie stayed maximum half of hall.I tried to watch this movie, to find it interesting and first 15 minutes even promised that rest of movie have to be exiting. But to the end of movie i was almost sleeping. Last 15 minutes i even didn't saw - couldn't stand it anymore. BORING! And even Tom Hanks didn't manages to save this film.

However, by the time the 100th person asked me \\"Have you read the Da Vinci Code?\\", I got entirely turned off and decided that if it was that popular, it would not be worth reading. So......when the movie came out, I was a fresh mind, not tainted with any expectations. It turned out that was a very good thing. I think the movie works quite well as a mystery/treasure hunt/mild thriller. Even though I figured out the \\"mystery\\" way before it was revealed toward the end, I've got to say that I thought the movie was paced well, providing back story when necessary, and had an able cast. Sir Ian McKellen always does a convincing job, and he was very entertaining as Leigh Teabing, adding some needed humor to the story. Paul Bettany was downright creepy as the albino monk.Although a tad bit long at around 2.5 hours, I enjoyed most every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Theatre Version","review":"The extended version (Directors Cut) is better than the extended version of this film.

GO GET IT!","review":"The fourth album by H2O is equally as strong as all the others. It definitely sounds much cleaner than any of the others, but what do you expect when they sign to a major label. The only black mark on this album is song #7 \\"I want, I want\\" I don't know what it is, but this song sounds over produced to me and I skip over it whenever it comes on...good thing that song #8 \\"Songs Remain\\" picks up where #6 \\"Ripe or Rotting\\" leaves off. The Madonna cover at the end is exceptional...it's even better live. H2O does a great job of walking a fine line with this album. They have signed on with a major level but they haven't sold out and they \\"don't forget their roots\\". I would recommend GO or any H20 album to anyone that is looking for some great Hardcore/Punk with a positive vibe.

I was dreading this release because it was them on a big label, the same label that happens to be home to Blink 182 and fenix tx. The cd didn't really click with me when I listened to it, like all of their other cds did. I think most of the tracks lack the energy that most H2O songs have, which bothers me because H2O is one of the most energetic live bands. Almost all of the songs on it seem slower and more melodic, with the exception of \\"Songs Remain\\". They do cover \\"like a prayer\\" which I believe is really great cover.

Brenda and Dylan had the best chemistry by far. Being a fellow Class of '93 myself-my friends and I were obessed with the first three seasons-I even used to tape them on VCR tapes back in the day. Now I can own the DVDS!! However, my collection stops with season four-I can't even look at \\"Valerie\\" and Claire is soooooooooo annonying!!

Shown from two different viewpoints and with the aid of flashbacks and with a slowly unfolding plot, it's long (2 1/4 hrs.) and fairly hard-to-follow upon first viewing but features superb momentum-inducing acting by Alain Souchon as the hopeful \\"boyfriend\\", Suzanne Flon as the deaf aunt - watch her facial expressions!, and especially Isabelle Adjani in an outrageous but moving part. As the lead character - known only as \\"She\\" - you either hate or sympathize with her. Either way, Adjani is at the top of her form - which is saying a lot! I shouldn't write any more without revealing the denouement, except, having won four Cesar Awards, this 1983 film, which finally became available in 2010 as Region 0 disc, needs to be seen by fans of smart thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.","review":"If you deffiantly want to hear Dir en Grey try a crack at something different, it's a great album.

Fitzhugh appears to have actually believed the nonsense he wrote: slaves were treated fairly and with respect, slaves just loved being slaves, etc.Confederate battle re-enactors count this as a favorite ... because of its premise, not because they've read it, as they rarely R-E-A-D anything that isn't a comic book.Still, if you want to see the pro-slavery argument put into print, then this is the book you should get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work in my computer.","review":"Cost more to send it back than it's worth.

Such memories and remembrances for me during the beginning of my life when I was beginning to appreciate the artistry in music. And if you are like me, this stuff will make you sigh and think back to childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece. That says it all.","review":"Ballard has a knack for making his insane ideas and conceptsmake perfect sense. This is a perfect example of that. This book isfilled with breathstealing bizarre concepts. You can really get to thinking about them. Many ideas in this angered some. Liz Taylor, Jackie O, and especially Ronald Reagan are all hit hard by Ballard's vicious insight (I don't think Ballard trying to be insulting. He was just being... weird). It's hard to tell exactly what this book is. Is it about the Atrocity Exhibition or is it the Atrocity Exhibition? The letters found at the bottom of random pages point to the latter. Ballard throws away everything anything ever taught about writing, including plot and continuity so don't try to find any, and sets out to create pure art out of words. Does he succeed? Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The illustrated ReSearch edition is a must have.","review":"I will not repeat what others have written as all the praise is indeed justified for this classic.I would like to add that the illustrated edition by ReSearch is the edition to have (I am not sure if this is the one that is currently available from Amazon). Phoebe Gloeckner's work and the B&W photographic collages really add tremendously to the already powerful words of J.G. Ballard."},{"rating":"1","title":"bizarre? incomprehensible? Sadly, yes to both.","review":"'The Atrocity Exhibition' has to be one of the strangest books out there. It's not so much of a novel but rather endless snippets of sex, death and automobiles all twirled together. Somehow deceased celebrities get thrown into the mix, adding to the perversion. Mercifully short, this book is a jumbled mess. Yet for some reason the author really likes this topic and subsequently wrote 'Crash', a marginally better read.Bottom line: a book that is not only not for everyone, I think it clearly isn't for anyone except for blindly loyal fans of the author. Simply awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm","review":"...those of you who disagree will probably say i'm uneducated or narrow minded, but i say to you that artistic forays away from traditions of writing or painting are very healthy but must be aware of the risk of becoming bad - as amply demonstrated by this novel.

I couldn't believe what kind of nonesense it was when I started with it...someone mentioned here that this is a cult book that wouldn't be recommended to 99 percent of readers, well I guess I am one of this 99 percentile. The only time I could slightly enjoy reading it was when I was stoned and I could get some sense out of it...but since I am mostly sober all the time then this book is definitely not for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Fans Only","review":"I read this while on vacation, and can honestly say, it was the most bizzare thing I have ever read. Personally, I loved it. As a Ballard fan, especially of his early works (Voices of Time, Terminal Beach, etc) I can say this was truly a fascinating read. However, I would recommend non Ballard fans to look elsewhere for an introduction to his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"a warning to the unversed","review":"i bought the book because of the rave reviews, because i fancy myself to be progressive and able to think on many levels. however, i was not able to grasp this book - or collection of short essays, or vignettes, or whatever - even with the foreward by burroughs and the extended commentary by ballard. confusion made reading a chore, and not an enjoyable one (where after a mighty struggle i manage to decipher an idea enough to get my mental teeth into it so that i can digest it later).what i mean to say is NOT that this is a bad book, but rather that it is not for those who aren't familiar with ballard's philosophies/notions of automobiles and sex. i wish i could have understood these concepts more because the writing itself was excellent and the structure of the book interestingly different from everything i am used to.in a word: beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to start, a chore to finish","review":"Ballard makes several keen insights in this book (many of them startlingly prescient). However, digging those nuggets of clarity out of the surrounding mess is difficult and often unrewarding work. The repetetive and disjointed nature of the narrative quickly leads to confusion--confusion about the characters, their motives, and the surrounding events. And perhaps that was intentional, but it doesn't make for a satisfying read.\\"The Assasination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\\" was one of the few bright spots in the narrative, but not quite bright enough for me to consider this book as anything more than a failed experiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind blowing, in every sense of the term","review":"This is a very difficult book, but also very rewarding for people with patience. I usually find experimental writing gimmicky, but the Atrocity Exhibition is haunting, paranoid, claustrophobic. Readers should be in the write state of mind to deal with a sometimes unpleasant read; those who do are usually transformed by it. This is a stunning work; I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the edition..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend of Rudolph Valentino","review":"This DVD beautifully conveys the magic of the silent screen era my parents told me about so often. The scenes from his biggest films accompanied contempory newsreels made the presentation more realistic. I would like to see similar DVD presentations of other \\"Legends\\" as well as great directors of the silent era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made documentary","review":"Although this documentary uses extensive footage from Valentino's films and good photographs, the details and information concerning Valentino's life is only glossed over. For example, the segment about Valentino's death shows newspaper headlines but the narrator fails to even mention what Valentino died from! For those interested in Valentino's personal life, you won't find it here. The infamous fact concerning his first wife is not mentioned (she threw him out of their room and the marriage was never consummated) nor is Valentino's homosexuality discussed. There is so much footage from \\"Blood and Sand\\" and \\"Son of the Shiek\\" shown that you feel as though you have watched the entire film. The dvd will be enjoyed by Valentino fans but for those interested in a good documentary in the vein of A&E's Biography series will be disappointed. You can find out more about Valentino's life from a brief entry in a film encyclopedia than you can from this documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Worse ...","review":"when I tried to contact the seller, he is not available anymore!

Not only did they include the wrong movie, but it looks and sounds horrible to boot. The picture looks like it was mastered from an VHS dub done in SLP. The sound is horrible, an English dub only. Oh yeah, they also included the insert for \\"Drunken Master\\", despite never releasing it on DVD. Unless you like \\"Fantasy Mission Force\\" and don't mind a poor quality copy of it, avoid this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, but I just like looking at Jackie","review":"this movie is also called Little Tiger from Canton, Directed by the infamous Lo Wei. This movie was shot before Jackie's eye opening operation, and he looks really cool! If you're looking for beautiful martial arts, this is not the movie to get. See Drunken Master for that. If you're a die hard Fan, this is definatly worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is the best martial arts film I have ever seen. It starts off well with Young Jackie getting taught by an old man (who seems a bit too much like a paedophile to start with). Jackie gets a bit good at kick, punch, chop (!) although he keeps it a secret from his pacifist father. The old man gets funnier and funnier as the film goes on as he rustles through bushes and pulls off hilariously bad oneliners. He is almost smiling throughout the entire film and the bit where he and Jackie go and pay the rent is priceless. As a film to watch on your own this is probably not great but invite a few mates around and you can really have a good laugh taking the peas out of this one. Highly recommended for fans of the 'So bad it's good' genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Chan must protect his family from a deadly syndacate.","review":"A very good kung fu flick much like \\"The Big Boss\\" shows a very young Jackie before he had his eye surgery.

AKA Master With Cracked Fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is pretty bad","review":"I am a Jackie Chan fan, but this movie is not that great. The acting is bad, the scenes are choppy, and the fight sequences are not anything spectacular. Personally, I found it a hardship to watch the whole movie. The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is the fact that Jackie Chan is in part of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck getting this DVD to play well...","review":"For starters, I will admit that the widescreen presentation of the English dub of this film is probably the best I've seen of any release of it. However, the film itself is a mediocre patchwork mess, with plenty of footage with a Jackie double. During one fight scene, blink and you'll miss both Mars and Yuen Biao, longtime JC collaborators.The biggest problem with this release is that the DVD is poorly manufactured. On two different DVD players, I could not get the disc to read properly. The disc would jump to random chapters every ten minutes or so in one DVD player; it wouldn't even read at all in the other one! I would suggest saving your money and, if you really MUST have this movie, buy one of the many other releases of the film. No matter how you slice it, the film isn't very good anyway, letterboxed or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some respect please","review":"I have never seen this movie, nor will I out of respect for Jackie Chan. This is not a real movie. When Jackie left his first director, a hack names Lay Lo, (Bruce Lee fan may reconize the name, he took credit for the first few movies Bruce made) Jackie had to sign over the rights to all of his early movies to him (on account this jerk sicked the Tri-ad on Jackie). With the rights to Jackie's early films, and Jackie now a smash hit, Lo hacked up Jackie's older films, and used bits and peaces on of each of them to make a \\"new movie\\" called Master with Cracked Fingers.To learn more about this read Jackie's Autobiography, I Am JACKIE CHAN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy release, please avoid","review":"I picked this up on a \\"hot tip\\" from a friend that this is a very cool kung fu movie (I had scene Drunken Master and really enjoyed it).

He's in it for all of 3 seconds, by virture of the fact he's in a bar where the odious film maker happens to be. A complete waste of time and it has NO place in any list of the work of VDO. If there was a minus-star rating, that's what I'd give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Vincent D'onofrio film!","review":"I can't believe that anyone allowed this movie to be listed under any heading other than \\"Major Jerk\\". I had heard about Troy, and did decided to give this a chance since Vincent was listed as an actor in it. Yes, he was in it- I think. There was a 5 second shot- from so far away they had to put a caption telling you it was Vincent that Troy was speaking to. If you enjoy listening to self-centered, lying, cheating people like Troy, then this is for you. If you want to see a real movie with real actors actually performing meaningful tasks, look elsewhere. I'm so very sorry I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning Tool","review":"As a script writing hopeful, this movie really shows you the no no's of the movie business. If only Troy could have been a more positive person and less of an a-hole, he may have been something.

It starts with his story being bought by Mirimax, then goes to trying to cast the movie, and suddenly it's falling apart and the movie isn't being made. Then they try to get someone else to make it, but nobody wants to for some reason.

My 3 and 5 year old boys love it! It is easy to build marble runs, watch your marble go, add on new pieces and they are using their brains all the while. This is a toy that will likely get even better for our boys as they get older and more able to engineer some multi level marble runs. For now, I mostly work with them so they aren't frustrated if the tower falls over as we build it. Its awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holes don't align well","review":"The holes don't align perfectly. Also, it is difficult when you're building to see where the hole should be.

The kids spent the weekend at her house, played with the one her son owned, and seemed to really enjoy it. They both LOVE it! They can set the blocks up in different ways to create paths for the marbles to run through. I think it is very educational, uses their problem solving skills, and keeps them entertained. It is very durable, the block pieces are solid wood. I will probably buy another set so they can create even bigger mazes. If your kid enjoys playing with blocks, Leggos, Lincoln Logs, etc. like mine do, this is another entertaining spin on that. Great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"My son's school has this and the boys love it, so we bought one for our home because he showed so much interest and it held his attention for a long period of time.

The plot lines have substance in addition to just humor. As well, the characters play off each other very strongly from the beginning of the show. Some of the highlights of the season are:\\"Activate your choices\\" the appearance of Dr. Becker's ex-wife, who has written a book about anger, and uses Becker as an example.\\"Lucky Day\\" everything goes right for Becker, which upsets him for the entire day.All the episodes are good, and I look forward to the other five seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becker - The First Season","review":"So well written and acted.

Becker's character of someone who's heavily opinionated & isn't afraid to say what's on his mind is just gold. Eventhough that's the side that's present more than any other, you see other sides of him as well throughout the series as well showing that he does care about the people around him & his heart is in the right place where it matters (Pilot episode). With other characters like Becker's best friend & blind newsstand owner Jake, supermodel to crappy cafe owner Reggie, more beauty than brains Linda, and Margret being the only one who's somewhat normal...just the right formula. Pick this up as this is a show you will laugh at & hopefully, all the other seaons will be released as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Becker!!","review":"My husband and I both love Becker. We didn't watch it much when it was on as a series, but now love the re-runs. I got the 1st season DVD set as soon as it came out and we have watched them over and over.

Finally the time we've all been waiting for, Becker is released on DVD!I've been wanting this series since I first saw it on CBS. Ever since then, I've tivoed every single episode. Then, one day, Becker was no longer aired on TV anymore. I searched for the DVDs so I could keep watching it on my own. Unfortunately, I was unable to find Becker on any reliable sites, such as Amazon.com. I did find some DVDs of Becker, but I did not know if they were fake or real.Finally, a year later, Becker is released on DVD. I asked my parents to give me this as an 18th birthday present and I am crossing my fingers in hopes that they will give me this. It would be the best birthday present ever!

Half of this CD is good while the other half needs to be re-worked or thrown out. Only Turning Off The Emotion stands out to me on this album. Rude Awakening is good along with ILLUSION, THE STORM, AND TOWER but it needs a better solo somewhere in it. The rest just isn't finished. Get Written in the Sand or THANK YOU CD before you buy this. It should never be compared to the brillant album Assault Attack..it is not that good but this album is not trash as a one person suggested About half the album does have some worth especially Turning Off The Emotion and Tower (if it were produced rigth could be a classic) and a little different direction for MSG but basically parts of the Cd needed to be re-done or produced better.

The film, a story of East End gangsters tells a most funny and wicked story. The music totally encapsulates the themes of the East end of London, and the crazies that went through it. From Murvin's Police and theives, a Notting Hill fav, to the modern OCS's Marchin' already.... the whole story will unravel before your ears once again.If you haven't seen the film, go and see it. Then listen to the OST and remember those funny and facinating moments.I have been looking for the Murvin song for some time, and it was thanks to this film that I found out who sang it. By far Police and Thieves is one of the best tracks, along with Spooky.i would certainly rank this OST up there with R.dogs, P.Fiction and Basquait.Forget the tackyness of Trainspotting, listen to the elegant, smoothe and sophisticated sounds that propell the film to greater heights.P.S.

Although it is better than some of Jackie's earlier films under his contract with Lo Wei (New Fist of Fury, The Killer Meteors, Dragon Fist, and many others), it's not that great. The acting is pretty dull throughout most of the movie. The entire film is so full of plot wholes and boring scenes, that you rarely care about what's happening. Most of the action is better than some of Jackie's other movies from the early 70s, but they still need lots of work. Although some of them are interesting, the action is way too slow to fully entertain any Jackie Chan fan. This film should only be seen if you want to complete your Jackie Chan collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an encyclopedia and very little depth on the War.","review":"This book should be called \\"Sociological essays on the era of the Revolutionary War.\\" It is not arranged as an encyclopedia and has relatively little material on the Revolutionary War.

What begins as an explanation of Greek culture turns into a fascinating and touching personal story of connecting with one's past. The author also describes Greek influence in this country and on the pearl industry. The book is both historical and anecdotal, with the poem woven throughout, connecting every facet of the story.

Although I've always been a strongly devoted Neil Young fan, I enjoyed the days of the groups beginning as well as their separate albums which made their return to each other all the more sweet and defining. Especially, at 47, because I began listening and seeing them as a group much younger than a lot of my fellow concert fans and later, individually, when I was able to truly appreciate the music and the lyrics. It's great to be able to raise that one clinched hand and the other hand, with 2 fingers signifying the feeling (or rush that some others prefer,) felt at the end of every live song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Young's contribution","review":"An interesting album although there is precious little of the wonderful harmonies associated with Crosby Stills and Nash. There are rather too many solo performances from this talented band. Neil Young's main contribution to this band's large portfolio is his harmony blends.

I may be a little biased, because I don't find many things much finer than a live Neil Young letting it all out. All in all, this is a pretty good album if you enjoy the live sound (which is certainly lacking in most of today's music).

The first problem is a weird one - the first song, Suite Judy Blue Eyes, isn't actually on the CD. It is listed as Track 1, but Track 1 is 26 seconds long, the first 8 seconds are silence, and the remainder is the very end of Suite Judy Blue Eyes (\\"da da da da da... da da da da da\\"), and that's it! It is so bizarre, I am not sure how they can list it as a track.The second is that I feel that many of the songs are played very sloppy.

There is nothing better then a show where artists can showcase there own songs acousticaly and then rock as a band. Highlights are Triad, Right between the eyes and Southern man. Well worth the cash for this one...."},{"rating":"2","title":"my most listened to album ever!","review":"I've been through so many copies of this album, on tape, and on vinyl--more than any other one I've ever owned. And finally it came out on CD with the extra songs and I grabbed it immediately! It's CSNY at their very best. Southern Man jam is awesome (\\"usually a really long song...and tonight we're gonna do it real slow\\"). As are Long Time Gone and the other electric shocks. The acoustic tracks feature deep lyrics and gorgeous harmonies...the latter all the more impressive because it is live. The added tracks were a delight to have added in...Neil's medley is so fine!! ...and, as said in another review, the line \\"one thing the blues ain't....is funny\\" in the middle of the awesome Black Queen is a truly classic moment. For now, I've misplaced my CD, so I'm looking for another copy (or two...it's a great gift!)...I'll never regret giving CSN&Y another few bucks for this music that has carried me for decades. Thanks, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four : What It's Worth","review":"CSN&Y when they really were CSN&Y (as opposed to Y&CSN). Most CSN(&Y) albums have been grossly overrated over the years, but this one deserves to be listened to. Excellent all-round musicianship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalga","review":"I lived for 18 months in a mud hut village in North West Iran. This was back in the beginning of the seventies. I had a set of earphones, a sony cassette deck and tapes of Iron Butterfly, Doors \\"live\\" and 4 way street by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I didn't need a lot more. 4 Way Street is still one of the great sounds. Take no notice of the bad points, live recording was still primitive in them there days and that's why you can imagine that you are at the concert because live sound used to be bad. Buy and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"bobrocks53","review":"I really liked this cd and gave it 5 stars for the 2nd disc. The long live jams are worth a reasonable price. I would like hear more of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What about the drummer","review":"Agree totally with every positive review on this absolutely essential CSNY album. What is surprising though, is that no-one (I have not been through each and every review, admittedly), seems to have made mention of the incredible drumming by Johnny Barbata on this set. I have never been huge into drumming at all, but each time I listen to this album, I cannot help but note that this guy has got to have been the most incredible improvisor I have ever heard. He never seems to repeat a particular style/type. I had never heard of him before this album, and have never heard of him since. Seems a crying shame somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Glory for the greatest Melodizers in Rock&Roll","review":"4 Way Street is an excellent album. It contains all of CSNY'shits (Teach the Children, Love the One Your With, Ohio, Carry On,Chicago, Find the Cost of Freedom, etc.) as well as the best version of Southern Man I've ever heard. It'll keep you whistling the guitar solo for hours afterward, its so good. It also includes such Neil Young solo hits as Cowgirl in the Sand (a personal favorite of mine) and a medley of The Loner, Cinnamon Girl, and Down by the River that is nothing short of stunning. This album was given to me as a gift before I had discovered CSNY, and now I'm obsessed. This album is a must-buy. Even if you're not a big fan of CSNY, this album will convert you into one. So, Carry on and purchase this album as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not age well...","review":"Your vinyl copy is all used up sitting in a box in the basement, so this is one of the albums you decide to get on CD because it is one of those records you have real fine memories of from back in school. But man o man, when you play it back now, you realize it is one of those albums that does not age well at all. As stated in other reviews, very uneven performances (thank god for remotes and CD track programming). But I must be honest and say that I find that after the first listen or two, I almost never go back and pick out this CD to play, even when in a nostalgic mood and looking for something different to listen to. Wish I hadnt bought it. Let sleeping dogs lie and spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointing","review":"I had great memories of the times and LP version of this CD set.I just bought it, to go with a serious stereo.As they said back then, what a bummer.The engineering is terrible. The vocals distort to the pointof being unlistenable.And for a group famous for its close harmonies, how come no one can sing in tune?Skip this live CD, find a studio version where they couldactually hit the notes, and where the producercould make them cut out the mindless drivel andextended, pointless jams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unlistenable","review":"Neil Young is revealed here as heads and shoulders above the others, no wonder he soon split. The sloppy recording, playing and singing were folksy and cool then, extremely dated now. This sound is simply too far below today's standards. \\"Chicago\\" is a bright spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaccid Rock","review":"21 tracks, 6 by Neil Young. Two of those are live retreads of tunes you should - if you're reading this - have elsewhere. Three of them are acoustic takes of solo tunes (one is a medley) and the last is an old Buffalo Springfield tune.The only other high point is Crosby's intro to Triad, wherein he basically says, \\"Hey, man. Once I was nailing two chicks at the same time. I wrote a song about it, and stuff...man.\\" But you can hear all of that on the sample provided ... and Triad is now available as a bonus track on Notorious Byrd Brothers, which - if you're reading this - you should have elsewhere.So, 4 worthwhile tracks out of 21, that's less than 20%. Sounds like 1 star to me...and I'm rounding it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"This is the worst live rock album ever made. It is an emabrassment to the great stars who made it.

I read about 55% of this story and I couldn't go on. The plot just doesn't move fast enough for me and the conversations about building materials for housing is space were just not interesting.At the point where I left off I didn't find enough science fiction to hold my interest and the slow moving plot was just lackluster.

There were characters by the dozens, each with a contrived space type name like:Yelena Bugolubovo,Nierbog,Veblen, etc etc.Some of them were described with square heads, and some were huge, from other planets all settling on this space city.I was so frustrated by ill-defined characters, and the number of them without giving me a picture for my mind to grasp, that I had had enough/Maybe there's a story line, you know; good guys vs bad guys somewhere later on, but a book, a play, a movie, should entertain.This book missed the mark for me.You can obtain it at no cost, but that's about what it's worth in my humble opinion.Sorry to be so strong about it, but honesty is better than false diplomacy.Fred Auerbach"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"Oh my.

It is so bad that no one took the time to remaster it.However I must say if I am going to be a zombie for any one it would be Dr. Myra played by Katherine Victor. Katherine Victor, of \\"Mesa of Lost Women\\" (1953) fame, after being in this dog of a movie went on to make 20 more notable movies as \\"The Cape Canaveral Monsters\\" (1960), and \\"The Wild World of Batwoman\\" (1966).Teenagers discover an uncharted island with a secret. Can you in your wildest imagination guess what that is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Fun, Bad Movie","review":"2 stars for being so bad, it's good. I have only seen this on video but the movie is so bad---it's funny. There are a great deal of sequences involving walking through semi-woods on an island. There are also a great deal of boat sequences. A character gets shot and gives a standout performance of, well, \\"play dying\\" and there is an unbelieveable fight sequence at the end which looks more like the characters are play wrestling with each other. The sound is awful but the movie was made that way. The sound echoes around in many scenes but one scene in the lobby of someone's house (?) has the worst sound of any movie ever. This movie begs to be put on MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE if they were still making those, which they should."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reprint of an older book, and a not very good one at that.","review":"This is actually a revision of an earlier book of hers called \\"Invocation of the Gods\\". Unfortunately, this was not indicated anywhere that I saw on the Amazon site, so I ended up buying a book that I already own. I was hoping for a more, well rounded,book on Egyptian Pagan rituals this time. Sadly, this was not the case with this book. It's hardly surprising though, as Llewellyn Publications, the book's publisher, has a history of reissuing their \\"under-performing\\" books under new titles. It's gotten to the point that if I pick up a book in a store, and I see their logo, I just put it right back. Considering how few books there are out there on Egyptian Paganism, I'd like to recommend this one, but, I can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perspective is too personal","review":"When I bought this book, I hoped to learn more about Isis and ancient Egyptian beliefs. What I discovered was one Wiccan's personal interpretation of the material. I was disappointed. I was seeking hardcore information, not a soft interpretation. The rituals are modified Wiccan rituals. but If you happen to be of Wiccan persuasion, and want to wear an Eyptian costume, this book might make you feel Egyptian. This book will make a beeline for my trade-in stack of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ow!","review":"While the book is full of information, it is one of the worst written books I have read in my adult life.

The quality of the game is so low as to be almost nonexistent. The board and the spinner are terminally flimsy--the spinner almost being useless it is so unsmooth and rickety. To require assembly of all the houses and everything every time one plays the game is a slight against anyone with patience or capacity for joy.

Most of the tunes on this album start to wear on the brain after a second or third listening. Part of the reason for this is the noticeable absence of anything pioneering or new. Their attempt at intermingling traditional Irish music with pop is promising on tracks such as \\"dreams,\\" but the rest of the album leaves me desiring more.

Who could argue that the album was brilliant. When 'Talk on Corners' was released I held off purchasing it for awhile after reading many disappointing reviews. By the time I did buy it, I was fortunate to get a copy with 'Dreams' included and the remix of 'What Can I Do'. The album has since been repackaged again with further remixes. 'Talk on Corners' lacks the creativity of the debut album and it is almost as if the Corrs decided to play it 'safe'. Predictable tracks are found on this CD including 'Only When I Sleep' and 'So Young'. Unfortunately the special irish sound that was their trademark is lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!!","review":"This version is worst than their \\"In Blue\\" cd. Gosh, why can't people just be and stay true to themselves? This is the Corrs's first attempt to be \\"Americans\\" and that says it all. If you really want to hear them at their best, buy their first cd and their \\"live\\" cd, where their Irish culture and heritage shines through. But if you want to hear \\"non-Americans\\" try to be \\"Americans\\" and then fail, by all means this cd is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bubble gum pop and not enough Irish soul.","review":"I bought this CD after catching the very end of a special I saw on TV. They ended their set with a rousing version of a traditional sounding Irish melody. Unfortunetly this CD is neither rousing nor particularly Irish sounding, unless you think that Dave Mathews Band sounds Irish because of the electric violin. I'm listening to the 2nd cover song on the album as I write this and I'm shocked to hear them perform \\"Little Wing\\" so poorly. They'd do better to hire a writer and perhaps a manager who would steer them clear of making such a huge mistake as covering a Jimi Hendrix song when they lack the chops to bring it off. Come on Corrs I 'm pulling for you. Try again and next time don't worry about making a pop album. Make a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Finest Hour","review":"Talk On Corners was the finest hour for this band of Irish family members. Their many talents are showcased in this excellent CD. I've owned the original and this deluxe version, which includes five unique mixes of some of the songs. Usually such remixes become a deterrent to enjoying the essence of the song. Not so here. The haunting version of Jimi Hendrix luscious \\"Little Wing\\" with it's Celtic arrangemet, is worth the cost of the CD alone. With \\"So Young\\", \\"Runaway\\", \\"Only When I Sleep\\", \\"Dreams\\", and \\"Queen of Hollywood\\", there are more than enough strong songs to make this a must have for your collection. This is a great edition, well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A darkhorse band(in the U.S. anyway)comes through the fog","review":"Although they've been making other CD's before this one, it's the first one I bought. I was influenced to buy this CD because of a performance I saw on the Leno show. They did their hit single \\"What Can I Do\\". Although the tin whistle has been taken out from the version I originally heard, it's still a really cool song. Other great songs on this remix CD are \\"Only When I Sleep\\", an extremely cool remix of \\"Dreams\\" by Fleetwood Mac. And a smashing instrumental song called \\"Patty McCarthy\\", this CD also contains other great hits which are too numerous to mention. They combine an awesome pop feel with an accent of their native Ireland sound. If you buy this CD, I think you would be very pleased with it . Also if you do like it, you would probably like B*Witched as well. Read my reveiw on their latest CD, \\"Awake and Breathe\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most excellent music I had never heard before","review":"I heard this band on imagineradio.com and it was great. I heard \\"I never really loved you anyway\\" and thought...hmm, what's this?So, I took a chance and got the cd. It's absolutely fabulous.

However, the heavy-handed remixes on this album convey little of that. Good songs have been gutted and overlaid with plastic rhythm tracks which destroy the effect of the original versions, which is rather like retouching the Mona Lisa with a dull crayon. It is amazing how a few techno-hacks can take good material and reduce it to the level of soulless, synthesized dance crap. Skip this mess, and stick with the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool.","review":"Although I love the Corrs, especially Andrea, I cannot give the special edition full marks. I was slightly disappointed that some songs from Talk On Corners (normal edition) did not appear on the album, and I prefer the non-mixed versions of Dreams, So Young & I Never Loved You Anyway. Still, this isn't too bad, pretty cool actually - What Can I Do is a favourite. Anyways, an excellent band, only lost coz of one or two things. Can't wait for the next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Corrs are TOO COOL!!!!!","review":"The Corrs are great.

Unfortunately, the atmospheric Irish sound of their first album has been replaced with an edge-less rock \\"attitude.\\" Gone are the wonderful Celtic instrumental tunes and the moody lyrics that made \\"Forgiven\\" such a standout. \\"Talk on Corners\\" is not a bad album, but it has little of the spirit of their previous effort. I can't help but wonder if the simple fact that there is already a \\"special edition\\" of the new album proves that the previous version was seen as somehow lacking....but the revised edition doesn't seem to be an improvement. Sorry, but based on this one, I'll test-drive their next release before I commit my money to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"could've been better","review":"The vocals are great, and the music is really nice for the most part.

Each tape targets a specific area with extremely effective exercises and a worthy amount of repetitions. As Claudia states in each tape's intro, \\"It's not about keeping up...\\". You can move along at your own pace and gradually build up reps. Be faithful, stick to it, and you will not be disappointed with your results. Kathy Kaehler built a great workout routine that has every bit of relevance today. There is nothing outdated about these tapes...every exercise you see here is still being touted today.

If you only know his usual stuff as a pop/rock drummer (with Toto during the last few years - which is how I noticed him - and Mick jagger, Jeff Beck and Pete Townsend before this), the album is a big, though pleasant surprise.

So, like a lot of other people, I would try to put some toys away, and they would both think it was a new game and they were supposed to pull them back out.I was originally using a large shoebox that came with a pair of boots, and not only was the little one chewing on the box as well as the toys, she would climb inside it, by making her way underneath the flaps.This arrived and not only is it big, but the lid snaps on. It doesn't snap on super tight, but enough so that the dogs can't knock it over. I now keep their bags of rawhide in there as well.

I only have two 'complaints'...1) I wish the lid was a flip top with hinges. The lid mostly stays off, but if it were hinged we would be forced to have it on. Of course, it would probably bang our dog in the head as he was getting toys out which would scare him (but also be sort of funny).2) I wish my dog would put his toys back in the toy box when he's done. :-)It's made of a good quality plastic and it's really cute and not too cheesy looking like some of the others I've seen.

When I found it at the video store and read it was a Troma release, I was convinced. This is no Toxic Avenger though (Although thats a very good movie for different reasons). This movie is very good. Apparently the actors are all real people from the street recreating actual scenes from the main characters life. This is probably not entirely true but the movie has a very real documantary feel and the direction is raw but wholly convincing. The movie does seem a little long though and consists almost entirely of dialogue but is one of the better movies about drugs I have seen and it would be interesting to see more of this directors work.

Berlitz does not try to convince people of anything concerning the people or culture present on the island, but instead points out that the Ridge would have been above water during the last ice age and presents his evidence from there. Comparisons of languages on both sides of the Atlantic ocean for similar words, migratory paths of certain animals, archeaological anomalies, and an analysis of flood mythology from around the world are used to support the basic premise. Overall, it is a very good, very well researched book on an interesting topic. I have recommended it many times, not least because it stays away from anything vaguely related to channeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of empires","review":"I remember picking up this book years ago when I was in seventh grade and it still fascinates me today. Charles Berlitz makes a very readable and logical argument for the existence of Atlantis by revealing that many disparate cultures shared a legend about a lost civilization that was far ahead of its time.

Conventionalwisdom had maintained for centuries that Troy, discussed in Homer's great work the \\"Iliad,\\" was a figment of Greek legend and few scholars took its possible existence as a serious matter. And, then, along comes a German archaelogist named Schliemann, who in 1870 defies conventional wisdom and excavates the city of Troy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old nonsense","review":"Like all books about Atlantis (and, for that matter, other silly pseduoscience and pseudohistory), this book provides no evidence except that which the author makes up. The fact of the matter is, the science of plate tectonics and continental drift shows, conclusively, that no continent could ever have existed in the Mid-Atlantic. The source of the Atlantis legend, as anyone who objectively examines the evidence will find, is the Minonian civilization of the ancient Aegean, which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1629 BC. While this may not be as fanciful as the Atlantis story, at least it's true. Put your thinking caps on, folks!

Finally no malicious software is controlling my machine. Well, first, Kaspersky is faster and more comfortable in use. Second, as i said, it doesnt intervene in any of computers processes. Third, it has hourly database updates. And four, it provides a better protection than norton, i had norton for two years and the first day that i got my kaspersky after norton, it located 11 Trojans and a virus, which Norton has never located and showed that system is fine.

This was not just a virus data file update, but a full upgrade to version 7.0, just as if I bought that version.Pros: Product works great and keep viruses from invadingCons: It has a proactive mode, that questions when registry changes and other changes to files are about to be made.

I am sad to say I did not have success.I can only guess, but I think that the message is not a good fit for me. The message is negative, along the lines of \\"do not have yucky sweet things\\". It was not a message that resonated with me. I tried it for months with no results.I more recently have purchased the much more costly series of CDs from Roberta Temes \\"Enjoying Weight Loss\\". I find myself much more drawn to her more positive approach and I AM finding modest success. Moreover I have a much more upbeat outlook, and find myself taking positive steps without resistance.

I find things I do automatically changing, even the kind of groceries I buy and the way I prepare food, too. Very worth the money. The reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that his accent is hard to understand at times as he just mangles words, and I found it distracting that I had to kind of wonder what he had just said instead of being able to absorb the message he was trying to deliver.

This album lacks the hooks and sweet melodies of its predecessor. Nigel Godrich strips away whatever musical virtues Jason may have (had). The \\"Flavor of the Month\\" Godrich was a wrong fit for Jason. The best songs here would be the lesser songs on \\"Author Unknown\\". And even at that, those songs were either outtakes from his previous album, or outtakes from the Grays album. As of May 2006, Jason hasn't recorded a follow-up (not counting that Beatles novelty album). He did record an ep a year or two, but that, like this album, was a virtual washout.Save your money and skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, We Can!","review":"The textbook definition of the term \`ear candy', Jason Falkner's follow-up to his formal solo debut 'presents Author Unknown' is another layered sonic treat that benefits greatly from the crystalline production of Radiohead and Beck collaborator Nigel Godrich. 'Can You Still Feel' doesn't break any new ground, however. In fact, like it's predecessor, it owes a great debt to the early '70s output of that other multi-intrumentalist and pop whiz, Todd Rundgren. That's not to say that Falkner is a slavish imitator--the man's just proud of his influences and wears them accordingly.This is pop music made by a rocker with a keen sense of melody and arrangement, the likes of which are seldom heard on radio or MTV. Don't deprive yourself of it just because clueless, tone-deaf, bought-and-paid-for program directors choose to look the other way.

I think the songs are also more consistent. Highlights: \\"Revelation\\", \\"Eloquence\\", \\"Author Unknown\\", \\"The Plan\\", \\"I Already Know\\", the rest of the songs. The CD booklet has a pretty funny picture of him (wearing lots of leather) being served drinks by a stewardess...flight attendant. That really doesn't add or take away from the CD in any way. I just thought I'd mention it. In closing, I'm honored to be on the same page as Eric Matthews (below). Thank you.

I bought this CD on a whim as I was impressed with the cover art. I must now report that I'm sure that I have in my posession one of the finest and most consistent pop albums of ALL TIME. This is pure joy and I'm also stunned at the fact that Jason played the bulk of the instruments on this album as well. Sadly, I feel that this record will fall on largely deaf and ignorant ears(particularly in my country) as this music won't find a place on radio or TV. EVERYBODY should own records like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!!!","review":"Maybe it's my age, but, I seem to have become very choosy upon hearing the new music of today, most of it rather boring.

I wake up humming songs like Author Unknown and Holiday.....really great tunes. I admire the fact that he does all the work on both cd's and I think he does a great job. Keep up the good work, Jason! Your sound is so refreshing when put amongst most of todays blah blah blah samey sounding \\"artists\\".

But... as some others have talked about in their reviews, there is literally NO detent when plugging into either component. The cable I'm replacing is a very cheap (in appearance and cost) cable that has great detent. My concern is that it will come unplugged any time something gets moved or I dust. I should probably return it for another brand, but I'm too lazy so I used black electrical tape to secure it from coming out too easily.

She primarly used it to pull herself up and tended to pick the entire kitchen up. It would have been helpful if it was slightly weighted on the bottom. Additionally, I was disappointed with the toaster. Either the toast should have been removable or it should have made sounds. She never became interested in the fridge door sorting but I am hoping that as her skills improve that it will become a fun game for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS NOT $189.99-PLEASE CHECK FOR APPROPRIATE PRICE","review":"I don't own this toy -yet! But after seeing it in the store, I wanted to buy it for my 6 month old son. Today, I am looking at it on Amazon and am SHOCKED that they have it listed at $189.99, when it actually only should cost about $35. Please beware of this fact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not too impressed","review":"We gave this kitchen to my daughter at her 1st birthday. She is now well past her 2nd birthday and has yet to play much with this toy. It just doesn't do that much. There are 3 food shapes to put in the sorter, a couple doors to open and a few burners that make sounds. My daughter plays with it for about one minute and then moves on. My advice is: if you want a shape sorter type toy, buy a much smaller one with more spaces (like the classic tupperware one with 10 shapes, my daughter loves that one), and if you want a kitchen for you child, just break down and buy a big play kitchen. Your child can play with that for years and years."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this . . .","review":"This toy definitely can't be beat for the money! I got this for my daughter for her first birthday, and she has loved it. I even love it while I'm cleaning up, because it's funny to see what things she has decided to stuff in the 'microwave,' 'stove,' and 'refrigerator.' :) Now (at 17 months), she even likes to get the little 'pan' that comes with it and pretend she is drinking whatever concoction she made. (Usually the egg ends up in the pan as well.) I just think it is a darling toy and would highly recommend it.One annoying factor: I normally keep the sound turned off, because after about a month, it started playing music at really random times on its own . . . a little creepy (especially in the middle of the night) and definitely annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a disappointment","review":"I expected this toy to have a little more to it. Yeah, the burner and \\"sink\\" parts make a noise and light up a little, but the toast doesn't come out of the toaster and the food accessories are pretty boring. That said, my 1 and 4 year-olds both play with it some. I was hoping for a little more action to distract them while I cook in the actual kitchen. Also, the door to the refrigerator falls off easily (and goes back on pretty easily, too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Toy","review":"My daughter got this as a gift for her 1st birthday. She plays with it everyday and seems to enjoy it. I've seen her play with it for up to 30 minutes at a time. She keeps busy opening and closing the doors, putting the cup in the cupboard and running around with the phone next to her ear. While I was wanting a larger kitchen set for her, this one is making due until then. I figured she would be bored with this when I saw the size of it, but it keeps her occupied and until she outgrows it, I won't be getting the bigger kitchen set.We must have the new version of this b/c we didn't get any pots and pans with it and the door does not come off. Our daughter tips it over, stands on it and sits on it. She'll try to carry it around and drop it. It's held up to her torture and all the sounds still work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen","review":"My 11 month old daughter loves the sounds this toy makes-but she pulls herself up on it and it tends to tip over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"With any toy, a child first needs guidance and of course supervison. My daughter got this at 10 months and fell in love with it. When we first got it we played along with her and now she sits and plays by herself. She just needed someone to show her about playing \\"pretend\\". She \\"cooks\\" things up now and gives them to us to try (she is now 11 months). It's about learning no matter how simple the tasks. She loves trying to put whatever is handy in the fridge, oven and microwave parts. The door does come off but it's not dangerous. It only snaps in and out and it's all soft plastic. My daughter will try to yank the door off on purpose. She thinks it's funny. She can also tip it over but again she does it on purpose. There isn't much weight to it so it's no danger to someone of her age. I think the best age range for this would be 9 - 18 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute fun toy!","review":"My daughter is 9 months old and received this as a gift and has a blast playing with it!

She will play with this toy for literally an hour at a time and always gravitates toward it first in the morning. It has great sounds and music, and the opening and closing doors all over it are so neat. Only issue is that it does tip over easily, so I try to lean it against something so that she won't pull it over. This is WELL worth the money and is so cheap on Amazon.com. I love this toy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sounds!","review":"My 10-1/2 month old son absolutely loved this kitchen, from the minute it came out of the box. He loves opening and closing the refrigerator, microwave and oven doors. Mostly, he loves the \\"egg\\" and will search the living room to find it (even under the bookshelves!). The sounds are great - and are much less annoying than those of the many of other toys in the livingroom. The refrigerator door did fall off once, but was easily fixed.

She also likes the sounds this makes. My older daughter had a different model about 5 years ago which she just adored. Both seem really good, although the prior one was a bit better...the door was sturdier and it came with shapes that were \\"ice cubes\\" - they would put them in the shape sorter door, then push a button and they would come out. This one, you just place the food shapes in the slots and they fall out. Also, there was a slot for the phone...this model it just comes with the phone, with no real \\"place\\" for it.

Definitely good buy for 9mos+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Tikes DiscoverSounds Kitchen","review":"I don't know why some reviewers are complaining about the size of this-just read the description.

I think it makes an ideal first kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"This kitchen was an excellent value.

I recommend buying the accessory set (salt shaker, mirror pan and spatula/spoon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for boys too","review":"I got the last model of this for my boy (who was 9 mos at the time) and he has loved it. In fact, he's 2 1/2 now and still plays with it.

She barely takes notice of it! Although the sounds were initially thrilling to hear, they have since lost their appeal. It is so tiny (barely 16 inches high) that she must sit to enjoy anything about it. Also, it is lightweight... so, don't be surprised when you see it knocked over or dragged off into another area.The real treasure about this kitchen are the tiny shapes, pots, & utensils that come with it. It's just unfortunate to spend so much on accessories!Choose this toy wisely.

He really does. It just doesn't really show on this disc. It starts out as an old-skool hip-hop D&B; jumble. I'm all for hip-hop, but his track selection is pretty weak. Considering the some of the big names that were on the tracks, it should have been better. AK demonstrates some pretty basic scratching here as well, but let's face it, the man is no turntableist. I REALLY hate female vocals in D&B;, and there are more than enough to turn my stomach in the first couple tracks.Towards the middle of the mix, the tone shifts a little closer to harder jungle. By the end of the CD it is full on AK jungle, although at times it sounds a little closer to Dieselboy.Overall, if you like hip-hop, chances are you will enjoy the first few tracks. If not, suffer through them and you will eventually hear some pretty good D&B;, but it ain't anything special."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Vanished from a seller in England","review":"Just received this yesterday, after a fairly long wait from England, but it was well worth it.

A page turner, the book is both easy to read and gripping. If you are looking for a Custer book that is factual and makes you feel like you are there, you will not go wrong with this. You can just about smell the gunpowder and hear the arrows whizzing by. It's hard to believe this is the author's first novel. Hopefully he has continued to write others since. I could not put this down."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes but was let down","review":"I read this book last year but never got around to reviewing it at the time. We all know the story, but this book seemed to lack imagination and was mostly boring. Despite some issues with his other book, Moon of Bitter Cold, I thought it had more spark and imagination, and overall, I remember it fondly. But this book left me feeling like the author was just going through the motions. I see that most other readers strongly disagree with me. For a good Custer/LBH novel, I recommendBroken Eagle. I read it a long time ago and need to read it again to see if it holds up, but I have very good memories of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best account of the fight on Greasy Grass ever done.","review":"Even though this book was written by a wasichu, it is truly the best account of the Greasy Grass that I have ever read.

Other wise works great and no more white gas to worry about."},{"rating":"2","title":"propane converter for coleman stoves","review":"the converter allows using propane with coleman type camp stoves. it works fine, but would benefit by having a continuously variable adjustment instead of four preset settings.

Other than that it works fine.I do recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I was planning to buy a new propane version of the coleman stove I already have when I ran across this product.

I purchased it mainly as a backup to the white gas. It is pretty stable on the stove, but you need to be able to elevate the stove to allow the canister to hang down below the bottom of the stove. It has been on two camping trips so far and has worked great. It lacks fine tuning adjustment of the burner which I get with the white gas, but I may have to place some markings on the dial to make it a little easier to manage heat.

The Archie Goodwin Files delve into some of the real mysteries in the Nero Wolfe books: how does the Post Office delivery Wolfe's commands seemingly within minutes of posting the letter, which doorbell rang, and why do secretaries appear so frequently in the books? This book will bring new enjoyment to your favorite Wolfe mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sequel Better Than the Original","review":"This effort is actually better than its predecessor, \\"The Nero Wolfe Files.\\"For one thing, the array of topics covered is more diverse. Since more essays had been written, the editors of this book had more source material to choose from in presenting this.And this gives rise to a very interesting spectrum of opinions. For example, one essay gives a very compelling and persuasive set of arguments that Wolfe was, in fact, born in the United States and then migrated to Montenegro during his childhood. Another essay is just as convinced (and offhanded) in accepting a statement Wolfe makes that he was born in Montenegro and became a naturalized American citizen. Each is compelling and very persuasive.If you cannot get enough of Wolfe, two things: (1) buy this book, and (2) make sure Marvin Kaye is motivated to release \\"The Saul Panzer Files\\" or some suc as soon as possible....[Maybe \\"The Inspector L.T.Fergus Cramer Files?\\"]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done...","review":"The follow up to The Nero Wolfe Files, it has both factual details about the Nero Wolfe novels but also some wonderful short stories set in the universe.

After hearing \\"Ty Jonathan Down\\", I first heard about this band. The song really is good!But when then listeing to the rest of the album, I was very dissapointed. The songs just don't have 'it'. The style changes from song to song.Fred Durst (oh no!!!!) and some Korn guitars are featured in this album.....but they don't really help anything in making this album something special.In the end, this album is not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"I saw these guys when they opened up for Rob Zombie/KoRn...and I must say, I had never been in a completely dead mosh pit until these guys came on. Boring and annoying...the only time it sounded good was when Fieldy came out and sang with em..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE ARE THE GUITARS!!??","review":"OK so this is SUPPOSED to be a \\"rock\\" album.YEAH RIGHT!!!. I can only count 3 songs or so that I ACTUALLY hear guitars!!. I'm a guitarist myself...and I can't enjoy a \\"rock\\" album without some good guitar playing. Also don't get me started on how BORING this album is. The only song I liked is Jesus. I LOVE KoRn but this is pure trash. I gave it to a friend of mine that likes this type of music (he loves ORGY) and he later told me \\"this is one BIG piece of trash\\". I DON'T recommend this album to anyone!!!. You want to buy some new HEAVY stuff...go buy Staind or Slipknot or even Limp Bizkit, but don't buy this album and expect to hear Heavy stuff because you'll be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just bought this crap for one golden song!","review":"Yeah, I can recall this one time when I was 14 years old, and I was in the kitchen and had the radio on. A song came on the radio from a band called videodrone and this song faceplant plays, I fell in love with the song. After hearing it about three more times, I never heard the song ever again. The band never blew up and just kinda dissapeared as quick as they appeared out of nowhere. Anyways I never forgot how good that song made me feel, and I never heard that song ever again. Fast forward 2009 (ten years later), I discovered it on amazon, read all the bad reviews of the album, bought it anyways.. The album sucks ass, but that song is always going to be a late 90's classic! Thank God I finally found the song again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so glad they broke up","review":"Put this cd on your list of \\"cd's not to buy.\\" This is pure crap at its finest, these guys have no talent at all. Their music sucks, it's so boring you will either want to break your stereo to pieces (please don't, this cd is definitely not worth the hassle) or just break the cd to pieces (which I highly recommend). Videodrone is by far one of the worst bands out there, and I am so happy that they broke up. I hope that they never get back together and I hope that they never bring their crappy \\"talent\\" into another band and ruin that band's career as well. But there's a light that is showing through all of this, and that is this: If Videodrone can make it into the music business, anyone can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Founding Father.","review":"i keep this album, because it reminds me of the days of old, inBakersfield. Nothing was going on, but these guys. They played at my high school (late 80's), of course it was Cradle of Thorns back then.Im 30 now, and i dont listen to this sort of music much anymore, but i used to absolutely love them. These guys were doing it long before korn, or limp biscuit or whoever else everyone compares them too. Way back, Jonathon Davis idolized Ty. Sex Art was an attempt to impress cradle of thorns. In my opinion. Most everyone did. Instead of comparing videodrone to Korn, you should compare korn/adema to cradle of thorns.Ty truly started something, with out getting any credit for it. He was the influence for all of these bakersfield bands. Ty influenced me. i wont forget the days of driving in the Impala listening to Cop Killa, or going out to Club Bam Bam's to see you guys play EVERY weekend. You are forever still in my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Thrills From the Book of Korn","review":"Videodrone are simply amazing. This CD puts together the electronics and vocals of Orgy, the fright of Korn, and the slight funk of Incubus. This CD demonstrates it all. Ty Jonathan Down and Faceplant, the singles are the best songs here, but Alone With 20 Bucks is also good. The only part I don't like is that they don't pour on their funk metal influences like they did when they were Cradle of Thorns. A few other good songs on it are Jesus (Lord of the Apes), Human Pinata, Closer to Coma, and Ant in the Dope. If you like this I'd recommend these bands; Orgy, Professional Murder Music, Taproot, and Hoobustank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this. I figured they must have talent if they were under Korn's Elementree Label. I was blown away when I heard this album. I am planning on buying some Cradle of Thorns cds now. My favorite songs are Faceplant, Human Pinata, Ty Jonathan Down, Jesus (L.O.T.A.) and Power Tools for Girls. I recomend this cd to anyone who are fans of Korn, Limp Bizkit, and especially Orgy. The songs switch form being light piano songs to head-bangin' industrial."},{"rating":"2","title":"its good for a first","review":"the album is great. i would recomend this to anyone who loves orgy because they are both great bands. KoRn deserves a nice round of appluase for signing these two bands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Videodrone is great!!","review":"I saw Videodrone open for Rob Zombie and KoRn on MArch 23 I thought that they were really good, and everyone there seemed to like them too. After I heard them I bought the cd. They sound like Orgy and KoRn mixed together. They give a really good live preformance...just buy the CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT, BUT GOOD.","review":"Being that this CD came out on KORN's record label, I guess I expected it to be a really heavy record along the lines of KORN or Limp Bizkit etc. Instead, although it is still heavy, it has a slower, darker feel to it more along the lines of Orgy. It takes some getting used to, but if you are into bands like Orgy or Marilyn Manson or pretty much any industrial rock, you will really enjoy this CD. Jonathan Davis and Fred Durst also make appearances on a couple of tracks which is really cool. Overall, this album is different, but very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as hard yet very very good","review":"The guys from Korn are back on track with this one. While some Korn fans will not be impressed with the slowed-down tempo I still have to acknowledge that this album is very very good. I recommend listening to this one first if you are into harder music but, if you like good music period then this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different for being a Korn-fed industrial band.","review":"Korn has reshaped rock music today for better or for worse. They have given us Limp Bizkit, Incubus,and Orgy. The next band signed onto their label is Videodrone. (aka Cradle of Thorns). You may think Videodrone is another rusty rap-metal band, or some wannabe new-wave hard rock band. Think again, Videodrone is much different than any of the other bands Korn has helped in the past. Ty Elam uses melody, and not some starved-for-attention melody i.e. Fred Durst, im talking melody-melody. He sings peacefully on ''Faceplant'',''Closer To Coma'',and ''Alone With 20 Bucks''. The keyboards and drums on this album are what is really amazing. The guitarist and bassist need to work somewhat harder in order to get a perfect rock band. But, they do serve up some pretty good industrial rock, and it is worth to listen to. Check these guys out."},{"rating":"2","title":"great follow up, but...","review":"this third installment of angelou's sutobiography is just as well written and interesting as her first two. however, i have become completely baffled with ine aspect of the novel. in the first two books, her son's name was guy. suddenly, in \\"singin and swingin...\\" her son is referred to as clyde! if anyone knows why this is so, please share your explanation. it would be highly appreciated! and whatever his name is, still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was a strong ful hearted book","review":"I believe that this book is wonderful, the way it shows her feelings, and also how the pain blacks felt against white people.

I don't mean that to sound sarcastic, but the plot is so weighted by metaphors, symbolism and inuendos that if it were any longer, I for one would have chosen to abandon it. In addition, the first half of the book, the word \\"sex\\" is used so often and metaphorically, that it only makes her message even more complex, when it shouldn't be. Once I got used to her style of writing, I did discover a decent story, I just wished I didn't have to work so hard to uncover it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a drink called paradise","review":"i have been to this part of the world recently and felt it offered a lot for a novel. the story line, such as it is, had a lot of potential. other reviews warned about the preoccupation with sex. apparently the author is either obsessed to the exclusion of everything else or thinks that just mentioning sex every other page, without any subtlety or romance, sells. the stream of consciousness style works some of the time, but., most of the time simply does not flow and jerks along incoherently. the characters are not dimensional. it could have been a good book...if someone else would have written it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully concocted mystery.","review":"This is a great story set in the world of make believe.

The characters just did what they always do. There are a lot of better books by these authors. I'm just sorry this good idea about the Day of Honor series turned out to be so bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book!!","review":"This book was poorly written drivel. I didn't even finish this it disgusted me so. I want to make sure no one else has to go through the torture of reading that.

It hadn't even talked about the day of honor and I was about halfway through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful game with lots of options!","review":"Now, bear in mind -- I'm not an avid gamer - in fact I rarely play computer games altogether nowadays. My favorite games were in the late 80's early '90s when game play was paramount over flashy graphics.I purchased this program after trying it out for a few weeks via Freeverse's website. This game is very similar to Activision's 80's version of Shanghai -- except that it's gorgeous to look at, has terrific gameplay, and is ...(insert drum roll here) ...loads of FUN!I prefer games that are easy to get into, and continue to hold my interest over time. This review would be 5 stars, but I took down one star because under MacOSX 10.3, I can't play any of the audio tracks on the game. Freeverse software has indicated that a patch will be made available soon.Highly recommended, especially for non-gamers that want a good, fun diversion every now and then. Perfect for kids and adults alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tile-matching game","review":"No problems with installation or stability, but you may burn through hours without even realizing it. :)While the monkeys aren't as much fun as BMS, the tile matching is good fun -- and educational.

However, I do not love this album. Tevin seems to be holding back; on any of his earlier works one can hear him really belt the song out and thus, pull you in. His vocals are much more reserved and...well...it's just not Tevin at his best. Listen to \\"I'm Ready\\" or \\"Back to the World\\" for pure Campbell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Standing Ovation for Tevin","review":"Like Tony from Washington, I cheer him completely on with his review of this CD by Tevin :) This is truly a remarkable CD and you hear the growth and the maturity that Tevin sings from his inner soul. This truly is a CD you must add to your collection, and what stands out for me most in this CD is the orginality of it, (not a bunch of sampling), but music where they really sat down and took time to write. If you are searching for a sound, that is a sound of its own, this is the CD you need to purchase and sit back and enjoy the evening with Tevin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tevin & his music are growing up before our very eyes!!!","review":"Act like you know cause if you didn't I'm here to tell you. This album Tevin showcases a broad range and travels a path where many R&B singers would not dare to tread. Radio, keep it up by not giving Tevin any love, 10 to 15 years will pass and the man and the voice will still be around. I appreciate the fact that Tevin is using his gift to bless us all who would stop to listen instead of trying to formulate the regular R&B booty and freak songs that cloud the airwaves daily. This is his fourth album and we've watched him grow before our eyes and just think he's the bomb now..wait till life bites him in the tail a little and he REALLY has some things to sing about. His best is yet to come!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth & Sexy","review":"Tevin has got it! A maturing voice with youthful appeal.

After awhile it feels just like a headache on tape. Energy is great, but overkill isn't. Buy the book version. The basic message is this: you don't have to ACT the way you feel. You can feel whatever emotions you feel, but then choose how to act. That's the key to emotional control."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must to Avoid","review":"This is a comic book version of a historic battle. The author presents a disjointed attempt that deals in fragments of events that are poorly connected. A useful map would certainly aid the reader who tries to follow the reading. On one page is a very lengthy footnote which actually appears 2 pages later as part of the text. Actually, I found the footnotes and their sources more valuable than the stumbling sequence of events as presented by the author. There must be a better book available."},{"rating":"2","title":"old school","review":"I listened to this through my high school years and still love the music, still enjoy seeing Kyper in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"Author Braden Glett is bold enough to take on not only efficient market theory and index funds, but also the investment approaches advocated by such luminaries as Peter Lynch, Warren Buffett, John Bogle and their ilk. Although Glett does not name these names, he finds plenty to disagree with in almost every popular or conventionally recommended investing strategy. That makes this book provocative and interesting. It's always good to see conventional wisdom shaken. However, the author writes in a very difficult style, and his message hits various grammatical and logical road blocks due to a shaky editing job. With that caveat, we believe that investors and traders may want to check this short book, as long as they take the author's recommendations as opinion - he offers little in the way of solid research to back his contentions, but he raises some potentially useful doubts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless album for the Rap collector","review":"I had been looking 10 years to find this album.

This is an impressive band with excellent musicianship, upbeat energy, great joy, and fine songs. What I found so impressive was how they avoided cliches in their performances of British retro pop. Remember the Knickerbockers song Lies? This band is a contemporary expression of that kind of sound. Yet they also had a distinctive hard edge. I'm a 58 year old boomer and I mostly listen to jazz these days. But I have followed Ray Davies career since the beginning (he was magnificent), and I was pleasantly surprised by Locksley. If you enjoy British rock circa 1966-1967 and you want to hear it performed with a contemporary edge, give their music a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Hornplayer","review":"Ethnomusicology is my first exposure to Gunn. To say the least, I am not dissappointed. I only give four stars, because I have never given five, except for MMW's \\"Notes from the Underground\\" as far as newer jazz is concerned. There is a great deal of variety on this album. Don't just spin track 1 and think \\"Well, so that's Gunn. Now what?\\" Highlights: Track 2 (very intense, don't listen in your car, unless you can afford the speeding ticket) Track 3 (bass intro can blind a small child at fifty paces), well, now that I think about it, everything else is spectacular as well. Track 1 can seem a bit trite, but it is an introduction. Besides, it doesn't serve to set the pace. There is no pace. Each track is a different planet in a ten planet solar system. If you like this one, might I recommend Nils Petter Molvaer's \\"Khmer\\" or anything by Medeski, Martin, & Wood (MMW)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing surprise!","review":"I recently went to see Charlie Hunter at the Knitting Factory in NYC, and Russell Gunn was the first act.

(R&B and otherwise) While Claudette has a nice voice (not dissimilar from Beyonce of Destiny's Child's), the two guys seem to drag it down and I keep thinking of one of those obnoxious pop groups like Boyz N Girlz or S Club 7.If you like the singles, just copy them off the radio!

No wonder I only remembered two songs from them Carmel and What would you do. I would say get the singles to Carmel and call it a day. I never liked What Would You Do because it was contradicting...guy at bachelor party see friend who is a stripper and tries to give her advice. Wait..hello..you are were enjoying this lady removing clothes until you realized who it was.The rest of the CD is slow and boring. Claudette Ortiz has a great voice.

Quite simply this is the worst cd that I have ever heard in my life. The song \\"What would you do\\" is soooooooo annoying it is starting to make me want to rip the radio out of every car I hear it in. But there are still some good uses for the cd. You could use it as a coaster, as a frisbee, or better yet see what happens when you try to put together a girl who looks good and has no talent and two fake wannabe thugs.

I believe City high is an excellent group that belongs on the top. I am great to hear the next single is \\"carmel\\". The 3 of them make beautiful harmony together and the songs they sing make you think. Not to many groups out there now a days can make you stop and think about the world around us and think \\"I wish I could make a difference\\" or \\"what would you do if YOUR son was at home crying all alone on the bedroom floor, and the only way to feed him is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money, and his daddy is gone.\\" I hope this group plans to stay around for a while and come out with another cd that is just as great as this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed, bad remake","review":"I think if you can find the Video edition you would be better off watching this movie on a VCR.

The only thing that kept me from giving her 5 stars for her latest book is her own theorizing about \\"soul containers\\", her continued endorsement of the bogus MJ-12 documents, and her unfortunate continued association with late night radio lunatic Art Bell. How she can continue to rise above the dung heap that is Art Bell is just amazing. Her own willingness to use whatever venue she can to bring the truth to us is astounding, even if it means risking her own credibility by continuing her association with the self-serving king of fatalistic paranoia himself, Art Bell.

The problem is with the sound. Background noises and music swamp the dialogue track - somebody walking across a room sounds like the French army storming the gates of Moscow.

But unlike Candyland, there are very few ways to change the order of the players--once someone gets out in front, they stay there. Even playing at Level 1, when you don't have to answer the questions, it is just too long. And as for the questions...well, there is one question card for each area on the board. On the card is a question for each color on the die. So if everyone rolls the same color (which did happen when we played), then everyone gets the same question. So basically, we are pretty disappointed with the game.

Alas the charcters are awful. What starts as horrible characterization becomes worse as the writer make everybody either too dumb or too mean to be sympathetic.

Can't believe I read the whole thing--I kept hoping that the book would live up to the hype and the interesting premise. So much could have been done better-I was constantly re-writing the plot in my head as I went along. So many potentially interesting subjects could have been explored and were left dangling or not touched at all. Attempts at a romance, suspense, adventure seemed to fall flat and I felt the writing itself wasn't good at all. Situations would come up that I felt could have been resolved or carried out in a very interesting manner so I'd keep on reading only to be disappointed.

It reaches at that 'what if' aspect. What if there were still some of these creatures around today, and what if they weren't all as grousome and horrid as we would like to think. I also felt it had a great use of imagery and detail that was very valuable in the enjoying of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I can't even begin to count the ways that Mr. Darnton messed up the science in this book. Yes, he provides a sketchy bibliography in the back, but I got the distinct feeling that he didn't read more than the introduction to those books.As for the story itself, it's one of the dumbest and most offensive I've come across in some time. The scholarly anthropologist (or paleontologist, which the author can't keep straight) goes out into the mountains of a former Soviet state and finds the Noble Savage. If the author had replaced the word Neandertal with Yanomami, !kung, or Native American, this book would never have made it to print. Apparently, it's okay to keep with the racist and destructive ways of white, Western society, just so long as the group of people being oppressed have been extinct for 40,000 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK, DIFFERENT STORY, VERY INTERESTING","review":"\\"Neanderthal\\" is not your typical adventure/thriller novel. There was obviously a lot of research done on the subject and it is presented in a very interesting way. There is a little of everything, from violence, sex and nudity to thought provoking theories. I found the novel both fast paced and well worth reading. Anytime you can actually learn something from a novel and enjoy it at the same time, it's a winner.It really makes you wonder what the world was like way back when"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to evolve","review":"Darnton needs to evolve to a higher level of story telling. I may have learned something from reading Neanderthal, but so what. I didn't care for any of the characters and while the plot was obvious, there was no craft in it's unfolding.

This book looks promising by being a bestseller, but is not as good as you might think it is. The first 1/3 of the book makes it hard to put down, but the remaining 2/3 is very dull.

I believe the author couldhave thrilled us all with a plausible story whereNeanderthal people have somehow existed. Thetelepathic powers and other absurdities are justover the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhhh, the fireplace never felt more warm!","review":"The book was somewhat interesting, in a crash scene sort of way--you find that you can't stop reading on, even though you know you shouldn't.

All in all, the story consisted of two dimensional characters, a loosely researched plot, and outdated science. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"reads like a bad hollywood script","review":"This book is an unfortunate waste of resources. The premise is creditable but the execution is staggeringly disappointing. Cardboard characters, flimsy and contrived storylines, supposedly intelligent and educated individuals behaving stupidly, and the degree to which belief has to be suspended to get through this book are just the main reasons this book deserves to go out of print. As I progressed through the book it became obvious the writing was done as though the writer were behind a camera and writing as though to set up the scene to be filmed. The problem is this is not a film where such lapses of plot and character development are compensated for to some degree by special effects, music and popcorn. I wanted to like this book - I couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"So that's what \\"big foot: is!","review":"This book is very far fetched even though it does try to explain the \\"big foot\\" myth.

Books of this type often enthrall me, but this one didn't. The cartoon-like characters weren't realistic; I don't think that even the worst of academic professionals would behave as unprofessionally as most of the characters in this book did. The book degenerates into New-Age pseudoscience, with lots of loose ends. The subject matter is tantalizing and needs a more thorough, even reverent look at the roots of humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting content","review":"The subject was interesting. I'm not a science fiction fan but I enjoy reading about science which is outside my scientific field. I didn't expect great literature and didn't find it here.

The initial idea was worthy of the likes of Jurassic Park but the final product left much to be desired. The characterizations were horrible. An example of this is the character of Van, in which we are told that he had a horrible childhood, thereby making a stock bad guy character. The plot line was so predictable that I was left with a boring read at best. Also the interdispersed sexual theme was laughable. The language read like an uninspired 12 year old wrote it. An example of this is the catch phrases (riddle wrapped in an enigma is my favorite, which occurs near the beginning).How did this book ever get published is my final question at the end of the book. I think that whoever the author is, he had better stick to his day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly titled","review":"What we have here is a failure at all levels. We have two \\"highly educated\\" protagonists who are little more than thinly veiled soap opera characters. We have their mentor who is a ripoff of Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. And we have an ending that should make Bruce Springsteen unhappy at the very least. And those are just a few flaws. All these and other flaws are put together to prove a point: deception is an essential trait of human intelligence. I guess this book is called NEANDERTHAL for two reasons. Number one, it is about neanderthals. And number two, that's the target audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"It took months to read this book","review":"This novel began with what I thought seemed like an interesting idea then went into evil plots, telekinesis and whatever...I put it down several times then picked it up again because I was convinced that the plot had to be going somewhere.

A reasonably good idea with possibilities drifted into a mess that seemed like a story someone might have written in middle school. yawner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid and Shallow","review":"I was very disappointed by this book after reading the glowing review using such phrases as \\"breathtaking suspense\\" and \\"dazzling storytelling\\", both of which were conspicuously absent. It was impossible to make any kind of connection, good or bad, with any of the shallow characters. The plot had some potentially interesting moments, but these were never carried to completion, and in many cases cause and effect appeared to be totally unrelated."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATROCIOUS!!!","review":"I was browsing through the bookstore when I saw the title Neanderthal. I have always been fascinated with that period of history, so I decided I would purchase it. I am a fool.It starts interestingly enough, providing a informative primer to neanderthals, but it the novel goes quickly degenerates into nonsensical madness. The characters are incredibly poorly developed, and actually quite unlikeable. How many times do we have to read about a broken relationship between a man and woman, and forced to reconcile amid extreme danger? At one point, the \\"heros\\" of the novel tacitly participate in the cold blooded murder of one the expedition to central asia.The ending is comical. While it was bad enough that they used a \\"trojan horse\\" concept to trick the neanderthals, doing to the \\"Born in the USA\\" was the capper.

Otherwise, I would have hit my head with a club if I bought it at a higher price. No offense meant to those readers who liked the story. Just didn't like it.

Neanderthal was a boring, laborious read that I had to push myself to get through. It was basically a poorly written, third grade attempt to rewrite Jurassic Park with neanderthal's in the lead instead of dinosaur's. The characters are cardboard, at best, and the plot (what little there is to it) never lives up to its possibilities. There is no suspense, and what little action there is was pointless. I found myself wishing that the Neanderthal's would just kill everyone so the book would be over quickly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"I was surprised to see the negative ratings about this book.

The concept was weak at best, not to mention old-hat for any one interested in the subject. There are huge flaws in the logic, and the dialogue, and the plot, but I'd have to say that characterization is the area in which the author really shines. And by \\"shines\\" I mean sucks, of course. The real tragedy is that there are authors who cannot get their *non-execrable* works published, and there are porn movies in need of a script.

The \\"scientists\\" have no more knowledge than you'd pick up watching TLC for a week; their eagerness to train the good hominids to kill is a low point in a dismall literary effort.

Many people commented that the real science should be ignored in favor of the story. In the example of Star Wars someone gave, that is true. Star Wars never touted itself as anything but purely unrealistic fiction. This work, however, seemed to claim otherwise.

In this case, not only is the speculative science filled with embarrassing holes, but the characterizations are hackneyed, thin and sloppy.

It also had a nasty habit of having the bottom of the jar fall off when lifting it from the blender, sending smoothie all over the place. It seemed no matter how tightly the bottom was secured, it was never secure enough. I ended up always having to hold the bottom for fear of having it pop off.After a few months, the blender developed a foul, burning smell when running (and it was only run about once a week). Just a few days ago, the motor stopped working altogether. I won't trust another Hamilton Beach blender again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on 2nd use!","review":"What a disappointment!

The \\"wave-action\\" design is what makes it so bad. Yes, it helps to mix things up better....but also forces the liquid to shoot up toward the lid. If you want to take the lid off to add things as it is running (like everyone i know who uses a blender) it shoots the liquid mixture out and all over the counter. I've never had any other blender where i could not remove the top to add things while it was running. You've got to be able to add things (like powders) AFTER it is running or else they will stick to the sides of the inside of the blender. Horrible design.

Truly riveting in it's expression of 1960's contemporary Mexico. By that I mean a mad scientist's dream and a city's nightmare. Not many films of this era effectively use strong women to \\"defeat\\" evil as they did in this film. A risk taken full force with no hesitation. A true film noir treasure. Not to mention the ominous meanings in Gomar's \\"Special Equipment\\" and the good natured bafoonery of Tommy. He truly lightened the intense feeling of this film. Watch it if you dare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This flick is so bad it's actually funny!","review":"The plot stinks, the dialogue is awful, and the acting wooden, yet this movie has its moments, i.e.,when the women kick butt and take names, and save the men (for once!) This is almost unheard of in the sci-fi & horror, or any other genre, for that matter, which makes it all the more enjoyable. Another great moment is The Golden Ruby's response to the little policeman when he tells her that he and his buddy with protect her. This is almost worth the price of the movie. If you like your action fast and cohesive, don't bother buying this movie. If you have a well developed sense of humor (or an equally well developed sense of irony) and don't mind sitting through the dull parts, or just like collecting cheeseball flicks, by all means, grab it."},{"rating":"2","title":"14k yellow gold swiss blue topax earrings","review":"Loved these earrings!!

Unforfunately, she incorporates a little too much dog knowledge in this first novel. Approximately 90% of the book revolves around dogs (training, showing, grooming, breeding, etc., etc., etc.). Instead of being a mystery novel with a dog component, it reads more like a dog book with a murder thrown in as an aside. Realizing that the main characters are PI Rachel Alexander and her pitbull, Dashiell, I know this series is going to have a dog component making it different from the majority of mystery series and giving it great potential. Hopefully this author will tone down the dog information and beef up the mystery portion a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh","review":"I love Susan Conent books and expeted this was simmlilar but it wasn't.

This is so excruciatingly bad, even painful, to watch that I could barely watch it to the end.Take a beautiful, accomplished if somewhat ditzy older woman, throw in a mid-life marriage crisis, and a mysterious younger beauty. Add fear and possible insanity, titillation, and some haphazard explanations thrown in that don't fit with the plot, and you have a disaster of incoherence, eventually leading to violence and wholly unbelievable pseudo-resolution.

The viewer comes into a story that feels like its been in progress for a long time. We're supposed to question, I guess, if Sarandon is unstable or being stalked. Then out of the blue we're given a story hook that is a complete gimick for explanation.I doggedly stayed with the film but the ending wasn't satisfying and the story felt like it was being written along the way.I really like the actors, Emily Blunt (a hoot in the Devil Wears Prada), Neil (you MUST see him in the Tudors season 1) and Sarandon. I don't need bang bang shoot em up to enjoy films. If the writing is there so am I. This film is not worthy of such a talented cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resist this one for god's sake!","review":"As you watch(if you can)this ridiculous thriller (and I use that term very loosely) set in the 'burbs, keep in mind Susan Sarandon helped fine-tune the script.

Each chapter is devoted to one family and each member gets a little space to say what they feel about being in a multiracial family. As one would expect, there are virtually no negative comments about it, but all seem to have been made better, even more completer people by the experience, and above all they tend to see themselves as members of a human family as opposed to members of one \\"race\\" or ethnic background. The children seem less confused than most of the rest of us. A wonderful book.

Still, a heartwarming collection of photographs and shared experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I must admit the book was a disappointment to me.

If you're looking for an essential Elton John CD, then this might be it, though frankly, you'd be missing a lot of his great material. Among the highlights on this collection is his live version of \\"Candle In The Wind\\" from his 1980's live album produced in Australia. Not to be missed either are his tunes with Tim Rice, \\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\\", and especially, \\"Circle Of Life\\".

I would be hard pressed to call \\"Daniel\\" or \\"Candle In The Wind\\" love songs as much as they are romantic ballads. But as a collection of Adult Contemporary hits from Elton John, this is a good greatest hits. Elton and Bernie Taupin were always masters of popcraft, and when they took aim at a ballad, they were often the best of their time.\\"Love Songs,\\" released by MCA just before Elton switched labels to Island Records, covers material from 1970 (\\"Your Song\\") to 1985 (\\"Blessed\\"). There were two so-so new songs, also the hits from \\"The Lion King.\\" (Saving you from buying the lackluster soundtrack.) What \\"Love Songs\\" doesn't do is present the full spectrum of Elton; instead of \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting,\\" you get \\"Blue Eyes.\\" If all you want is Elton's pleasantries, this will do fine.

The only features I used on it is the convection and broil feature. I have baked macaroni and cheese, chicken, steak, and potatoes.

After whatever is done cooking I place it on top the oven to keep it warm until everything is finished. I bought this in addition to my Warning double burner. Both products work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 minutes to broil a steak","review":"I bought this oven because I thought it would save energy instead of heating up the large oven. This Hamilton Beach oven got so hot that I was afraid that it was a fire hazard. The top and sides and back get dangerously hot. The door does not fit tightly, so lots of hot air comes out there also. I baked potatoes on the convection mode at 400 degrees, and it still took an hour. Then I put a steak in to broil. on the top rack, and it took 30 minutes. Even then the exterior of the meat did not look brown. The problem is that there are only two elements on the top of this fairly large oven, and it is just not enough to broil properly. So, I heated up the kitchen on a hot day making the AC run harder, the potatoes cooked for as long as usual, and the steaks took twice the normal time. I don't think this oven was satisfactory in any way, and I am returning it tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but keep your toaster","review":"I've been using this oven for over 3 months now.

I have yet to actually use my new oven, but I am very excited about it, seeing the great performance we have seen out of the smaller Hamilton Beach oven we have. I bought this while it was on sale - only around $90 - which is why I haven't used it yet.

This was an expensive purchase for me ($100), so I've taken care of it. I've only used the rotisserie function once, and that was recently. Based off other reviews, maybe I shouldn't have, but that's ridiculous. It's only a year and a half old. My mother has had the same type oven, but a Chefmate for at least ten years! Last week (on normal function), it smelled like burning electricity. I tried to use it again with the same result, except this time the timer knob wouldn't stop clicking. Tonight I tried one more time, and now it won't even come on, but that timer knob sure will click endlessly. I'm currently in contact with the company to see if they stand by their product. I'm expecting to be disappointed, but I'll update this review if I'm pleasantly surprised. Honestly, it really bothers me how things are made not to be repaired, but to be replaced. I say go with a Cuisinart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save Your Big Oven!","review":"I have had this oven and used it for one month. It does everything the manufacturers say it does and I have no complaints. Since having this oven I haven't had to use my large stove oven. It is very user friendly. The rotisserie does pork or turkey roasts with ease and needs limited clean up. Be sure to tie up the meat to be used on the rotisserie and when cooking a whole chicken,it must be balanced on the spit. This product does it all and has plenty of space in it. It is a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"An electircal accident waiting to happen","review":"I noticed the cord was warm when I unplugged my Hamilton Beach oven after use, but ignored my instincts and continued using it. The cord began to get HOT during use, and one day I saw scorch marks on the outlet it was plugged in to. I had an electician out to make sure the outlet wasn't damaged. He said the power cord on these ovens is too small (should be a 12 or 14 guage, not 16) - that essentially they are the same as a space heater and have the same problem those do. In fact, I showed him how the glass door does not close all the way on the right side and he said that makes the oven work harder (hotter) to maintain the proper temp, putting more stress on the insuffecient cord. It doesn't help that this comes with a 2 prong plug, basically a lamp cord.This oven is an accident waiting to happen, and Hamilton Beach must know that. I guess they won't care untill they get sued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, about right for price","review":"Everything worked fine out of box. Simple to use. No presets, just a timer, a mode and a temperature button. Could use a better grill tray (hot dogs roll right off or slide through). Does not toast very well or heat evenly if on the top (no toast or similar function - just try broiling). Cooking roasts works great. Still need to test a pizza.Good for price, but we could use something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with this so far","review":"I purchased this convection oven having never used one before.

We researched several different ovens, and based on the reviews chose this one. We tried it out the first day, and noticed that when taking it out of the box the top of the oven had several small dents in it. We decided that the dents alone weren't a problem, we could live with them, but once we turned it on (following the manufacturers recommendations) the convection setting had an awful rattling noise. It was so loud it actually vibrated items on the counter sitting close to it. We cooked two meals in it and decided that the noise just couldn't be right and wasn't acceptable. We did not want to listen to that every time we cooked something. So we decided to send it back and purchased a Breville through Amazon instead. Hopefully, the next convection oven will be a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Very Well!!!","review":"This machine works really well. Was able to efficiently cook and warm a few things in it!

I use it almost everyday, it cooks pizza just like it says. I have used the rotiserrie 4 times now, got to be sure you tie the chicken well. Hard to find the string ties, but you can use the 100 percent cotton thick yarn string that you crochet with. I toast sandwiches, cooked fish, just about everything, you can sqeeze in it. Yes, it does get hot all over the outside. just dont sit anything closer than 5 or 6 inches on top or sides or back, so it will get plenty of air,and not get stuff around it too hot. Suggest buying your own 12x12 pans and glass ware, because the pans included start to warp, and wont sit flat. But you can still use them to catch grease. Overall i love it, and would buy it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Awesome Product. Works great! Easy to set the chicken as rotisserie.

UPDATE: after contacting hamilton beach in hopes of receiving new knobs, I was told to cut the cord off of the oven and return it to them with 12 dollars and they would replace it. I do not think I want to go to the trouble so no thanks. I will just buy the next one from another manufacturer UPDATE: This toaster is less than a year old and has completely bit the dust.

My little toaster has gotten 200 uses and is still ticking. Although, the door hinge is loose but I spent 20 bucks on it so I was okay with that. This thing cost 5 times more so shouldn't it last a little longer. On the 38th use the timer stopped working and on the 39th use I had to sit there and hold the on knob for 25 min.

Hang in there if you don't get the moves immediately - you'll get to know the routine after a few repeats, and it will start to feel really good. I like that Claudia isn't always as smooth or evenly-paced as Kathy. It helps me be forgiving of my own imperfections. After all, the important thing is just doing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Arm Workout","review":"I have had this video for years and I still use it because it is the best arm workout I have found to date. It is a complete upper body workout that works upper back, chest and, of course, arms. Quick, to the point workout (it's a 30 minute video) that delivers visible results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different type of video","review":"After doing this workout, I did feel a burn in my upper body muscles the next day. The video itself is very \\"artsy\\" and mod, not your typical workout video. The moves are very basic and sometimes it looked like Claudia was feeling the burn, too. On some parts, though, it looks like she's losing her form and doesn't control her movements. Overall, it was a refreshing change from typical workout videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent tape","review":"This workout is very effective. I have been doing it for about 2 months and do see results. It is not extremely difficult and wont leave you feeling very sore the next day. Remarkably I flexed one day and was firm on my entire arm! Although the muscle isn't very visible, when you flex watch out! This workout isn't to long and wont bore you. The exercises are done is sets of three so just when it starts to hurt they're over. I recomend this tape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not a easy workout!","review":"This is a great workout for the upper body. I love the way that the push ups are in between each segment. I usually have a hard time completing the last set of push ups. Anyway, the workout is much more intense whenever you use heavy weights. I used 8 lb weights when I was doing this workout a couple of years ago.

From the start, the book pounds the reader with the main character's \\"double life\\" without a trace of grace or subtilty. It reads like \\"young adult\\" fiction, except that it doesn't have any likable characters. The one interesting result of reading this book is to see how such a potentially interesting topic like bigamy can be so boring when addressed by an incompetent writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"This book sounded intriguing.

My favorite character is police Detective Scotty Grant, who tries again to frighten our heroine, Maddy Sprowls, off the case. In this installment, Maddy feels compelled to look into the murder of one of her old and dear friends, making it a heartwrenching puzzle. Making this probe even more daunting is the fact that the list of possible suspects include many of her other old friends. Maddy operates in this yarn pretty much alone, making the investigation scarier in many respects. Corwin's prose is delightful, and the observations and descriptions are often scathing and hilarious. I comment \\"Dig\\" to everyone who loves a good mystery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Farewell dear friend.","review":"Knew Jimmy in Nashville and had breakfast every morning with him for over a year at Cracker Barrel, I knew the man and he was wonderful, this is a fiting tribute to a man who was a giant and snubbed by the Opry because he didn't fit their profile, warm, friendly, generous and a true King of Bluegrass, highly recommend you have this if you love Bluegrass as I do, he was larger than life and should be remembered for who and what he was."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't understand the man's music without hearing the story and seeing some footage...","review":"Martin was definitely a talent, and an incredible character.

The guitars sound a bit washed out and are rather difficult to decipher half the time. This is on par with Hate Eternal's Counquering the Trone -- another monotonous hyper blast beat.For virtuoso metal with MUSICALITY, VARIETY, UNPREDICTABILITY, and GRIND, stick to Suffocation, Dying Fetus, Broken Hope, and Cryptopsy.

John is, quite frankly the only thing to write home about this album.Get Anomalies instead; god knows why amazon puts it alongside this over-hyped garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys, please...","review":"Try to create some memorable Death metal songs instead of cranking out nothing but incoherant psychotic ramblings accompanied by a drummer who thinks that all there is to metal is to blast out as many beats as possible per minute. What the Hell is the point in being brutal and extreme if all the songs sound similar to one another? The only thing I hear in these DM circles is how fast and brutal and technical and extreme some of these band are. Sure, that's a good motive to purchase something. Buy it because it's brutal and extreme and technical. That's a gimmick if ever I've heard one. I swear, those have become some of the biggest buzz words in Metal. Well, I'll leave you with these thoughts and go back to listening to Immolation's \\"Close to a world below\\" for my extreme metal fix. Check that band out if you want to listen some meaningful extreme metal that doesn't fall into repetition."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible joke","review":"What a waste of energy! Wow! technical! brutal! Mega wow! But can they write music?! Why don't they try and work out some formulas to cure diseases if they're so technical and great! They're rhythms are very simple - just lots of unnecessary, unmusical hits per second. There are no riffs. The sound is quite shallow. The vocals are hmmm VERY interesting. The lyrics, who cares by this stage!? They have nothing to say musically, so why fall for the lyrics? Oh did I mention its fast. Yes, fast. Buy this. It is fast. What a gimmick!!The one star?

Well I disagree with the way she made Chrissa seem. She madeher seem like a weak fragile person. Chrissa is a really storng person,she rescued those kids didn't she? She also made Thad seem like a country boy he wasn't that country. Yes I do reccomend this book to people who like action-packed adventures.

Instead I got about 33 pages of biographical text and 100+ pages of poor quality grainy black and white photos.

Instead, this book seemed to be an essay written on the problems of racial injustice and ignorance in Atlanta, America, and the world. Nothing wrong with that, but then I take into account that the essay was written in a most meandering and disjointed fashion, full of incomprehensible references, with an overwhelming tone of arrogance. Baldwin is right, everyone else is wrong and to blame. Not persuasive, just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed with this - partially my fault as I didn't realise it was an essay.Had no idea who the author was.basically vitriolic politics - but a necessary work for anyone research the Atlanta Youth murders.Not wanting to appear racist but I was offended but a variety of comments.Being white and English is obviously not a good thing in Baldwin's eyes.But everyone is entitled to an opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not worth it.","review":"This product sounded so good, but boy does it lack. Of the three DVD's that all claim to be 50 minutes, one is 38 minutes with a lot of filler, and another is 42 minutes with some filler. Although some of the costumes and scenery are nice, the quality of the filming is poor. This all could have been done with less filler on one DVD and it would have been more enjoyable. As it is, when they tried to stretch each topic to try to fill up close to half a DVD, the lack of organization and the excess filler made this set a really big waste of money. The studio needs to edit out the filler and release it again on one DVD for less than half the price to even come close to making this worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.

Like many others in fandom, I eagerly read both books.Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed by this book. Page after page, I shook my head in disagreement and wrinkled my brow in perplexity of the how-did-she-reach-*that*-conclusion variety. It simply did not represent my perspective of or participation in fandom, then or now.I've read the book more than once since its publication, seeking to see if my view on it has changed, and it never has.(On a related note, \\"Textual Poachers\\" has always engendered the opposite response in me.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good except for the finish","review":"The weight and feel of this is great.

That said, terrific product, results in her shooting more accurately and no complaints except as noted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Laser","review":"Very accurate laser.

However, the Cliff's notes version has three sample tests and discusses each section of the test in-depth. It leaves the reader well prepared for the test and for half the price of most of the other books. In addition, since actual sample tests are available from LSAT.ORG, there is simply no reason to buy another book and pay more money. The only downside is that the book is very small so it's relatively hard to write on the sample tests as the book suggests.

The acting seems decent enough,but the look of the thing, the lack of finesse in the soundtrack, and the failure tosuccessfully capture seemingly strong performances is surely the fault of an inept director.I don't sympathize with the characters and some of the actors come off as over the top and unbelievable in theirperformances. Some of them seem to be acting in a play while others, like the amazing Keir Dullea,are acting exquisitely for the camera. Unfortunately, most the time, the camera isn't capturing that work.I'm no expert on screenplays, but there seem to be some holes there, too.There are two related story lines going on at once, but only one of them crosses the finish line.There's a good reason you haven't heard of this film before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too tight","review":"I normally love Naturalizer shoes, but these were so uncomfortable that they actually physically hurt to wear.

Just the light portion is approximately 3 inches long, not including the keyring part, which has this odd (hard to describe)swiveling action that is awkward and seems like it would break easily. It does not just hang and swing freely...it is beyond me why they would design it this way.As for function, you turn it on and off by twisting the base...but if you twist it a little too far, the battery compartment pops open, all 4 fall out, and the light falls to the ground! (At which point I guess you'd need ANOTHER light to find all the little bits?)VERY poor quality, badly designed item...and if that wasn't enough, it arrived broken! Since it is transparent, it appears as though the batteries corroded inside the item. So I cannot testify as to how well it lights up, but with so many other issues, it wouldn't matter how well it worked...it's a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Santo American Style","review":"Afficionados of lucha libre cinema will enjoy this rare example of El Santo dubbed into english and americanized as Samson.

Well, that's exactly what you get with this Matlock DVD set, with the only difference being that you pay 30 times more for it!

I think it is also encourage anyone who is interested or curious about the Cathoilc faith to take a preview of the video. The video decribes how an ordination happens at Saint Peters, what actually goes on during an ordination. The video also decribed a Blessed and is story and how one day, he could become a Saint by the Pope. Finally, once a Pope dies, a new Pope must be elected, the video will cover that as well. The pictures of the Vatican are just awesome. I've been to Rome before, and these pictures just bring back memories. Also, I forgot to mention, the Swiss Guards. The video goes into how one becomes a guard for the Pope and there uniform. You must buy it or at least rent it if you can. The Pope is seen in several frames thoughout the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun program","review":"This was a nice film. It was reverent and respectful without being overtly religious.

I came to it not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos. In other words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from the Globe Trekker series.With that in mind, the target audience for this video is not me. It is the religious Catholic. Therefore, from my perspective, I can't recommend it. I'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion. I don't enjoy worshipping the \\"Holy Father\\", or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the Swiss Guard.If you are a devout Catholic you will probably enjoy this video. If you are not, and just came to the video because you wanted a Globe Trekker style tour of the Vatican, you are likely to be disappointed.And that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grabs you and doesn,t let go until the story is finished.","review":"R.L Stine is a wonderful auther and this book proves it.

Rather than continue to buy Nora \\"gag me\\" Roberts, I searched for more along the paranormal line and came across Lyndsey Sands, Katie MacAlister, Kelley Armstrong and others. This being my first foray into Katie MacAlister's humor, I was in stiches. The \\"fake\\" vampires and the homage to Feehan (even though I've never read her I've read enough reviews to know a homage when I see one). I had to put the book down everytime Joy mentioned her \\"cheerleaders.\\" It was a nice, quick and entertaining read for those interested in the paranormal side of \\"romance.\\" I'm getting into \\"Sex and the Single Vampire\\" and now I'm eager for \\"Even Vampires Get the Blues.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"I am relieved that I did not let the silly title dissuade me from reading this book.

This particular book was well written with an interesting plot. She did set up the next book quite nicely. I was just a little disappointed that there were two guys who you were rooting for...one was bound to loose, and although he has his own book, it was still a little disappointing at the way she created a love triangle. Overall, although it isn't my favorite of her books, it is still a great one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing characters....","review":"this is the second book by this author that I've tried (Noble Destiny was the other), and sadly I do not see what all the fuss is about. I noticed that in both books the heroine's behaviour and dialog, in particular, are very immature.Maybe I'm just too old for this writer's style (I'm 36), but like another reviewer indelicately wrote, the heroine in this book is annoying and ditzy to the point of headache inducing. I also find the idea of a \\"airhead\\" heroine and a dark, brooding, intelligent hero hooking up highly implausible.I was hoping for a fun, funny book-but in a intelligent way. I find many of these \\"comic\\" romances tend towards vapid, seemingly brain dead heroines-not my thing-I'd rather watch an Anna Nicole Smith show if I want that:)For a funny and sexy vampire series-may I recommend the Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris instead.1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing","review":"In all my years of reading I don't think I've ever disliked a heroine as much as this one. 'Joyful' (teehee) is one of the stupidest women I've ever seen in print. Her friend Roxy gets the prize for most annoying. I haven't the least respect for Raphael given all the crap that Joyful heaps on him while he begs for more while gazing at her with pure lust. I don't think I laughed once - there's nothing funny in people who are portrayed as stupid, sick and messed up at these are. And what, pray tell, does the title have to do with the book? If the editors hadn't put the \\"tips\\" on the back cover there would have been nothing that related at all. It's a catchy title and cover that has no relationship to what's going on inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous, Infantile and just plain boring.","review":"I gave this book one star only because there wasn't any zero. Between the bickering and stupid dialoge between the characters you still had to put up with all the Clich�� (so many) on each page. If you excluded the sex this book could have been written for a 13 year old. If I could ask for my money back for such a bad book I would but since my friend gave it to me - maybe I should ask for hers back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written","review":"This is the first book I have read by Katie Macalister, and I was NOT impressed. Recently, I've been reading books in the vampire/fantasy/romance genre, and I enjoy the witty ones. This is a badly written book. The character Joy, apparently, loses most of her intelligence when she crosses the Atlantic, and becomes almost an entirely different character. I can see where the author was trying to go with her humor, but the execution was poor. If you've been reading books like \\"Undead and Unwed\\", I think you will be disappointed.ALSO, as another reviewer remarked, the title has nothing to do with the plot of the book.I might give Katie Macalister another try. Maybe this book is an exception. Several reviewers think highly of her books, but I would borrow the book. I'm not wasting any more money on this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!!!","review":"Katie Macalister does it again. This is a warm, witty, laugh aloud book. The heroine is great (not annoying as one poor spirited reviewer so rudely commented) and is a good match to her hero. Katie Macalister's heroines are thoughtful and realistic, not wimpy doormats that spend the book wringing their hands and waiting for the hero to tell them what to do or what to think. The secondary characters are full blooded and keep your interest. This is a very entertaining book and a definite keeper!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Thankfully I checked this book out of the library. Since I hadn't been impressed by \\"Noble Intentions\\", I didn't want to take a chance buying this one. I can read about anything, but this was such drivel I just skimmed over the book. From what I read, the writing was poor, the characters annoying, and the \\"love scenes\\" insipid. I won't waste my time with another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Into It","review":"Could not capture my interest. Starts out with Joy and her friends performing some ritual to find their soul mates. Comes off as hokey and rediculous, and not really in a funny way. I couldn't take the dialogue--too much forced comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"I was actually quite disappointed in this book. I absolutely adore Katie's other writing, but have been avoiding the vampire series because I find that most vampire books I've picked up feel like they were written by a thirteen year old; but, I figured what the heck, I love Katie, maybe I'm wrong. I wasn't. The main character wasn't relateable at all, the hero was very bland, they fell in love far too quickly to be believable and I could see the supposed \\"plot twists\\" coming MILES away. I just wasn't impressed. I guess I'll go back to sticking with her contemporary and historical novels and leave the vampire and dragon books for the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires? They don't exist.","review":"I loved Katie's dragon series so I decided I'll try this and see how she does with vampires. I loved the title thinking that maybe it might be about a vampire falling in love with a human. Boy, was I wrong. It was about two girls going to some place in europe and consulted their friend who was a witch to see if they would meet their perfect match. It started off real good with a little emotion here and there. I was bugged by the fact that was the main hero a vampire or not? As it said 'A girl's guide to vampires' I assumed he was. No, it turns out the guy she didn't love was a vampire or so called 'dark one'. The main character fell in love with a normal guy. This was a very disappointing book to me. The main character was a little annoying but she didn't bother me while her friend did. If you like contemporay romance with a little supernatural twists then this is for you. Romantic paranormal fans will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was light vampire fluff. The female lead was annoying and whiny. I barely was able to get through this book. And I was surprised I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe anyone likes this book.","review":"The story would be fine if it were written by someone else. The author seems to randomly pick conflicting adjectives and gives no reason anyone should care anything for the characters. None of the relationships make any sense and there is no explanation why the characters care for each other or why they are where they are or what they are doing there. The heroine repeatedly insults her cohorts by calling them \\"boob\\" & \\"poop\\". This illustrates the quick- witted nature of this author. I hope she didn't quit her day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"This book is really terrible. The main character is a moron and there are no characters that are even remotely likable. The plot is predictable. There is little to no humor.

Yuck don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katie Macalister is a wonderful writer!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely love all of her books but this one was wonderful. Soooooo funny!!!The heroin is hilarious and she stands up for herself.

Katie does a perfect mix of both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Who are these stupid women and why do we care? The two main female leads in this story are insipid, stuoid and very very annoying. The men in the book, should have run a mile. Otherwise (if you can stop your teeth from grinding) it is a passable vampire (Sort of) romance. The men are right, the author needs to get the women correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible compared to other books","review":"I read the first Black Daggar Brotherhood book by JR Ward before I read this book. I thought that it would be similar (not exactly the same but I had hoped it would still be fun and interesting enough to hold my attention). Boy was I wrong. I hated this book. I mean HATED. I had to force myself to read this book simply because I don't like starting a book and not finish it. Sure, my reading BDB before this book may have swayed my opinion but I simply could not stand it. It was boring, lacked any sort of interesting plot or characters. I thought it was a cheap rip off of so many other great vampire series. Don't buy this book. It's not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forcing Myself To Read","review":"I can't believe how incredibly long it has taken me to read this book. I love vampires, and I usually read 100 pages a day, so I should have finished this book in 3 days, 2 if it was really good. The main characters are a bit annoying, especially Roxy. I like sarcasm and wit, but there was overload, sometimes Joy was borderline obnoxious. I pushed myself to read it because I thought that it was going to be so good..I bought the other books in the series. I pray that they are better than this..the first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"This book tries too hard to amuse. Annoying, trite, predictable. Lame dialogue, poor plot development, some potentially interesting angles that never went anywhere. I will generally read anything, but I literally threw this book in the recycle bin rather than pass it on to a friend. I chose to read the Skymall catalog instead on my flight- it was that bad.

It sounded fun, but it was fun like BEING the bouncehouse for a pack of toddlers is fun- NOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, terrible, bad, etc.","review":"A thirteen year old could have written this book--dialogue was juvenile, humor was flat, and the idea was unimaginative.

Actually, the author should be sorry....really sorry for writing this mess. I really love this author too but I can not \\"fake it\\". I did not care one iota about Joy, who by the way was not interesting or amusing. Just not worth my vision time to read about. The only character that I did like was Christian, he was interesting and sounds very sexy. As for Roxy I am surprised that Joy didn't ring her next on about 5 different occations. She pushed me over my tolerance level. I couldn't take it any more...I just skimmed to the ending with relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's Fooling Who?","review":"An interesting tale spun by life's reality.

My gripe (and it is a BIG one) is the fact that these episodes were edited from the originals. Don't believe me? Look on the back of the case in the little rectangular box at the bottom and it says so right there. Had I known this, I would never have ordered it, as much as I love this show. What the idiots at CBS Video apparently don't understand is that the whole point of buying complete seasons is that so we can see the complete episodes as they were intended to be seen, not some hacked up versions by some no-talent hack who has nothing to do with the show in the first place. I feel like they should redo this season on dvd and give everybody who bought these hacked up versions a copy for free.

You never see anything close to this on television anymore and its a shame too because not everything is a superficial reality show with backstabbers smiling to your face like at some church function. Shows like Cheers really gave that Survivor, American Idol element (i.e. Gary's Olde Town Tavern crowd) a pie in the face and we need more of that manliness and machismo back rather than \\"real\\" foppish pretty boys, \\"hardcore\\" poseurs acting cute to get what they think is some easy action with married or taken women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Nerd Glasses","review":"I'll be using these in my \\"Louis Tully\\" costume ensemble.

Amusing plot with enough mystery and angst to keep it from being the lightest fluff. I don't like the supernatural usually, but the lost kid wasn't offensive.

But it's really a book about his wife, Mathye Caboto, through the medium of her fictional diaries and letters.

People still want things they can't have (a perfect marriage, a perfect job, lost youth, etc.); that is the essence of the human condition. The reason that the Buddha and his followers subsisted on begging was that it was that absolute renunciation and poverty were considered essential components of monastic living in South Asia at the time; otherwise no one would have taken him or his message seriously (don't be such a cultural imperialist)...you would have been better served by starting out with the book \\"Buddhism, Plain and Simple\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strange little book.","review":"The author offers her attempt to reconstruct the life and personality of a teacher who did not wish to have his personality commemorated, and for whom there are no verifiable biographical data in the modern sense.

The cord is long enough to be useful without extension. The articulated upright and separate 'wings' adjust to place much, full-spectrum light where you want it. The white plastic coloring is bright and neither yellowed nor dull. The base is sturdy. The docking area is large enough for an old, large MP3 player or maybe even a Motorola flip phone.

It's a touch switch: touch on, touch off; roll on, roll off.The only minor problems are the range of motion of the upright and wings could be a little more, and, the recharging receptacle could be a little more customizable and stabilizing.

Allyson's style, which balances always on the edge of pop without ever falling over, merges with the rather stern aestheticism of Coltrane to give this album the peculiar tension which makes it an unqualified success. James Carter, Bob Berg and Steve Wilson offer invaluable support, although to call Carter's flamboyant scene-stealing \\"support\\" may be something of an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NEW CLASSIC","review":"What a concept!

I don't understand what the hype is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the changes","review":"I am a big fan of the Coltrane album and if you area going to pay tribute, you'd better have a good take on things. McCoy Tyner stayed somewhat close to the actual chords. Just listening to a few of the preview cuts, I was turned off by the piano player's avant gard approach. It didn't maatter how Karrin interpreted the songs, they were already ruined by all those seconds/ninths/13ths etc. in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have always liked Karrin Allyson. Though she has a small voice, she uses it to good advantage. My problem with this album is that while she sings these ballads very well and gives them there just do, her effort and the mood she attempts to set is totally subverted by the high register horn blowing on nearly every piece which totally destroys the mood she is attempting to set. The liner notes commend the players for laying out; but what Berg et al should have done was lay off. They totally subvert Ms. Allyson's otherwise fine effort. This is thus a truly disappointing session because of its lack of balance and the inappropriate cocophony one is subjected to in listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honky saxes!","review":"Ballads, it says. Well, yes, when Karrin is singing, it is balladic, beautiful and soft. Then come the honky cacaphony of saxes. Gone is your tranquility.

Try her other CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"I must disagree with the other reviewers. This album was so horrendous that I've already thrown it away (couldn't fathom giving it to anyone, they'd think much less of my tastes if I did).

Songbird Karrin Allyson, for example, is the first jazz vocalist ever to record a CD devoted to the songs performed by master saxophonist John Coltrane on 'Ballads,' his classic 1961 album. Hers is a deliciously moody collection of still-fresh standards like 'It's Easy to Remember,' in which Allyson's slender, sunny voice is dappled with dark shadows of rue. Perfect for late-night listening, with or without a like-minded companion.\\"--Terry Teachout/TIME Magazine (June 25, 2001)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for true Coltrane fans","review":"If you really like Coltrane - if you have ever turned to John in a state of anxiety, depression or melancholy, and were soothed as if he understood your tangled soul and gently combed through it - then you will find little of interest in this peculiar tribute album. The singer and producer have made no apparent attempt to recapture either the emotional space or the lyrical innovation of Trane's approach to balladry. It is, if you will, Pat Boone to Trane's Little Richard. That said, if what you're looking for is a pleasant, quiet cd to sit along side your \\"Jazz After Midnight\\"-style compilations, this one will do just fine.

She is a true artist, pianist and singer. Why she isn't hyped up like the \\"overhyped\\" Krall and Monheit is beyond me. This woman is also a wonderful improviser she can scat with the best of them. Put her in a room with the past great ladies of jazz and she could definitely hold her own. Keep it up!! Lady!! This CD is a must have. I already have the original Coltrane ballads, (along with just about everything else he has recorded). Having a vocal interpretation of these songs long associated with him is wonderful and an idea long overdue. I am glad that Karrin, a vocalist worthy of doing this project decided to do this CD. She retained everything in the original recording and then added something new. One can't approach Coltrane unless one knows what they are doing. And Allyson definitely knew what she was doing. Also congrats to her on her Grammy nomination!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I started here","review":"This was the first Karrin Allyson album I heard. I liked this album -- her singing as well as the ensemble work -- enough to seek out more. If I had started with some of her other albums, though, I probably never would have checked this one out, and that would have been unfortunate. She sounds less forced, less self-conscious, on this album than on, say, Footprints or In Blue. She wears these songs more gracefully than on the other albums. The musicianship here is also more organic than on, particularly, Footprints, which has got to be (I hope) a low point in her catalog. Lewis Nash is one of my favorite contemporary drummers, and he turns in a typically agile yet supportive performance. The sax blowing is the hottest you'll find on any of Allyson's albums. I don't mean to damn Allyson with faint praise, but I'm glad this was the first of her albums I heard, because this is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent early Argento piece","review":"THis is one of Dario's best efforts.

His voice sounds so refined and leaves you with a 'lasting impression'! They did a marvelous job on the writing and so forth. (He wrote all his songs eh?) Everything seems finely tuned to grab your initial attention and keep it until the end of the album. {Romantic, Reminiscent, Optomistic, With Lingering Hope Blended In A Soft & Hard Sound..All In One, etc.} I would describe it as a Jeff Buckley/U2-esq feel to it, but only better!!! It's certainly worth the money to purchase this CD now. So you'll have it to listen to for years to come...Looking forward to his future albums. Like wine...it should get even more extrodinary with time! You won't be disappointed and will rave about it for sure! Would give it 10 stars * * * * * * * * * * =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The flavour content is weak....","review":"There is no staying power with this album, basically, everything seems watered down, from the uninspired vocals and lyrics, to the blase insturmentation. I don't see why everyone loves this album, its BORING! After all, they price it in the bargin bin for a reason...."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't avoid the Jeff Buckley comparisons","review":"I'm a little dissapointed in myself that I spent money on this CD. Now I must admit I am a huge Jeff Buckley fan (RIP), so I may be biased in my opinion about this record. But the fact is, Jimmy Gnecco's voice is amazing but he needs to find his own identity. It's almost like he has thinking, \\"What would Jeff do?\\", when writing the vocal lines. As far as the music, it's kinda bland, over-produced, formulaic, blah, blah, blah.Hopefully, the next effort will a little more original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bono!?!?!??!????","review":"This album stinks. If anyone really likes this and thinks its original, try picking up some U2, and you will never touch this CD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I was Jeff Buckley","review":"It seems like this guy wishes he was Jeff Buckley so bad, that he even dresses his hair like Jeff. His vocals are hours of Buckley impersonation in the mirror. Lack of originality is so common now, I think I'll pick someone to imitate, then I'll make it big, right??? Then I could be best buddies with my daddy corporation that really really really cares about me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN.. Thank god the '90s are over","review":"After listening to my sister's copy of this CD, The part of me that was still awake decided to write this review.Boring. That states it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why all the negativity?","review":"Over produced? It just sounds like a great, grandiose rock record. There are no top name producers adding their trademark electronic effects, no key changes to make a song more uplifting.It's arty without being pretentious, incredibly touching and the arrangements are spot on throughout. In short, it's the perfect antidote to the current wave of posing Detroit garage and misogynistic, angry nu metal out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album came straight from God","review":"I'll keep it short: This band is gonna change the WORLD, keep your eyes out for them. Not only are the vocals stunning, but the music is hypnotic...ingrediants that create a sound that comes around once in a lifetime. The only thing I can compare this album to is \\"Neon Ballroom\\" by Silverchair...but even that is a stretch. Its very unique, very very good. And OH MY GOD they care about their fans...I went to a show that wouldnt let me in cuz of my age, and Jimmy Gnecco (lead singer) came out after and performed 4 songs for me acoustically in the parking lot...beat that. What other abnd would do that??? This band is goin' places..."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding debut","review":"forget about buckley, forget about radiohead, forget all of the comparisons. just as jeff and tom and bono are musicians in their own right, so is jimmy gnecco. The OUR's debut Distorted Lullabies delievers a dynamic, passion filled, expressive and diverse album --- that will give enrapture you, and give you chills if you actually take the time to focus on the music. buy the album, see them play live ---and be enlightened*"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing band","review":"I recently saw Ours play at Stubb's BBQ in Austin, TX as the opener for Pete Yorn and they were incredible. Before seeing them live, I had heard only the song \\"Sometimes\\" but every song they performed was great. Jimmy's voice is beautiful, haunting, and enough to give you goosebumps. Soon after the show I bought the cd and have been listening to it practically nonstop ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"-Completely Infectious-","review":"After seeing Ours for the third time this year, I am now undoubtedly aware that they are the best band to come on to the music scene in a very, very long time. I will not make comparison to other artists, or make and judgements. I will say that every song on the album is masterfully put together and leaves you like a drug. Jimmy Gnecco is amazingly approachable and genuine in person. I had the fortunate opportunity to hear him play an acoustic version of Meet Me In The Tower with three other people in Austin, TX. and his voice was even better in real life than it is on the CD. I sat there and cried. I have never in my life been more moved. Honestly.Thanks to all of them for making this beautiful album.'\\"We have to love these people\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! Melodic! Bono+VAST+Manson=OURS","review":"VAST was the last group that blew me away until this CD came out! Singer/guitarist Jimmy Gnecco is definitely a follower of U2! Many a times in this CD you would swear it's Bono singing! This CD flows beautifully! It is melodic, wonderfully produced by highwayman Steve Lillywhite (U2, XTC, Urban Verbs). Lyrically, it's personal and agonizing! He empties his heart out! Dreamworks is behind this so that's good news! Though the CD shows few pics, you can see where anyone can think of Manson when looking at Gnecco! Give this a chance! It is superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fantastic","review":"While I was surfing DirecTV the other day I happened upon MTV2 and I'm so very thankful I did.They happened to be playing the video for Sometimes. Immediately I was struck by how much Jimmy Gnecco's vocals reminded me of Jeff Buckley. I felt a great loss when Jeff died, and still do to this day. I was sure to never hear another singer that would approach his power and style. I was wrong. Mind you, I'm not elevating Gnecco to the level of Buckley. No one will ever reach that plateau in my mind. I'm only trying to convey the feel of the vocals.I've only listened to the album a total of 2 times and I'm already beyond impressed. I can feel it sucking me in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite There","review":"Where does one start when writing a review of music that has so much promise but leaves the listener disappointed? Amazon predicted I would love this release. I was sure I would too. The first release from this title \\"Sometimes\\" caught my undivided attention. The rest is all downhill. This review is simply my opinion. I certainly can understand the appeal of Ours as a band. To me Ours is a poorman's Radiohead. I know this will make people cringe but I feel they haven't done enough to create their own interpretation of the electronic sound. They ride the coattails of Radiohead with a sprinkling of U2 thrown in for good measure. It is entirely possible my mind my change as this CD matures. But for now it remains a weak attempt to join the solid genre of psychedelic electronica. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good CD","review":"Ours is an extremely talented band and Jimmy Gnecco is a very skilled singer. People should appreciate him for that instead of endlessly comparing him to Jeff Buckley and giving bad reviews because he's \\"imitating\\" him. His voice sounds similar to Jeff's but isn't that a good thing? What's he supposed to do? Not use his gifted voice to share with us, or try to make it sound different from what it really is just because its skill level and stunning sound are comparable to another great singer? I completely agree with the \\"amatuer faux-rock crit\\" review and the one below it by ranstermonster. Besides the beautiful vocals, other amazing elements of this cd would include the lyrics and the pure emotion put into this creation. This is one of the best cd's of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Debut Cd from a band with a bright future ahead of the","review":"One of my friends told me to download \\"Sometimes\\". So i did, and like, the first 10 seconds i heard of it I wanted to buy the CD already. So I did, and it is absolutely brilliant. I enjoy every song on it, but my favorites are \\"Sometimes\\", \\"Fallen Souls\\", \\"Drowning\\", and \\"Dancing Alone.\\" But like I said, there are no weak songs. This guy can really sing. big range of notes and powerful, beautiful singing. I've never heard anything like this, really. I hope this band has a bright future ahead of them and keeps making Cd's this great. Buy this CD as soon as possible. If you like this, I suggest you also check out Muse, Travis, and Radiohead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Bought this because it came up under a search for Cote de Pablo. Once I got it, I realized the mistake - but figured it wasn't worth the hassel to return it. So I listened to this pathetic drivel for an hour hoping there was one good song. Sort of reminds me of the last political election . . . . . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a lullaby...","review":"I have enjoyed this CD for quite a while. I enjoy the whole album which is a rare occurrence...even more these days. The whole CD tells a tail and it would make a sweet soundtrack to some movies IMO (In My Opinion-like Vampire hunter D or Countdown vampires PlayStation 1). The songs go from depressed to all sunshine and so forth but I really enjoy the CD!!!-Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super-awesome!!","review":"Oh man. I bought this CD almost 4 years ago and I still love it. All JB and radiohead comparisons aside, this band is fabulous. It has that dark swirliness in it's music that you so very rarely find...it's like Mazzy Star meets Radiohead with mood disorder. Its definitely a gothic sort of act, but it's one with serious musical talent. Honestly..one of the most emotional CDs I have ever heard in my life...it's erotic, it's sad, it;s elated and it's wonderful sleeping music...it's everything all at once, totally dependent on the mood of the listener. Check out Tracks 1, 4 and 10 (my personal favorites). You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can we get another album?","review":"I enjoy this one a lot and and came out with this strong album. Starts nicely with a native beat, a low tone singer and a higher tone singer which is pretty much similar to Bono.I find he has a lot in commun with Muse's album Origin of symmetry on many points (Darkshine = Drowning) or (Feeling good = Miseryhead) who cares it's striptease time ... both albums out the same year at one month from each other.Medication makes me think of Underneath from The verve pipe. I always loved that song. Both albums out the same year again.He even sound like Pineapple thief on meet me in the tower.My personal favorite is Sometimes and I'm a monster"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an Ours cd","review":"Really good cd. I'm anxious for their next cd to come out. this was just some really great songwriting and then creepy vocals to back it up. Everyone should own this cd. Everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've Heard In 5 Years","review":"Ours is the best band I've heard since the Verve Pipe. When I first heard them play live with Powderfinger I was in awe. I turned to my friend after they played Fallen Souls and said to him this band is awesome. I bought the CD and the rest is history. The CD's incredible, it's as simple as that. Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome voice, but not quite there yet...","review":"First time i saw the video for \\"Sometimes\\", i thought to myself, \\"OH MY GOSH! ITS FRIGGIN' JEFF BUCKLEY!!!!\\" so i wrote down the band name and went to the store to get it. \\"Sometimes\\", the lead single, is quite catchy, and is a good song overall. I was reluctant to buy the cd after i saw the track listings, like \\"Drowning\\", \\"Bleed\\", \\"Medication\\", etc. i cant say how many times stupid alternative bands have named their songs this. they are a bit of an average rock band- but there is something there that makes them stand out-just like tool- the lead singer's voice. He has a wonderful voice and knows how to use it. he needs to be a solo artist and ditch the band. The rest of the songs dont really stand out- average at best. The lead singer's voice holds it all together. Yet i'm gonna give them a break, its only their first album. Who knows what this band is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop kidding yourselves...","review":"Look, Gnecco's voice is extraordinary--there's little doubt about that. But there isn't one decent song or original turn on this whole album. It's all forgettable overproduced noise, and its edge is completely dulled by its own indulgent and corporatized marketing 'package.' I kinda wish they just cranked out a low budget live thing instead of this Dreamworks-2-years-in-overdevelopement monstrosity.I saw this guy play in a coffeeshop in northern New Jersey--just him and a guitar--and he was pretty damn impressive. He should hire/collaborate with a guy who can write and produce a decent song and become very, very, famous.This album could and should have been a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"They didn't love you in our time.........","review":"Great melodies, great lyrics, great musical composition. I love this CD from begining to end. You can hear a lot of influence from everything from Jeff Buckley to Concrete Blonde to U2 to even Radiohead. But Ours is much darker than these 4...this album is a definte sign that intelligent goth-rock is here and will persavere.The song \\"Bleed\\" comes on near the end of the album and catches you off guard, it's too beautifully dark to explain in words.Their new album \\"Precious\\" is to be even more amazing, their first single \\"Leaves\\" is so intense and beautiful.If you dig the 4 artists listed above, but have a penchant for something darker and more intense, listen to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, excuse my \\"Bad English\\" but Ours put great feelings...","review":"...into rock music. Yes there're some parallels to other great musicians like Muse, Radiohead, U2 and The Tea Party , but this band is brilliant in creating beautiful melancholic songs, that I haven't heard before..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Absolutely Addicted to this Album","review":"I'd never seen or heard of Ours until they opened up On The Bricks in Atlanta, but the second they stepped on stage and Jimmy opened his mouth I was addicted. I feel a bit guilty because the first thing that drew me to them was the voice that reminded me so much of Jeff Buckley's ((I feel guilty simply for being the millionth person to make that comparison)). I bought Distorted Lullabies right there at the concert and it really hasn't left my CD player since! It's definitely one of the best albums I've discovered this entire year, I can't even choose a favorite song off of it! And my initial attraction to Jimmy's voice remains. Ours are very unique and there's no one to compare their music to because there's nothing else like it, they're wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"For $4 it's not bad, but within two weeks the black paint started coming off to reveal the white plastic, looks horrible, but if you don't care how the case looks then this is the case for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"This thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you don't ever open your phone this is the case cover for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Snaps on easy but snaps off easy too.

If you are looking for a book to show you PRACTICAL knife fighting, read this book. As a student and instructor in the martial arts for 15 years it is good to see an instructor with the same views of practical applications for the street that I have. It is a win at all cost world and this book gives you the information to help you survive. A very straight foreward approach to knife fighting. If you are interested in this book you should also check out Tao of Jeet Kune Do by Bruce Lee. It's not a knife fighting book, but it covers all aspects of fighting. There are similarities in views of practicality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not very useful","review":"This book is interesting, but in general, very poorly written. The author comes across as an overblown windbag (not an uncommon occurrence for this type of book). The techniques described are reasonable, if not earth-shattering. Anyone interested in more than an academic understanding of knife-fighting would be well served to put the book down and start training.The most annoying thing about this book was the very poor quality of the writing and the editing. There are literally hundreds of instances of factually incorrect statements, grammatical errors, and misspellings. It was very difficult to take the author seriously when so many blatant errors made it into the book.Not a book I'd recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play Nice","review":"To be honest, this book wasn't all that great. The author spent more time explaining how his \\"dynamic\\" method was better than everyone else's instead of actually teaching the art of blade wielding & fighting. There was even space for a comic strip of some fat, cross eyed martial arts master rejecting a sparring session with the author out of fear. Now Mr. Ryan, play nice or I'll put you in the garage-sale bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Useful","review":"I found this book to be a waste of time. It covers very little of the skills or techniques that I was hoping to find. There are too many, too small chapters. The author provides an introduction to numerous schools and theories of knife fighting, but goes no more than skin deep into any of them. Much space is wasted on the history of these different schools, and yet--despite all the pages used--the information is no more than what you could gather by spending a couple of hours reading about knife fighting on Wikipedia. I'm still searching for the book that will fill my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna Be Master","review":"Lot's of braggin, lot's of superhuman concepts.

Too much time of this 30 minute video is spent in weak fantasy story plots - horses running around in a field and shots of a lady's face as she admires the car & its driver. A few minutes are spent showing the guy tearing up a country road, but no track footage is presented. One semi-interesting interview w/ Pininfarina is shown, but the questions are soft and the answers are obvious. There is no factory footage showing construction, which would have been interesting. The sound is the most disappointing feature - the V12 music is the primary reason people would buy this video over a book, alas, no justice is done here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salad Bowl Defective - Poor Quality","review":"I just received the Ironwood Gourmet Extra Large Acacia Wood Salad bowl.

The cooler area for food is incredibly small and is likely to crush whatever food you put in there. The pocket is located between your back and all of the picnic stuff, so your actually squeezing your food any time you wear it.And worst of all, the straps are the worst design I have ever worn. The design of the attachment of the top of the straps to the bag is so backwards it actually hurts to carry it with any weight. And the straps are so short, only a child or small woman can easily get their arms through the openings. So any normal sized person is putting so much pressure on the food pocket that it crushes everything.I like the detachable insulated wine bag so I give it a 2 instead of a zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picnic Backpack","review":"The actual backpack was different from the photo and its description.

The writing is easy to read, in fact, very simple. The main character, Conrad Clay, is a petty, self-centered egotist who is only concerned with his own 10-year-old desires. Clay's parents have significant financial and marital problems and don't have time to deal with the selfish needs of a child who thinks the world revolves around him so Conrad attempts to lash out by building a home-made bomb to feed his need for attention. The characters of the immediate family were well-developed but the other characters including Clay's best friend Loop were not fully brought to life, only used as a vehicle for Conrad to act or react upon. The novel is, fortunately, fairly short and joins the ranks of the many disposable books available for a long wait at the airport."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Modern Coming of Age Novel","review":"I met the author of this novel, who spent much time in New York City, and writes with the passion of experience and the knowledge of life in the streets. The hero of this novel is a young white man living in a primarily black community in a shipyard town near San Francisco. He goes from foster home to foster home and attends Christian churches attended by blacks. While its about identity, its also about friendship (he befriends a blind man who draws a new color thats symbolic of the soul). It's also about tolerance, humanity and a boy's journey into manhood. It's a modern coming of age novel. It's well-written and soulful. Dickens, while not in an obvious way, directly influenced some of the characteristics- the waif who is taken in by a \\"family\\" and taught good values. The book is very modern and contains language that is very realistic and down-to-earth, like its tone.

I am a huge fan of these books and the series was excellent as it was originally written. However, starting with the book \\"Flames in the Ashes\\" the whole series goes to pot. It is as if they were written by someone else. Equipment that was never in the other books is suddenly available, the facts on how the war started change, and there's even references to Bill Clinton! Read all the \\"ashes\\" books, but stop before you get to \\"Flames\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"johnstone book #18","review":"Although this book met all the service level agreements it came much later than books from other vendors ive used through amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"I am struck by the absolute timelessness of this music. We have loved it for 30 years, and now our children all love it too. This version is beautifully played, and having the two versions on the same CD is very interesting. I prefer the total piano version. Its a great record. Greg Yates in Adelaide, Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the same","review":"Although I enjoy piano versions of music, this album was just not the same for me as the original new age concept music. Oldfield has commented in his autobiography that the insight which gave him his first two albums seems in some ways to have been lost forever, and for me there is simply nothing like the original versions of Tubular Bells and Hergest Ridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"this thing is a piece of junk you would not believe how many problems it has it will burn a hole in your pocket, its a money pit.AS soon as you replace something there will be another part to break,not to mention that minimoto went out of business and sold there left over parts to monster part.Anyway i would stay away from this nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks","review":"im 15 years old one of my cousins got this it is stupid i have a $6,000 dollar suzuki Z400 and it is set up to be raced and it goes atleast 60mph alot better"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GONE WITH THE WIND of Mexilucahero Movies","review":"Probably the best known of all the masked wrestler/superhero movies,SANTO(SAMSON)vs.THE VAMPIRE WOMEN is the GONE WITH THE WIND of the genre.It features all the cliches that make the Mexiluchahero genre such fun.A virginal heroine and a seductive villianess(actually several),wrestling action(both in and out of the squared circle),inept police(are there any other kind in these films),supernatural menace,and an athletic hero who wears a mask but doesn't have a secret identity.Great high camp fun!But would it have been too much to ask to put Santo's image on the box cover?Oh well until someone gives this movie the treatment it deserves(digitally remastered in both English and Spanish with a film commentary)this is the DVD for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"then there was one","review":"What's all the Raa raa about??? Saw 2 was much better. To me this could be a ok tv movie,but if this scares you there is a serious problem that should be looked at.Thought the acting had a lot to be disired. The whole thing was a kiddy movie. If you want some scarry stuff email me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful in a good way","review":"The acting is so bad in this movie you have to see it. A ripoff of about 300 other movies that are exactly like this.It needs to be seen just for the terrible Dennis Hopper acscent. It fades in and out through the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"As boring as reality tv","review":"A brilliant premise. Recreate reality tv in a movie. Yay!A bunch of people are kidnapped, locked up in a house, and left to their own devices. The one who is still alive at the end wins the prize money. Yes, it's like Saw 2, but without the sadistic violence. It plays out like most reality shows. The participants party, get drunk, throw up, argue, and fight. It's about as boring as reality tv too, but at least here the participants die and don't just get voted out.Dennis Hopper feels misplaced as an irish priest, but he does add some weight and depth to the film. Without him, this would not be worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"House Of What???","review":"I would like to say: I have read some very good books over the years and they were written with Plot and Ploy. This movie was low budget and it lacked meaning to me. The characters didn't have any structure at all, they were just there.I did not find this movie interesting at all I only watched it so that I could get the Soundtrack info. Now that I did like.One more thing, If I'm not mistaken, the scene with the rapper (who's Black) and the Cop (who's a policeman) gives off the impression that youngblack men are hostile to the police. why else would this twisted directorput that scene in the movie? One thing I've learned in this life, is thatthere are some very sick people in this world.... Just look at the director of this movie...Think about it!!"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-4f2fcd79"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/30.md","filePath":"quotes/30.md"}'),j={name:"quotes/30.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,G as default};
